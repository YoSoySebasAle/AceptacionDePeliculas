1
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:20,983
Oliver!

2
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:33,796
I have something for you!

3
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:17,169
Edge!

4
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,341
A present from Mr. Kane.

5
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:58,044
-Grid Police Headquarters.
-Yeah. This is Teddy Rex.

6
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,074
What's up?
I got this strange feeling.

7
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:01,381
Anything weird happen tonight?

8
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,048
Yeah, a murder
down at the carnival graveyard.

9
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:08,750
It's nothing for you
public-relation guys, Teddy.

10
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:11,195
Yeah.
They're keeping it real quiet.

11
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,993
Got it. I'm on my way.

12
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,067
Put my little rubber duckies

13
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:23,939
Three and four in the water

14
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:26,535
Mmm, yeah, a wiggle push

15
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:29,343
And a wiggle push,
they go, they're off

16
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,281
Ooh, that's cold!
Cold! Cold! Cold!

17
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:33,785
Warm. Ah, perfect.
Don’t flush, please.

18
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,230
OK, freshen up here, Teddy.

19
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:58,504
Here we go. Hmm, let's see.

20
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:00,443
No stubble as usual.

21
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,005
A little toothbrush action,
and...

22
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:10,485
Like a summer breeze.
You can forget this thing.

23
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,292
Looking good.

24
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:26,134
Well, dreamer.

25
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,507
OK, Zippy, Teddy's going out.

26
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,204
Wish me luck.

27
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:37,546
Hmm, little kissie. Oh, sweet.

28
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:40,851
Back at you.

29
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:43,651
OK, I'm off.

30
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:47,553
Oop. Almost forgot.

31
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:49,854
Cookie!

32
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,691
Macadamia. Yes!

33
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,472
Open sesame.

34
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,345
Here we go.

35
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,642
And swish!

36
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,683
I got a strong tail.

37
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,350
OK, my first case.

38
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,235
Don't cook your circuits again,
Coltrane.

39
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,402
I'm sick of always dragging you
in for repair.

40
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:41,413
Downloading
outlaw combustion vehicles.

41
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:45,212
Attention, shoppers.
In-store special at aisle nine.

42
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,981
Naughty boy clones
are half-off.

43
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,919
Seriously, Coltrane...

44
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,889
you sure your CPUs
are ready for action?

45
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:53,391
Oh, yeah.

46
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,325
At midnight tomorrow,
it's all over!

47
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,421
We're doomed!
Somebody, help me! Help!

48
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,592
Got you!

49
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,686
Gentlemen,
it's so good to see you!

50
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm from the Grid Police.

51
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:30,051
Are you collecting
for the Policeman’s Ball?

52
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:33,121
Humor! Humor!

53
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,256
Put that thing away.

54
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,199
It could go off.
Somebody could get hurt.

55
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,430
Well, then I suggest
you not move, huh?

56
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:42,399
Grid Police!

57
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:46,036
Now, gentlemen,
you've been observed.

58
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:49,240
You've been seen,
spotted, caught...

59
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,148
committing a crime,
so you're under arrest.

60
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:05,791
Well, thank you.

61
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,604
Upsadaisy!

62
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:54,710
I thought you said
you had the front.

63
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,272
I thought you said
you had the back.

64
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:59,977
-Oh, like you had the front?
-Like you had the back.

65
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:17,196
Nothing like
a welcome-back party.

66
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:23,108
These were not
engine scavengers.

67
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,805
-Body hunters?
-Probably.

68
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,815
DNA-encrypted clone.
I.D. unknown.

69
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:32,545
Serial number unknown.
Manufacturer unknown.

70
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,609
Recommend Medevac for final I.D.

71
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:37,653
It's as if he didn't exist.

72
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:39,953
But that doesn't make any sense.

73
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:42,858
Coltrane downloading.
I need Medevac.

74
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:44,828
Yeah. Headquarters. Medevac.

75
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:48,163
Yeah. I need an I.D.
on a murder victim.

76
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,930
Have Knife contact me as soon
as he's got the information.

77
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,130
Thank you.

78
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:59,407
You two call yourselves cops?
You're a circus act.

79
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:01,378
Modem Katie's performance test
to my terminal.

80
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:03,905
If the numbers check out...

81
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,007
you'll be street-legal again,
Coltrane.

82
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,752
Welcome back to the Grid, Katie.

83
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:15,022
Check your circuits, Coltrane.
If any...

84
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,291
I love when he does that. I do.

85
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:32,366
This is a precedent-setting
crime site.

86
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,003
We are
at the carnival graveyard...

87
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:37,037
where the body of a dinosaur
has just been discovered...

88
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:41,144
and from the looks of it,
the victim of foul play.

89
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:42,347
Grid Police are investigating--

90
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:43,912
-Hey, hey, move it along.
-Hey, what are you doing?

91
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,617
-This is a secured crime scene.
-Excuse me! Since when?

92
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,888
-Behind the barrier.
-Hey, Teddy, how you doing?

93
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:50,395
Hey, Sarah. What's going on?

94
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:52,829
It looks like somebody
had a sensitivity attack...

95
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:54,491
and wants to keep
this incident under wraps...

96
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:55,658
which, you know,
I don't blame 'em...

97
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,168
because if this got out...

98
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:58,499
Could be trouble, I know.

99
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:01,062
Yeah. So, what are you doing
out in the jungle tonight, huh?

100
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:03,632
Funny thing.
I was home asleep, right?

101
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:07,111
And all of a sudden,
I had this flash.

102
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,113
Deep down,
I knew something was wrong.

103
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:10,808
Wait, are you telling me
that all you dinos...

104
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:11,975
are on the same wavelength?

105
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:15,475
Well, it's kind of like
we feel for each other.

106
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,010
It's hard to explain.

107
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,820
Look at this, would you?
Dinocide.

108
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,122
This is terrible.

109
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,256
Yeah. That's a first.
Got any clues?

110
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:29,528
No suspects, no evidence,
no clues, no nothing...

111
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,433
unless you got something for me.

112
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:34,871
No. I wish.

113
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:37,932
All right, buddy. You take care.

114
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,273
You, too.

115
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:43,608
Oh, boy.

116
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:44,843
Poor guy.

117
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,146
Body bag coming through.

118
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:48,915
Coming in. Coming in. OK.

119
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,717
Yeah. Teddy Rex.

120
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:51,881
Where's Commissioner Lynch?

121
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:55,450
The commissioner is at
the New Eden fund-raiser, Teddy.

122
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:57,291
I'm on my way.

123
00:10:58,229 --> 00:11:00,698
Our Zapheads
have come through...

124
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,463
compliments of Adam.

125
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,077
Where's the body?

126
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:16,809
Uh, we lost it
when the guns jumped us.

127
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:19,817
Guns?

128
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:23,082
Mr. Edge, we shook them off.

129
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:24,953
We're lucky
we're still breathing.

130
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,083
I agree.

131
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:36,800
Mr. Edge, now, we wouldn’t want
to make Mr. Kane angry.

132
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,802
Look him in the eye...

133
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:40,702
convince the commissioner
I'm his man--dino.

134
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:42,763
That's right, dino.

135
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,605
Walk tall.

136
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:47,270
-Hey, hey, watch it, tubby!
-Sign back there. Sorry.

137
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:49,178
Can I help you a minute?

138
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:51,649
Yeah. Wash, no wax, please.

139
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:53,947
Official business.
As you were, gentlemen.

140
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,578
Can you believe that?

141
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,267
Just in, a dead dinosaur
has been found...

142
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,971
in the carnival graveyard.

143
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,741
DNA pioneer EIizar Kane...

144
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,805
announced the revival
of the now-extinct raccoon...

145
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:26,840
will begin
at midnight tomorrow...

146
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,615
using the same revolutionary
cloning techniques...

147
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:35,953
Elephants, lions, whales,
now raccoons?

148
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:38,088
Katie,
what's happening to the world?

149
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,155
I ask myself that same question
all the time.

150
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,135
What are you doing up so late?

151
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,638
Dad said I could help him out
tonight.

152
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:49,162
He should be here any minute.

153
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,972
You know,
it's about time you two meet.

154
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,445
You’re just relentless,
aren’t you?

155
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,844
Coltrane,
report to New Eden Foundation...

156
00:12:57,882 --> 00:13:00,442
Grid 2120, priority one.

157
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:02,283
Forget it. I'm off, remember?

158
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,414
Yeah. Priority one.
Your car's on the way.

159
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:06,583
All right. Thanks.

160
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,353
Do me a favor--catch up
with my little buddy...

161
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:11,294
take him up to my apartment
and give him something to eat.

162
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,788
Sure. Can you swing by
the playground tomorrow?

163
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,322
It's a surprise.

164
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,495
I'm not real good
with surprises.

165
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:20,300
Aw, Katie!

166
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:25,368
All right. I'll try.

167
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,936
-Katie...
-I'll be there if I can.

168
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,674
Tomorrow!

169
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:32,581
I'll try really hard.

170
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:34,745
OK. See you.

171
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:38,378
See you.

172
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:46,958
Why not bring back bald eagles
and then raccoons?

173
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:49,695
Kane's bringing back
all the extinct species.

174
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:53,626
Thank you.

175
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:58,907
Well, good evening.

176
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:15,584
-Rex, T. Rex.
-I'm sorry.

177
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:18,186
This is
an invitation-only affair.

178
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:22,462
Really?
How's this invitation, Frenchy?

179
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,662
Teddy! What a surprise.

180
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:27,433
You here to work the room?

181
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:30,931
I'm looking
for Commissioner Lynch.

182
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:34,275
Whoop, there he is. Nice
talking to you, Mr. Summers.

183
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:35,871
Excuse me. Pardon me.

184
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,011
God!

185
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,110
Something smells good here.

186
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:46,620
Well!

187
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:50,660
Commissioner Lynch,
sorry to barge in.

188
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:51,958
Excuse me.

189
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:54,790
Teddy?

190
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:57,733
There's been a murder
at the carnival graveyard, sir.

191
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,704
-And?
-Commissioner.

192
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:02,832
EIizar Kane, I'd like you
to meet Teddy Rex...

193
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:05,809
Assistant Press Liaison Officer
with the Grid Police Department.

194
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:07,971
But, of course,
you must know each other.

195
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:09,980
Teddy and myself go back a ways.

196
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:12,005
This is Dr. Shade,
my personal doctor.

197
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,539
-How do you do?
-Good evening.

198
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,052
Not many people get
to meet their maker...

199
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,611
at a fund-raiser, huh?

200
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:18,713
Teddy's my crowning achievement.

201
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,986
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Kane.

202
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:24,689
-Please excuse me.
-Oh, of course.

203
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:29,223
Very nice to have you here,
but tell me why you are here.

204
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:33,135
Well, it's kind
of a police matter, and...

205
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:38,132
It is now my great honor
to present EIizar Kane--

206
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,144
DNA research pioneer...

207
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:44,775
and, of course, the founder of
the New Eden ecology movement.

208
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,546
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,218
Years ago,
I re-created dinosaurs...

210
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,320
to show how science could
change the world, and I did.

211
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:01,161
My friends, the ark is ready.

212
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,794
Mankind will step aside
for our new destiny.

213
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:07,931
-My dream is...
-Sir, this was a dinocide.

214
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:10,168
-A dinocide?
-Yes.

215
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,805
Excuse me, sir.
Is something wrong?

216
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:17,816
Yes. Yes.
There's been a dinocide.

217
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,112
I beg your pardon, sir...

218
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,448
but I'd like to be assigned
to the case.

219
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,784
Teddy, you have a great future
in the department--

220
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:26,688
Sir, I'm just a publicity stunt.

221
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:29,352
-I want to be a real detective.
-Now, now, now, Teddy...

222
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:31,361
we all have our paths to follow.

223
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:34,990
I understand,
but dinos and humans are here...

224
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:37,364
to rise above our limitations--

225
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,665
you know,
make our dreams come true.

226
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:40,830
What?

227
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:43,136
Teddy, you sound like
you're running for office.

228
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,006
Please, sir,
just give me a chance.

229
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,407
At ease, Teddy. At ease.

230
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:47,912
Sir, a minute, if you would.

231
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,310
Please?

232
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:56,144
You may help yourself.

233
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:59,179
So, what do we have, Frenchy?
Meat, meat, meat, and meat.

234
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:01,715
You know,
I'm a recovering carnivore.

235
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,227
Sweets.

236
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,628
Ah! Yes! Cookies!

237
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:08,155
One per customer!

238
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,736
Toodle-oo.

239
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:18,868
Now, our tall and shiny
reptile freak over there--

240
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,503
he could be the key.

241
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:24,982
We could make him
our first dino detective.

242
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,984
What? Are you out of your mind?

243
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:30,352
Just track with me, sir.
Look, Teddy solves the dinocide.

244
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:33,358
Inter species relations are
smoothed over. Who's the hero?

245
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:36,122
-Teddy Rex.
-No! Lynch--

246
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,424
the commissioner
who had the vision...

247
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:42,558
to look beyond species
to tame our town.

248
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,931
Six of these.

249
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,794
Cheers.

250
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:52,109
Oh, Teddy...

251
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:56,841
Yes, sir?

252
00:17:58,382 --> 00:17:59,543
You have the case.

253
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:03,749
Undercover. No press. No fuss.

254
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,779
Just results
by prime time tomorrow.

255
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,923
Let me go! Put me down!

256
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:15,263
-I can't believe it!
-That big pig!

257
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,767
I won't let you down.

258
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:18,428
I got to call my mom.
I don't have a mom.

259
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:20,494
-There is one condition.
-There is?

260
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:24,372
Yes. We're teaming you up
for your own good.

261
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:27,173
-Great.
-With a veteran, a pro--

262
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,679
Colstein.

263
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:35,118
Well, well, well.

264
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:40,249
Hey! Coltrane!

265
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,520
What?

266
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,395
Yes, I do,
but that's not the point.

267
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:49,794
-Commissioner.
-Coltrane.

268
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,632
-Summers.
-Coltrane...

269
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,501
there's been a homicide,
and your name came up.

270
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,631
Am I a suspect?

271
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:59,200
Actually, it was a dinocide.
A dinosaur is dead.

272
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:01,940
Teddy Rex, meet Katie Coltrane.

273
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:05,381
You two solve this case
together.

274
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What?

275
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:09,550
Teddy's in public relations...

276
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,351
but I'm field promoting him
temporarily.

277
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:13,653
-He's a dinosaur.
-Come on, Coltrane...

278
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:16,558
he graduated from the academy
just like you did.

279
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:19,894
-He's a dinosaur!
-You're not a specist, are you?

280
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:23,296
Give me results
by prime time tomorrow...

281
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,996
and I'll double
your regular commissions.

282
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:28,734
He's a dinosaur! Come on!

283
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:30,764
Hey, Coltrane,
straighten up and fly right.

284
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:33,675
This is your chance
for a comeback. Don't blow it.

285
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:36,009
He's a dinosaur!

286
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:40,411
Look, as long as
we're partners...

287
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,318
why don't we
make the best of it, huh?

288
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:46,187
You're a dinosaur.

289
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:48,317
Yes, technically.

290
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,156
I have this dream.

291
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:54,221
I've always wanted
to be a detective.

292
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:57,067
If Oliver Rex would’ve squealed
about your master plan...

293
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:58,432
nobody would’ve believed him...

294
00:19:58,469 --> 00:19:59,937
but with the nose job
Edge gave him...

295
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,995
we don't have to worry
about that anymore, do we?

296
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,507
You little squid.

297
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,670
You're supposed to make certain
your police pals stay clear.

298
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,679
That is your job.

299
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:13,344
And for which you will
follow us into the next world.

300
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:14,510
For your information...

301
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:17,180
I have used
my own powers of persuasion...

302
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,552
to convince the commissioner
to assign...

303
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:23,789
the department's token dino
to your messy dinocide.

304
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:26,092
-Theodore Rex?
-Yes.

305
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,428
I've also teamed him up
with a burnt-out gun.

306
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:30,525
This is going to be trouble,
I can feel it.

307
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:33,731
Hey, Coltrane and Teddy Rex
will blow this case.

308
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:35,762
I guarantee it.

309
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:39,743
And we will just sail away.

310
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:42,769
Ah, my stop.

311
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:46,113
Well, midnight tomorrow.

312
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,515
Ta-ta.

313
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,819
This is from Adam.

314
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:53,153
Edge.

315
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,658
You do realize...

316
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:56,217
the missile launch
is midnight tomorrow?

317
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,490
-That's your problem.
-There's no leeway.

318
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,554
All right, don't get
your knickers in a twist.

319
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:02,999
My people are working on it.

320
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,900
Don't call Zapheads people.
They belong in cages.

321
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:09,133
Well, then clone me
some better ones.

322
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:11,267
You know how I feel
about failure.

323
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:12,901
Yes, sir.

324
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:14,672
It reeks of imperfection!

325
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,180
What do you want me to do?

326
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:17,476
Just have them followed.

327
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:21,474
I don't want anyone
to sense our concern.

328
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:25,316
Spinner...

329
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:28,587
Spinner, over here.

330
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:31,527
Psst. Hey, wake up.

331
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:34,532
Get your finger
out of your nose.

332
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:35,726
Spinner!

333
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:40,560
Yes, Mr. Edge?

334
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,232
Listen, I'm going to give
you toads a shot at redemption.

335
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:44,708
Redemp...

336
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:47,040
You, shut up!

337
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,203
Listen, I want you to keep
your beady eye...

338
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:50,111
on that gun and the rex.

339
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:51,911
Look but don’t touch.

340
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:54,919
Whatever you say, sir.

341
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:56,420
Good.

342
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,017
All aboard.

343
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:05,653
One seat. No waiting.

344
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,205
-Seat guards.
-What?

345
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:23,543
Safety first.

346
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:26,243
Safety...
Driving defensively...

347
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:31,214
Listen, I can raise your seat.

348
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:33,223
No, thanks. No, no, no!

349
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:39,154
Get me down--now!

350
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:40,960
I'll lower it.

351
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:45,327
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

352
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,736
Listen, uh, I just...

353
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:51,730
I just wanted to say
that it's a real pleasure...

354
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:54,767
working with a professional
like yourself.

355
00:22:54,812 --> 00:22:58,077
What do you have on the case?

356
00:22:58,115 --> 00:23:00,106
We got a dead dino,
which is a first.

357
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,244
No suspects, no clues,
no motives.

358
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:07,452
So we need to determine
a cause of death, right?

359
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:12,593
Where would you have
a dino autopsy?

360
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,894
Yes!
The Museum of Natural History!

361
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:16,093
Of course! We're off!

362
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:19,831
Sorry, ma'am.

363
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,599
Pharaoh or whatever you are,
sorry.

364
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:25,234
Oh, holy shoot.
Back to traffic school.

365
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:26,573
Coming, coming.
Everything's fine.

366
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,045
Just got to glue its head
back on.

367
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,548
You going to a fire?
Slow down.

368
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:33,516
No.
It's just fossils creep me out.

369
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,109
Why is that?

370
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:38,247
I can feel my ancestors,
you know?

371
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,621
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Your ancestors?

372
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,752
Yeah--staring at me,
talking to me.

373
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:44,454
Yeah, right.
What are they saying?

374
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:46,054
Well, they want me
to follow my heart...

375
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:48,326
do the right thing--the usual.

376
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:49,491
Please.

377
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,160
Well, don't you have
a guardian angel?

378
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,966
-Yeah. Me.
-Right.

379
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:57,105
-Wow!
-What now?

380
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,075
I mean, look at this!

381
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:01,908
You know,
it just makes me wonder.

382
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:06,975
I mean, these bones
have so many untold stories.

383
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:10,681
If dinos weren't extinct,
we'd be running the world...

384
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,747
and you soft-skins
would be fossils.

385
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,192
-Can it, OK?
-Whatever.

386
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:24,593
Poor little guy.

387
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:28,629
-You knew him?
-Well, yes and no.

388
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,936
What do you mean? You either
knew him, or you didn't.

389
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:33,205
Well, I've see him around, but
I didn't know him personally.

390
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,371
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

391
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:36,538
Grid Police. Who are you?

392
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,515
Dr. Armitraj,
head dinosaurologist.

393
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:42,611
He's a detective?

394
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:45,384
-For now.
-Katie!

395
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:46,821
-Let's cut to the chase.
-Be nice.

396
00:24:46,857 --> 00:24:48,450
What do you have on the victim?

397
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:50,824
He died of an explosion
close to his snout.

398
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:52,829
I really have not had
a chance to look at him.

399
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:56,197
-Oh, excuse me.
-Doctor, may I?

400
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,496
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.

401
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:58,695
May you what?

402
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:07,838
Religion.

403
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,293
There you go.

404
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:27,127
Send this to Captain Alaric
at headquarters.

405
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:30,156
See, he can reconstruct
whatever killed our friend here.

406
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,531
Then we'll have our lead.

407
00:25:31,568 --> 00:25:33,730
-What about prints?
-Ah, prints.

408
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:36,035
You see, the scale patterns
on our tails...

409
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:38,167
are all different and distinct.

410
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,905
Headquarters computer, I need
a tail print I.D., please.

411
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:44,471
Stand by for a holofax,
will you?

412
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:49,109
Oh, and I need you to do this
as quickly as you can for me.

413
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:53,351
Tail print I.D. confirmed.
T. Rex I.D.--Oliver Rex.

414
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,017
Cloned at New Eden.

415
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,926
Lives at Prehistoric Place
with Molly Rex.

416
00:25:57,961 --> 00:25:59,360
Molly Rex?

417
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:02,161
-Is that somebody you know?
-Don't I wish?

418
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:06,067
She sings at a nightclub
on Prehistoric Place.

419
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:10,266
Get down, yeah.

420
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:12,105
Get back up again.

421
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:14,873
Groovin'.

422
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:25,517
What is that smell?

423
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:27,285
Clean, unfiltered air.

424
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,418
Everything in here
is good for you.

425
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,428
-Hey, Teddy!
-Hey, Tina.

426
00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:33,590
-How are you?
-I'm fine. You?

427
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,759
I'm fine. Soft-skin, I see.

428
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,259
Her name's Katie Coltrane.
Could we get the tour, please?

429
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:44,138
Walk with me. Welcome
to the Extinct Species Club.

430
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:47,269
If a species shows up here,
it's history.

431
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:49,780
Yeah, well, you must be
running out of space.

432
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:51,872
Yeah, well, more species
are vanishing every day.

433
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:54,111
Maybe Mr. Kane
will bring these species back...

434
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,380
just like he did with dinosaurs.

435
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:58,684
You said a mouthful.
OK. Let's talk liquids here.

436
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:01,919
We've got glacier, natural,
or fizzy water--that's H2O.

437
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,586
I'll just take some tap,
thank you.

438
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:06,426
Sorry. I don't dance.

439
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:08,295
Oh, I'm kidding.
Listen, find yourself a table.

440
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:09,959
Make yourself comfy. I love you.

441
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:14,768
That thing at the table
just clacked at me.

442
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,534
That's just Grok.

443
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:20,271
He likes soft-skins.
He thinks you're kinda cute.

444
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,280
-What is this?
-Ah, now, this is great.

445
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:27,045
This is hydroponic seaweed
and krill.

446
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:29,109
No toxins, chemicals, or dyes.

447
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:31,087
-You gotta try some.
-No, thank you.

448
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,282
-Come on.
-No, no, no.

449
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:34,416
-I don't want any. Put it down.
-All right.

450
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,358
Can I ask you
a personal question?

451
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:39,328
-Sure.
-I thought you people...

452
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:41,457
you know, ate meat.

453
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:44,695
Um, I'm kind of on the wagon.

454
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:46,965
You know, it's not like
the old days, Katie...

455
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:50,804
with herds of duck-bills
roaming through the plains.

456
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:52,900
Yeah, and you guys
were eating them all.

457
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:55,139
Oh, and you humans
are such a deal, huh?

458
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:56,305
The only time you soft-skins...

459
00:27:56,346 --> 00:27:58,314
seem to pay attention
to other creatures...

460
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:00,544
is to shoot them, eat them,
or wear them.

461
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:02,552
Am I right?
Are you listening to me?

462
00:28:02,586 --> 00:28:05,453
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You just don't--

463
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:08,424
What is he doing?
I mean, it's a whole thing.

464
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,825
-We don't get out much, do we?
-No, I don't.

465
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:12,920
-Great.
-I'm just going to see...

466
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:14,192
what I can find
out in the rest of the room.

467
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:16,563
I gotta get out of his eyesight.
He's making me nervous.

468
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,726
-Fine.
-Check her out.

469
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,236
-Go freshen up.
-All right.

470
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:23,205
Oh, man.

471
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:37,611
Molly.

472
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:40,954
And now,
my reptilian relations...

473
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:44,586
clack your claws
for the bodacious cretaceous...

474
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:46,824
mesozoic mama...

475
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:49,628
Miss Molly Rex!

476
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:58,298
Come on, let me cling on,
feel like I'm dying

477
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:02,472
Make that low-down music
tickle up your spine

478
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:06,881
Baby, I could warm you
with this heart of mine

479
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:10,046
I'm no angel

480
00:29:11,121 --> 00:29:12,714
I'll take your blues

481
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:15,384
Stomp down your troubles

482
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:19,225
Rock you with a steady roll

483
00:29:19,263 --> 00:29:23,530
Use your connection
to win my affection

484
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,662
You're my little
ace in the hole

485
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:31,974
Let me hug you now
before the night is gone

486
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:35,570
Come on, flag this joint,
so we can carry on

487
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:40,914
I can make you heaven
while the shades are drawn

488
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:44,649
I'm no angel

489
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:57,157
Come on, honey, thrill me
like a midnight breeze

490
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,259
Don't care how you do it, babe

491
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:00,930
Just so you please

492
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:05,670
Take my kisses
till your weary heart's at ease

493
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:08,701
I'm no angel

494
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:11,305
I'll take your blues

495
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:13,817
And stomp down your troubles

496
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,445
Love you with heart and soul

497
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:22,516
I love her!

498
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,550
You're my little
ace in the hole

499
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:28,158
How's about it?

500
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:35,364
And you think
you're going to get somebody?

501
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:39,999
-Not tonight, baby.
-Hey, come here.

502
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:42,137
-Let's go.
-No! Police business, right?

503
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,944
-Yeah. Let's go.
-Dressing room. I'm coming.

504
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:51,687
-Flowers from a fan.
-Whoa. Thank you.

505
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:52,848
Have we met?

506
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:55,722
Well, uh, I've seen you around.

507
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,989
-We're the Grid Police.
-I knew it.

508
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:00,019
Last night, I'm dead asleep...

509
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:03,226
and all of a sudden,
I get this flash.

510
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,098
I know. Me, too.

511
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:08,435
Dinosaurs feel for each other.

512
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:12,272
Oh, yeah. They sure do.

513
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:15,939
-Excuse me.
-Certainly.

514
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:18,448
Don't bruise the taffeta.

515
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:20,109
Wide load coming through.

516
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,118
Ooh, shouldn't have said that.
Sorry.

517
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:24,849
Hey, come on.
We're looking for a killer here.

518
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:27,687
-Whoa. Killer?
-Yeah, well...

519
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:33,128
Mrs. Rex, I'm sorry to say
that your husband Oliver...

520
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:35,029
was murdered last night.

521
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:37,796
Did he have any enemies
that you knew of?

522
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:39,928
Murdered--oh, wait.

523
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,234
Wait a second--
Ollie wasn't my husband.

524
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:44,070
-He was my roommate.
-Great!

525
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,303
No, that's bad.

526
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:49,142
I mean, uh, I feel for you.

527
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:50,738
What exactly was he?

528
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:52,715
A pussycat.

529
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,149
No, no, I mean, what did he do?

530
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:57,882
He was an entertainer.

531
00:31:57,921 --> 00:31:59,582
A song and dance dino.

532
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:01,421
Worked kiddie parties
and conventions.

533
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:04,621
Did he have any hobbies?
You know, outside interests.

534
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:09,325
He worked at New Eden.
It was in his heart--

535
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:11,926
-Did you say New Eden?
-Mm-hmm.

536
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:15,063
Well, thank you, Miss Rex.
You are so beautiful.

537
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:17,164
I mean, you were so helpful.

538
00:32:17,207 --> 00:32:21,474
Say, won’t you come to Oliver's
recycling here tomorrow?

539
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:23,206
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

540
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:25,214
You said you didn't know
he was dead...

541
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,977
and suddenly now
you're having the funeral?

542
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:28,985
I find that a bit odd.

543
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:31,613
Nope. Speedy funerals
are a dino custom.

544
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:34,317
Yeah. Can you ix-nay
on the funeral-ay, please?

545
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:36,155
Yeah. Get the breath-ay
out of my face-ay.

546
00:32:36,193 --> 00:32:38,287
I'll be outside. Excuse me.

547
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:44,390
Like I said,
if you think of anything...

548
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:47,233
I will definitely
get a hold of you.

549
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,139
-Listen, just call me Teddy.
-Teddy.

550
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:53,768
I'll see you at the funeral.

551
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,438
I got to get some air.
Excuse me.

552
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,677
I really got to go.
I'll call you. See you.

553
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:18,464
-That was inexcusable.
-What? What was?

554
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:20,402
Your glandoism.

555
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:22,565
-I am not glando.
-You are glando.

556
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:25,598
Your mind has shut down,
and your glands have taken over.

557
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:28,475
Hey, I am not lovesick, OK?

558
00:33:28,512 --> 00:33:30,139
I know I haven't been
a detective long...

559
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,306
but I'm fully in control--

560
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:34,318
We have I.D. on
your murder victim from tonight.

561
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:35,512
I'll be there.

562
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,814
We'll pick up
where we left off tomorrow.

563
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:41,119
I'll see you then.

564
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:43,125
OK, I'll just gas up
and go home.

565
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,651
-Straight home.
-Right.

566
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:47,823
Look, boys,
they're splitting up...

567
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:50,526
and there goes our little witch
with the gun.

568
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:54,570
Wait a minute.

569
00:33:54,604 --> 00:33:58,734
Now, you remember
what Edge said. Just watch.

570
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:02,234
I suppose we could
tweak his tail a smidge.

571
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:08,117
The police

572
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:12,179
My first case.
Let's see what I got so far.

573
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:15,658
I have the victim's I.D.,
and his roommate is Molly Rex.

574
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:18,184
Oh, Molly Rex.

575
00:34:18,228 --> 00:34:20,128
Molly, Molly,
Molly, Molly, Molly.

576
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:21,858
Oh, I love the sound of that.

577
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:25,198
Ah, some trick-or-treaters
out for an early Halloween.

578
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:32,767
Knife.

579
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,903
Coltrane.

580
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:37,380
So, how did your rewiring go?

581
00:34:37,414 --> 00:34:40,008
-What's it to you?
-Very good.

582
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,984
They kept
your aggression level up.

583
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:44,953
I must say, the dead clone
you sent me tonight...

584
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:47,082
was quite a puzzle...

585
00:34:47,123 --> 00:34:50,787
but I finally got his I.D.
by breaking the code.

586
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:53,319
-The code?
-The genetic code.

587
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:57,425
The map of our destiny,
and we're all slaves to our DNA.

588
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:01,304
Zapheads! It's Zapheads!

589
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:04,000
Hey, what are you doing?
That's not nice.

590
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,475
Get off of there!

591
00:35:06,509 --> 00:35:08,443
This is T. Rex.
This is an emergency.

592
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:10,071
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

593
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:13,442
This is
an official police vehicle.

594
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:16,783
Code red! Code red!
Katie! Where are you?

595
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,790
Look at these cloning patterns.

596
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:22,656
Very precise, very regular...

597
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:24,126
each one bearing
the proprietary imprint...

598
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,855
of the creating corporation.

599
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:27,954
It gets better.

600
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:30,262
Look at this.

601
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,825
New Eden.

602
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:36,169
The foundation was built
on the cloning patterns.

603
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:37,970
All registered to Kane.

604
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:40,272
According to the I.D. numbers
on those molecules...

605
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,835
his name was Adam.

606
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,346
Adam.

607
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,314
Hey, I just had a new tune-up!

608
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:47,976
I mean it, you guys!
Get off of there! Mayday!

609
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:50,316
Hey! Katie!

610
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:54,915
-Katie! Katie!
-Yeah.

611
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,484
-Help me, Katie!
-See you.

612
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:02,062
Get out of here! Come on! Get!

613
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:04,362
You think you're scary.
Scary red eyes.

614
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:06,665
Come on! Don't get me mad.

615
00:36:06,703 --> 00:36:09,695
I hit the fire extinguisher,
and my whole world went white.

616
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:13,203
Katie, my door is stuck.

617
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:16,406
What is going on? Why didn't
you go home like I told you to?

618
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:18,005
I did. I was.

619
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,109
I--I ran into some Zapheads.

620
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:24,644
-Did you pull your gun?
-My--my gun?

621
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:26,622
Yeah, your gun.
Don't you have a gun?

622
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:29,591
Well, actually, I--
I don't believe in violence.

623
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:30,957
You don't believe
in violence...

624
00:36:30,994 --> 00:36:32,689
and yet you want to be
a police person?

625
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:35,562
You must lead
a charmed life, then.

626
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:39,364
Yeah. Don't I just?

627
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,601
Night on the town, huh, boys?

628
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:50,773
We have made
some very hot credits...

629
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:53,442
selling the dino's
tour car parts...

630
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,850
on the old black market.

631
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:58,752
I thought I made myself
crystal-clear.

632
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:00,256
Look, but don't touch.

633
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,587
Well, of course I warned them...

634
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:04,889
but do you think that they
would listen to me? Oh, no.

635
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:06,692
When you can't
control yourselves...

636
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,698
you make it harder for us all.

637
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:09,893
Well, it seems to--

638
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:13,392
Well, you know, I mean,
everyone has their own agenda.

639
00:37:20,744 --> 00:37:22,303
Mercy.

640
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:26,281
This is your last chance.

641
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:30,378
You keep your eye
on the rex and the gun...

642
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,252
or I'll stick you
in the blender.

643
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,862
Slick partner, Coltrane.

644
00:37:45,902 --> 00:37:47,597
Pick on a dino. That's easy.

645
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:50,504
-Beauty and the beast.
-Yeah. Who's who?

646
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:57,079
I need another
rex-friendly vehicle.

647
00:37:57,113 --> 00:37:58,774
You promise to take care of it?

648
00:37:58,815 --> 00:38:01,113
The word around here is
you're in the doghouse.

649
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:02,482
Look, you--

650
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,114
I told you about that.
Don't piss him off, OK?

651
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:08,591
OK. Actually, you're in luck.

652
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,526
I happen to have
the perfect vehicle for you.

653
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:14,428
Well, get it outside right now!

654
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:19,026
-Excuse me. I have to go.
-Let's go.

655
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:22,060
People, people, people,
what has the world come to...

656
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:25,666
when cop cars get stripped
with the cop still in them?

657
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:38,816
I don't know, Katie. Why would
those Zapheads go after me?

658
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:41,984
-Can it.
-Teddy! Coltrane!

659
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:46,462
Your tour car was bought
with taxpayers' money.

660
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:50,359
You've been on this case
for twelve hours...

661
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,960
and you've got zip
to show for it.

662
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:55,096
Teddy, look, we cut a deal.

663
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:58,233
You wanted this case, and
I wanted a boost in my polls.

664
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,572
-Yeah.
-Not more trouble!

665
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,078
I didn't want this case
to begin with.

666
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,237
What?

667
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,644
Where the hell were you
when the car was stripped?

668
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:07,412
-I was at Medevac.
-Medevac?

669
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,714
Your orders
were to stick with Teddy!

670
00:39:09,752 --> 00:39:11,049
You embarrassed the department.

671
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,213
What do you mean, I--

672
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:15,384
Sir, if anyone let
the department down, it's me.

673
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:18,588
-Yes!
-Yeah.

674
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:20,027
Yeah. Look at you.

675
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:21,792
You don't even
look like a detective.

676
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:23,321
Oh, sir, please.

677
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:28,361
You cannot judge a dino
by his scales.

678
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:30,168
What?

679
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:35,111
Never mind.

680
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:36,475
Coltrane,
you stay out of this...

681
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:39,243
or I'll transfer you
back to drug duty.

682
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:40,807
A gun and a dinosaur detective.

683
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,841
Wait till I get my hands
on Summers.

684
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:45,514
Summers?

685
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:47,819
Do me a favor.
Meet me up at supply.

686
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:50,519
-OK.
-Open your mouth.

687
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:54,694
Minty fresh.

688
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:57,856
Commissioner.

689
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,599
Commissioner.

690
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:05,737
Are you telling me
Summers set this up?

691
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:09,473
You heard me. He said
you still have the magic.

692
00:40:09,512 --> 00:40:10,707
Remember, this case
better be gift-wrapped...

693
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:13,273
by prime time tonight, or else.

694
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,517
-Coltrane.
-Sir.

695
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,784
Any I.D. on that murder victim
from last night?

696
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:24,316
Yes. It turns out he's
a clone registered to New Eden.

697
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,761
Interesting. I'm working
on those weapon fragments...

698
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:28,286
they sent me from the museum.

699
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:29,765
Nice bit of sleuthing, Coltrane.

700
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:31,733
Thank you, sir.

701
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:35,136
-Hey, Ella.
-Hey, Teddy.

702
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,661
What happened to you?

703
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:39,607
Oh, don't ask.
Hey, I'm here for a new look.

704
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:41,303
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

705
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:43,574
I'm on my first case.
How about that?

706
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:45,945
-That's wonderful. Good luck.
-Thank you, thank you.

707
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:48,383
-Undercover dinosaur, huh?
-Yeah, right. That's right.

708
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:50,182
Look, I've got to blend in, OK?

709
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,621
-Oh. Go to the zoo.
-Ella!

710
00:40:53,656 --> 00:40:55,488
Step right up. Go ahead.

711
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:56,856
All right. Here I go.

712
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:04,298
Turn around

713
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:07,998
-Ready?
-OK, Ella. Dress me up.

714
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:11,598
Now, make me look nice, OK?
I got this very picky partner.

715
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:14,303
Besides being loud, obnoxious,
and very pushy...

716
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:15,812
she's a joy to work with.

717
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:22,714
Oh, that's no good.

718
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:25,551
Kill all the wabbits

719
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:28,353
Ella, this is not undercover.
Push the button!

720
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:33,327
Ella, undercover.
Porfavor. Please!

721
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:37,531
Not bad.

722
00:41:42,105 --> 00:41:44,199
Undercover now!

723
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:50,971
He's a cop. You got to
make him look like a real cop.

724
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:52,675
Ella.

725
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:55,013
I'm getting a wee bit of
breeze in my lowlands, lassie.

726
00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:56,541
Work with me, will you?

727
00:41:56,586 --> 00:41:58,520
All right.

728
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,919
I think this will do fine.

729
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:09,891
Yeah. You look good.
You look like a real cop.

730
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:12,401
I'm too sexy for my clothes.

731
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:16,503
Where are we going?

732
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:19,008
-Whoa. Slow down a minute.
-What?

733
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,409
-New Eden?
-Yeah. What's the matter?

734
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:23,105
It's just that Dr. Kane...

735
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:25,843
you know, he's my creator
and a father figure--

736
00:42:25,882 --> 00:42:27,714
-Come on, Teddy.
-What?

737
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,149
You sound like
we're going to arrest the guy.

738
00:42:29,185 --> 00:42:30,550
We're just going to ask him
questions.

739
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:32,611
That's what we do.
We're police officers.

740
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,054
If you want to play
with the big guys...

741
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,854
you got to behave
like a big guy.

742
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:37,656
-New wheels, Coltrane.
-Thank you.

743
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:39,092
-You ready?
-Yeah.

744
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:40,755
-That's our new van.
-What?

745
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:43,823
Hey, kind of cute.
And it's leaving.

746
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:46,858
Why is it leaving? Hello?

747
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:49,065
Guess we're hoofing it.

748
00:42:49,105 --> 00:42:50,834
I, uh...what?

749
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:53,205
That guy at the desk--
look at that thing!

750
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:55,939
Calm down. Calm down.
Breathe. Breathe.

751
00:42:55,978 --> 00:42:59,175
Zen. Zen.

752
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:01,616
Now let's go.

753
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:03,779
-How am I going to get in?
-Through the back.

754
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,447
Get in the back.

755
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:07,047
In the back
of the garbage truck?

756
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,025
Oh, fine. I'll sit in the back
of the garbage truck...

757
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:13,723
where it smells like cheese
and fish and boogers.

758
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:15,925
Oh, it stinks in here.

759
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:18,366
Ohh. I get my first case
and here I am...

760
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:21,632
in the back of a garbage truck
with the goosh and the mush.

761
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:22,968
Are you driving or what?

762
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:24,905
No. I'm waiting for you
to sit down.

763
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:27,376
I can't sit down, because
if I sit down, I'll get gushy...

764
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,741
and I'm not going
to get gushy...

765
00:43:28,778 --> 00:43:29,904
because I just got
my new clothes.

766
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:31,175
OK, sorry, you're right.

767
00:43:31,214 --> 00:43:32,340
You know how
to drive this thing?

768
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:34,110
-Shut up. Shut up!
-Well, then close the door.

769
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,778
Hey, you don't mind
if we make a stop, do you?

770
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,811
Ooh! Fine.
I'll just be in the back.

771
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:41,654
What am I stepping in?

772
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:43,250
Ugh! Guano!

773
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,919
Are you sure you can drive?

774
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:47,430
Whoa! Don't hit the cadets!
Don't hit the cadets!

775
00:43:48,664 --> 00:43:51,156
I'll get you back for this.

776
00:43:56,038 --> 00:43:57,767
My snout!

777
00:44:03,546 --> 00:44:05,913
Pass it to Joey. Joey's open.

778
00:44:05,948 --> 00:44:08,383
Pass it to Joey!

779
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,545
Cool! A dinosaur.

780
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,782
Hey, kids, what's going on?

781
00:44:12,822 --> 00:44:14,517
-What's your name?
-What's up?

782
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:17,219
-How you doing?
-Hey, look at the dinosaur.

783
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,230
-Nice blading, guys.
-You look good.

784
00:44:20,263 --> 00:44:23,494
Thanks for coming. Don't worry.
My dad's not here.

785
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:25,331
-Oh, good.
-He's at work.

786
00:44:25,368 --> 00:44:26,802
I wanted to give you this.

787
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:30,898
-What? This is for me?
-Yeah.

788
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,375
-That's nice.
-It is nice.

789
00:44:35,912 --> 00:44:38,904
It's a badge case,
now that you're a gun again.

790
00:44:38,948 --> 00:44:40,575
I finished it this morning.

791
00:44:40,616 --> 00:44:42,983
Yeah. Thanks.

792
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,487
That is so sweet.

793
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,488
You know, this looks like fun.
Can I play?

794
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:47,751
-Sure!
-Meet Teddy Rex.

795
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,283
-Do you blade?
-Oh, yeah. I'm amazing.

796
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,590
What, are you kidding?

797
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:54,357
I got a room full of trophies
at home.

798
00:44:54,397 --> 00:44:55,887
They retired my jersey.

799
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:57,866
I even have a candy bar
named after me.

800
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,959
-Hey, hey, stop that.
-What?

801
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:01,902
-Candy bar too much?
-A little.

802
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:04,703
May I have three balls
at the same time, please?

803
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:10,675
Watch the master at work.

804
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:12,841
Face the wind.

805
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:15,852
A-one, two, three!

806
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:26,728
I'm the baddest dino in town,
doo da, doo da

807
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,976
I had Spinner
follow the rex and the gun.

808
00:45:44,313 --> 00:45:46,372
Take a look.

809
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:50,147
The kid's the handle on them
in case they get too close.

810
00:45:50,186 --> 00:45:51,517
Leave it to me.

811
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:03,256
Wow, Sebastian.

812
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:06,064
I just, uh...

813
00:46:06,102 --> 00:46:09,299
It's a badge case,
now that you're a gun again.

814
00:46:10,006 --> 00:46:11,804
Well, here we are.

815
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:13,935
The New Eden compound, Katie.

816
00:46:15,611 --> 00:46:19,275
Get me out. It stinks.

817
00:46:19,315 --> 00:46:22,580
Can you believe this? This guy
has got his own personal zoo.

818
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:26,020
Yeah. Incredible.

819
00:46:26,055 --> 00:46:30,617
It's the only place in the Grid
that still has live animals.

820
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,219
A pair of every animal on earth.

821
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:34,889
Yeah. I think this is--ow!

822
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,659
-Sorry.
-No problem.

823
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:38,996
Sorry.

824
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:45,107
Can you just slide your butt...

825
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:47,633
-Yeah. That's great.
-Like that?

826
00:46:47,677 --> 00:46:50,408
-All right.
-All right, buddy, let's go.

827
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:57,016
Oh, boy.

828
00:46:57,053 --> 00:47:00,216
It's like coming home for me,
Katie.

829
00:47:00,256 --> 00:47:02,384
This is where I grew up.

830
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:05,884
And here's Mr. Kane's lab,
where I was cloned.

831
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:09,057
Ah.
Memories, memories, memories.

832
00:47:09,098 --> 00:47:10,497
Freeze the elephants first.

833
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:12,627
Midnight
is only five hours away.

834
00:47:15,104 --> 00:47:16,503
May I help you?

835
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:19,736
-Welcome to New Eden, Mr. Rex.
-Well, thank you very much.

836
00:47:19,775 --> 00:47:22,540
We're here to see Kane.

837
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:25,377
-And you are?
-Coltrane. Grid Police.

838
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:26,540
And you are?

839
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:29,984
Dr. Shade, Kane's
personal physician. Follow.

840
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:34,047
-Come, Teddy. Follow.
-Hmm. Follow.

841
00:47:35,524 --> 00:47:39,358
I hope he has a moment to spare.
This is highly unusual.

842
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:42,854
Mr. Kane, you have visitors--
Teddy Rex and, um...

843
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:45,458
-Coltrane.
-Yes. Coltrane.

844
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:48,869
Yes. Welcome, Theodore. Hello.

845
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:51,999
Hi, Mr. Kane.
I'm sorry to barge in, sir...

846
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,475
but I'd like you to meet
my partner...

847
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:54,704
Detective Katie Coltrane.

848
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:57,611
Nice to meet you.

849
00:47:57,646 --> 00:48:01,605
Nice to...meet you.

850
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,210
We have something wonderful
to show you.

851
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:06,017
Guppies?

852
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:09,618
Ice fish.

853
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:12,388
They're remarkable creatures.

854
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:13,759
They live in our polar oceans...

855
00:48:13,796 --> 00:48:19,235
in water so cold,
no other organism can survive.

856
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:23,398
They possess an enzyme which
I've isolated and reproduced.

857
00:48:23,439 --> 00:48:26,568
Because of it,
ice fish can be trapped...

858
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:28,771
and frozen in ice for years.

859
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:33,145
Brought back to life again.

860
00:48:33,182 --> 00:48:35,742
After injecting a serum
from the ice fish...

861
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:37,947
into a subject's blood...

862
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:41,082
they can be frozen and
reanimated whenever you like.

863
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:48,025
That's just peachy, but we are
not here for a social call.

864
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:49,963
-I liked the fish.
-Come on.

865
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:52,661
No need to take an attitude.

866
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:55,295
I'll try to remember that.

867
00:48:55,337 --> 00:48:58,307
We're here because
someone gave Oliver Rex...

868
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,275
and a clone named Adam
a new cosmic address.

869
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,803
Is there--is there something
we can do to help?

870
00:49:04,847 --> 00:49:08,647
Well, according to his roommate,
Oliver worked here...

871
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:11,312
and the dead clone
was registered to you.

872
00:49:11,353 --> 00:49:13,822
Adam worked in species data
with Oliver.

873
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:17,588
-Species data?
-I collect endangered species.

874
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:20,220
We try to rescue
the last specimen when we can...

875
00:49:20,262 --> 00:49:23,357
and keep them here
at my compound.

876
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:25,766
Thank you for letting us know.

877
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:30,637
You're so very welcome, but
I do have one more thing to ask.

878
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:32,971
Isn't it a little strange
to you...

879
00:49:33,008 --> 00:49:36,205
that both these guys were made
extinct on the same night...

880
00:49:36,245 --> 00:49:38,304
and they both
just happened to work for you?

881
00:49:38,347 --> 00:49:40,577
It strikes me as tragic.

882
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:42,914
I'm sorry, officers.

883
00:49:42,952 --> 00:49:46,547
I'm sorry I can't be
of more help to you.

884
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:52,022
-Thank you.
-Thank you for your time.

885
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:54,086
Thank you. Good-bye.

886
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:56,188
Good-bye, and I really
enjoyed seeing the fishes.

887
00:49:56,232 --> 00:49:58,997
-Let's go.
-Excuse me. Coming!

888
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:12,010
Goal!

889
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:34,899
Brothers and sisters...

890
00:50:34,937 --> 00:50:41,434
we are gathered here this day
to recycle Oliver Rex...

891
00:50:41,477 --> 00:50:44,970
who, from the beginning
to the end...

892
00:50:45,014 --> 00:50:47,346
was our friend.

893
00:50:47,383 --> 00:50:49,181
Listen, where's the body?

894
00:50:49,218 --> 00:50:50,879
He was liquefied.

895
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,685
What do you mean, he was
liquefied--like a smoothie?

896
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:54,917
You see those tubes over there?

897
00:50:54,957 --> 00:50:57,619
His essence
fertilizes the flowers...

898
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,094
so that each guest
can take some home.

899
00:50:59,128 --> 00:51:00,755
Farewell, sweet Ollie.

900
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:03,993
Oliver! Oliver!

901
00:51:04,033 --> 00:51:06,934
Oliver is compost!

902
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:09,267
It couldn't have been a dino--

903
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:11,865
Oh, yes! She speaketh the truth!

904
00:51:11,907 --> 00:51:13,875
Go on, baby doll! You testify!

905
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:16,879
Maybe it was the soft-skins,
Oliver!

906
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:19,006
-What?
-Who's next?

907
00:51:19,048 --> 00:51:20,538
Please.

908
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:23,518
A word from your creator.

909
00:51:23,552 --> 00:51:27,147
My children, my children.

910
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:29,214
I am to blame
for Oliver's murder...

911
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:33,559
because it was I who brought
dinosaurs back to life.

912
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:37,555
But I give you my solemn oath...

913
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,264
we'll find
who's responsible for this.

914
00:51:41,303 --> 00:51:43,897
A better world is coming.

915
00:51:43,939 --> 00:51:46,965
I promise. I promise.

916
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:56,952
My favorite part.

917
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:59,580
-I'm going after Kane.
-What?

918
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:01,317
I'm going after Kane.

919
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,336
Good funeral.

920
00:52:23,078 --> 00:52:25,069
Thanks so much for coming,
Teddy.

921
00:52:25,114 --> 00:52:28,573
Oh, uh, Molly, my pleasure.

922
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:30,346
If there's anything else
I can do...

923
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:34,254
Well, a walk home
would be a lifesaver.

924
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:37,884
Yeah.
Let me ask my partner.

925
00:52:37,926 --> 00:52:40,554
Excuse me. Oh, boy.

926
00:52:40,596 --> 00:52:42,928
Oh, boy.

927
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:47,836
Molly wants you
to walk her home...

928
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,429
and it's purely
police business?

929
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,405
What was I, hatched yesterday?

930
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,908
-No, no, no.
-Come on. What are you doing?

931
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:54,431
We have work to do here.

932
00:52:54,476 --> 00:52:57,036
Yeah, I know, but
think of it as a police escort.

933
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:00,176
Please?

934
00:53:01,884 --> 00:53:03,875
Don't do the eyes.
You know the eyes kill me.

935
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:06,479
-OK, I'll tell you what.
-I'm sorry.

936
00:53:06,522 --> 00:53:09,981
You have one hour. We'll finish
the interrogations inside.

937
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:12,153
You be back here in an hour.
And do me a favor.

938
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:14,060
-What?
-Do you have a breath mint?

939
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:16,929
-What?
-Nothing. One hour.

940
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,396
-Nice ceremony.
-Thank you.

941
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,909
-Theodore.
-Yes, Century?

942
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:31,402
I advise you to give up
your dream of being a detective.

943
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:33,575
No. I can't do that.

944
00:53:33,615 --> 00:53:37,950
-Are you ready, Teddy?
-Ah, Molly. You bet.

945
00:53:37,986 --> 00:53:40,921
-Right this way.
-They never listen.

946
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:43,220
Ah, youth.

947
00:53:43,258 --> 00:53:47,024
Mr. Kane, I have something
that might interest you.

948
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:49,622
My best friend’s a cop!
She's going to kick your butt!

949
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:51,656
Get me out of here right now!

950
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,260
Hey, man, what are you doing?
Get off me!

951
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,365
Hey, help! Hey! Let me go, man!
Get your--get off of me!

952
00:53:58,407 --> 00:54:02,537
Meet Sebastian--
Coltrane's pet, our insurance.

953
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:04,910
How do you do, young man?

954
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:06,574
Stuff it, pantload!

955
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:08,379
Hey, mind your manners, kid.

956
00:54:12,321 --> 00:54:14,653
Get your hands off me,
you scarecrow!

957
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:29,799
Well, what do you know?
It's--it's my house.

958
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:31,067
You want a...

959
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:34,468
a little snack--
maybe some milk and cookies?

960
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,945
I'm a fool for milk and cookies.

961
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:42,516
Milk and cookies!

962
00:54:42,551 --> 00:54:45,179
Cookies, cookies, cookies,
cookies, cookies!

963
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,279
Milk and cookies for my tummy

964
00:54:47,322 --> 00:54:49,757
Here we are--home, sweet home.

965
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:51,817
I'm just going
to straighten up a little.

966
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,329
Oh, well. It's a mess.

967
00:54:54,363 --> 00:54:57,822
-Oh, say, it's so cozy.
-You really think so?

968
00:54:57,866 --> 00:54:59,630
-I know.
-I decorated myself.

969
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:04,001
-Nice--nice kick.
-Yeah. I started in the chorus.

970
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,804
No kidding. Really? Wow.

971
00:55:06,842 --> 00:55:10,369
Well, gee, Molly,
I'd like you to meet my dog.

972
00:55:10,412 --> 00:55:13,040
This is Zippy the dog.

973
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:14,674
Oh, doggies.

974
00:55:14,716 --> 00:55:17,185
Zippy. Zippy, talk nice.

975
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:19,984
Zip--Zippy!
No, no, no! Don't...

976
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:24,652
Sorry. He's a little mad.

977
00:55:24,693 --> 00:55:26,320
I left him alone so much.

978
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:34,492
Coltrane, Teddy Rex, report
to Captain Alaric A.S.A.P.

979
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:37,062
Do you want to see
my car collection, Molly?

980
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:38,539
I've got some really nice ones.

981
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:45,943
A gray one and a big silver one
with mag wheels--

982
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:47,142
a whole pile of them.

983
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:03,490
-Oh, Molly...
-Step out, boy.

984
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:07,560
I'm not such a good--
such a good dancer, Molly.

985
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:11,172
One, two, three.
Two, two, three.

986
00:56:16,378 --> 00:56:18,039
Hold me tight!

987
00:56:19,781 --> 00:56:22,011
Twirling and whirling...

988
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,576
The dinos are, uh...

989
00:56:26,088 --> 00:56:27,715
well...

990
00:56:29,091 --> 00:56:30,354
dancing.

991
00:56:33,061 --> 00:56:35,530
I got it, Molly! I got it!

992
00:56:35,564 --> 00:56:37,396
You got some stuff in you.

993
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:41,895
Watch your tail there.
Look out!

994
00:56:44,673 --> 00:56:47,108
Watch it, Zippy!

995
00:56:50,445 --> 00:56:52,072
Oh, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly.

996
00:56:52,114 --> 00:56:55,744
Whoo! I'm getting chills
on my scales.

997
00:56:55,784 --> 00:57:00,153
Teddy, I know you're up there,
and I know you can hear me.

998
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:01,747
You don't know
what's going to happen to you...

999
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,157
if you don't get your tail
down here right now.

1000
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:05,819
Look, I know it's not much.

1001
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:07,329
It'll probably
turn your finger green--

1002
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:08,921
turn your finger greener.

1003
00:57:08,964 --> 00:57:12,059
Teddy, it's perfect.

1004
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,263
Wow.
Listen, I'll be back soon.

1005
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:18,763
-Oh, you have to go?
-Duty calls. Toodle-oo!

1006
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:20,775
Take care.

1007
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:22,277
Oh, you...

1008
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:24,245
So long.

1009
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:27,647
It's a badge case,
now that you're a gun again.

1010
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:38,420
Molly, Molly, Molly.

1011
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,758
Ooh, you got it bad, don't you?

1012
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:49,433
My, my, my, aren’t we
just a tad glando this evening?

1013
00:57:49,471 --> 00:57:53,874
Come on! I'm not glando, OK?

1014
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:57,140
Oh, I see you dancing out
in the street under the stars...

1015
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:00,638
and flinging your tail around
like you're a free guy.

1016
00:58:00,682 --> 00:58:04,983
Oh, Katie, you act like
only humans fall in love.

1017
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,488
I can't understand you.

1018
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:10,219
Why do you keep your feelings
all bottled up inside, huh?

1019
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:14,024
You Yoknapatawpha are? You are
the classic ankylosaurus type.

1020
00:58:15,364 --> 00:58:17,162
That's right. Tough exterior...

1021
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:20,032
but soft and gushy
on the inside.

1022
00:58:21,436 --> 00:58:25,373
Get into the truck, Teddy.
They want us at headquarters.

1023
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,001
It sure looked like you cared
for Sebastian back there.

1024
00:58:28,043 --> 00:58:31,240
Am I right or wrong?
Right? Wrong? Right.

1025
00:58:31,279 --> 00:58:33,008
Do me a favor.

1026
00:58:33,048 --> 00:58:35,949
Don’t tip. Don’t twirl.
Don't swirl.

1027
00:58:35,984 --> 00:58:38,681
Just walk--like a man!

1028
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,418
Well, do your best.
Get in the truck.

1029
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:53,065
I reconstructed
the little gizmo myself.

1030
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:55,536
-It's a butterfly?
-It's a replica.

1031
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,562
It carries an explosive device
in its body.

1032
00:58:58,607 --> 00:59:01,042
It explodes on contact
with the victim--

1033
00:59:01,076 --> 00:59:03,408
-the work of a real artiste.
-Nasty.

1034
00:59:03,445 --> 00:59:05,539
Now, where would our killer
get a weapon like this?

1035
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,514
Only one name comes to mind.

1036
00:59:07,549 --> 00:59:09,916
In technokill circles,
he's known as the Toymaker.

1037
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,010
-Toymaker.
-So, where do we find him?

1038
00:59:12,054 --> 00:59:14,045
He runs a dead storage company
as a cover.

1039
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:16,683
It's called Dragontail
Dead Storage Company--

1040
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:18,250
somewhere in the Ninja Grid.

1041
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:20,591
-Good luck, Coltrane.
-Thanks. Come on.

1042
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:22,495
Time for a house call,
eh, Katie?

1043
00:59:30,205 --> 00:59:33,106
Brake, brake, brake!

1044
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:34,506
I thought you said
you could drive!

1045
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:36,136
Can it.

1046
00:59:36,178 --> 00:59:38,647
So, this is
Dragontail Dead Storage.

1047
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,978
Yep. Download ambush avoidance.

1048
00:59:41,016 --> 00:59:42,506
What?

1049
00:59:43,985 --> 00:59:46,352
I didn't know you were bioware.

1050
00:59:46,388 --> 00:59:49,949
Yeah. All guns are.
We're implanted with biochips.

1051
00:59:49,991 --> 00:59:53,188
You see this badge?
It's like a union label.

1052
00:59:53,228 --> 00:59:55,822
We're more human than human.
Let's go.

1053
00:59:55,864 --> 00:59:59,630
Hey, that must be
classified information.

1054
00:59:59,668 --> 01:00:02,000
Yes, it is,
so let's keep it that way.

1055
01:00:02,037 --> 01:00:04,472
Oh, right. Ahem.

1056
01:00:04,506 --> 01:00:08,340
So, you're a human
computer terminal, right?

1057
01:00:11,813 --> 01:00:13,645
Yeah. After you.

1058
01:00:13,682 --> 01:00:16,845
-Door. Let's go.
-Right.

1059
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:26,762
-Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
-No minimum tail clearance.

1060
01:00:26,795 --> 01:00:29,821
So, people keep
dead relatives here...

1061
01:00:29,865 --> 01:00:32,027
until medical science
can reanimate them?

1062
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:33,364
Well, they brought
you guys back...

1063
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:35,369
so why should that
be a surprise?

1064
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:36,871
Well, that's true.

1065
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:40,170
-Walk like me.
-Right--like you.

1066
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,835
Tip..toe...

1067
01:00:41,877 --> 01:00:45,677
Stop with the tip-tip.
Don't tip-tip. Just tiptoe.

1068
01:00:45,714 --> 01:00:47,341
What is that smell?
Is that you?

1069
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:49,407
It's not me.
How could it be me?

1070
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:51,920
-Did you--
-Look, I didn't butt-trumpet.

1071
01:00:51,953 --> 01:00:53,114
One of these things is leaking.

1072
01:00:53,155 --> 01:00:54,850
Fine, fine. Let's go.

1073
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,790
-Doo doo--
-Don't "Doo doo doo."

1074
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:58,054
-What?
-Don't "Doo doo doo."

1075
01:00:58,093 --> 01:00:59,652
What,
am I waking these mummies up?

1076
01:00:59,694 --> 01:01:01,059
Come on. Come on.

1077
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:04,257
All right, there's a bell.
I'm going to ring it.

1078
01:01:04,299 --> 01:01:06,996
All right, ring the bell.
Yeah.

1079
01:01:07,035 --> 01:01:08,867
Maybe we should look around.

1080
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:30,189
Welcome to Dead Storage.
Who's going to die?

1081
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:34,822
Nobody's dying.

1082
01:01:34,863 --> 01:01:36,422
We're looking for the Toymaker.

1083
01:01:36,464 --> 01:01:38,330
Never heard of him.

1084
01:01:38,366 --> 01:01:41,336
What do you mean? Come on.
We know he's here. Where is he?

1085
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:42,928
Who wants to know?

1086
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:44,666
Who are you?

1087
01:01:44,706 --> 01:01:47,607
I'm the guy from the bag.

1088
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:50,111
You want me to get
in that bag with you...

1089
01:01:50,145 --> 01:01:51,772
and snatch you to pieces?

1090
01:01:51,813 --> 01:01:54,214
Ooh, I'd love it, baby.

1091
01:01:55,717 --> 01:01:58,687
Come and get it.

1092
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,381
Come here. Come here.

1093
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:06,657
Don't be going in my bag,
you understand?

1094
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:09,255
Listen, zit...

1095
01:02:09,297 --> 01:02:11,197
I want to know
where the Toymaker is...

1096
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:13,861
or my friend here is going
to bite your pea head off.

1097
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:15,028
Food.

1098
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:18,734
-Ha!
-What do you mean, ha?

1099
01:02:18,773 --> 01:02:21,071
You're four inches tall,
and you're giving us "Ha"?

1100
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:24,443
Hey, nightmare hair, take
lizard lips and get out of here.

1101
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:25,776
Take that.

1102
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:28,249
Fuzzy! We got trouble!

1103
01:02:28,283 --> 01:02:31,309
What's he talking about Fuzzy?
What is Fuzzy?

1104
01:02:31,353 --> 01:02:32,514
I don't know.

1105
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:41,629
It's a hairy hot dog.

1106
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:45,256
-Cops!
-Cops? I'm out of here.

1107
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,927
What?

1108
01:02:46,968 --> 01:02:48,458
Follow me.

1109
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:50,733
Let's go. Come on.
Up, up, up, and away.

1110
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,740
We're going now.
This is us moving. Elevator up.

1111
01:02:52,774 --> 01:02:54,264
-I'm going.
-Get me out of here.

1112
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,277
-Let's go.
-Follow me.

1113
01:02:56,311 --> 01:03:00,680
I'll take your blues,
stomp down your troubles

1114
01:03:00,715 --> 01:03:04,674
Love you with heart and soul

1115
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,678
I'll take your blues,
stomp down your troubles

1116
01:03:08,723 --> 01:03:12,023
Rock you with a steady roll

1117
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:16,019
Here's your connection,
take my affection

1118
01:03:16,064 --> 01:03:18,089
Then you're my--aah!

1119
01:03:18,133 --> 01:03:19,862
All right,
you're coming with us.

1120
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:21,630
Not in this life, dream boy.

1121
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,802
Miss Molly Rex, I presume?

1122
01:03:33,815 --> 01:03:36,147
I can't believe
you'd do that in the elevator.

1123
01:03:36,184 --> 01:03:37,811
I didn't pump gas.

1124
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:39,377
-Katie, I have an idea.
-What?

1125
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:41,412
I'll play a tough guy--
you know, from the old movies?

1126
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:44,289
-Yeah. What about it?
-Check it out. Watch this.

1127
01:03:44,326 --> 01:03:47,455
Is anybody home, sweetheart?

1128
01:03:47,495 --> 01:03:49,862
-I believe this is our host.
-Watch my attitude here.

1129
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:53,801
A bioware...and a dragon.

1130
01:03:53,835 --> 01:03:57,863
That's tyrannosaurus rex,
girlie-boy.

1131
01:03:57,906 --> 01:03:59,840
Welcome.

1132
01:03:59,874 --> 01:04:01,364
Have some tea.

1133
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:03,036
Are you the Toymaker?

1134
01:04:03,078 --> 01:04:05,046
I've been called many things.

1135
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,879
What's this, Kung Fu? I don't
want to play games with you.

1136
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,408
-We're here because--
-We need a gun.

1137
01:04:10,452 --> 01:04:14,355
What, headquarters
doesn't supply you with weapons?

1138
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:17,757
Yeah, they'll give us weapons,
but they're too bleeping small.

1139
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:19,453
We got a problem with that?

1140
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,061
What are you doing?

1141
01:04:23,098 --> 01:04:25,760
-I'm here to buy a gun, OK?
-You don't need to buy a gun.

1142
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,394
-Katie, I'm undercover here.
-What, what, what?

1143
01:04:28,436 --> 01:04:30,200
Work with me!

1144
01:04:30,238 --> 01:04:31,535
Oh, is this a ruse?

1145
01:04:33,908 --> 01:04:35,034
You need a gun.

1146
01:04:35,076 --> 01:04:36,840
-I need a gun.
-He needs a gun--

1147
01:04:36,878 --> 01:04:40,280
a big gun, because he's a big...

1148
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:42,817
guy.

1149
01:04:42,851 --> 01:04:44,376
I almost thought you meant that.

1150
01:04:44,419 --> 01:04:46,251
Could you stay here, please?
I'll finish the act.

1151
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:47,448
Oh, sure.

1152
01:04:52,127 --> 01:04:55,153
That's more like it.

1153
01:04:55,196 --> 01:04:57,255
Very nice.

1154
01:04:57,298 --> 01:04:59,266
You do very professional work.

1155
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,268
Oh, and by the way...

1156
01:05:01,302 --> 01:05:04,567
last night, one of your
butterflies killed a dino...

1157
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:07,632
and we can connect you
to the murder.

1158
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:10,576
Suck eggs, cops!

1159
01:05:10,612 --> 01:05:14,105
-What is that?
-It's a bug, and it's beeping.

1160
01:05:14,149 --> 01:05:15,708
It's beeping,
and I don't feel good about it.

1161
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:19,618
-Let's backtrack.
-Easy, steady.

1162
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:21,122
Don't shake the platform.

1163
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:24,126
You know what? Little tiny
baby steps to the left is good.

1164
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:25,320
Now to the right.

1165
01:05:27,162 --> 01:05:28,857
-I'm out of here.
-Right, right, right.

1166
01:05:28,897 --> 01:05:31,229
Go on. Right, right, right.

1167
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:46,012
Hey, I ain't cleaning this up.

1168
01:06:07,902 --> 01:06:10,030
I'm going to hit him, Katie,
I swear.

1169
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:11,800
What do you mean? What are you
going to hit him with?

1170
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,865
-With my breath.
-Oh, no, not that.

1171
01:06:13,908 --> 01:06:16,605
No. Don't do it, don't do it.
Oh, come on--oh...

1172
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,574
That breath didn't bother you?

1173
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:33,484
Last chance.

1174
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,053
Who bought the butterfly?

1175
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:37,224
That's it!
I'm going to eat this guy!

1176
01:06:41,603 --> 01:06:43,970
You cannot eat our only suspect.

1177
01:06:44,005 --> 01:06:45,905
Watch me.

1178
01:06:47,575 --> 01:06:49,805
You want to know? I'll tell you
anything you want to know!

1179
01:06:51,145 --> 01:06:53,239
Aah! It's Edge.

1180
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:56,410
Edge bought the butterfly!
He works for Kane!

1181
01:06:56,451 --> 01:06:59,079
-Kane? Where is he?
-At the compound.

1182
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,713
Wait till I get my claws on him.

1183
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:03,622
-Forget it. He's got hostages.
-What?

1184
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:06,491
Yeah. A little boy who works
at the mystery meat stand...

1185
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:08,087
and some dino singer!

1186
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:11,064
Molly and Sebastian.
It's chow time!

1187
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:13,090
Aah! You want Kane?

1188
01:07:13,134 --> 01:07:14,533
-Yeah.
-Talk to the Zapheads.

1189
01:07:14,569 --> 01:07:16,162
I got some payback
for the Zapheads.

1190
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:17,296
But the compound's a fort.

1191
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:21,002
You'll never get in!
Never, never, never, never--

1192
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:29,244
-Ah, so what? Come on.
-OK.

1193
01:07:30,285 --> 01:07:32,185
Boss, I quit!

1194
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,678
Oh, no! Let me go!

1195
01:07:33,721 --> 01:07:36,019
No! You're messing
with the wrong guy!

1196
01:07:47,435 --> 01:07:48,596
Let go!

1197
01:08:05,386 --> 01:08:06,945
What are you looking at?

1198
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:18,829
Well, doc, when do I get
my seat on the ark?

1199
01:08:18,866 --> 01:08:20,356
Excuse me?

1200
01:08:20,401 --> 01:08:23,336
Tonight,
Kane takes down mankind.

1201
01:08:23,371 --> 01:08:27,569
I mean, that is what this whole
freak show is about, isn't it?

1202
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:30,704
So, Kane kills
all the soft-skins...

1203
01:08:30,745 --> 01:08:33,077
and gets to play God, right?

1204
01:08:33,114 --> 01:08:34,513
Tell me, Mr. Summers.

1205
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:36,984
What diseases
run in your family?

1206
01:08:41,155 --> 01:08:43,988
Very big feet.

1207
01:08:44,025 --> 01:08:46,926
-How delightful.
-What? Was it something I said?

1208
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:54,999
Sweet dreams, Summers.

1209
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:02,166
You weren't really gonna bite
that guy's head off, were you?

1210
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,609
It crossed my mind.

1211
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:09,140
-Gun command.
-On-line, on-line bioware.

1212
01:09:09,183 --> 01:09:11,550
Gun command.

1213
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:13,111
-Man.
-What's the matter?

1214
01:09:13,154 --> 01:09:14,553
I can't get anybody on my comp.

1215
01:09:14,589 --> 01:09:17,524
I think that explosion
blew it out...

1216
01:09:17,558 --> 01:09:20,118
and that means
we're out here all alone.

1217
01:09:20,161 --> 01:09:25,224
Yeah. Listen. For what it's
worth, I've got you covered.

1218
01:09:25,266 --> 01:09:27,530
-Why, thank you, Teddy.
-Sure.

1219
01:09:27,568 --> 01:09:29,229
And look, we have company.

1220
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:32,171
I'm going to get me
a Zappy meal.

1221
01:09:33,274 --> 01:09:35,208
What do you mean, you're
going to get a Zappy meal?

1222
01:09:35,243 --> 01:09:37,644
You're a vegetarian.
What are you talking about?

1223
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,306
Hey, I binge once in a while.

1224
01:09:39,347 --> 01:09:40,473
Let's go.

1225
01:09:40,515 --> 01:09:42,540
At midnight,
the world turns into a pumpkin!

1226
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:44,210
Or an ice cube!

1227
01:09:44,252 --> 01:09:47,313
-Coltrane and Teddy bear...
-And everybody else!

1228
01:10:07,141 --> 01:10:08,370
Hey, girls.

1229
01:10:11,746 --> 01:10:15,341
So, hey, guys, how y’all doing?

1230
01:10:15,383 --> 01:10:17,943
This broad keeps popping up!

1231
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:20,352
Don't I, though?
Did you miss me?

1232
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:22,618
I bet you did. I missed you.

1233
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:23,852
We had such a good time.

1234
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:25,222
You know, I was thinking
about it the other day.

1235
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:27,591
We had such a good time
when I was shooting at you.

1236
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:30,029
You were shooting at me--
trying to kill me, remember?

1237
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:33,762
And I thought, "Where do I go
if I have a problem?"

1238
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:35,360
Where did I come? To you.

1239
01:10:35,403 --> 01:10:39,362
I'm looking for Kane,
and I need your help.

1240
01:10:39,407 --> 01:10:42,069
Now, why would you do that?
I'm really crushed!

1241
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:45,637
I mean, I came here because
I thought you could help.

1242
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,547
I'm so emotional
I don't know what to do...

1243
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:52,110
and my partner is just really
going to be put out by this.

1244
01:10:52,153 --> 01:10:54,485
Your partner?

1245
01:10:59,494 --> 01:11:02,259
You thought I was going to come
here by myself, didn't you?

1246
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:04,765
-Yeah, I know you did!
-Yeah, she knows we did!

1247
01:11:07,268 --> 01:11:09,259
Silly man. Look.

1248
01:11:17,178 --> 01:11:23,550
Hey, I want you to read
this message into the holocam.

1249
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:25,985
We'll send it
to your gun girlfriend.

1250
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,751
She'll get a hologram.

1251
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:33,352
Then she'll see the light, and
we'll live happily ever after.

1252
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:36,523
I can't read your writing.

1253
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,365
Well, then, sound it out!

1254
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:51,335
Dangle my toes in the air

1255
01:11:51,379 --> 01:11:53,438
Look at me, Katie!
I'm a pterodactyl!

1256
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:58,952
Hey, look, stop that.
Stop moving around!

1257
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:00,420
I thought you said
you could fly this thing.

1258
01:12:00,454 --> 01:12:02,115
Excuse me.
I'm not used to flying...

1259
01:12:02,156 --> 01:12:04,887
three thousand pounds
of dino-flab every day.

1260
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:07,623
Ooh!
I think I'm going to be sick.

1261
01:12:07,662 --> 01:12:09,528
If you let that go,
I swear to God...

1262
01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:11,293
I'm going to turn you
into a pocketbook.

1263
01:12:11,332 --> 01:12:14,302
Take us down! There's
Kane's compound right there.

1264
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,794
Look at me! I'm flying!

1265
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,307
Come on. Quit that.

1266
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,241
Quit it!
You're making the copter move.

1267
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:24,472
Great, great. Lower us down.

1268
01:12:24,512 --> 01:12:27,038
I think my--
here comes my lunch!

1269
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:30,483
-Don't let it go--fly off!
-No, no, no, no!

1270
01:12:30,518 --> 01:12:33,749
Watch out for the trees!
Watch out for the trees!

1271
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:35,847
Get the hell out!

1272
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:38,552
-What are you, nuts?
-Oh, I'm going to shoot you!

1273
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:41,329
Where are all the animals?

1274
01:12:41,362 --> 01:12:42,693
Where are all of Kane's animals?

1275
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:45,097
Stop that! Stop that!

1276
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:48,526
-Not that fast!
-Hey, hey! Not so fast!

1277
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:52,164
-I'm a passenger down here!
-Stop that! Stop moving!

1278
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:55,767
He's going to make
tyranno-sore-ass soup out of us!

1279
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,175
Gee, I'm gonna make
an hors d'oeuvre out of you...

1280
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,044
and quit flapping down there!

1281
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:02,015
Oh, dear! Help me, Katie!

1282
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:03,175
You've got to bail out!

1283
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:05,652
-Somebody's got to bail out!
-You go!

1284
01:13:11,092 --> 01:13:13,060
We're going down!
We're going down!

1285
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:18,295
Help me! Help me!

1286
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:26,836
My God!

1287
01:13:35,683 --> 01:13:38,414
Please, your creatorship...

1288
01:13:38,452 --> 01:13:41,422
if you would give me
just one moment here.

1289
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,121
I just want to say one thing.

1290
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:47,589
None of this is my fault!

1291
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,928
They made me bring them here!

1292
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:53,400
He is the one!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1293
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:05,406
Oh, look, EIizar.

1294
01:14:05,446 --> 01:14:07,676
It's...

1295
01:14:07,715 --> 01:14:09,308
What was your name again?

1296
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,376
Coltrane.
Where's Sebastian?

1297
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:15,151
In a cage,
where all bad children belong.

1298
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:18,159
Get rid of them.
Get rid of them!

1299
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:32,333
Excuse me.

1300
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,559
-Why, Teddy!
-Molly!

1301
01:15:01,602 --> 01:15:03,502
-Teddy!
-Molly! Oh, my head!

1302
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,810
-What happened?
-Teddy, are you OK?

1303
01:15:10,544 --> 01:15:12,979
Teddy, you are safe now.

1304
01:15:13,014 --> 01:15:14,345
Wait a minute.

1305
01:15:14,382 --> 01:15:16,043
You killed Oliver and Adam,
didn't you?

1306
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:19,713
The sacrifice was necessary,
unfortunately.

1307
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:22,883
Well, at headquarters,
we call that murder.

1308
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,317
Teddy!

1309
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:28,226
I'm sorry. You're under arrest.

1310
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:32,028
Look around. It's the future.

1311
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:33,659
-Yeah? What?
-Life has changed, Teddy...

1312
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:36,671
and in one minute,
I'll change the world.

1313
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:39,298
What are you talking about?

1314
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,774
What the...

1315
01:15:40,808 --> 01:15:43,573
You see, mankind is
a failed species, and look--

1316
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:46,581
-New Eden will finish them off.
-Oh, no.

1317
01:15:46,614 --> 01:15:49,276
I will block out the sun...

1318
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:53,014
and create a new ice age!

1319
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:55,022
-Katie!
-Sebastian.

1320
01:15:55,056 --> 01:15:58,356
Over here, Katie! I'm here!
Come and get me!

1321
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:01,089
Katie, watch behind you!
Move out of the way!

1322
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,200
Katie, turn around!

1323
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:10,968
Wait!

1324
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:22,512
This time, I run evolution...

1325
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,779
not God.

1326
01:16:23,818 --> 01:16:25,547
Here is my ark.

1327
01:16:25,586 --> 01:16:27,486
It contains the seeds
of the New Eden.

1328
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:31,082
I brought here
breeding pairs of all plants...

1329
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:33,116
insects, mammals...

1330
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,094
amphibians, birds, bacteria...

1331
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:37,621
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera...

1332
01:16:37,665 --> 01:16:41,033
the ingredients for paradise.

1333
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:43,730
That's my paradise.
It's...

1334
01:16:44,972 --> 01:16:48,465
My paradise! It's my breed!

1335
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:52,576
Detonation, minus one hundred.

1336
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:53,842
My destiny.

1337
01:16:53,881 --> 01:16:57,840
So you froze them here
just to save them.

1338
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:04,916
Oh, no. It's a small price
to give them immortality.

1339
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,120
Don't you agree?

1340
01:17:11,732 --> 01:17:14,633
We call it
survival of the fittest.

1341
01:17:14,668 --> 01:17:16,432
-We should go.
-Yeah.

1342
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,768
Wait!
What have you done with Molly?

1343
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:20,331
Oh, she's safe.

1344
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:24,470
I'm pleased
that you care for each other.

1345
01:17:24,512 --> 01:17:27,948
Detonation, minus ninety.

1346
01:17:29,116 --> 01:17:33,246
A pair of rexes--
at last, my ark is complete.

1347
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:35,449
Yes. Prepare him for sleep.

1348
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:36,615
Of course.

1349
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:40,150
Molly, my love.

1350
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:45,924
Molly,
what have they done to you?

1351
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,552
Detonation, minus eighty-five.

1352
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:35,272
Hey, hold your horses.
Needles creep me out, you know.

1353
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:38,251
Oh, one little prick,
and you'll wake up in paradise.

1354
01:18:38,285 --> 01:18:39,684
Oh, terrific.

1355
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:43,384
So, tell me, why did you guys
kill Oliver and Adam, huh?

1356
01:18:43,424 --> 01:18:46,291
They threatened to expose
Mr. Kane's master plan.

1357
01:18:48,095 --> 01:18:50,962
Don't you realize?
Something wonderful has begun...

1358
01:18:50,998 --> 01:18:53,968
and you, Teddy,
are invited to join the party.

1359
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:55,662
Yeah, well, do me a favor.

1360
01:18:55,703 --> 01:18:57,899
You seem like a nice, mean lady.

1361
01:18:57,938 --> 01:18:59,906
Please help me stop your boss!

1362
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,840
EIizar has the remote control.

1363
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:05,903
He's the only one
who can abort the plan, so...

1364
01:19:05,946 --> 01:19:07,414
I'd like to have
a little chat with Kane!

1365
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:11,247
He's on his way up
to one of his sleep chambers.

1366
01:19:11,285 --> 01:19:15,552
Now, shh.
Teddy, close your eyes.

1367
01:19:15,589 --> 01:19:17,819
The best is yet to come.

1368
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:21,385
Yeah, maybe you're right, doc.
I'll cooperate.

1369
01:19:25,165 --> 01:19:28,294
Teddy? Teddy!

1370
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:30,167
Sorry, doc. Got other plans.

1371
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:32,070
Teddy!

1372
01:19:32,106 --> 01:19:34,473
Detonation, minus eighty.

1373
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:42,476
Katie!

1374
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:47,619
Oh, Katie, am I glad to see you!

1375
01:19:47,655 --> 01:19:49,589
Oh, Katie!

1376
01:19:49,623 --> 01:19:51,216
You all right? Good.
Who's your friend?

1377
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:53,158
I just met him over there.
Can I keep him?

1378
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:56,128
-All right. Let's go.
-All right!

1379
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:57,631
-Hey! Get out of here.
-Grenade! Grenade!

1380
01:19:57,665 --> 01:20:00,134
Get out of here!
Let's go.

1381
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:02,499
Detonation, minus seventy.

1382
01:20:02,536 --> 01:20:04,766
-Access denied.
-What's the code? Come on.

1383
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:06,796
-Access denied.
-Come on!

1384
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:11,038
Access denied. Access denied.

1385
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:12,603
-Access denied.
-Please, come on!

1386
01:20:22,423 --> 01:20:25,586
I'm sorry, Molly. I'm sorry.

1387
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,333
Ouch.

1388
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:40,504
Molly, Molly.

1389
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:42,703
-Teddy!
-Molly? Molly?

1390
01:20:42,743 --> 01:20:46,008
-Teddy!
-Oh, Molly!

1391
01:20:46,046 --> 01:20:47,639
Oh, Teddy!

1392
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:50,776
Oh! I thought
I'd never see you again.

1393
01:20:50,818 --> 01:20:52,786
Oh, I missed you so much.

1394
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:58,015
-I was so worried about you.
-Stay right here.

1395
01:20:58,058 --> 01:21:00,493
-You're so cold.
-You're so warm.

1396
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:01,926
And I'm so ill.

1397
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:04,454
Detonation, minus sixty.

1398
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:07,433
Katie! Come here, you!

1399
01:21:07,468 --> 01:21:09,766
You're squishing me right now.
Oh, my goodness!

1400
01:21:09,803 --> 01:21:12,033
And you're just
a little gregarious.

1401
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,836
Yeah. I'm so happy.

1402
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:16,036
What is this place?
Where are we?

1403
01:21:16,076 --> 01:21:18,067
This is Kane's ark,
a frozen zoo.

1404
01:21:18,112 --> 01:21:20,604
He's mad. He wants
to play God or something.

1405
01:21:25,386 --> 01:21:28,185
Katie!

1406
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:30,088
-Katie!
-Katie! No!

1407
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,258
Why?

1408
01:21:34,294 --> 01:21:39,460
Teddy, I told you,
we'll create a better world.

1409
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,936
Come with me! I forgive you!
Teddy, come with me!

1410
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,995
I can't!

1411
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:47,769
Teddy, you are not a cop.

1412
01:21:47,808 --> 01:21:50,209
You can't be what you are not.

1413
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:52,110
-Come with me.
-No!

1414
01:21:52,146 --> 01:21:53,739
You drop the gun!

1415
01:21:53,781 --> 01:21:55,271
You hear me?

1416
01:21:57,851 --> 01:21:59,910
It's a pity.

1417
01:22:08,862 --> 01:22:11,661
-Teddy?
-What? What?

1418
01:22:11,698 --> 01:22:13,928
Are you hit?

1419
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:17,096
No, I'm--I'm just playing.
Are you hit?

1420
01:22:17,137 --> 01:22:18,366
I'm not exactly hit.

1421
01:22:18,405 --> 01:22:23,673
I'm off-line, and I'm down,
so I think you're on your own.

1422
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:26,236
All right, give me your gun.

1423
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,475
I can't.

1424
01:22:27,514 --> 01:22:29,073
-What?
-I can't.

1425
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:31,744
Katie, give me your gun.
This is no time to play around.

1426
01:22:31,785 --> 01:22:33,753
-Give me it.
-You might've been right.

1427
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:36,415
It kills me to say this,
but you might've been right.

1428
01:22:36,457 --> 01:22:38,425
Use something
a little better than a gun.

1429
01:22:38,459 --> 01:22:39,984
No, Katie, look,
all this time...

1430
01:22:40,027 --> 01:22:42,189
you've been telling me
a good cop uses a gun, right?

1431
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:43,594
So, what are you
telling me now?

1432
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:44,961
I was wrong.

1433
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:47,998
-Your brain.
-What?

1434
01:22:48,035 --> 01:22:50,094
Use your brain.

1435
01:22:52,339 --> 01:22:54,433
All right. Brains over bullets.

1436
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:56,034
-Yeah.
-Let's do it.

1437
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:57,840
Hey, partner?

1438
01:22:59,413 --> 01:23:02,041
Wait a minute.
You said the "P" word.

1439
01:23:02,082 --> 01:23:04,676
Yeah, I did. Good luck, OK?

1440
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:08,052
Yeah. You, too, partner.

1441
01:23:08,088 --> 01:23:11,888
I'm going after Kane. Hang on.

1442
01:23:11,925 --> 01:23:14,451
-Scram then.
-Right.

1443
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:15,656
I'll see you.

1444
01:23:18,398 --> 01:23:20,867
Detonation, minus fifty.

1445
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,138
Come on!

1446
01:23:30,711 --> 01:23:32,577
Hey, come--come back here!

1447
01:23:38,952 --> 01:23:41,250
OK. Where are they?

1448
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:43,689
Wait. Brains over bullets.

1449
01:23:47,094 --> 01:23:49,256
OK. Get the rope. Here.

1450
01:23:49,296 --> 01:23:51,697
Detonation, minus forty.

1451
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:55,427
Yeah. Come here.

1452
01:23:57,271 --> 01:23:58,432
Come here!

1453
01:23:58,472 --> 01:24:01,237
OK. All right.

1454
01:24:08,949 --> 01:24:10,246
They went to the right. Yeah.

1455
01:24:10,284 --> 01:24:13,413
Detonation, minus thirty-five.

1456
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:32,232
I'm going to get you guys.
Head them off at the pass.

1457
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:34,240
Detonation, minus twenty.

1458
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:44,142
Geronimo!

1459
01:24:59,132 --> 01:25:00,497
Teddy...

1460
01:25:00,534 --> 01:25:02,935
Teddy, the remote.

1461
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:05,735
Detonation, minus fifteen.

1462
01:25:08,008 --> 01:25:10,636
-Teddy!
-Hand over the remote.

1463
01:25:10,677 --> 01:25:12,304
You're under arrest, Kane.

1464
01:25:12,346 --> 01:25:15,179
I'll stop your missile myself.

1465
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:16,774
-Ten...
-Take that!

1466
01:25:16,817 --> 01:25:19,752
-Nine, eight...
-Don't do it!

1467
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:22,756
-Seven, six...
-Don't do it! My breed! Teddy!

1468
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:25,622
-Five, four...
-Oh, please!

1469
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:29,152
Three, two, one.

1470
01:25:36,837 --> 01:25:39,829
We're here today
to honor Theodore Rex.

1471
01:25:39,873 --> 01:25:43,275
Teddy, we owe you an apology.

1472
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:46,644
Soft-skin, scale--

1473
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,308
you've shown us
that they’re only words...

1474
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:51,647
words that keep us apart.

1475
01:25:51,685 --> 01:25:55,849
Our survival rests on all
species treating each other...

1476
01:25:55,889 --> 01:26:01,089
with compassion, kindness,
and respect.

1477
01:26:01,128 --> 01:26:02,687
-Teddy...
-Go on.

1478
01:26:02,729 --> 01:26:06,029
It is my honor to promote you
to detective first class.

1479
01:26:06,066 --> 01:26:08,364
Wow! Thank you, sir.

1480
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:10,564
-Teddy, you were right.
-Yes, sir.

1481
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:13,198
We can all realize our dreams.

1482
01:26:18,178 --> 01:26:22,206
Teddy, I'm so proud of you.

1483
01:26:24,751 --> 01:26:25,912
Thank you!

1484
01:26:27,154 --> 01:26:28,383
Hey, Molly.

1485
01:26:28,422 --> 01:26:31,255
You the man!

1486
01:26:34,828 --> 01:26:36,694
Congratulations, detective.

1487
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:38,698
Hey, thanks, Katie.

1488
01:26:38,732 --> 01:26:40,496
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1489
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:41,763
-Oh, yes, you could.
-You think?

1490
01:26:41,802 --> 01:26:44,396
Oh, yeah. I believe
you could do anything...

1491
01:26:44,438 --> 01:26:46,031
you put your mind to, Teddy.

1492
01:26:46,073 --> 01:26:47,199
Aw, please!

1493
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,800
Anytime you need me,
you know how to find me.

1494
01:26:49,843 --> 01:26:51,436
You know,
it's funny you should say that.

1495
01:26:51,478 --> 01:26:55,073
As a gold badge,
I get to pick my new partner.

1496
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:56,344
What?

1497
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:58,545
So, what are you doing
the next twenty years?

1498
01:26:58,585 --> 01:27:01,782
Oh, you mean that soon?

1499
01:27:01,822 --> 01:27:04,291
Katie, I think
this is the beginning...

1500
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:06,156
of a beautiful friendship.
