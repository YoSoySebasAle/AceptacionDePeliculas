999 emergency

00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,074
help me, I got lost while hiking

3
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:39,989
hello?

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,706
Hello? Can you hear me?

5
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,365
I can hear you, was it an accident?

6
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,956
I told you I got lost

7
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,540
do you know where you are?

8
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Sai kung east

9
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,577
sai kung east

10
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,990
"465407"

11
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,081
is that it? "465307"?

12
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,083
Yes

13
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,907
sir, what do you see?

14
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,619
"233421"

15
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,332
sir, neither of those coordinates
are in sai kung

16
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,664
help

17
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,833
hello?

18
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,371
- My badge number is "238448"
- Hello?

19
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,375
You're a police officer?

20
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,369
I need to know your position

21
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:14,792
hello?

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,661
Hello? Can you hear me?

23
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,620
Sir? I can't hear you clearly

24
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,490
what do you see around you?

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,490
You came from sai kung east?

26
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,205
Can you hear me?

27
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,538
Hello?

28
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,373
Sir? Can you hear me?

29
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,364
Send someone here

30
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,375
hello?

31
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,206
Mom, I'm going to work

32
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,119
ying, don't leave yet

33
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,248
pay respect to your father

34
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,662
It's been seven years
since he's gone missing

35
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,534
I'm getting his death certificate later

36
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,074
Here, have some water

37
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,576
Remember to take your pills at 3pm

38
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,494
I'm going to work now

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,365
who are you?

40
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,246
Mom, I'm ching, your son

41
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,081
I don't know you

42
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,707
mom, I'm mak chi ching

43
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,289
what are you doing here?

44
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,832
I put you to bed last night, remember?

45
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,289
You're a stranger here, right?

46
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,434
Are you trying to steal from me?

47
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,074
- Help, thief!
- Mom...

48
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:29,033
Ying, I'm sorry for the noise

49
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,042
do you need help?

50
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,911
It's okay, don't worry about it

51
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,785
yes

52
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,699
sure, I'll send it to you by two o'clock

53
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,577
I'm ready

54
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,327
thank you

55
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,869
Morning ying - morning

56
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,036
new case, husband's been missing for a year

57
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,482
with a six year old daughter at home

58
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,875
thanks

59
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:23,161
Help her, missing a father
is a lot of trouble

60
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,077
ying

61
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,490
ying

62
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,458
someone's here for you.

63
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,542
Thanks

64
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,661
suet wing, what's wrong?

65
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,369
Are you okay?

66
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,534
My mom has decided to marry that man

67
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,539
she's been neglecting me ever
since she was with him

68
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,369
keep going, I'm listening

69
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,534
it's like my dad has gone missing

70
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,999
I can't seem to reach him

71
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,374
but he's dead to me anyway

72
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,623
I'm always home alone...

73
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,583
Ying, ying

74
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,375
bye-bye

75
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,573
miss sit?

76
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,956
- Miss sit.
- Yes?

77
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,282
You should've told me
if you didn't wanna listen

78
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,292
suet wing

79
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,868
I get it, miss sit

80
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,038
thank you, I can handle by myself

81
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,873
you can reach me anytime

82
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,573
Hello? Nam?

83
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,869
Ying, there's news about wah

84
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,365
come to the police station

85
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,039
Nam

86
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,157
nam

87
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,287
A hiker found this two days ago

88
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,998
and brought it to us

89
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,583
here, you can keep his badge

90
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,616
the police
will no longer be involved in this case

91
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,915
it's been seven years since the incident

92
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,371
our protocol states
that we can't continue the investigation

93
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,125
his badge is best in your keeping

94
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,164
in my keeping?

95
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,373
I kept a lot of things too

96
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,373
but what's the point?

97
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,956
I thought you asked me to come up here

98
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,373
to let me know if there
were any developments

99
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,950
now that we've found his
badge, there's hope

100
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,453
but you're telling me
you're gonna stop investigating?

101
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:02,249
Ying, calm down

102
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,365
you know I want to find wah as well

103
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,956
where did you find his badge?

104
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:11,624
At wah's last known location

105
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,956
around the snake stone in sai kung

106
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,167
who found it?

107
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,998
A regular citizen

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,615
but something doesn't feel right to him

109
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,577
I want to meet him

110
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,708
alright

111
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,491
I want to know, where did
you find this badge?

112
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,370
I'm not obliged to say anything

113
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:03,163
but whatever I say,
can't be used in a court of law

114
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,830
hey, she's asking you a question

115
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,498
I've already answered you before, madam

116
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,365
you don't belive me, yet you've asked
your subordinate to question me

117
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,239
what do you want?

118
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,660
I'm not a cop

119
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,415
this is my father,
he's been missing for a long time

120
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,790
please tell me more

121
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:24,409
it's a place that doesn't exist on map

122
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,409
hey, what are you doing?

123
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,249
Don't you wanna know where I went?

124
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,244
Open the gate now!

125
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,083
What did you think I would do?

126
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,123
Alright

127
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,533
since neither of you believe me, leave now

128
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,248
I believe you

129
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,494
I want to know where you found this badge

130
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,206
please tell me, I beg you

131
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,949
many people have searched for him
for seven years

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,456
but we've found nothing

133
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,414
you were the only one who found something

134
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,489
so I want you to tell me more

135
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,957
as you said, it's been seven years

136
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,322
he'd be dead even if we found him

137
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,450
at least I'd have an answer

138
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,992
I won't give up until I find him

139
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,953
what if I told you

140
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,033
when I was there

141
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,700
I saw my wife who died five years ago?

142
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,583
Would you believe me?

143
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,032
Yes, I would

144
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,074
but what I say would sounds ridiculous

145
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,495
I don't want others to think I'm a lunatic

146
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,706
nam

147
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,032
It's an enchanted realm

148
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,365
it was a very foggy day

149
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,289
before I went into the enchanted realm,
I kept going on the same path

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,616
after god-knows how long, I finally left

151
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:16,705
but I couldn't locate myself on a map

152
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,289
and my compass doesn't work

153
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,039
I kept walking and walking

154
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:24,000
it must've been more than seven days

155
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,999
but it never got dark

156
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,533
I never got hungry or thirsty

157
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,953
I saw a lot of people walk by

158
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,125
hey

159
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:38,204
but they couldn't hear me at all

160
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,581
hey

161
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,875
hey

162
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:49,912
finally, I saw a beam of light

163
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,616
I walked towards it

164
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,618
And there she was, my late wife

165
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,241
as I was approaching

166
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,823
I came back out

167
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,582
I went back to the mountains a few times

168
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,303
but I couldn't get into the enchanted realm

169
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,040
how did you get in in the first place?

170
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,369
I have no idea

171
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,993
but I think it's a realm

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,161
that is fluid in nature

173
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,998
it doesn't have a fixed entrance or exit

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,197
and certain conditions need to be met
in order to get in

175
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,040
I'm still trying to figure it out

176
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,616
for the first few months
after my father went missing

177
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,365
I was at the mountains every day

178
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,351
but I never crossed into
the enchanted realm

179
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,787
I found his badge at the enchanted realm

180
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,659
if you couldn't get in,
you wouldn't be able to find him

181
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:51,908
so you're saying
that my father is in that realm?

182
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,205
Yes

183
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,873
enough

184
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,331
ying, let's go

185
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,618
this is absolute nonsense

186
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,039
let me ask you

187
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,537
are your dreams real?

188
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,998
Yes - why?

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,786
Because they feel real

190
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,699
but how can you quantify your feelings?

191
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,323
Do you have tangible evidence?

192
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,245
And the place you were in your dream

193
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,868
was it real?

194
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,413
A dream is a dream, what are you on about?

195
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:29,954
Ying, he's crazy

196
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:30,993
why are you still listening to him?

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,538
I guess it's time for this lunatic
to take his pills

198
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,248
both of you, leave

199
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,832
I beg you, please tell
me more about the realm

200
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,369
get out!

201
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,032
Let's go

202
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,207
ying, ying

203
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,539
it's been seven years

204
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,366
if he's really still alive,
he wouldn't be in the mountains

205
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,494
a badge doesn't mean much

206
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,206
can you be more rational about this?

207
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:01,873
He said he was up there for seven days

208
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,538
I've asked his family,
and they said he was gone for a few hours

209
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,328
he's a lying lunatic

210
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,996
the police weren't able to find anything
of his for the past seven years

211
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,621
but this so-called lunatic found something
that belonged to my dad

212
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,241
should I believe him, or you?

213
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,494
I want to find wah as well

214
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,860
but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna believe anything anyone says

215
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,489
I know you think this is ridiculous

216
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,286
but I choose to believe

217
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,578
at least there's a glimmer of hope

218
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,411
Slowly, be careful

219
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:45,455
don't worry, I can handle by myself

220
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,280
ching loves you,
that's why he hired a maid for you

221
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,408
why did you have to fire the maid?

222
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,623
That bastard kid

223
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,075
no, I've already submitted it

224
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,833
wait a second

225
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,948
sorry, Vincent

226
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,449
yes, it's at home, sorry

227
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,949
I'll submit it first thing tomorrow morning

228
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,533
ying ma, sorry for the trouble today

229
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,248
I'll hire a new maid as soon as possible

230
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,536
no worries, I was free today

231
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,283
I was just chatting with Mrs. mak

232
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,370
I'm fine now, why do I need a maid?

233
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,406
Mom...

234
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,829
You're not listening to me,
you're being unfilial

235
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,073
bastard kid

236
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,287
Sorry, I appreciate your help today

237
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,953
I'm off tomorrow, I can take care of her

238
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,207
thanks for letting me
store stuff at your place

239
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,368
don't mention it

240
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,703
alright, I should be heading back

241
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,789
- sure, I'll send you out.
- Okay

242
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:54,998
I'm off, Mrs. mak

243
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,706
- bye-bye.
- Bye-bye

ying

250
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:46,409
I was at Mrs. mak's place all day,
I didn't have time to cook

251
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,499
let's eat out

252
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,331
what about the caretaker?

253
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,832
Mrs. mak fired her

254
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,537
she's getting more and more stubborn

255
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,783
it must be so difficult for ching

256
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,073
Mom - hmm?

257
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,825
Someone found dad's badge in the mountains

258
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,533
Isn't that some kind of hope?

259
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,369
But did they find him?

260
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:57,830
Ying, why do you insist on being like this?

261
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,824
That's my father

262
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:04,991
you lost your father, I
also lost my husband

263
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,957
we have to move on

264
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,581
mom...

265
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,782
I'm going out

266
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,784
No one would believe you, but I believe you

267
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,783
remember that

268
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,243
Auntie?

269
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,996
My mom's asleep,
if you wanna listen to music, turn it down

270
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,706
okay, I know

271
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,583
Ying

272
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,829
why are you dressed like that?
Aren't we going hiking?

273
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:41,580
There's an extra ticket
for a band show tonight

274
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,993
don't be angry

275
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,745
don't band shows start at night?

276
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,663
Shouldn't I have dinner with
whoever treated me to this show?

277
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:55,114
I'm your dad, you should be hiking with me

278
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,661
go on, don't come back too late

279
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,786
here's a compass and a map

280
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:08,034
and a cell phone,
in case you need to call for help

281
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,621
those concert venues are really sketchy

282
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,117
you should bring it with you,
in case you need to call for help

283
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,708
hello?

284
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:23,958
Hey

285
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,369
where are we having dinner?

286
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,740
You decide

287
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,330
honey

288
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,993
bye-bye

289
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,535
Why?

290
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,494
Why are you here?

291
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,871
Come play with me, big sister

292
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,248
what happened to you?

293
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,250
Ying

294
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,159
when will you properly meet a guy

295
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,365
and bring him home for dinner?

296
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,828
You're not young anymore

297
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,783
you should think about your future

298
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,117
some people went missing
in sai kung recently

299
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,833
is that so?

300
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,581
Those people got what they deserve

301
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,226
said there were ghosts,
and went there for an adventure

302
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,083
nobody would know if they slipped and fell

303
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,403
did you look through my notebook?

304
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,290
Ying, it's been seven years

305
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,078
when can you let it go?

306
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,035
I want to ask you as well

307
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,079
how can you forget everything about dad?

308
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:09,999
Why did you not leave behind anything
he used to own?

309
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,082
And you put his picture
up there like he's dead

310
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,743
didn't I go searching for him?

311
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,457
If he wanted to come back,
he'd be back already

312
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,244
but someone found his badge

313
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:24,076
so do we have to go up
to the mountains every day now?

314
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,700
It's not been seven days, it's seven years

315
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,866
nobody asked you to go
up and search for him

316
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,408
if you'd rather he be
dead, I won't stop you

317
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,993
but you can't stop me

318
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,831
Hello, suet wing?

319
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,030
Miss sit, I just wanted to apologize

320
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,366
you've always been good to me

321
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,742
suet wing, I didn't take it to heart

322
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,621
my parents neglected me,
my classmates didn't like me

323
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,411
do you remember what I told you?

324
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:29,410
There will be people
who like you or dislike you

325
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,082
we can't satisfy everybody

326
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,869
nobody likes me

327
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,540
everything I do is wrong

328
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:40,581
even my parents don't want me,
you know how much they hate me

329
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,203
they don't hate you

330
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:48,908
I called to thank you for listening to me
all this time

331
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,540
you're the only person who treats me well

332
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,748
good bye, miss sit

333
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,991
hello, suet wing? Where are you?

334
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,702
Hello?

335
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,957

337
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,995
I've called the police,
they're on their way

Suet wing

339
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,789
- Hello?
- Hello?

340
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,198
Is it dad?

341
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,199
Ying? Is that you?

342
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,290
Dad, where are you?

343
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,035
Far away

344
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:56,203
there's nobody occupying these apartments

345
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,581
where do you mean?

346
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,164
- Hello?
- Hello?

347
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,624
- Dad?
- Hello? Can you hear me?

348
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,789
Is anybody there?

349
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,292
Hello?

350
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,789
Is anybody here?

351
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,740
Dad

352
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,115
is anybody there?

353
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,864
Dad, is that you?

354
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,412
Help!

00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,994
You're finally here?

372
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:01,035
This is not the place, follow me

373
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,573
We're here

374
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,579
What are you doing here?
You're not allowed in

375
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,662
sir, I'm a social worker

376
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,287
my client called me for help

377
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,117
you're so late,
we sent that girl to the hospital hours ago

378
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,823
hours ago?

379
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,914
I know her

380
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,033
oh right, I'll get back to work

381
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,740
ying, what are you doing here?

382
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,116
That's my client in there

383
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,380
she called me,
and I got here as soon as I could

384
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:03,703
don't worry, she's not in danger

385
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,617
but you don't look too well

386
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,573
I got lost just now

387
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,868
what are you talking about?

388
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,200
- Did you arrest that man?
- Are you okay?

389
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,698
There he was...

390
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,333
Ying!

391
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,536
Ying, are you okay?

392
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Mom?

393
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,409
Yes, Vincent

394
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:12,406
didn't you know there was a meeting?

395
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,281
What? Meeting?

396
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:13,906
Isn't that tomorrow?

397
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,282
Two o'clock on the 4th

398
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,956
yes, sorry, I...

399
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:20,874
Sorry, I'll be there soon...

400
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,864
Mom! How many times
have I told you not to wander around

401
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,331
it's very dangerous

402
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,032
there you are

403
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,700
you've been gone a month,
you didn't even call

404
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,700
did you spend all your money,
and now you're asking me for some?

405
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:56,705
Mom, I made you breakfast this morning

406
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,035
come on, let's go home

407
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,873
do you have any shame?

408
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,324
Mom, let's talk about this at home, okay?

409
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,493
There's a lot of people here

410
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,616
what cannot be said out here?

411
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:12,073
Are you afraid of people finding out
about your bad deeds?

412
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:17,322
You little bastard,
everyone you know are imbeciles

413
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,661
you only ever ask me for money

414
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:22,078
you talk back at me when you're at home

415
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,282
you're the best at acting

416
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,784
acting like such a good boy out here

417
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,999
it angers me to have a son like you

418
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,699
other people have children too,
none are as bad as you

419
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:36,826
you nasty little bastard,
I regret having you

420
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,578
you never do what you promised

421
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,869
I hate people who are fake

422
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,831
Killing without mercy

423
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,956
ying, you're awake

424
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,331
that man killed people

425
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:01,124
- you were only dreaming.
- It's real

426
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,867
that man was killed children
in the housing estate

427
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:09,621
I saw a beam of light,
just like the one the other guy said he saw

428
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:13,241
I went to the enchanted realm,
I really went in there

429
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,115
stop your nonsense, okay?

430
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,740
The doctor said you had low blood sugar

431
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,412
if you carry on like
this, you'll faint again

432
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,790
also, my father called me

433
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:24,282
he really called me

434
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:29,614
come on, why don't you rest for a bit

435
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:55,080
Yes, Vincent

436
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,039
hello, when are you
submitting the proposal?

437
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,038
I'm working on it now

438
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:00,579
you are rushing?
You're always rushing whenever I call you

439
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,743
the client is flying off tomorrow morning

440
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,287
I need some time,
I'll send it to you when I'm done

441
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,572
what kind of attitude is this...

442
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,370
- Son.
- What is it?

443
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,536
I'm hungry

444
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:13,744
I'll make you something later

445
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:27,953
How many times have I told you

446
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,199
don't bother me while I'm working

447
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,869
why don't you ever listen to me?

448
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,581
Are you trying to kill me?

449
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,164
Is the whole world trying to kill me?

450
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,577
Trying to kill me?

451
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,743
I'm giving everything up

452
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,741
to take care of you every day

453
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,417
Mr. ho?

454
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,200
I'm not available,
just put down the money and go

455
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,638
I think I've been into the enchanted realm

456
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,367
what about your police friend?

457
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,789
She doesn't believe me

458
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,578
it was very foggy

459
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,949
I kept trying to find my way

460
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:39,746
then I saw a man, slaughtering children

461
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,368
That's the enchanted realm

462
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,616
what you just said proves that I'm right

463
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,995
the enchanted realm appears in places
where violence was prevalent

464
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,948
just like...

465
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:09,407
I saw a group of Japanese soldiers
burying some villagers

466
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:16,617
the enchanted realm is a place
where time and space interlace

467
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:22,622
people in the realm will witness
deeds of injustice from the past

468
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:26,493
that's why you saw that
man killing children

469
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,991
did you tell the cops?

470
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,408
I'm not actually crazy, okay?

471
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:35,458
Wait a second

472
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,366
how did you get out?

473
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,123
I saw a beam of light, just like you said

474
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:54,530
The space that the enchanted realm occupies
is the same as the real world

475
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,373
it's just that the fluidity is different

476
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:01,989
there can be an enchanted realm right here

477
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,322
this can still be a mountaineering shop
in the enchanted realm

478
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,412
we're just not in there at this moment

479
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,374
just like parallel universes in films

480
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,161
here's a simpler metaphor

481
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,703
fluidity

482
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,912
same place, but one is going faster

483
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:24,578
and the other is going slower

484
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,916
but there will be times when they overlap

485
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,748
like the hour-hand and the minute-hand

486
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,162
one goes faster, and the other goes slower

487
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,998
but they overlap at times

488
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:41,328
and when they overlap

489
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,908
the entrance to the
enchanted real will open

490
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,664
and because of the difference in fluidity

491
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,784
the two worlds experience time differently

492
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,323
so seven days in the enchanted realm

493
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,415
was just a few hours in our world

494
00:40:58,792 --> 00:40:59,827
yes.

495
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,202
But it was the opposite for me

496
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,827
I was only there for a while

497
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,119
but when I got out,
it's already been a few hours

498
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,162
What symptoms did you experience

499
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,782
after you got out of the enchanted realm

500
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:19,080
I felt tired, so tired that I fainted

501
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,119
my friend sent me to the hospital

502
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,948
the doctor said that my blood sugar was low

503
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,994
what did you do in the enchanted realm?

504
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,490
After I saw the man kill the children

505
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,580
I kept on running

506
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:28,583
I get it now

507
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,073
I get it now

508
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,911
the time you experience
in the enchanted realm

509
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,996
not only will it be compressed,
but it can also be extended

510
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,072
which explains the how
I was able to spend seven days in the realm

511
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,495
without any food or water, and no sleep

512
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,412
because I wasn't hungry, sleepy, or thirsty

513
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,908
I thought I was in there for seven days

514
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,999
but it has only been a
few hours for my body

515
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,538
that's why I didn't feel sleepy,
hungry, or thirsty

516
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,331
with the same logic,

517
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,824
I was running for a while in there

518
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:05,916
but I've been running for hours
in the real world?

519
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:08,454
Right, do you know why?

520
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:11,905
You had low blood sugar
from excessive exercise

521
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,415
also, when I was in there

522
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:15,998
I received a call from my dad

523
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:19,659
does that mean he's in there somewhere?

524
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,619
That's possible

525
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:30,114
but that could also be his spiritual waves

526
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:36,531
I've also received a call
from my dead wife when I was there

527
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,822
so, there's hope in finding him?

528
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,663
- Yes.
- How do I get back in?

529
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,995
Do you hear weird noises sometimes?

530
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,743
Or see strange unexplainable things?

531
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,707
Things that only you can see or hear

532
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,708
and nobody else can feel?

533
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:15,407
That's it

534
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,411
but once I left

535
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,703
I didn't see these things again

536
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,454
now you have the key
to enter the enchanted realm

537
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,458
what does that mean?

538
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,032
It's magnetic fields

539
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,956
it's radio waves

540
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,949
you're able to receive radio waves
that others can't

541
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,367
I'm gonna need your help
with getting back in there

542
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,130
why do you want to
get into the enchanted realm?

543
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,157
We are the same

544
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,698
we're both looking for answers

545
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,035
Mrs. mak

546
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,452
ying, there you are

547
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:04,914
your mother left a bag at my place

548
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:06,157
come get it for her

549
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,375
sure

550
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:10,908
your mother is a Saint

551
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,999
she's always here taking care of me

552
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,911
but she's forgetful

553
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,207
she was too busy listening to music

554
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,660
listening to music?

555
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,115
Have a look

556
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:24,246
June 3rd, 1980,
chan kin sang, a 55-year-old man

557
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:27,830
heavily in debt, with mental disorders

558
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:30,791
tied up his three daughters,
all under ten years old

559
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,040
and killed them

560
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,123
and commited suicide by
falling to his death

561
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,323
why are you telling me this?

562
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,494
That case happened
at lai ching estate, room 1224

563
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,242
that's the same room
you said you saw the killing

564
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,786
back then, the neighours said

565
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,909
that the man kept on saying

566
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,917
"killing without mercy"
before he committed suicide

567
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,038
so the case happened 30 years ago?

568
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:07,374
I also looked at the cctv footage
in the building that day

569
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:09,203
and found some abnormalities

570
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:24,038
I've also checked that wah's phone
did make a call from sai kung that day

571
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,912
So I was really in the enchanted realm?

572
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,866
I refuse to believe any of it

573
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:39,748
then how would you explain this?

574
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:43,040
You saw a case from 30 years ago

575
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:47,080
because it was a projection
from your subconscious

576
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:51,121
there must've been a signal jam in the cctv

577
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:53,658
so it was footage from another elebator

578
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,823
what about the phone call?

579
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,874
The radio waves in sai kung are unstable

580
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:03,072
there might be an error in the data

581
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,494
so if you don't believe any of this

582
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,536
why are you helping me?

583
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:15,161
Wah taught me everything at the academy,
he was my mentor

584
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:24,998
He called me on the day he went missing

585
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:29,080
but I was on a case, so I didn't answer

586
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:32,617
so I've always wanted to know the reason
behind his disappearance

587
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,282
what I can do

588
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,200
is to follow every lead on this case

589
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,909
nam, I know you don't believe me

590
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,081
but can you help me one last time?

591
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:47,953
I've already helped you many 'last times'

592
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:51,539
when did I ever refuse?

593
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,791
A women went missing in the mountains
early this morning

594
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:03,535
the police speculates
that she fell off a cliff

595
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:07,831
this was the sixth disappearance from
the mountains in the past two months

596
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,073
according to information found on the scene

597
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:11,699
the lady who disappeared
is between 50-60 years old

598
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,322
son, it's been a while
since you've gone on a hike with your dad

599
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,912
let's go on a family hike together, okay?

600
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,491
Oh, sure

601
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,537
when you're free, tell your dad

602
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,914
when we were young, we
never went to the mall

603
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:34,245
we would always go on hiking dates

604
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,165
we saw a snake one time

605
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:44,039
your dad was a big guy,
but he was so terrified

606
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:47,707
I had to hold him the whole time

607
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:50,791
he's absolutely useless

608
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,037
but when has your father ever been useful?

609
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,698
Vincent?

610
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,870
No problem, it's all done

611
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:09,705
I've been working on this report
for three months

612
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,786
we're gonna secure the funding

613
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:18,166
no problem,
there will never be anymore problems

614
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,786
We're almost at the sharp peak

615
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,572
it's close to where wah went missing

616
00:50:58,333 --> 00:50:59,698
is anyone there?

617
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,198
Help me!

618
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:04,907
Did you hear that?

619
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,115
Is anyone there? “What is it?

620
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:08,208
It's dad

621
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:09,581
hey, ying

622
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:12,453
- help
- Ying, where are you going?

623
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:15,615
Don't run off

624
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,956
save me

625
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:21,243
- ying, stop, wait for me
- Is anybody there?

626
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,165
Help

627
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,491
ying, what's wrong?

628
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:31,827
It's dad

629
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:34,373
the sound came from here

630
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,414
did you hear it?

631
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,331
It's not here anymore

632
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:43,950
this is it, we're close

633
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:48,368
ying, you can't run off like that,
it's too dangerous

634
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,411
we can't lose each other

635
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,874
let's go back the way we came from

636
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,077
let's go

637
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:05,325
I can't do this, I want to go home

638
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,367
you wanted to reminisce the past

639
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,955
besides, the doctor said
you should go out more

640
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,698
did you forget that?

641
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:16,158
We didn't have to go so far

642
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:18,658
we're almost there, look

643
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:20,623
I'm really tired

644
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:39,036
It's beautiful, we haven't been here
admiring the view for a long time

645
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,248
then let's stay here for longer

646
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:47,830
we're so high up, it's so beautiful here

647
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:55,790
mom, I need to take a call,
there's no signal here

648
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,282
I'll be back real soon

649
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,873
Ching?

650
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,494
Ching, where are you?

651
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:41,906
You're a young child, I can't leave you

652
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:43,908
ching

653
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:45,828
ching

654
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,369
mom, mom

655
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,456
I'm right here, it's okay

656
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:53,450
mom, it's okay, I'm right here

657
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,832
everything's fine, everything's fine

658
00:53:57,583 --> 00:54:01,246
there were some eagles flying by

659
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,999
like they were looking for prey

660
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,414
Mom?

661
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,823
It's all your fault

662
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:32,875
brought me here to god
knows where, what now?

663
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,533
Mom, let's go back home

664
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,699
people are going to laugh at me

665
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,868
then let's wait until your pants dry, okay?

666
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,956
But I feel really uncomfortable like this

667
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,456
then you decide, are we going or not?

668
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,578
Don't talk to me like that

669
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,207
just leave if you want

670
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:56,033
but watch your tone

671
00:54:57,292 --> 00:54:58,292
I'm sorry

672
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,207
you're sorry... that's
all you know how to say

673
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:03,540
you forget all about it when you wake up

674
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:05,452
that's enough, mom

675
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:10,623
do you think I'm annoying?

676
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,206
What did I teach you?

677
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,617
You need to be courteous and be considerate

678
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:18,534
I'm gonna get your dad to scold you tonight

679
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:20,112
dad has been dead for three years

680
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,659
you unfilial bastard,
cursing your father's death

681
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:27,284
I knew you were nasty all along,
yelling at me all the time

682
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:29,123
I wish I never gave birth to you

683
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:36,455
I constantly have to
care about your feelings

684
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,287
I'm already pushed to the brim at work

685
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:41,704
and you're like this at home

686
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:45,200
I'm exhausted

687
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:48,291
dad has been dead for three years

688
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:50,408
it's three years

689
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:52,533
don't mention him again

690
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:54,498
he's not coming back

691
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,412
wake up, can you hear me?

692
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,205
Mom?

693
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:21,748
Mom?

694
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:25,667
Mom?

695
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,956
Mom?

696
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:12,077
Wait a second

697
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:14,074
I remember passing by this place

698
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:28,079
I've put a ribbon here with a marking

699
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,332
if we see this ribbon again

700
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:35,076
then it'll prove
that we're repeating the same path

701
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:36,789
where are we now?

702
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,536
Check your phone

703
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,866
- There's no signal.
- Me neither

704
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:11,661
- Hello?
- Hello, nam is that you?

705
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:14,494
We've been searching for
you for a long time

706
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,742
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have left you behind

707
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,581
nam

708
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,198
there's no sound

709
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,364
there was no signal at the housing estate,
but I got a call

710
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:30,870
I can tell you now that we've
already entered the enchanted realm

711
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,992
shut up! Nothing has changed

712
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:35,792
let's go

713
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:40,655
don't worry, I'll prove that I'm right

714
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,453
Right, we're repeating the same path

715
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,574
this is it, this is the enchanted realm

716
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:18,074
the housing estate was the same,
I kept going on the 17/f

717
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:20,869
according to my experience

718
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,457
something is about to happen

719
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,750
Ching?

720
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:44,282
Ying

721
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:46,039
ching, what are you doing here?

722
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,583
I was hiking with my mom

723
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:53,167
where's Mrs. mak?

724
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,912
I got a call from the office

725
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,331
I couldn't get a signal

726
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,745
so I went somewhere to get a better signal

727
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,911
but when I returned after the call,
she was gone

728
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:05,908
then I got lost

729
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:09,205
don't be afraid, we're also lost,
and we're looking for a way out

730
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,208
let's go together

731
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,664
- Go on, go on.
- Help

732
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,203
I thought you were the man

733
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:32,782
I thought you were the man

734
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,786
now you need someone to save you

735
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,582
police, let go of the man

736
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,162
help

737
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,206
let go of her

738
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:51,618
let go of the girl!

739
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:52,910
Otherwise I'll shoot

740
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:58,366
a few guys going after a girl, you cowards

741
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,911
I'm saying this one more
time, let go right now

742
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,744
otherwise I'll shoot

743
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:06,120
stop your nonsense, you're ruining the fun

744
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:31,530
Double homicide in 2011

745
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:36,783
the two victims were the model couple

746
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:40,823
male victim chan chi yuen,
was a champion athlete

747
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:43,495
female victim wong ching
yi, a gifted student

748
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:47,784
the three killers were their classmates

749
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,948
nam, are you okay?

750
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:58,955
I was investigating this case
when I was fresh out of the academy

751
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:02,499
wah was in charge of this case

752
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,831
because of jealousy

753
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:08,450
they used hiking as an excuse

754
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,699
to lure them into the mountains

755
01:02:18,542 --> 01:02:22,114
He said he was forced to go up
to the mountain by three boys

756
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:27,035
the court couldn't convict him
due to lack of evidence

757
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:30,287
I was the one who let him walk free

758
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:34,576
aren't you a star athlete?
Come and save your girlfriend

759
01:02:57,667 --> 01:03:01,205
- Everybody had enough fun?
- I'm done, let's go

760
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,039
The murder happened on June 5th

761
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,369
today is June 5th

762
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:19,533
I went into the enchanted
realm two days ago

763
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:22,374
that murder case happened on June 3th

764
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:25,416
it was the same day, I get it now

765
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:27,869
so the gate to the enchanted realm opens

766
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:31,072
on the same day the murder takes place

767
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:32,948
cool

768
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,914
what realm? What are you
guys talking about?

769
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:38,370
I need to get out of
here, how do I get out?

770
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:40,331
Get out? I don't know
what you're talking about

771
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,870
realm? What enchanted realm?

772
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:43,875
Tell me

773
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:49,157
a beam of light is the exit
of the enchanted realm

774
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:52,000
but whether we can find it is up to chance

775
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:54,953
let's go, let's find the exit

776
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,161
but I still haven't found my dad

777
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,662
we're dying here, let's go

778
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:02,783
can someone tell me what's going on?

779
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:06,200
Stop asking questions,
just stick together if you want to leave

780
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:07,698
let's go

781
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,573
come on

782
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:32,292
Ching

783
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:38,914
Ching

784
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,832
ching, are you okay?

785
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,661
I'm okay, let's keep going

786
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:03,874
We've finally left the forest

787
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:08,328
ying, come on

788
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:12,748
wanna leave?

789
01:05:18,042 --> 01:05:22,206
Ching, you'll be sent to prison
if you get out of here

790
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,208
why don't you stay?

791
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:26,536
Mom, mom

792
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:33,374
just say the word
if you don't wanna take care of me

793
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:36,079
why did you have to push me off the cliff?

794
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:40,490
Turns out I've raised you
to become a murderer

795
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:44,534
did you know that unfilial children
will be punished?

796
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:47,579
Did you think you can get away with this?

797
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:50,999
You've left a lot of
evidence in the mountain

798
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,081
the police are gonna arrest you

799
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:55,032
enough, shut up

800
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:56,208
shut up

801
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:57,375
ching, what's wrong?

802
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,829
Calm down, let's talk about this

803
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,434
it's a hallucination,
I've entered the enchanted realm

804
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,494
none of this is real

805
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:15,750
No, don't hurt yourself

806
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:29,080
I understand
why so many strange things are happening

807
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:31,081
look

808
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:37,159
it doesn't hurt, there's no blood

809
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,953
it doesn't hurt at all

810
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,244
I must be dreaming

811
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:48,249
this would only happen in a dream

812
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,706
It doesn't hurt, there's no blood

813
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,911
then I know how we can get out

814
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:03,580
if we die in the dream,
we can get out of here

815
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,073
- come on, give it a try.
- You...

816
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,074
Give it a try, come on

817
01:07:07,417 --> 01:07:10,284
come on, give it a try

818
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,414
I'm telling you to give it a shot

819
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:15,157
put the knife down

820
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:16,532
take the shot

821
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:18,917
shoot me

822
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,740
this is a dream

823
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,242
I'm not afraid, shoot me

824
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,240
there's no blood

825
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,083
I'm not bleeding, it doesn't hurt

826
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:34,157
I'm all right

827
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:39,873
did you hear that? This isn't real

828
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:43,287
this isn't real

829
01:07:48,292 --> 01:07:49,998
Killing your mother is not enough

830
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,240
now you're killing another person

831
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:53,410
shut up

832
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:56,199
you won't be bored
even if you spend your life in prison

833
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:58,533
I'll come and find you every day

834
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:01,032
you were a burden when you were alive

835
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,033
you're just as annoying after you're dead

836
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:07,118
you deserved it,
I would've killed you ten times over

837
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,740
killing who?

838
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:12,079
They all witnessed you murder someone

839
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,573
you can't get away with this

840
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:20,913
who saw it? Who saw it?

841
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:25,489
This is a dream, I'm not afraid of you

842
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:28,658
I'll kill whoever witnessed it

843
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:32,284
I'll kill whoever witnessed it

844
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,913
drop the knife, otherwise I'll shoot

845
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,365
you all have to die

846
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:40,331
you all have to die

847
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,164
Ching

848
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:06,582
I've discovered something else

849
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:14,119
I've been stabbed here,
it doesn't hurt and I'm not bleeding

850
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:18,994
but I know that my body is bleeding
in the real world

851
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:23,033
and I've lost a lot of blood

852
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,414
Honey

853
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,118
honey

854
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,116
I've always wanted to ask you one thing

855
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:45,074
why did you have to jump?

856
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:48,158
You were my everything

857
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:50,783
but you only ever focused on yourself

858
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:53,078
was my existence important at all?

859
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:57,498
I'm sorry

860
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:00,827
I'm sorry

861
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,574
Ying, we have to get out of here

862
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,125
let's go

863
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,248
Come on

864
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,573
That's the exit

865
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,407
come on

866
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,911
be careful

867
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:59,159
Aren't you here searching for your father?

868
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:00,748
Let's go, ying

869
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,787
you went through all this trouble
getting here, now you're going?

870
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,955
Is anybody there?

871
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:07,788
Help

872
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:08,372
dad

873
01:11:08,417 --> 01:11:09,782
it's a hallucination

874
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,198
I really saw my dad

875
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,910
it's not real

876
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:16,364
the neighbour, and the murders aren't real

877
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:18,328
why don't we get out of here right now?

878
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:19,873
Let's go

879
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,915
I'm here for my dad,
now you're telling me to leave?

880
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:24,243
I don't care, you're coming with me

881
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,082
if you can't get out,
what's gonna happen to your mom?

882
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,241
Your father is dead

883
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:36,829
I don't care, I just need an answer

884
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,948
if you're so afraid, you go ahead

885
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:41,374
I'll leave when I find the answer

886
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,916
Don't be scared, it was a long
time ago, daddy is right there

887
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,118
- Dad.
- Stop right there

888
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,867
Did you think you can redeem yourself
by staying single?

889
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,618
It's too late

890
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:40,079
did you know how heartbroken
your mother was?

891
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,706
She lost her husband

892
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:45,871
and she had to live with a sinner
like you everyday

893
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:51,119
if you came up hiking with me that day

894
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:57,787
I could've gone home,
I wouldn't have been here for seven years

895
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:02,539
because of a decision you made,
I can never go back

896
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,332
and I can never see your mother

897
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:07,618
I'm sorry

898
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,744
don't tell me you're sorry

899
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:11,789
ask yourself of all your sins

900
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,370
you made your mother lose her husband

901
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:18,791
and you killed your brother
with your own hands

902
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:30,575
Ying, it's time for dinner

903
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,664
Honey

904
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:47,497
are you okay?

905
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,740
Honey

906
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,290
- don't move, don't move
- It hurts

907
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,281
let me see that

908
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:54,203
- I can't.
- It's gonna be okay

909
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:58,747
- it hurts, the baby...
- It's okay

910
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,369
because of you

911
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,369
I lost a son

912
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:10,080
because of you,
there is no one to carry the bloodline

913
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:14,530
your brother can never come into this world

914
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:17,746
all this happened because of you

915
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:22,246
you killed your brother 30 years ago

916
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,207
you killed me 7 years ago

917
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:29,741
are you still seeking redemption?

918
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:33,040
Yes, I want to seek redemption

919
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:35,286
as long as you're gone

920
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:37,078
you can't hurt anyone around you

921
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,992
and people around you don't need to suffer

922
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,244
as long as you die

923
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,413
you can stay here with us forever

924
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:49,623
as long as you die

925
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:52,583
you can compensate for everything

926
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:01,915
this place is better than the real world

927
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:05,000
here, you don't feel pain when you die

928
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,574
isn't it so tiresome being alive?

929
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:10,620
Just cut in there, and you'll be free

930
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:14,322
sister, don't be afraid, it won't hrt

931
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,619
Ying?

932
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:46,620
Mom, I killed my little brother

933
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,539
don't think this way

934
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:54,708
remember, no matter how
hard we try sometimes

935
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:59,700
we cannot control the outcome

936
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:02,829
if I wasn't carelessly playing around

937
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:05,700
you wouldn't end up like this

938
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:13,322
we cannot control
the outcome of a lot of things

939
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:18,493
but we can control how we deal with it

940
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:24,660
you're still young,
it's okay if you don't understand

941
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:30,285
you'll understand when you're older

942
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:49,371
Remember you refused to
eat when you were young

943
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,491
you said eating would make you grow

944
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:54,198
you're afraid of growing up

945
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,324
and we won't love you anymore

946
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,037
we were at the park, walking by the river

947
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:04,996
you saw your own reflection
in the river, and you said

948
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:09,079
there was another 'you' inside the river

949
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:10,998
and you wanted to save her

950
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:18,873
It's okay if you couldn't find me

951
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:23,701
as long as you can find yourself,
you understand?

952
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,536
Miss... are you okay?

953
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:37,622
Miss, are you okay? Miss

954
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:39,616
she fainted, call the police

955
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:05,705
Ying, you're finally awake

956
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:13,832
Have I been gone for long?

957
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:18,414
I told you not to wander around,
you're making me worry

958
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:25,204
mom, I'm sorry

959
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:28,915
I won't wander off again

960
01:20:58,167 --> 01:21:01,330
I never found out
whether my dad was in the enchanted realm

961
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:05,579
but I'm gonna stop fixating on this

962
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:08,829
because I've found the answers
I was looking for

963
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:14,825
I've never been back on
the mountain ever since
