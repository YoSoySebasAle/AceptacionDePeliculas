"Magnum P.I"...

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:05,994
My one redeeming quality in
this life is that I've always

3
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:07,821
tried to be a father figure to you.

4
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:09,719
Man, I was surprised
when you called.

5
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,129
I didn't think you
were up for parole

6
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:12,957
for another 18 months.

7
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,263
You'd be surprised how far

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,657
a charming personality will take you.

9
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:19,921
How long? Couple of months.

10
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,966
Doc says it's stage IV cancer.

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,578
I'm gonna enjoy every
bit of life I got left with you.

12
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,132
My visa's expired.

13
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:29,219
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Well,

14
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:30,586
I haven immigration lawyer

15
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:31,515
who's working on it.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,618
Well, you know, you can always
overstay your visa.

17
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:36,024
- You have 180 days.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,460
And 171 days ago,

19
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:38,945
that might have been an option.

20
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,041
- Everything okay?
- My immigration lawyer.

21
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:44,094
He filed an emergency appeal,
but it was denied.

22
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,273
And, 'cause I overstayed
so long,

23
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:48,415
there is a chance that
they'll deny me entirely.

24
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,384
Which means I'll be
moving back to London.

25
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:21,325

29
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:51,664
Okay, s-steady, boys.

30
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:52,752
Steady.

31
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,754
Steady.

32
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:56,104
No, no, no, Magnum,
you're doing it all wrong.

33
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,409
How can I be doing it wrong?

34
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,758
I-I haven't even done anything.

35
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:02,240
Dogs have a pack mentality,
Magnum, right?

36
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:04,634
In every pack,
there is an alpha.

37
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,027
The alpha has the first

38
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:07,854
and the last say;
you need to be commanding

39
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,987
and lose all the emotion
from your voice.

40
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:10,988
- Right?
- Okay.

41
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,946
Whatever you say, Master Yoda.

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,861
Sorry,
I-I don't get the reference.

43
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:16,298
Not a Star Trekfan.

44
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:19,433
Star Trek?
You got be kidding me.

45
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:21,041
Yes. Of course I'm kidding you.

46
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:22,608
That was a test,
which you failed

47
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:23,949
because you're still being
too emotional.

48
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,735
Now be... the... alpha.

49
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:28,508
Okay.

50
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,835
- Apollo.
- Magnum,

51
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,010
that is Zeus.

52
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:34,142
Surely, you can tell them apart.

53
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:35,491
Of course I can't.

54
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,232
What did I say
about being too emotional?

55
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:39,886
Okay, okay, okay.

56
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,237
Zeus... sit.

57
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,195
No, too late.Okay.

58
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,849
Ea-Easy, boys,
easy. Heel! They sense your indecisiveness.

59
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:46,980
Heel.

60
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:47,981
Okay, which is it, Magnum?

61
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:49,113
Is it sit or is it heel?

62
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:50,506
Do they even know
the difference?

63
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,939
Do you?

64
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:55,337
And don't roll your eyes,
Magnum.

65
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:57,078
How can you even see that
from over there?

66
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,819
I don't need to see it,
Magnum. I know you. Now focus.

67
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:02,257
I need to know that you
can look after the lads

68
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,301
whilst I'm in London.

69
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:05,173
Okay, you know what?

70
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,000
Listen to me, you two maniacs.

71
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:08,263
I've had enough of this crap,
all right?

72
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:10,221
I am tired
of you guys terrorizing me.

73
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:11,309
All right?
I'm the alpha.

74
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:12,183
I'm the alpha,

75
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:13,964
and you're gonna do
exactly as I say.

76
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,097
And right now,
I command the both of you...

77
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:17,526
to sit!

78
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,516
It worked.

79
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:30,415
Oh, my God.

80
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:32,136
Higgins!

<i>♪ So on everything

82
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,339
Hold on.

83
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:42,800
You met a woman
in the cancer ward?

84
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:44,455
Not just a woman, Teddy.

85
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,849
An angel.

86
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,765
Look at you,
you old hound dog.

87
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,115
How did this happen?

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,910
I don't know. We were
just the only two patients

89
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:53,222
not distracted by our cellphones,
so we started talking,

90
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,378
and two hours later,

91
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:56,128
we're still at it, and ended up

92
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:58,088
grabbing a bite in the café downstairs.

93
00:03:58,173 --> 00:03:59,356
Wow. That's amazing.

94
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,081
Yeah, we got plans
for next week.

95
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:04,493
We are going skydiving.

96
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,059
Ha! Ooh!

97
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,365
Hold on, hold on.

98
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,543
You realize
how dangerous that is?

99
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,111
Oh, how dangerous can it be?
What's the worst

100
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:11,809
that can happen,
man... my chute doesn't open?

101
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:13,206
I'm dying

102
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,817
of terminal cancer, boys.

103
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,864
I'm checking out either way.

104
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,854
Ice, that is not funny.

105
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,683
All right,
I'll-I'll be right back.

106
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,467
I got to hit the head.

107
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,472
You know, I know
the odds aren't great, but...

108
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,519
I'm glad he decided
to fight this thing.

109
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:30,606
Yeah.

110
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,175
What are you doing?

111
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,263
Just a little digging.

112
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:36,742
Ice has been acting weird
lately.

113
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:38,222
Plus, he's never had a cell.

114
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,397
A cell phone?

115
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:41,190
Now, that is
suspicious.

116
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,456
Don't mock me, all right?
I can tell something's up.

117
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,426
Ice never has had a cell phone,

118
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:47,847
even when most guys in prison
had burners.

119
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:49,896
Hmm.

120
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,542
- What is it?
- It's a text chain

121
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,428
with some number
I don't recognize.

122
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,154
Ice is meeting up
with somebody tonight.

123
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:59,069
Well, it's probably the woman
he was just talking about.

124
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:00,723
Nah, not the way
they're texting.

125
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:01,941
This is a guy.

126
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,421
Ice could be up to something.

127
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:04,944
He's probably just meeting up
with some dude

128
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:05,776
to hang out.

129
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:08,693
Kind of like
we're doing right now.

130
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,119
Yeah.

131
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,749
Ooh, yeah.

132
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,091
Everything good?

133
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:16,308
Yeah. You ready
for another Coops?

134
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:18,007
Yes, sir. I gotcha, buddy.

135
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,378
Well, this doesn't look
suspicious at all.

136
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:07,773
What the hell
you doing here? You know,

137
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:09,534
I could ask the same
of you, pal.

138
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,667
How'd you find me?
I made sure I wasn't followed.

139
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:14,274
I put Friend Finder on your
phone at the bar earlier.

140
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,408
Friend what? What-what
the hell is that?

141
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:19,304
It's an app. You can track your
friends' movements, you know,

142
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,004
in case they decide
to do something stupid.

143
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,915
Now it's your turn.
What's going on?

144
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,011
A score.

145
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,754
I'm hitting up a warehouse
over at Pearl City with a guy.

146
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,019
- You out of your mind?
- Look, it's an easy pinch, man.

147
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:32,717
I'll be in and
out in under 20.

148
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,633
Nobody gets hurt.
It's a no-brainer.

149
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:36,549
You just got out.
You want to go back in?

150
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:37,907
This is none of
your business, kid.

151
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:40,144
You're family...
that makes it my business.

152
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,712
Rick, I love you, man, I do,
but I'm doing this thing.

153
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,478
So you either turn me in,
or you get in that car,

154
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:47,913
you drive away...
Only two options here.

155
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,485
Okay.

156
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:55,492
Give me a hug first,
just in case.

157
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:57,143
All right.

158
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,710
Come on, man.
All cool.

159
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,712
All right. Be safe, okay?

160
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,189
Always.

161
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,425
Very smooth, kid.

162
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,933
Learned from the best.

163
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,413
Give 'em back.

164
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,972
Eh, you know I can't do that.

165
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,122
Knock it off, Rick.

166
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:19,737
I'm already late as is.

167
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,867
Why? Just tell me that. Why?

168
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:25,652
I got this friend,

169
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,828
he needs somebody
to hold his hand.

170
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,003
So why has it got to be you?

171
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,309
Guy had my back in prison.

172
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,311
Ice,
you're a 63-year-old man with lung cancer.

173
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,226
You haven't had a score since the '90s.

174
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,793
You're gonna get caught.

175
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,098
I know what I'm doing.

176
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,534
Ice, it's taken me long enough

177
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,232
to accept the fact
that you're sick.

178
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:41,712
All right? The only way I can cope

179
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,105
is by enjoying the time
that we still have left.

180
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,750
So hell no, you're not getting
these keys back.

181
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,701
Damn you, kid.

182
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,661
All right.

183
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,381
All right, what?

184
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,163
All right, you win.

185
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,647
You're a stubborn
son of a bitch, you know that?

186
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,649
I learned that from you, too.

187
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,826
Come on,
I'll give you a lift home.

188
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:13,831
It's gonna look bad,
me backing out like this.

189
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:15,528
Come on. You're Icepick.

190
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,266
You're a legend.

191
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:20,040
Your reputation
can take a hit.

192
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:22,401
Yeah.

193
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:39,421
I've been working
every angle I can think of

194
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,641
to keep Higgins in Hawaii,
but time's running out.

195
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:44,165
A few days from now,
she'll be on a plane to London.

196
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:46,357
She says she'll be back,
but who knows?

197
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,248
Could take a while
for this whole visa thing

198
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,431
to get sorted out.

199
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,042
A lot can happen
between now and then.

200
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:52,434
Maybe she'll change her mind,

201
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:54,523
decide London is
where she ought to be.

202
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:55,873
Maybe she'll meet someone.

203
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:57,483
One thing seems certain,
though:

204
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,224
it looks like
I'll be without a partner

205
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:01,313
for the foreseeable future.

206
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:04,055
On the plus side, I'm getting
two dogs that hate me.

207
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:09,016
Thomas Magnum.

208
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,844
Hey. It's Adam Noshimuri
with Five-O.

209
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:12,237
Tani Rey gave me your number.

210
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,021
Yeah. Thanks
for getting back to me.

211
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:15,370
Of course.

212
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,371
Tani fill you in?

213
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,851
She did.
And I reached out

214
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,548
to an immigration attorney
I know.

215
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,986
He's hooked up a few yakuza
with legit papers.

216
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,292
He says
there might be one option,

217
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:27,208
but it's a long shot
and very expensive.

218
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,209
Legal?

219
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:29,123
As far as I know.

220
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:30,690
He didn't get into details.

221
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,562
Look, I'll text you his contact
info so you can follow up.

222
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:35,477
Great. Yeah, much appreciated.

223
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,305
No problem.
Hope it works out.

224
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,956
Aloha.Aloha.

225
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:41,919
An expensive long shot.

226
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:44,399
Doesn't sound very encouraging,
but it's something.

227
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,966
Gonna need some help, though.

228
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,403
Good thing I know someone
with deep pockets.

229
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,231
Hey, Robin.

230
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,761
It's me.

231
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:03,364
Ice?

232
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,192
Ice?

233
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:09,444
Ice, I know you're in there.
Come on.

234
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,182
We got to talk!

235
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,091
Ice, I'm coming in.

236
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:19,161
Ice?

237
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,302
Ice!

238
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:23,568
Oh, man.

239
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:24,907
Hey, kid.

240
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,193
You lied to me...

241
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:27,412
You went through
with it anyway.

242
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:28,935
Yeah, I should've listened
to you, man.

243
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,328
The whole thing went sideways.

244
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,895
Yeah, no kidding.
It's all over the news.

245
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:33,549
They're saying you guys
killed a security guard. Not me.

246
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,377
No, man, not me.
My-my... my partner.

247
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,336
- You know he was gonna do that?
- No, of course not!

248
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,834
Son of a bitch popped the guard,
then turned the gun on me

249
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,255
before splitting with the cash.

250
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,551
- I was lucky to get away.
- That looks bad.

251
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,866
- I got to get you to the hospital.
- No. No, no hospitals.

252
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,913
You're gonna bleed out.

253
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,042
Then let it bleed out.

254
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,304
I'm getting your ass
to the hospital,

255
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,392
you're gonna tell
the cops what you know.

256
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:52,959
Ricky, Ricky, forget it!

257
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,439
You were there.
You know who the killer is.

258
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,788
I'm not turning myself in.

259
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,051
I didn't kill nobody
and I didn't steal nothing.

260
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,966
Ice, you got to do something.

261
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:02,663
I am not gonna spend what time
I got left in a cage.

262
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:04,970
Besides, I tell Five-O everything I know,

263
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,622
you're gonna end up
there with me.

264
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:21,161
What happened?
Whose blood is that?

265
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,076
Icepick's.Is he okay?

266
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,251
He's alive.

267
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,036
Listen, I-I need your help.

268
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,690
You heard about that
warehouse that got hit

269
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:28,995
in Pearl City last night?

270
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,563
Yeah, I-I saw it on the news.

271
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,431
Icepick was there.

272
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,263
Well, you got to tell HPD.

273
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,351
I can't.

274
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,658
Rick, someone died last night.

275
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,269
I know you guys are family,
but this is... Magnum,

276
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,357
it's about more than that.

277
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,185
Look,

278
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,623
I knew it was going down.
I saw Icepick last night.

279
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,626
So you knew about it,
and you didn't do anything?

280
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,628
No, I got in his face,
I told him he couldn't do it.

281
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,455
I told him to turn around
and walk away.

282
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,632
Hell,
I thought he did. I gave him a ride home.

283
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,721
- And he still went through with it?
- Yeah.

284
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:01,452
You were with him last night,
you had advance knowledge of it.

285
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,388
Considering your relationship,

286
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,696
they're gonna think
you were involved.

287
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,524
That's why I'm here.

288
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,831
If I go to the cops,
we could both end up in prison.

289
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,176
But there's a killer on the loose.

290
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,656
Somebody's got to catch him.

291
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:14,084
And I'm sorry to put
you guy sin this position,

292
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,599
but I don't know
who else to turn to.

293
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,861
Look, Thomas, I need your help.

294
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:32,155
Sorry about the blood.

295
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,333
There's some pain medication
in the cabinet next to the fridge.

296
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,553
I didn't want
to come here.

297
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:38,114
Rick insisted on it.

298
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:39,330
It's just as well he did.

299
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,912
Tell us about your partner.

300
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,564
His name is Adrian Reese.

301
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:46,741
We were in Halawa together.

302
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:49,561
He was getting out,
he had a score lined up,

303
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:50,527
wanted to pick
my brain about it.

304
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:52,181
I figure, "I ain't going anywhere, so..."

305
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:53,748
So you gave him your take on it.

306
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,838
For a roll of commissary stamps
and a pack of smokes, yeah.

307
00:12:56,922 --> 00:13:00,406
But then, I got out early, and

308
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,365
I figured,
"What the hell? I'll hit up Reese,

309
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,802
and maybe he wants
some company."

310
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:06,630
Where do we find this guy?

311
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:10,419
I wouldn't know.

312
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:11,940
Is there any information
you could give us?

313
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,927
Any detail that might help?

314
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:16,031
No.

315
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:17,510
Come on, there's got
to be something.

316
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:18,990
Ice, think.

317
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,731
There's a guy lying dead
in the morgue because of us.

318
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:21,993
What are you talking about,
"Because of us"?

319
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:23,299
I didn't see you there.

320
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:24,866
I should've stopped you. Come on, Rick.

321
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,172
You know you had
nothing to do with this.

322
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,779
No, I should've stayed with him,
made sure he didn't go back.

323
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,177
Instead, I trusted you.

324
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:36,181
Yeah, well, then you
didn’t learn what I taught you, kid.

325
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:38,836
- What's that?
- Never trust a crook.

326
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,446
Yo.

327
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,839
Yo, I got your message.

328
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:44,015
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

329
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,931
All right, anything
you need, I got you.

330
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,890
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

331
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:50,718
- Thanks, TC.
- I'm here for him.

332
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:52,154
If you didn't have
a hole in you,

333
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,721
the two of us
would be having words.

334
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,331
You're a good friend.

335
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:56,636
Like you should've been?

336
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,203
Look, my boy could go down

337
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,075
- because of what you did.
- All right, TC, just...

338
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,554
take a breath.

339
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:03,252
No, he's right.

340
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:06,081
I got myself into this.

341
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,996
I'm the one
who's got to make it right.

342
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,214
Where do you think you're going?

343
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,563
To find Reese.

344
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,914
Yeah, that's not happening.

345
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:15,177
Magnum's right.
You're in no fit state to go anywhere.

346
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:16,569
You need to stay here

347
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,920
till you get your strength back.

348
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:21,006
Let us do our job.

349
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:28,625
What's this about?

350
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,583
Our client thinks this guy Reese
might be the father

351
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:34,283
of her child,
so we need to find him and collect DNA.

352
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,285
Well, you need a
court order for that,

353
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,939
unless you plan to raid
his trash in search

354
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:40,593
of a half-eaten sandwich
or some used dental floss.

355
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,248
Right now, we're just focused
on, uh, tracking him down.

356
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,943
He's gone off grid.

357
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,255
I can let you look at the file,
but you can't take it with you.

358
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,428
Deal.

359
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,698
Here he is.

360
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,785
All right. Thanks.

361
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:06,318
Hey, listen, I just want to say
I'm sorry to see you go,

362
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,191
but I think you made
the right decision.

363
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,365
I appreciate that.

364
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,755
I hope this one doesn't give
you too much grief while I'm gone.

365
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,843
Heard that.

366
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:13,912
Let me know when
you get settled.

367
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,307
I'm thinking about taking my
son to Europe for summer vacation.

368
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:18,092
- Maybe we'll look you up.
- Oh, yeah,

369
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:20,466
you absolutely have to.
I'd love to show you around.

370
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:23,857
Okay. It looks like our guy
Reese has a bunch of aliases.

371
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:26,552
Okay, well,
that's a good place to start.

372
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,164
All right. Thanks, Gordon.
Owe you one.

373
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,248
Just one?

374
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:33,020
Cheerio.

375
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,174
Hey, when you're back
in London, you don't mind

376
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,916
if I ask you to do stuff
like this for me, right?

377
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,875
Hmm. If I said I would mind,
would it stop you?

378
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,572
Probably not.

379
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:49,445
And besides, I figure
it's the least you can do,

380
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:52,796
considering you're kind of
bailing on our partnership.

381
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,539
I'm sorry, but that is not my choice.

382
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,933
Is that why you've been
avoiding me this whole time?

383
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:01,413
- 'Cause you think l'm abandoning you?
- I'm not avoiding you.

384
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:03,068
You've been on the surf ski
three times a day

385
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:04,375
since I told you I was leaving.

386
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,375
- Well, I like to surf-ski.
- No one likes paddling that much, Magnum.

387
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,224
Okay, I take it back.

388
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:17,341
You're not bailing
on me. I just, um...

389
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:21,369
I'm disappointed
that you're leaving.

390
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:25,775
So am I.

391
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,186
Hey.

392
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,747
Anything yet?

393
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:31,922
We're working on it.

394
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,576
How's Mr. Hofstetler?

395
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,794
He's, uh...
he's sleeping.

396
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:38,630
What's going on?

397
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:40,110
Robin's coming to Hawaii.

398
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:42,451
I told him it wasn't necessary,
that we could

399
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:45,107
deal with the particulars
of my exit over the phone.

400
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,666
I-I don't think that's it.

401
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:50,242
What do you mean?

402
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,217
Well, I talked to a guy
from Five-O, and he said

403
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:55,880
he may know a lawyer
who can help out with this,

404
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,275
but it-it's
very expensive,

405
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,052
so I asked Robin
to look into it.

406
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:01,733
I wish you hadn't done that.

407
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:02,701
Why not?

408
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:04,615
Because Robin’s already done so much for me.

409
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,054
Yeah, you didn't ask
him to do anything. I did. And besides,

410
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,229
it's a long shot.

411
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:10,101
Uh, almost zero percent chance

412
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:12,235
that it's
gonna work.

413
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:13,777
What is it?

414
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:16,781
I don't know, but
Robin said that, um,

415
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,173
if it doesn't work, he still
wanted to say goodbye.

416
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,118
That's very thoughtful of him.

417
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:25,076
Yeah, well, that's Robin.

418
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,084
You know, I'd like
to throw you a party

419
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,389
before you go. Uh,

420
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:30,783
assuming I'm not in jail.

421
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,151
Thank you, Rick.Yeah.

422
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,366
Why don't you go home,

423
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:40,022
take a shower
and maybe check in on the bar?

424
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,155
Uh, no, I'm-I'm okay.
I'll stick around.

425
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,637
Rick, seriously,
go take care of yourself.

426
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:45,052
We've got this.

427
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:49,132
All right. Well, uh,
call me if you find Reese.

428
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,554
I feel bad for him.

429
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,857
Shouldering the weight of this problem.

430
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:00,555
He shouldn't blame himself.

431
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:04,428
I don't think it's that.
I-I just think he feels like...

432
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:06,082
Icepick betrayed him.

433
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,983
Well, he's not wrong.
I mean, if it were me,

434
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:09,520
I don't know
that I would protect him.

435
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, I don't think
I would, either.

436
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,889
But it's complicated.
I mean, without Icepick,

437
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:16,788
Rick probably would've ended up
on a very different path.

438
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:19,095
Rick feels like he owes him.

439
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,053
Yeah.

440
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:24,056
Oh. I have something.

441
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,623
Reese used one of his aliases

442
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,495
to check
into the Honua Lani Inn.

443
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,276
Then let's head over there.

444
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,052
But, uh...

445
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,943
But, um, this is the
picture of the guy.

446
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:42,117
216.

447
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:44,555
Promise me you won't use
that fake badge when I'm gone.

448
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,731
This little piece of tin
opens a lot of doors, okay?

449
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,080
So that's a no?

450
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:49,865
It-it helps me do my job.
Asking me not to use it

451
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:52,563
is like asking Steph
Curry not to use his jump shot.

452
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:55,087
A jump shot... - Yeah, we have basketball
in England, Magnum.

453
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,177
The door's been busted open.

454
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,712
Mr. Hofstetler.

455
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:12,627
He ain't here.

456
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,803
We must've just
missed him.

457
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,108
You lied to us.

458
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,067
Yeah, well, I didn't
want you more involved

459
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:19,503
than you already are.

460
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:21,897
So you were just gonna execute
a man in cold blood?

461
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:24,073
He didn't hesitate to pull
the trigger on that guard.

462
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,553
Last night could've been a clean score,

463
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:26,858
but that wasn’t good enough for Reese.

464
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:28,982
No, no, he wanted
to have it all for himself,

465
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:31,080
and he didn't want
to leave any witnesses.

466
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:34,826
20 years ago,
I never would’ve trusted a guy like that.

467
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,162
Because I did...

468
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:39,815
you're all in a fix now.

469
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:42,254
Maybe you can
still do some good.

470
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,156
Tell us what you know about
Reese so we can find him.

471
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:46,920
Yeah, then what?

472
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,010
Then we turn him in.

473
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:49,960
Figure out some way to
keep you and Rick out of this.

474
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:51,448
Man, you don't get it.

475
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,904
I don't want
to put him back behind bars.

476
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:56,810
I want someone
to stick him in the ground.

477
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:59,888
It's the only way you stop a man like that.

478
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:02,219
He's evil.

479
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:05,505
Even if you are right,

480
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:08,549
that's not what Rick
wants us to do.

481
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:16,299
Hey, boss. Yeah?

482
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,311
- There was a guy in
here looking for you. - Who?

483
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:20,444
He didn't leave his name.

484
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,566
He's sitting in the booth over there.

485
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,532
All right, thanks.

486
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:35,797
Funny. I've been
looking for you.

487
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,102
Walk.

488
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,227
Walk. All right.

489
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:44,036
Where's the car?

490
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,716
Take it easy.
It's the Porsche.

491
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,186
Good. Let's go for a ride.

492
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,711
Okay. Where do you want to go?

493
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:50,492
You're gonna take me
to Icepick. Let's go.

494
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,971
If he moves off that sofa,

495
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:20,843
shoot him. You got it.

496
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,757
<i>♪ Oh, girls</i>

497
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:26,152
<i>♪ They want to have fun.</i>

498
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:28,473
Rick.

499
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,672
Okay. We're on our way.

500
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:36,313
We got to go.

501
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:44,170
Okay,
I know it doesn't look like it,

502
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:46,259
but I swear I got in
some pretty good shots.

503
00:21:46,343 --> 00:21:48,522
- Yeah, sure, you did.
- I did, seriously.

504
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:51,438
- And I believe you.
- It doesn't sound like you do, Theodore.

505
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:52,875
Guys, please.

506
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,094
What did he want?

507
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,053
He wanted to finish what
he started with Ice.

508
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:59,142
Yeah, dude must've seen
coverage of the robbery,

509
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:02,188
heard that there was only
one dead body instead of two,

510
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:03,276
knew he messed up.

511
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,538
Yeah, well, if he's hunting Icepick,

512
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,976
it's only a matter of
time before he finds him.

513
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,716
I'm more concerned
about you at the moment.

514
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,717
I'm gonna be fine.

515
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,110
Maybe now you are.

516
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:12,895
But Reese knows that
you can link him to that heist.

517
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,200
He's gonna want you dead, too.

518
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:15,941
Ah, he's got the money. If he was smart,

519
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,812
he'd get off this rock
while he still can.

520
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:20,076
If he was gonna do that,
he would've done that yesterday.

521
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,426
Think he's more concerned
with tying up loose ends.

522
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,906
You sure?

523
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,342
It sounds risky.

524
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,257
I guess it's better than
looking over your shoulder

525
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:28,345
for the rest of your life.

526
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:29,433
We don't have a choice.

527
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:30,608
We have to bring
the fight to Reese.

528
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:32,479
We have to find him
and take him down

529
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:33,959
before he gets to Rick
and Icepick.

530
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:35,134
You guys got any leads?

531
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:36,744
None of Reese's other aliases

532
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:39,138
from HPD panned out,
but Icepick did mention

533
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:41,010
another name
he's been using.

534
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,359
Carl Brewer.

535
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:43,664
We're looking into it now.

536
00:22:43,748 --> 00:22:45,144
All right, well, I'm
staying here with Orville

537
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:46,319
until this whole
thing's over.

538
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,625
I don't need a bodyguard.

539
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,493
- I'm staying.
- He's staying.

540
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:01,378
I don't know you too well,

541
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:03,206
but the way
you're looking at me,

542
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,991
feels like you might
want to use that thing.

543
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:08,556
Believe me, I'm tempted.

544
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:11,910
No one was supposed
to get killed.

545
00:23:11,994 --> 00:23:13,477
Given your experience,

546
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:16,132
you had to know
that was still a possibility.

547
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:18,830
I've been on the inside
for a long time.

548
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:22,355
Being on the prowl...
That's... it's what I do.

549
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:25,656
I couldn't resist
one last score.

550
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,776
I really didn't want anyone
to get hurt.

551
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,082
Uh-huh.

552
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:31,886
What about Rick?

553
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:33,622
What about him?

554
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,193
He's like your son.

555
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:37,066
You're supposed to protect him.

556
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,371
I always have.

557
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:40,069
Best I could.

558
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:41,548
Until now.

559
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:43,681
You put him
and everyone I love in danger.

560
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:45,467
And for what? Money?

561
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,728
You only care
about yourself.

562
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:50,209
Should be ashamed.

563
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:52,078
I am.

564
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,526
Wasn't about the money, though.

565
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,135
Then why'd you do it?

566
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,896
I haven't got that long left.

567
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:02,560
I just wanted to

568
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:05,913
feel like... it used to.

569
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:09,750
I needed something
to make me feel alive again.

570
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:12,536
Really, really alive.

571
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,318
If only for
just one night.

572
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:19,409
Figure what have I got left
to lose?

573
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:23,112
You had Rick.

574
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,937
Wasn't that enough?

575
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,601
It should've been.

576
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,435
I guess I've been lying to
myself about being at peace.

577
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,826
Truth is...

578
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:50,136
...I'm not ready
to die just yet.

579
00:24:58,535 --> 00:25:01,411
- Anything on Carl Brewer?
- Yeah.

580
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:05,067
Reese actually used that
alias to get a cellular data plan.

581
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:06,894
Oh, okay. Score one for Icepick.

582
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:08,766
- Mm-hmm.
- Ping the phone yet?

583
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,203
Why is it, everything that
comes out of your mouth is a query?

584
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:13,205
What? I'm driving.
You're laptop-ing.

585
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:14,904
Laptop-ing?

586
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:16,781
It's just not my thing.

587
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:18,644
Firstly, "laptop-ing" is not a word.

588
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:21,300
And secondly, you really ought
to make it your thing, Magnum,

589
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:23,172
if you're gonna continue
your business without me.

590
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,956
Well, maybe you can teach me
before you leave.

591
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,914
I have days, Magnum, not months.

592
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:28,960
And as to your query, I can't ping

593
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,744
Mr. Brewer's cell phone
because it's dead.

594
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:32,877
But according
to his cell phone records,

595
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:34,487
he did call one number

596
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:37,490
more frequently than most,
and that belongs to a...

597
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:39,101
Leon Yates.

598
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:41,103
Leon Yates.

599
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:43,017
Name sounds familiar.

600
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:46,061
Could you pull up the news
coverage from the robbery? Uh-huh.

601
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,678
Leon Yates

602
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:53,762
was the armed guard who
was killed during the heist.

603
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:56,944
Seems he wasn't such an
innocent victim after all.

604
00:25:57,028 --> 00:25:58,772
No, he's more like
an inside man.

605
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,252
Which would explain
how Reese knew

606
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,341
that there was a safe
full of cash in the warehouse.

607
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:03,734
Yates have any family?

608
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:05,518
Says here he was survived
by a girlfriend...

609
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:07,216
Cynthia Lloyd in Kalihi.

610
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,389
Maybe she knows something.

611
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:31,977
Ms. Lloyd?

612
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:33,443
Yes?

613
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:35,620
- I'm Jan Hawks.
- This is Travis McCoy.

614
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:37,506
We're investigating
the warehouse robbery

615
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:39,987
on behalf of its insurance company.

616
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,474
We're very sorry
for your loss.

617
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,868
We heard your
boyfriend Leon

618
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,568
was a very dedicated
security guard.

619
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,559
Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

620
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:48,126
Do we have to do this now?

621
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:50,780
We understand
it's a difficult time for you.

622
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:52,522
Generally, in these circumstances,

623
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:54,263
it's better to move quickly.

624
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,156
We'll only take a minute.

625
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,245
Thank you.

626
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,419
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

627
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:04,587
I, um...

628
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:06,590
I just don't know
how I can help.

629
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,115
For starters, you can tell us

630
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,701
if you recognize this man.

631
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,107
No. I've never
seen him before.Okay.

632
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:22,068
So, you, uh... you
live here alone, huh?

633
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:24,155
Just me.

634
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:28,297
This is, um,

635
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,602
you and Leon, huh?

636
00:27:29,686 --> 00:27:30,908
Looks like

637
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:32,475
Wailua Falls.

638
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,300
Last Christmas.

639
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,092
Thank for your time.

640
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:44,226
We're very,
uh... very sorry for your loss. Jan.

641
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,315
We'll call you if we
have any more questions.

642
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,664
Our sincere condolences.

643
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:49,474
Can't let you leave just yet.

644
00:27:56,698 --> 00:27:57,830
Lock the door.

645
00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:06,060
Look... we mean no disrespect.

646
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:07,541
We're just working
for our clients.

647
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,500
Clients, right.

648
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:10,807
Friends of Rick.

649
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:12,138
Looked him up online.

650
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,599
Saw a press conference,
you guys got back from the sandbox

651
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:15,586
few years ago.

652
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:17,020
P.O.W. heroes.

653
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,521
Okay. You got me.

654
00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:24,912
But this doesn't
look like a hostage situation.

655
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,438
On a hunch, I'd say these two

656
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,735
had something going on
behind Leon's back.

657
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,522
So, what, you use Leon,

658
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:34,865
stab him in the back,
and then steal his girl?

659
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,257
Not in that order, but yeah.

660
00:28:38,408 --> 00:28:39,408
What do you want?

661
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,345
You're gonna call your buddy.

662
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:42,833
You're gonna bring him

663
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:44,702
and the old man down
here, and if you don't,

664
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:47,179
it's lights-out
for old Mary Poppins here.

665
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:54,520
Thomas, what's up?

666
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:55,695
Good news.

667
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,069
We got a lead on Reese.

668
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,176
Yes. I love you guys.

669
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,699
Seriously, Mai tais for life.

670
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:01,179
Or any other beverage
of your choosing.

671
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:02,745
What's wrong with Mai tais?

672
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:04,878
I'm just saying it's not your
best cocktail, that's all.

673
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:06,184
And you're just now telling me this?

674
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:07,446
Eh, Kammy said it, too.

675
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,664
Kammy said it? Rick, listen,

676
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,101
I think we have a way
to draw him out,

677
00:29:10,185 --> 00:29:11,232
but we're gonna need
Icepick's help.

678
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,668
Do you think he's up for it?

679
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,366
Yeah,
of course. Anything to get this guy.

680
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,019
Okay, uh, great.

681
00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:18,283
I'm gonna need you to be my QRF,
just like in the Korengal.

682
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,632
But, uh...

683
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,155
I'll shoot you the address
in a second.

684
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,375
- Yeah. Yeah, you got it.
- All right.

685
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,156
Thanks.

686
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,901
- That was weird.
- Right?

687
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:31,861
QRF?
We were his primary unit.

688
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:34,212
Yeah, and we didn't have
a QRF in the Korengal.

689
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:35,952
That's the whole reason the
Talis were able to grab us

690
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:37,171
when Hannah sold us out.

691
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:39,521
Thomas is sending us a message.

692
00:29:39,698 --> 00:29:41,094
He and Higgins are in trouble.

693
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,267
Yeah.

694
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:52,320
So, what happens
when they get here?

695
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:55,576
- Kill all four of us?
- Or five.

696
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:57,398
She's a witness, too.

697
00:29:57,483 --> 00:29:58,705
Wha-What?

698
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,207
Don't listen to 'em, babe.

699
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:01,413
They're just messing with your head.

700
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:02,648
Another workout of you,

701
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,169
last words you ever say.

702
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,558
Gordon. Save it.

703
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,654
Your pal Icepick is going
down for murder one,

704
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,391
and you helped
cover it up.

705
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:25,694
That makes you an accessory.

706
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:27,432
I get that.

707
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,963
You could face charges.

708
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:32,748
I know. We don't really have
time for that right now.

709
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,794
Yeah, he's right.
Let's just get our friends back

710
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:36,630
and worry about the rest later.

711
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:43,408
Stay on comms.

712
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:49,545
And these are to be
used only if necessary.

713
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:53,688
Sure you don't want
to give me the bigger gun?

714
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:55,730
Just follow me.

715
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:06,942
Reese is armed. He's got Thomas,
Higgins

716
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,131
and the homeowner
in the living room.

717
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:09,613
But there could be
other hostiles

718
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:11,262
in there I can't see.

719
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:14,660
Make the call.

We're on our way.

726
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,063
Should be there
in about ten minutes.

727
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:29,211
Okay. See you soon.

728
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,896
All right,
it's go time. You got two entry points,

729
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:35,676
- front and back.
- Copy that.

730
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,362
Front door.

731
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,298
- There's someone out there.
- Son of a bitch!

732
00:31:53,803 --> 00:31:55,329
Gordon!
He hit my vest.

733
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,290
Go get him.
Go get him.

734
00:31:58,328 --> 00:31:59,547
Don't move!

735
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,132
Terrific.

736
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:15,735
Magnum!

737
00:36:15,285 --> 00:36:16,318
You okay?

738
00:36:16,403 --> 00:36:18,004
Yeah.

739
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,638
How did you know
I wasn't gonna go flying

740
00:36:20,723 --> 00:36:21,888
off the top of that thing?

741
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,284
I knew you'd do something.

742
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:24,894
How?

743
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:29,551
Because after two years,
Magnum, I think I know you.

744
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,691
Better late than never, I guess.

745
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:53,400
Mind if I have a moment?

746
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,850
You got a minute.

747
00:36:56,837 --> 00:36:58,186
Hey.

748
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:02,018
Listen, I'm sorry
for everything, kid.

749
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,672
I know you are.

750
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:07,942
I was just, uh, scared
of wasting away.

751
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:10,029
Looking for one last thrill.

752
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:13,812
I should've gone skydiving.

753
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,605
Hey, look,

754
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:18,600
I don't want you
to feel bad for me.

755
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:21,342
I lived my life
the way I wanted to.

756
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:24,684
And most parts,
I'm... I'm proud of,

757
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:27,123
other parts not so much.

758
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,124
But the part that
had to do with you...

759
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,879
...I'm most proud of that.

760
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:38,305
'Cause you turned out
to be one hell of a man.

761
00:37:55,895 --> 00:37:57,813
And always be grateful for them.

762
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:00,254
Family.

763
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:03,424
That's all we got... in the end.

764
00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:08,411
I'll see you soon.

765
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:09,817

Higgins is leaving today.

772
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,343
I did everything I could
to keep her here.

773
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,694
I'm not sure if there was
anything else I could've done.

774
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:55,697

00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:56,996

Try not to be too hard
on him, all right?

781
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:22,766
I know it doesn't look like it
from the outside, but

782
00:39:22,851 --> 00:39:25,375
he can be quite fragile.

783
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:35,467
That being said, do give him
a nick once in a while,

784
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:36,912

Looks like Robin made it.

795
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:30,789
He's up at the house.

796
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:36,013
So, I guess this is it.

797
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:39,148
Actually... it's not.

798
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:41,977
Turns out I don't ha veto leave after all.

799
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:44,105
What do you mean?

800
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:48,723
Robin met with the attorney, and together

801
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:50,638
they resolved my visa status.

802
00:40:50,722 --> 00:40:53,942
It's all taken care of.

803
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:56,208
So you're not going?

804
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,471
Uh, you want me to?

805
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,602
No.

806
00:40:58,686 --> 00:41:00,340
Not at all. I'm just...

807
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,994
...surprised.

808
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:06,172
What did they do?

809
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:08,960
It turns out,
there's this obscure law in the book

810
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:13,225
that says if you own a
company that’s valued at $500,000

811
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:15,401
and you have at least five employees,

812
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:17,094
then you're entitled to a visa.

813
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:20,051
Yeah, but you don't have that.

814
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:22,054
No. No, I don't.

815
00:41:22,275 --> 00:41:24,019
But, uh...

816
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:27,413
...thanks to Robin, I now do.

817
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:29,915
I still don't understand.

818
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:36,463
Robin's just signed over
full ownership of his estate to me.

819
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,032
You now own Robin's Nest?

820
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,671
Yes. And all of its contents.

821
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:48,869
And with employees like
Kumuas cultural curator and,

822
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:52,482
well, you as security consultant,
amongst the others,

823
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:55,891
I'll be allowed to retain my
legal resident status.

824
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:58,460
So, technically,
we now work for you?

825
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,405
Well, yes, I mean,
there's no "technically" about it,

826
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,493
actually, Magnum.

827
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:06,191
You and all the other employees

828
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:07,977
are now on my payroll.

829
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:10,331
Okay.

830
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,515
How is this gonna work?

831
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:18,089
That remains to be seen.

832
00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:21,814
Anyway, best not keep Robin waiting.

833
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:24,596
You know,
I'm not sure l like this new setup.

834
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:26,774
Well, Magnum, you kind of
only have yourself to blame.

835
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,669
You were the one that put
this whole thing in motion.

836
00:42:28,753 --> 00:42:30,755
I didn't know this
was gonna happen.

837
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,594
What about the Ferrari?

838
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:34,816
Oh, the Ferrari?

839
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:38,255
Yes, well, technically,
that's now mine.

840
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:40,661
You know, I think
I might rechristen it.

841
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:42,880
Higgins 2. What do you think?

842
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,235
I hate it.

843
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,195
Ah, reckon I will, then.
