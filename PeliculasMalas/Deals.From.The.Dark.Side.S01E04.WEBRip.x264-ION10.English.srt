1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,239
- That is so rare

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,899
and that I've gotta have.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,730
Eight!

4
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:05,571
- Eight, we have eight, I'm at eight,

5
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,396
now nine, ninety, nine

6
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,229
- Thirteen.

7
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:08,842
- Thirteen, $1300.

8
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,040
- What the hell?

9
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,029
This thing here was called a face puller.

10
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,110
Isn't that awesome?

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,769
My name is Steve Santini.

12
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,629
I buy and sell the darkest, most gruesome

13
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,819
artifacts on the planet.

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,247
Welcome to the Dark Side.

15
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:54,068
Whenever I'm in this area, I
like to drop into Jim's store.

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,570
There's no telling what
I'll find with each visit.

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,979
Everybody comes in and
they know and they think

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,719
they're gonna get something for nothing.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,019
I can't get them for nothing

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,590
and I'm not selling them for nothing.

21
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:10,519
- Oh, hey, check that out.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,480
Titanic.

23
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,779
- That's pretty cool.

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,750
Check this out.

25
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:14,790
- What's that?

26
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,105
I've seen these before.

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,269
It's a locking collar.

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,100
- Yeah.

29
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:19,693
- It's an antique iron
collar with a built-in lock.

30
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:22,149
You see, the thing is,
these things show up

31
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,040
all the time at auction.

32
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,010
People think they're slave collars,

33
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,632
but they're actually dog collars

34
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,389
and they've sold for thousands of dollars.

35
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,619
- Morning!

36
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,600
- Morning!
- Good morning, sir!

37
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,159
- Jim, been a while.

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,140
How you doing?

39
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,970
- Pretty good.

40
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:34,811
- Yeah?

41
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:35,636
- You?

42
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,889
- Good, hopefully better in a few minutes.

43
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,958
Well, I found this old dog collar.

44
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,935
Kind of wondering, you
know, what you want for it.

45
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:45,629
- Put $425 for this.

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,950
- Can you do any better?

47
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,871
- You just want things too
damn cheap, that's all.

48
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:50,690
- What's the best you can do, Jim?

49
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:52,997
- $325

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,619
- How about $125

51
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,060
- Oh no, that's ridiculous.

52
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,570
No, no, no, get your
numbers up there a bit.

53
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,969
- My final offer $150.

54
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,850
- No.

55
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,489
- Give me your final best.

56
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,410
- Two and a quarter.

57
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:09,837
- $175.

58
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,131
- $200.

59
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,636
- $180.

60
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:14,927
- $205.

61
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,860
- You're going up!

62
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,145
I know.

63
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:19,886
Trying to get you to realize
that it's worth money.

64
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:21,487
- $190.

65
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,320
- Five.

66
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,209
- $195.

67
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,040
- Deal.

68
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:28,612
- Haggling with Jim is
a pretty humbling experience.

69
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:31,150
Every time I come here, he beats me down.

70
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,188
- Those packages going out or coming in?

71
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,587
- No, those are going out.

72
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,489
That's the human jaw
bone and the lead cross.

73
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,379
- Ah, from the plague pit, right on.

74
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,120
- But, you know what I do
have for you coming in?

75
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,564
- Ah, incoming is always good.
- Checks!

76
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,159
Historic jail exhibit check.

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,099
I think this is one of the titanic ones.

78
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,379
- Yeah, it's an exhibit
I designed for them.

79
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,579
- I spoke to a woman on the phone

80
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,439
and she has a Victorian
cat o' nine tails for sale.

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,270
- Awesome!

82
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:03,111
- She said that we could come by

83
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:03,936
and take a look at it.

84
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,219
- Well, you know
that they're very rare?

85
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,349
So, if it's real, I mean, I'd pick it up.

86
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,529
I'm not holding back.

87
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,410
- You wanna go take a look?

88
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,410
- Oh, yeah, absolutely!

89
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:12,369
Hey, I'm off to the bank.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

90
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,119
You have to take your daughter Shayna out

91
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,109
to buy her dress for this dance.

92
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,829
You've been avoiding it and
you can't avoid it any longer.

93
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,759
- For me, I collect torture stuff.

94
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,719
Going to a mall is torture.

95
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,149
- She wants her daddy there.

96
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,639
- She wants her Daddy's wallet.

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,610
- But, you have to go.

98
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,360
- Tell you what, if I'm
going, you're coming, too.

99
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:31,908
- All right.

100
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,099
- But first, I need to check out

101
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,370
these cat o' nine tails.

102
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,790
Oh man, what the hell?

103
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,810
- Welcome to the playroom.

104
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:41,302
- I mean, this is wild.

105
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:42,777
Check out these tables.

106
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,709
Okay, hey, so you're a dominatrix, right?

107
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,629
- Retired, which is why
I'm selling this stuff

108
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,430
and I thought you'd like these things

109
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,155
that are rather dark.

110
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,378
- What's the story with this table?

111
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,529
It looks pretty old.

112
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,950
- This is a 1950's operating table.

113
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:03,304
People died on this thing, side
rails held the arm pieces. -

114
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,105
- It's sickening.

115
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,010
- And, this one right here.

116
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:08,399
I don't know it's just me,
but I'm getting a deeper,

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,019
darker vibe from this one.

118
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,249
- This came from a turn of
the century women's asylum.

119
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,699
- A psychiatric hospital.

120
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,149
- Like a sanatorium.

121
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,319
Women were tied to this thing.
- No way.

122
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,849
- If you woke up with a headache,

123
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,079
your husband could send you there

124
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,369
for as long as he wanted back then.

125
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,629
- You know, at the risk
of sounding old fashioned,

126
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,920
I kind of like that idea.

127
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:26,587
Just kidding, just kidding.

128
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,609
This is great.

129
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,809
I came for something else.

130
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,649
Stef tells me you have an
1800's prison flogging whip.

131
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,500
Can I see it?

132
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,480
- Yeah.

133
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:38,379
- Whoa, that's awesome.

134
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,189
That is incredible and it's ancient.

135
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,839
- It is a Victorian-era British
prison cat o' nine tails

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,770
for beating the convicts with.

137
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,529
- Do you know how rare these things are?

138
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,629
They were often destroyed

139
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,649
because the prison system
didn't want to admit

140
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,379
that they'd used stuff like this.

141
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
- Yeah, you're correct.

142
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:57,719
- This cat o' nine tails
flogging whip is amazing.

143
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,079
It's a staggering find.

144
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,910
Hey Rob, come here for a second.

145
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:00,751
- What?

146
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:02,816
- You often wonder how
prisoners felt back in the day

147
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,958
when we're researching this stuff.

148
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,785
- Yeah.

149
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:05,618
- Well, you're gonna get to find out.

150
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:06,701
You're in good hands.

151
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:09,020
- You're so evil, so evil.
- This is gonna be great.

152
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,872
- Yes, I am and I'm going to
be loving every minute of this.

153
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:13,769
- I really don't know about this, guys.

154
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,600
- I do.

155
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:17,099
- Oh, Jesus!

156
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,606
- No more coffee stops!

157
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:21,607
- Oh, Jesus!

158
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:25,401
Now I know what it feels like.

159
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,409
- Oh, nice!

160
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,449
Right on, I enjoyed every second of that.

161
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,089
I've gotta get down to business here.

162
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,240
What's your price?

163
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,596
- I'd like $1600.

164
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,567
- $1600?

165
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:44,572
Oh man, I was thinking somewhere
along the lines of $! 200.

166
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,979
I'm gonna put this in an exhibit

167
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,919
that I'm gonna put together
and assemble and tour

168
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,549
of ancient justice instruments.

169
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,639
I have to keep the cost down

170
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,889
because I have to make the money back

171
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,820
by admissions as this tours.

172
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,332
- But, if you own it a long time

173
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,510
and exhibit it often, then
you will make money on it.

174
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,967
$1600.

175
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,119
- Nah, you know what?

176
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,639
I'm really stuck at 12.

177
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,079
- I'm stuck at 16.

178
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,319
- Really?

179
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,529
You know what, I hate to
say this, because I likely

180
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,069
will never see another one in my life,

181
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,939
but, you remain the custodian of the whip.

182
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,770
- You sure?

183
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,282
- Yeah, I've gotta stay at 12, thanks.

184
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,009
Carolyn ran a really hard bargain,

185
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,439
so I took a big chance
and walked for the door.

186
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,270
- Wait.

187
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,639
- You'll take 12.

188
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:26,545
- No, 13.

189
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,019
- I'm not gonna quibble over $100.

190
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,959
I've been after one for ten years.

191
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,229
Done, $! 300, thank you so much.

192
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,060
- Nice, nice.

193
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:36,901
- That's awesome.

194
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:38,866
- I'm really satisfied with
the price I paid for this

195
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,499
and, truth be told, I probably
would have paid a lot more.

196
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,399
The last authentic one of
these I saw selling at auction

197
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,209
went for over $4000.

198
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,540
Today was a great day!

199
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,749
Stewart McLaughlin in a prison officer

200
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,669
from Wandsworth Prison in the UK.

201
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,909
He's also the author of
several prison-related books

202
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,159
and, actually, I got very
lucky that he was in town

203
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,429
and made time to meet with me.

204
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,789
When I inquired what the oral history was,

205
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,609
that this is a British
prison flogging whip

206
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,079
that was used on inmates for
infractions or punishments.

207
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,489
What do you think?

208
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,159
- Looking at this piece,
it's not like any official

209
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,409
cat o' nine tails that I've seen

210
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,129
in any archive or museum.

211
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,249
It's certainly not
something that would have

212
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,780
been used in a British prison

213
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,714
in pre-1870.

214
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,459
The handle itself is way too short.

215
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,339
- As bit by bit, Stewart stripped away

216
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,049
everything I believed about this whip.

217
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,349
I mean, the measurements were wrong,

218
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,230
the history was wrong.

219
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:41,539
It wasn't a prison cat.

220
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,749
I mean, I started to feel
like a bit of an ****.

221
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,999
I'd paid money on this, my own
research, my own knowledge.

222
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,450
It wasn't right in this case.

223
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,729
- But, I know, in
British in penal colonies

224
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,399
around the globe,

225
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,409
the smaller version of the cat,

226
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,479
certainly serves as the boy's cat.

227
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,619
- Something like this.

228
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,859
- Could be something like this.

229
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,019
I think you're probably
looking at something

230
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,050
which may even be mid-1800's.

231
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,809
- Stewart pointed out that
this was actually used

232
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,259
for flogging prisoners.

233
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,449
Maybe not in British prisons,
but in penal colonies.

234
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,999
This is still a rare piece
and it's possibly earlier

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,450
than I ever thought it was.

236
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,859
- Hey, Steve.

237
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,690
- Yeah?

238
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:24,759
- You're gonna be happy.

239
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,590
- Oh?

240
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,293
- I got your invite to
the annual invite-only

241
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:29,039
Dark Relics Private Auction.

242
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,279
- Yes, once a year I wait for this.

243
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,159
- And, I printed you out pictures.

244
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,529
- Awesome.

245
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,259
Knee restraints.

246
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,090
- Oh, I like that.

247
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:40,043
- Spiked arm bracer to cleave
in someone's face with.

248
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,369
- Look at that!

249
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,559
- Oh man, that looks
like an antique coffin.

250
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,629
- It looks Victorian, maybe.

251
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,520
- Yeah, I'd say about the 1800's.

252
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:47,579
- That is awesome.

253
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,410
- You know what?

254
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:49,491
I'd look great in here if I could win it

255
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:50,452
because you know who else go after this.

256
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,679
- Oh money bags.

257
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
- Yep, it's always the way.

258
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:54,969
If I want it, you know it's gonna happen.

259
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,189
- Yeah, anything you want, he'll want.

260
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,020
- Yeah.

261
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:58,632
This guy I call Money Bags.

262
00:08:58,633 --> 00:08:59,839
He's a new guy on the scene,

263
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,329
collects the same stuff that
I do and has got deep pockets.

264
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,399
He really pisses me off.

265
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,558
- And, he has more money than you, so.

266
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,389
It's true.

267
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:10,134
- You're fired.

268
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,949
I want to know if this cat o' nine tails

269
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,809
was ever used on human beings.

270
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,879
So, I'm having a blood test done on it.

271
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,429
- Interesting
thing about blood stains

272
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,809
is that often at a crime scene,

273
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,439
they're washed out or bleached

274
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,069
and thankfully, these
chemiluminescence agents,

275
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,118
they allow us to see what is not there.

276
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,859
Would you mind turning
off the light please?

277
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,690
- No, certainly.

278
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:33,533
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

279
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,216
Finger's crossed, here we go.

280
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,769
Okay.
- There it is, saw it.

281
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,247
- You see it?

282
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,307
Wow!

283
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,988
Check it out and over there, too

284
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,509
and, look at the one
strand, it's dripping down

285
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,849
in three drops.

286
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,329
- It's lighting up a like a neon sing.

287
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,160
- It is.

288
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:51,589
Look at that; It's insane.

289
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,869
Now we just have to find
out if it's human blood.

290
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,800
Can we do that next?

291
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,320
- Yes, that's the next
test we're gonna do.

292
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:57,595
Okay.

293
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,828
- This is the moment of truth, I mean.

294
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,419
That was a lot of blood.

295
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,679
Man, this is awesome.

296
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,809
We always believed this
was a flogging whip

297
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,739
for human beings and this
could be it right here.

298
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,349
- I'm gonna put my sample with blood on it

299
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,519
in the container.

300
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,350
- Okay.

301
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:16,292
- And, once again, snap it off,

302
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,369
close it back up again,

303
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,500
shake it all up.

304
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,730
- Finger's crossed.

305
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,399
One line is the control.

306
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
- One line is the control.

307
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,059
- And second line is...

308
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,970
- Second line to
see if it's human or not.

309
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,939
What do you see?

310
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,520
- Two blue lines!

311
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,109
That's amazing.

312
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,689
This was used to draw blood.

313
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,550
- Yes.

314
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,550
- That's incredible!

315
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,629
Wow, thank you so much.

316
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,039
This cat o' nine tails tested
positive for human blood

317
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,409
and that's amazing,

318
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,999
but I still don't know
where it was used and when.

319
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,649
I'm gonna take it to another expert,

320
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,619
but first, my 13-year
old daughter is going

321
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,309
to her first major
school dance with a boy.

322
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,529
I'm not exactly excited
to be here dress shopping

323
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,490
with her, but it's gotta be done.

324
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,899
One-hundred and 50, 200 bucks.

325
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,429
This one I love.

326
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,330
Ta-da!

327
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,260
How about this?

328
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:13,480
It's like 100 bucks;
It's got good coverage.

329
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,550
- This is nice.

330
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:16,393
- No!

331
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:17,816
Look at how short the skirt is.

332
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,650
No way.

333
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,299
- Whoa, sexy.

334
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,090
- Wrong word, change.

335
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,469
Now that is super.

336
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,869
- It's horrible, it's
ugly, it's granny style.

337
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,860
- It's elegant.

338
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:33,419
- It's fun shopping with my Dad

339
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,129
cause he pays for everything,

340
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,799
but at the same time, it's annoying.

341
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,639
Dad, you're embarrassing.

342
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,339
Why don't you just go?

343
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,899
- I could hunt for dark
artifacts and torture instruments

344
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,579
all day, but looking at
dresses, forget about it.

345
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,109
- Just go.

346
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,379
- Nothing skimpy, no leopard-skin.

347
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,149
- Trust me, trust me.

348
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,100
- It's on you see ya

349
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:56,756
- Bye.

350
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:03,207
- The day I've been
waiting for is finally here.

351
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,309
The preview of objects from
the Dark Artifacts Auction.

352
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,149
I mean, it's one thing to
see pictures of these things,

353
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,680
but to see them in person, it's amazing.

354
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,049
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

355
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,379
That's amazing, eh?

356
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,210
Check it out.

357
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:21,269
That, I've gotta have.

358
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,100
Check this out.

359
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:24,319
This is so rare.

360
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,179
It's an actual hangman's hood.

361
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,200
It's made out of leather.

362
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,282
- Why is it so rare?

363
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,010
- Because they disposed them.

364
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:31,292
Nobody wanted them.

365
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,131
- No way.

366
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:32,956
- Bad luck, man.

367
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,259
The man that looked through
that took your life.

368
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,549
That could go through the roof though

369
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,579
if people here realize what
that is the way I realize it,

370
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,479
it could go really high.

371
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,569
Gotta have it.

372
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,400
- Okay.

373
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,719
- It's a really competitive business.

374
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,479
You have to make a plan in
advance and stick to it.

375
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,829
- So, do you want everything?

376
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,949
- I'd like it all, but
there's a few pieces

377
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,566
in particular that I want.

378
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,657
One is the coffin and the other one is

379
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,589
that executioner's hood
because that piece is so rare.

380
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,820
Think of how cool that coffin
would look in that corner.

381
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:10,245
- Right behind my desk.

382
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,689
- I'm really excited about
this upcoming auction,

383
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,309
but first I want to meet
with one more whip expert

384
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,119
to see if I can finally get to the bottom

385
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,969
of where and when this cat
o' nine tails whip was used.

386
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,800
Hey, Peter.

387
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:25,120
- Hey, I'm an expert because of 50 years

388
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:29,531
of collecting, reading
and writing about whips.

389
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,750
- You know, I noticed

390
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:32,761
you brought a big bag with you.

391
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:33,820
I'm hoping there's more
than clothes in it.

392
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:36,367
- No, I brought you some
whips from my collection

393
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,200
of 1,000 whips.

394
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:38,663
- Awesome, whoa!

395
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,759
- Some stems from the
Peter Frisk collection.

396
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,499
- Oh my God!

397
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,339
That looks viscous.

398
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,809
It is actually a rhino-hide.

399
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,870
It's from the belly of a rhino.

400
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,173
- Could you imagine getting hit with this?

401
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:53,642
- And, that's what called a sjambok.

402
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:55,609
It's from South Africa.

403
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,819
It's probably about 100 years old.

404
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,319
- That was used on people?

405
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,639
- That was used on people.

406
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,640
This one here is a cossak
whip, from the 19th Century.

407
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,939
- A true cossak whip.

408
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,479
- A true cossak whip.

409
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,949
It's meant to be used for
horseback and cossak riding

410
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,459
in the Russian army would
have carried a whip like that.

411
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,919
Probably an officer.

412
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,769
- This has caught my
attention immediately.

413
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,779
This is awesome.

414
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,977
- What's that.

415
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,339
- This is bone?

416
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,479
- It is bone and carved stone

417
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,044
and there's a knife in the handle.

418
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:29,355
- Check it out!

419
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,979
Would this be for stabbing?

420
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,279
Was this like a weapon?

421
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,789
- It might be for eating
your dinner actually.

422
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,829
- Really, like this?

423
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,139
- It's very rare; It
should be in a museum.

424
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,189
- Should be, well, it is.

425
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,690
Yours.
- Yeah, mine.

426
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:42,521
That's right.

427
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,744
- Seeing your expertise and
your incredible collection,

428
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,119
we came to the right guy.

429
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,269
I mean, I imagine there's
nobody on the earth

430
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,569
that likely knows more
about whips than you.

431
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,989
This cat o' nine tails tested
positive for human blood

432
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,139
and that's amazing, but I still don't know

433
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,870
where it was used and when.

434
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:58,933
- Yeah, this is a fascinating whip.

435
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:03,549
There is wear on them and age patina.

436
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,159
I'm also looking at
the work of the joining

437
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,529
and the style of those is 19th-Century.

438
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,779
I have seen Australian
convicts flogging whips

439
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,696
from the 19th Century that resemble this

440
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:18,877
Now I would add another possibility....

441
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,710
- Okay.

442
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:22,879
- It also
resembles a photo post card

443
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,739
from the convict ship, Success.

444
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,119
- The Success was the most famous

445
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,229
and notorious prison ship of all time

446
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,019
and, when she retired, they toured her

447
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,749
from port-to-port around the world

448
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,929
showing people the horrors
of the British penal system.

449
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,659
- This sticker is very, very important.

450
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,379
It's a collection number,
which appears to confirm

451
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,099
that it's either in a museum, on the ship

452
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,799
or somewhere else.

453
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,849
My theory is that is was on display,

454
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,089
set up in the convict ship, Success.

455
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,469
Everything's consistent.

456
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,810
It all fits in with Success.

457
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:53,673
- This is killing me.

458
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,429
I don't mean to interrupt you, I have to,

459
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,879
what's it worth?

460
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,409
- It's worth a lot of money.

461
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,310
If it can be proved to be from Success,

462
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:04,169
it should be in the range
of possibly $10,000.

463
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,429
- 10,000 bucks?

464
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,430
Even a 1800's punishment
whip used on convicts,

465
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,009
if we couldn't nail down
the ship certainly...

466
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,419
- Even if you couldn't nail that down,

467
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,399
it's still worth three or four thousand.

468
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,539
- Oh man, this is great.

469
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,409
- So you have
a very valuable item.

470
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,159
Peter gave me some amazing
information about this whip

471
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,669
and now, armed with that, I know

472
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,129
that if I ever want to sell this thing,

473
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,079
I could more than triple my money.

474
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,910
Wow.

475
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:33,753
- Take good care of it.

476
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:35,166
- Oh I will and, you know what,

477
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,999
if I ever decide to get rid of it,

478
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,850
it'll go to your collection.

479
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:40,077
- I'd buy it from you, but
I know you wouldn't sell.

480
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,910
- Not yet.

481
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,840
- Not yet.

482
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,219
It's amazing to be
invited to this auction.

483
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,240
I looked forward to it the whole year.

484
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:54,673
- Okay, we're gonna start
off the auction here

485
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,069
with the slave collar
here, nice little collar,

486
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,079
it's a dungeon collar, folks

487
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,759
Sold, $300

488
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,209
Next item up for bid here
is the iron paddle wagon.

489
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,040
Sold it!

490
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,208
Two and a half.
Sold it!

491
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:05,139
$650.
Sold her.

492
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,477
$2100.

493
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,179
Late arrival here, there's Dan.

494
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,149
Hey Dan, I hope you brought
your thick wallet tonight, sir.

495
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,109
- I started seeing this
guy about two years ago

496
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,239
showing up at auctions

497
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,279
and even bidding online against me

498
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,679
and people have told me later
it was him that had done it.

499
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,199
- All righty,
folks, change your tune.

500
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,309
We're off to the two-star
items in the show.

501
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,099
Executioner's hood and the coffin.

502
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,129
Nice piece right there.

503
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,399
Who's gonna start me off
there, anybody want $1,000?

504
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,359
Five hundred, wow, couple
hundred quick, four,

505
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,249
four, now to five, five and
a four now five to a five,

506
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,060
seven, I'm at a seven, now eight, go eight

507
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:35,902
- Eight hundred.

508
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:37,865
- I'm at an eight, now nine to a nine.

509
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:38,810
- Thirteen.

510
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:39,700
- Thirteen!

511
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:42,250
- I'm at a 13, now 14, get
to 14, do the 14, go 14.

512
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:46,641
Now I'm at a 13, now 14,
go 14, sold it, $1300.

513
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,549
- I'm pissed off that I
didn't win that coffin,

514
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,099
but, you know what, now I have more money

515
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,849
to go after that executioner's hood

516
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,809
and I'm going home with it.

517
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,309
- Next item up for bids here folks

518
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,719
is the Scottish hangman's hood.

519
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,309
Very, very rare, most of these
were destroyed right after

520
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,589
the executioners retired.

521
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,529
Who's gonna start me off
on the bidding on that

522
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,225
in about $2,000?

523
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:09,286
Wow, 15, 1,000 and holding.

524
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,118
- 1,000

525
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,291
- I'm at $1,000 now to 11
to 11 do I hear 11 and 12?

526
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:13,694
Will 12 gets 12 do 12.

527
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:14,525
- Thirteen.

528
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:18,807
- Thirteen and 14, 14 and
15, I'm at 14, can we go 15.

529
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:19,638
- Fifteen.

530
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,151
- Fifteen, 15, now 17
and 1/2, hear 17 1/2,

531
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,508
17 1/2 and two.

532
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,339
- Twenty one.

533
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:25,240
- Now I'm at 21.

534
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:26,067
- Twenty five.

535
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,559
- Twenty five, 125 now
3, now 3 go 3 get 3,

536
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,759
think you good, think you
should, think I would,

537
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,200
now bid 25 and 3.

538
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,910
Sold!

539
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:34,753
- Yes!

540
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:35,876
- $2500

541
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,219
- Right on!

542
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,929
What an auction, I mean,
I didn't get the coffin,

543
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,019
but I did get the Scottish Hangman's hood

544
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,609
and that for me, means it
was a score and a great day.

545
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,489
Now I have to switch gears
and get into another mode.

546
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,599
A young man is coming
by to take my daughter

547
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,789
to her first dance.

548
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,989
- You must be Mr. Santini

549
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,159
- This hat.

550
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,169
Respect.

551
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,160
Tell me a bit about yourself.

552
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,879
Do you collect anything?

553
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,549
- Um, no.

554
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,199
- I do, I collect ancient torture devices.

555
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,099
This thing here was called a face puller.

556
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,179
It went right over someone's face

557
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,399
and they'd pull the
face right off a person.

558
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,300
Isn't that awesome?

559
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:13,469
You know, when you shake a
man's hand, it's a sacred bond,

560
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,069
but, back in the day, they had this.

561
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,029
If you broke your word like, for instance,

562
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,649
what time you get home at night,

563
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,019
they'd crush your fingers
between those plates.

564
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,829
Do you agree that promises
are very important?

565
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,660
- Yes.

566
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,439
- Yeah, that's good, you know.

567
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,479
This thing here, check it out.

568
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,799
It's got these spikes on the inside.

569
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,869
First they'd take a person's hat off,

570
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,069
so this could fit over top of the head.

571
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,939
See all these sharp points?

572
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,579
They'd twist the handle and the entire top

573
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,480
of the person's head would disconnect.

574
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:43,968
- Awe, sweet!

575
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:47,255
- Oh my God, where's the limo?

576
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:49,026
- So much better than a limo.

577
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,531
- I think this is your limo.

578
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:52,100
- This is your ride, kids.

579
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,020
- She's gonna kill you.

580
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,960
- Yeah, probably.

581
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,650
- Thank you.

582
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:03,313
- Hey, Hayden, just
remember man, 11 o'clock.

583
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,139
I'll make it 10:50, sir.

584
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,180
- Sir, right on, good boy, smart kid.

585
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:10,991
- Have fun, guys.

586
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:11,836
- Have fun, man.

587
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,810
- Bye.

588
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:15,040
- Dance the night away.

589
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,527
See ya!
