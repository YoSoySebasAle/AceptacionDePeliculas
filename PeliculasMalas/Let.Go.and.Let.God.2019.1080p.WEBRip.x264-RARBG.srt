00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:39,985

00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,350
- Hey, call you back?

00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:08,003
- [Male] Morning.

10
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,048
- [Woman] Good morning.

11
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:11,963
- Hey buddy.

12
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,095
- Hey.

13
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:13,922
- You get your homework done?

14
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,663
- Yes.

15
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,186
- Good.

16
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,535
You make it a great day.

17
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,275
- [Boy] All right.

18
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,016
- Oh.

23
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:19,830
Good morning sir.

24
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,840
You're early.

25
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,060
- [Male] Yeah.

26
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,672
- I'm getting ready to make
some coffee, you want some?

27
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,719
- No thank you.

28
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,947
- I'll be in my office
if you need anything.

29
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,475
Moody this morning.

30
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:15,146
Sir.

31
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:21,413
- [Male] Yeah?

32
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,287
- We're having a service
Friday night at the church.

33
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,550
Thought it'd be a good idea--

34
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,160
- I know all about it.

35
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,945
I know all about it.

36
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,033
I'm one of the members.

37
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:37,952
- Care to join us?

00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,395
[male exhales sharply]

39
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:47,614
- I don't know.

40
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,965
I'll think about it.

41
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,491
- [Woman] I'll just
leave this here,

42
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,059
just in case you
do decide to come.

43

John!

47
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:25,450
John.

48
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:30,368
Johnny?

49
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,414
John!

50
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,328
Johnny!

51
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,247
John?

John?

56
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,302

[door knocking]

58
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:40,482
- You think I didn't see
you hiding behind my door?

59
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:41,352
What's going on?

60
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,574
- I was just trying
to see if you

61
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:46,967
had a chance to
look at the flyer.

62
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,187
- I did.

63
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,452
And chances are I'm
not gonna make it.

64
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,192
- You sure?

65
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,367
- [Male] Yeah.

66
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,368
- But, I just--

67
00:11:57,412 --> 00:12:00,023
[phone ringing]

68
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,112
You serious?

69
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:09,511
Yeah.

70
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,297
Are you, okay bye.

71
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,385
Johnny's missing.

72
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:17,998
- Johnny's missing?

73
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:19,956
Jake's Johnny?

74
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,090
- [Woman] Yeah, I'll go
ahead and call the watch team

75
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:23,873
so they could start looking--

76
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,701
- No, no, no, no, no.

77
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,355
- We'll just gather
all the information

78
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:30,358
and we'll deal with it if
the police need our help.

79
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,098
- [Woman] You wanna wait?

80
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,403
- Yeah.

81
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,056
- Why?

82
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,799
- Because it's
Father's Day weekend.

83
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,107
- Are you okay?

84
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,326
This is what we
do, it's our job.

85
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,850
We're the Community Ministry!

86
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,376
- Yeah, well
whatever that means,

87
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,030
why don't you just
pray about it.

88
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,391

00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,411

morning wine again?

91
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,375
[door creaking]

92
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:16,377
Drunk.

93
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,548
[phone buzzing]

94
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:03,815
- Hello.

95
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,514
- Mom.

96
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:07,558
Johnny's missing.

97
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,474
- Did you call the police?

98
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,649
- Yes.

99
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:12,955
- Do you think he ran away?

100
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:16,959
- [Woman] I don't know.

101
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,279
- I probably shouldn't say this,

102
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:35,586
but I mean, I hope
he's all right,

103
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,589
but this is probably a sign.

104
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,682
- What is that supposed to mean?

105
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,818
- I told you and Jake
not to adopt a black boy.

106
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,690
They need to be
with their own kind.

107
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,301
You think he doesn't see that?

108
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,829
- I'm not doing this right now.

109
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,613
- Your husband died
and you're left

110
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,572
to raise him all alone.

111
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,446
- Race has nothing
to do with it!

112
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,840
Hateful people make it that way!

113
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:14,451
I called you to let you know
your grandson is missing!

114
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:17,498
Bye!

115
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:24,026
- Grandson.

116
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,605
You taught her,
she's just like you.

117
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,476
She never listens
to a word I say.

118
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:04,153
[door knocking]

119
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,684
- We came over as
soon as we heard.

120
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,251
You okay?

121
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,035
- Not at all.

122
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,081
- [Male] It's good
to see you Wendy.

123
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,778
- Good to see you too.

124
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,928
- I haven't been
here in a while.

125
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,588
- I talked to my mom,

126
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,765
and she just made things worse.

127
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,595
- Let's just focus on
John, 'cause your mom...

128
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:58,164
- [Male] Yeah, is it okay
if I searched the place?

129
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,208
Look for forced entry?

130
00:17:59,252 --> 00:17:59,861
- Yes.

131
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,214
- Are there any leads
on where he might be?

132
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:06,694
- I have no idea.

133
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,348
I'm not even sure
he left on his own.

134
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:12,656
- Have you talked to the
school or any of his friends?

135
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,919
- I called, he's not at school.

136
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,530
The principal talked
to the classmates

137
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:17,661
and nobody has seen him.

138
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,799
- Do you mind if
we pray for you?

139
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,105
- Okay, thanks.

140
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,370
No sign of forced entry.

141
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,503
I spoke with the police.

142
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,376
Because it hasn't
been 24 hours yet

143
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,552
there's nothing they
can do until then.

144
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,512
- 24 hours?

145
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,906
Somebody could have taken
him across country by then.

146
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,429
- Look, I have some of
my friends on the force

147
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,823
looking for John while
they're on patrol.

148
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,738
And I also called
the Help Center.

149
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,001
- You mean the community
group at that church?

150
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:57,353
- At least we have
someone looking with us.

151
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,834
- We just can't sit here
and hope that they find him.

152
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:00,835
- Let's just calm down.

153
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,663
We can think better-

154
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:03,707
- Calm down?

155
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,014
I lost my husband.

156
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,060
And now I'm ab out
to lost my son.

157
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:12,847
You have yours.

158
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,133
I waited until I was
married to have children.

159
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,353
Trying to be obedient.

160
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:43,225
Nobody does that anymore.
[slow paced music]

161
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,749
I thought the Lord
would honor it.

162
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,186
And instead he
took Jake from me.

163
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,843
A couple of years
before Jake passed,

164
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,584
we found out we
couldn't have children.

165
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,588
That's why we decided to adopt.

166
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,379
As soon as life
starts to act right,

167
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,556
Jake passes,

168
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:11,906
and now this.

169
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,345
I don't think I can
believe in God anymore.

170
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,132
God wouldn't give people
more than they can bare.

171
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:33,188
- And we know that
those who love God,

172
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,885
all things work for good

173
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,844
for those who are called
according to His purpose.

174
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,250
[birds chirping]

175
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,827
[ominous music]

176
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,203
- Yeah, there's this
super hot guy here.

177
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:17,858
He has so many
tattoos on his arm.

178
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,903
But he has that one
piercing on his nose.

179
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,037
Oh it's so hot.

180
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,736
My Mom hates when they
have nose piercings.

181
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,911
Hold on, my Mom's calling.

182
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:30,740
Yes Mom.

183
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,526
I'm on the way okay.

184
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:35,745
Yes.

185
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,010
I was on the phone.

186
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:43,274
Wait Mom, Mom, Mom.

187
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:44,406
Can I use the car later?

188
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,209
[door knocking]

189
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:19,615
- Judy!

190
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,052
Judy.

191
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,491
I just got a call.

192
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:27,101
- [Judy] Okay.

193
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,058
I get those every day.

194
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,845
- Did you tell some people
to go look for Johnny?

195
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,457
- [Judy] I'm busy.

196
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,850
- I asked you to wait Judy.

197
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,420
What if we have an
emergency we can't fulfill?

198
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,073
It's Father's Day weekend

199
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,902
and we're short of help.

200
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:46,860
- I'm not gonna sit around

201
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:48,209
and wait for another emergency

202
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,950
when we have one right now.

203
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,168
- [Male] What if he's not lost?

204
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,692
Huh?

205
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:53,519
What if he's at a friends
house or something?

206
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:54,955
- Exactly.

207
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,260
You don't know where he is.

208
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,914
That's why we
prepare for the worst

209
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,481
and expect the best.

210
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:00,395
- [Male] Judy come on.

211
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,570
- What is wrong with you?

212
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,399
This isn't you.

213
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,053
I figured after what
happened to Lily

214
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,271
you would be the first person

215
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,056
to wanna find
somebody else's child.

216
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:14,104
You were born and
raised in a church.

217
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,152
Do you believe this
is what God wants?

218
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,867
- [Male] I don't
even believe in God.

219
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,218
- I said "Do you believe this is

220
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:42,263
"what God wants from you?"

221
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:44,178
- Are you listening to me?

222
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:49,009
I said "I don't even
believe in God!"

223
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:49,749
- How?

224
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:52,099
You work at a church.

225
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,100
- So what?

226
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:56,146
'Cause I work at a
church doesn't mean

227
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,148
I have to believe in God.

228
00:24:58,192 --> 00:24:59,933
I need a paycheck!

229
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:04,720
- [Judy] What?

230
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:06,983
- When I was coming up,

231
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,858
I didn't have
choice of religion,

232
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:12,641
it was given to me.

233
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,515
And as a kid, I couldn't
ask any questions.

234
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,170
- You were just being curious.

235
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:21,520
- No, no, no.

236
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,217
You try telling that
to my Aunt Nessa.

237
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,525
You question anything
in the Bible,

238
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,574
she find the biggest,
thickest Bible she could

239
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,882
and she hit you it right
in the back of your head.

240
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:38,972
And I didn't realize
until I got older

241
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,103
that she was afraid.

242
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:45,413
Look, I never believed in God,

243
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:46,893
I never embraced any of it.

244
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:49,373
I mean I took communion,

245
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,028
I got baptized.

246
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:54,901
I went to confession.

247
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,209
I was just faking it.

248
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:04,954
I don't believe Jesus died
on the cross for my sins.

249
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,956
Especially no one
as crazy as I was.

250
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,570
But

251
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,620
after Lily died,

252
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,712
I just stopped
believing all together.

253
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,628
I didn't think He was real.

254
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,588
Why would He do that?

255
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,941
- Because He loves you.

256
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,294
- If He loved her why
did He let her die?

257
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,695
Why did He let my baby die?

258
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,831
I mean it wasn't her fault.

259
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:58,225
I didn't take care of my health.

260
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,532
And if he loved her
why did He do that?

261
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:02,533
She didn't deserve it.

262
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,668
I was driving

263
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:09,715
and I passed out

264
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,021
and I was wrong

265
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,155
and she had to pay for it.

266
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:25,513
It's not love.

267
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,735
That's why I don't
believe in God no more.

268
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:30,649
I don't believe it.

269
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,915
[solemn music]

270
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,747
Oh my God, this is crazy.

271
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,843
When did you know
you were a Christian?

272
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,981
I asked you a question.

273
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,330
It's a simple answer.

274
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,771
When did you know
you were a Christian?

275
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:12,473
- [Judy] When Jesus died
on the cross for my sins.

276
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,518
- No, no, no, no, no.

277
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:17,391
I'm not asking you when
you knew you were saved,

278
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:21,308
I'm asking you to tell me,

279
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,399
when did you know that
you were a Christian?

280
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,140
The moment.

281
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:28,968
The second, hour, the minute

282
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:32,319
that you knew what
you believe now.

283
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:37,063
When did you know
you were a Christian?

284
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,417
[somber music]

285
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:09,399
- [Woman] Lord, can
you hear me though?

286
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:12,968
A long time ago I stopped
believing Your reports.

287
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,754
Through Your son Christ
all things were possible,

288
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,582
and that I simply believe.

289
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,584
I believed every word You said.

290
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,586
After all, You're the same God

291
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,501
that raised Lazarus
from the dead.

292
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:26,895
He that wants some more,

293
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,332
so I got a question,
why did you save him

294
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,638
and not my daughter.

295
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,509
This is not divine order.

296
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,337
I wasn't supposed to bury her,

297
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,905
she's supposed to bury me now.

298
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,602
What in the world
do you want from me?

299
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:41,518
What do you mean that the
faith of a mustard seed?

300
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:44,652
It was your mountain
that fell down on me.

301
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,568
Left to die and the
rumble can't see

302
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:50,527
to get from under my humbles.

303
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:52,529
You never believed in me

304
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:55,315
til you see miraculous
signs and wonders.

305
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,665
I wonder, I wonder
was all that you could

306
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,493
claim even real.

307
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:02,539
When she touched the hem of
your garment was she healed?

308
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,107
What miracles did
you perform for Paul?

309
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:08,502
How did five loaves and
two fish feed all of y'all?

310
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:12,158
That water into wine,
they had to be lying.

311
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:14,900
Babies birthed by old
women and virgins,

312
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,598
Jonah in the whale,
Daniel in the den,

313
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,774
okay then, really.

314
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,472
See up until now I
never questioned you.

315
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:25,562
But the prayers of the
righteous did you even hear?

316
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,390
I begged to switch places.

317
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,001
She was just a baby.

318
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:32,613
Jesus was supposed to take
the will in an instant

319
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,615
my lifeline was killed.

320
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:37,705
Awake me from this dream,
this can't be real.

321
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:40,708
Devil on duty,
lie, destroy, kill.

322
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:43,537
Mission accomplished
I'm all out of options,

323
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,669
I can't face the odds.

324
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:48,542
The Lord said, "Let
go, and let God."

325
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,207
- Do you ever feel like

326
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,512
if you prayed hard enough,

327
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:05,080
certain things wouldn't happen?

328
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,259
- I never thought
about it like that,

329
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,478
but I know what you mean.

330
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:19,529
God's not punishing you
for not praying enough.

331
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:20,617
- It feels like it.

332
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,144
Or either He just isn't there.

333
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:26,406
- What?

334
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:28,103
- I just feel like
prayer doesn't work.

335
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:33,848
If it did, why are all these
things happening to me?

336
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:42,596
- Remember when was asked
why the blind man was blind?

337
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:48,036
He said "So that God
may get the glory."

338
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,603
Let God get the glory on this.

339
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,003
- So what do we do now?

340
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,271
- Why don't we go inside
and see if there might

341
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,968
be a clue as to where
he might have went?

342
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:10,058
Yeah, come on.

343
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:27,119
- [Wendy] No, no, no.

344
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:29,686
No, no, that's not
his room anymore.

345
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,687
It's this way, come on.

346
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:31,688
This way.

347
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,438
Why is this missing?

348
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,007
- [Woman] What is it?

349
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,138
- [Wendy] John's knife.

350
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:35,013
- You okay?

351
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:39,800
- Jake bought John this knife

352
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:42,020
as a souvenir from the
Father and Son retreat.

353
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:44,979
John never took it
out of the case.

354
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:47,764
- [Friend] What do
you think it means?

355
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,811
- Hopefully it means
he left on his own

356
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:54,554
and he's coming back.
[slow paced music]

357
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:03,084
[birds chirping]

358
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:43,516
- [Male] Come on
John, you can do this.

359
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,451
- [John] Hey!

360
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:06,843
- Hey.

361
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:07,757
- [John] Look what
I made at school.

362
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,585
- Wow, that came out great.

363
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:10,847
- [John] Yeah, I got an A on it.

364
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,240
- I bet you did.

365
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:16,026
Can I hang on to this?

366
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,811
- [John] Yeah.

367
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:18,638
- I'll put it up here.

368
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,816
That way, when I roll in a call,

369
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:23,730
I can think of you.

370
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,745
[ominous music]

371
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,011
- I appreciate your help,

372
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:48,058
but can you exactly explain
how the program works?

373
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:51,932
- Okay, so say
your bill is $1,000

374
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:54,761
and our budget for
that day is 700,

375
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,850
you have to come up
with the other 300

376
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:58,591
and show us proof
that you can pay it

377
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:01,071
before we can give
you the other 700.

378
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:04,379
- Well exactly how fast do
I have to get the money?

379
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:06,642
- Just as soon as you can.

380
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:08,557
It's based upon needs,

381
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,994
but I'm sure we can
work something out.

382
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:12,866
- I understand.

383
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,216
I'll try to come
up with the money.

384
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,826
Thank you, thank you.

385
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,479
- Sorry.

386
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:19,655
We'll get it figured out.

387
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,165
[door slamming]

388
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:57,998
- Look,

389
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,526
I just miss her a little.

390
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,703
I miss her so much.

391
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:12,055
I don't know why God
took Lily from me.

392
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:16,973
I miss her so much.

393
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,769
- It was a miracle.

394
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,249
- What is a miracle?

395
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,383
- Earlier today you asked me,

396
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,909
"When was the moment,
the second that I

397
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:41,824
"knew I was a Christian?"

398
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,307
It was when I saw a miracle.

399
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:54,750
Jesus said in John 4:48,

400
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,318
"Unless I see miracles
in amazing things,

401
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,537
"they will not believe."

402
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:04,543
Some won't believe until
they see a miracle.

403
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:07,110
I believe we're so consumed

404
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:09,983
by the worlds ways that
it hinders our beliefs.

405
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,071
We can't see clearly.

406
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:19,253
My Mom had cancer.

407
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,864
- [Male] You don't
need to tell me that.

408
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:24,302
[slow paced music]

409
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,390
- She had cancer.

410
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:28,306
I prayed for my
Mama day and night.

411
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:32,397
She wasn't getting any better.

412
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,528
Nothing was helping her.

413
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,011
Then there was this lady,

414
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,970
Miss Grace.

415
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:47,107
She came to see Mama

416
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,719
and she prayed for her

417
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:52,330
in a way I had
never seen anybody

418
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,548
pray for somebody.

419
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:55,507
She was on her knees
praying for her.

420
00:38:58,423 --> 00:38:59,989
A few days later
Mama was healed.

421
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,606
The doctors couldn't explain it.

422
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,088
A few days after
all that I got a

423
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:14,047
chance to spend some
time with Miss Grace.

424
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:19,748
I understood why God
answered her prayers

425
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:20,967
that she was praying for Mama,

426
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,404
she loved Jesus.

427
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,932
I promise you, try loving Him.

428
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,804
Just try.

429
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:32,544
And you'll see.

430
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:38,027
He's been loving
you for a long time.

431
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:41,770
A long time.

432
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:01,399
[male sniffling]

433
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:35,824
- Why don't we just pray?

434
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:43,049
- [Wendy] We need more
than prayer right now.

435
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,138
- The Bible says
pray for all things.

436
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:49,185
- It's gonna be
getting dark soon.

437
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,412
- You've seen those
trophies in his room?

438
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,153
You know what those mean?

439
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:02,024
That means he's a winner.

440
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,156
He's gonna be okay.

441
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,117
- But right now we're losing,

442
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,642
and I'm tired of losing.

443
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,001
- Let's do something.

444
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:23,263
Let's play a board game.

445
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,312
- My kid is either lost,
stolen, or kidnapped,

446
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,362
a board game is the
last thing on my mind.

447
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:37,190
- I'm just trying to help.

448
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,974
I'm trying to ease your mind.

449
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,236
You don't wanna pray.

450
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,412
- I'll pray whenever
God brings my son back.

451
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:03,216
Jake's shoes are missing.

452
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,353
No, I mean Jake's
shoes are missing.

453
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,234
Oh my goodness,

454
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,846
what if it was a robber?

455
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,369
Like a petty theft?

456
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:27,545
- No, no, no, no.

457
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:30,548
Don't jump to conclusions.

458
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:31,766
Jamal already checked the house

459
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,638
and there's no forced entry.

460
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,162
Just trust God, God's got this.

461
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:36,989
- Trust God?

462
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,687
Trust Him?

463
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:43,996
The one that let my husband die?

464
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:49,262
The one that let my
child get kidnapped?

465
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:55,877
I'll trust Him when
He brings my son back.

466
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:59,925
[birds chirping]

467
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:29,215
- [Jamal] What's up?

468
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:29,998
How ya doing buddy?

469
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:30,782
- Jamal, how are you?

470
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:32,479
- Not so good.

471
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:34,612
Not so good.

472
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:38,398
You know John is missing right?

473
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:40,182
- Sorry man, I heard.

474
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:41,706
No sign yet?

475
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:42,663
- Nothing, nothing.

476
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:46,536
Look, you got a couple hours,

477
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,713
you can hop in the car
and help me look for him?

478
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,803
- You know, I wish I
could, I really do.

479
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,456
- [Jamal] I really
need your help buddy.

480
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,067
- You know the kids are
gonna pull up any second.

481
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,851
They've been driving all day.

482
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:59,071
We're gonna hook up,
we're gonna head out.

483
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:01,029
We've been looking
forward to this trip.

484
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,296
- Father's Day weekend right?

485
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:13,346
Slim, I really need your help.

486
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:20,440
- I bet you if I
get on this phone,

487
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:22,747
make these few phone calls,

488
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,878
we'll get you some help.

489
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:39,851
- You still got
Wendy's number right?

490
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:42,375
- [Slim] I've got Wendy's,
I believe I have yours.

491
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:43,289
- Yeah, mine hasn't changed.

492
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:44,420
It hasn't changed.

493
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:45,334
- [Slim] I got it then.

494
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:46,814
- All right.

495
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,468
All right Slim, if
you hear anything,

496
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,297
please give me a call or
contact Wendy all right?

497
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,167
- [Slim] You got it.

498
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:55,083
- All right man.

499
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:57,129
- [Slim] I'll get
on that phone call.

500
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:58,260
- Thanks.

501
00:44:58,304 --> 00:44:59,218
Happy Father's Day.

502
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:01,742
- [Slim] Thanks.

503

[slow paced music]

504
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:05,501
- Talk to me.

505
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:09,288
Just keep pushing.

506
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,379
All right.

507
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:14,119
All right yeah.

508
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,599
Hello?

509
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:20,255
Tell me something good.

510
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,781
No leads?

511
00:46:26,914 --> 00:46:28,307
We gotta do something.

512
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,570
Wendy's about to
have a breakdown.

513
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,575
All right look, I'm gonna
check a little further out

514
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:37,011
and then I'm gonna
go back and check on,

515
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,884
yeah, I'm gonna check
on Wendy and Natasha.

516
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:40,710
All right.

517
00:46:41,537 --> 00:46:42,887
All right, yeah.

Hello.

522
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:30,064
Are you gonna pay
for your food ma'am

523
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:31,587
or stand there and
keep loitering?

524
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,198
'Cause we have
customers waiting.

525
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:44,992
- Looks like
there's nobody here.

- They're coming.

Hey.

For whatever it's worth, listen,

don't let bad habits hold
you back from missing life.

Sometimes you just need
to stop and look up.

[woman exhales]

536
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:33,519
- Nothing?

537
00:48:38,263 --> 00:48:40,700
All right, thanks.

538
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:42,136

Day to you too.

They said they done
all they can do.

Let's just let the
police handle this.

542

- I'm going out there by myself.
