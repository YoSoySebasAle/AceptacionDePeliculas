Whoa, what's this about?

We heard them shots poppin' off.

30
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,066
Then Venice gets a call
saying you been shot at,

31
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,111

Wassup, Miami? Hope
you are having a great morning so far.

49
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:07,092
You are listening to JAM 95. 1, southern
Florida's number one hip hop station.

50
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,095
It's me, lady T,
and l gotta get into this 41 1.

51
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,557
Because late last night in downtown Miami,
it was a hot one.

52
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:18,019
The ongoing beef between rappers A-Maze
and B-Bone apparently, that boiled over.

53
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,856
It ended up in a scuffle at
the Tropical Heat night club.

54
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,526
The altercation resulted in a shooting
that left one of B-Bone's associates

55
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,696
in critical condition. There
was also a drug related slaying

56
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,948
in the Triangle
late last night, too.

57
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,617
Authorities fear that the
shooting may have been a result

58
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,370
of the ongoing drug war
between rival Haitian gangs.

59
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,039
In other Hip Hop news,
Ja Rule, he's in town this week.

60
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,251
To promote his new album,
M irror Reloaded, he'll be performing...

61
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,881
Rise 'n' shine.

62
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,717
Come on. We gotta get
movin'. We got a lot to do today.

63
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,720
We gotta do the photo shoot. And
after that we got the marketing meeting.

64
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,473
Then we got the in-store at Del
South Records in North M iami.

65
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,349
What we doing at in-store for?

66
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,311
For the label. lt's some promotion shit,
l guess.

67
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,635
What promotion we gonna do? We ain't got
no album. lt ain't comin' out for months.

68
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,290
I don't know. Don't ask me,
man. They got their reasons, you know.

69
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,111
What else we gotta do?

70
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,072
We got the lunch meeting with the
movie people, Selahsi's video shoot,

71
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,741
then it's the show
at H2O tonight.

72
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,077
And l set the meeting
for the label, too.

73
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,079
What about?

74
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,350
You know that kid, Young Eastie,
l was telling you about?

75
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,833
Shit, he's fresh.
I'm telling you.

76
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,252
I'm ready to go back
to fuckin' bed.

77
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,963
Are you crazy? l just told
you we we've got a full day.

78
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,128
I got so much goin' on in my head, too,
man. Anthony shouldn'ta shot that cat.

79
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,135
I know. Look,
we just gotta move on,

80
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,138
put it behind us like we always
do. You know what l mean?

81
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,600
If the dude dies though dawg,
we gonna be in the shit storm.

82
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,311
And l thought l was past that type of shit,

00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,981
This shootin' shit,
this death shit. Fuck B-Bone.

00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,361
That bum ass nigger. He done
started some shit he can't finish now.

85
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,113
But dude, guess what?
It's on him, not us.

86
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,950
Man. You stick
around, man.

87
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,995
These motherfuckers,
all they do is act like goddamn fools

88
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,373
and run up the bar
tab like a motherfucker.

89
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,168
And guess what, man? l ain't going
to motherfuckin' jail dude, l mean it.

90
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,379
L'd rather fuckin' die.

I need you home,
and not running all over hell and be gone.

M h-mh. My babies got to eat.
Come on. Get some eggs.

108
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,476
We'll be home for dinner.

L'ma be out tonight. You
won't see me till at least tomorrow.

110

Peace.

115
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,086
There you go.

116
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,172
I said l heard them helicopters
buzzing last night. Where were you?

117
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,799
I was in the studio, Ma.

119
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,427
Jay got it covered.

120
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,262
Jay? What is he?
A big high-roller now?

121
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,264
Flippin' burgers by day,
music tycoon by night?

122
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,766
It's not like that, Ma.

123
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,810
You have responsibilities here.

124
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,269
I know that.

125
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,646
You know?
Prove it then.

126
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,439
Mom, l just did prove it.

127
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,110
You know what?
Be here by six.

128
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,446
Shit, l don't even wanna think about
Venice sneaking somebody in here.

129
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,448
I am too young to be a grandma.

130
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,158
All right, Ma.

131
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,877
Dave, what's up?

132
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,297
M r. Jackson.
I'm glad you made it.

133
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,133
Lots of press today.

134
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,802
Yeah. Ain't no bad press,
ls all good?

135
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,971
We need to take
this seriously, Antoine.

136
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,306
I'm taking it seriously, dude.

137
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,351
I took it seriously last night when
l was in a pissy ass fucking cell.

138
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,813
I took it real seriously. l was in that
bitch all night. Where was you at?

139
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,149
I'm usually not up that late.

140
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,068
Look motherfucker, l'm not giving
you a retainer for your beauty sleep.

141
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,779
We gotta go.

142
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,424
My guess is they'll wanna pin a lesser charge
on you. Perhaps conspiracy to commit murder.

143
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,576
What?

144
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,661
Conspiracy.

145
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,932
Man, l didn't do shit. l'm
sitting there with a hot blonde.

146
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,708
I'm sipping on my drink and we're
having a good motherfucking time.

147
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,355
A motherfucker l ain't never ever seen before
gonna come up to me and throw shit in my face?

148
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,881
Hell, yeah,
Anthony did what he had to do, man.

149
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,217
That's how that shit go down. l
didn't have to tell him to do shit.

150
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,016
It'd be best if you keep a low
profile for a while, that's all l'm saying.

151
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,769
You hear this motherfucker?
I'm going on tour for two weeks

152
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,062
and this dude's telling
me about a low profile.

153
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,398
I warned you.

154
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,859
Did you see Shark Week,
when it was on TV, the cable thing?

155
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,779
They're talking about sharks,
telling you everything about sharks.

156
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,947
When a sharks stops
swimming, they drown.

157
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,451
Okay? l gonna keep it moving,
Dave. l'm gonna keep it moving.

158
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,703
That's what l'm
trying to tell you.

159
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,540
I need you to sign
one more thing.

160
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,293
Nah, man, give it to Gary.

161
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,256
All right, dude.

162
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,230
What up, boy?

163
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,148
What's good, baby?

164
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,691
Ain't nothin'.

165
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,276
We gotta get that
demo from Tyrone.

166
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,903
Yeah, he want that bread though.

167
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,112
How much you talking?

168
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,239
$ 1,500.

169
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,907
1,500?

170
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,617
Jay, you gotta
talk him down, man.

171
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,078
I mean, l can do it,
ain't nothing.

172
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,248
Nah, serious, man, because you know l
got that meeting with A-Maze and Gary.

173
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,667
Jay, this is serious, man.

174
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,003
I know it's serious. Come on. What you
gonna do? You gonna do the same thing?

175
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,506
Bro, we gotta go
to work. We late.

176
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,593
Come on, man.
Trippin', man. Shit.

177
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,106
Good morning,
good morning, good morning.

178
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,782
Good morning. Welcome to
Lalo's. May l take your order, please?

179
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,035
Yeah. l'd like a coffee,
a morning bacon sandwich,

180
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,496
and can l get a side
of that green potato salad?

181
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,957
Right. Um,
please, drive around.

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,501
Bacon sandwich with cheese.

183
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,136
How you doing, sir?
That'll be two-fifty.

184
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,071
Thank you, sir.

185
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,657
And enjoy your
green potato salad.

186
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,036
Sexy in the eyes. A-Maze,
right in the camera.

187
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,664
Girls. Sexy, sexy.
Turn your shoulders in.

188
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,751
Shoulders into me. Arching
the backs. Asses out. Asses out.

189
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,254
Girls, relax. Relax. A little more,
get into each other.

190
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,506
No, get him to loosen up,
not the girls.

191
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,675
Hey, l've tried everything
except a cattle prod.

192
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,260
Can you get this going, dude?

193
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,825
A-Maze, relax. These
are your bitches.

194
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,639
I'm trying, man l get tired.

195
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,515
Come on, you're the king
of the hood, man.

196
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,351
I'm shuffling my feet
'cause they hurt.

197
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,144
Stay with me.

198
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,104
I've been posing
for a long time. l'm hot.

199
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,856
I know.

200
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,859
All right. Let's take
ten. Let's take ten.

201
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,446
You look great.

202
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,032
No, no, no, nah,
l need you to go on over there.

203
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,660
You'd fit right in there.

204
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:58,039
One shot. Gary, don't you wanna see her in...
You wanna see her in one of those numbers.

205
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,124
Stop bullshitting. You
wanna see it. Thank you.

206
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,168
Okay, yes.

207
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,382
Hey boys.
How're you doing?

208
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,304
Let me see what you doing.

209
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,764
Excuse you.

210
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,432
Give me this.

211
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,938
Okay, you know what? You really
shouldn't be reading my messages.

212
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,440
It's only journalists
looking for a statement.

213
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,902
Well, the problem is that statement
comes out, and it stirs up this pot

214
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,947
with this beef,
and it fucks me up.

215
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,283
No, because all of it can play our way,
okay?

216
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,829
50 Cent got huge sales
off his beef with Jarule.

217
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,915
Tupac, Biggie,
all of it parlayed into record sales.

218
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,834
That's the angle
l'm working with.

219
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,254
Okay, Ja Rule, first
of all is the dude's name.

220
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:51,134
And your first mistake is,
50 Cent took nine bullet holes.

221
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,511
Tupac and Biggie? Dead.

222
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,597
I can't remember the last time
that l heard about a publicist

223
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,517
lying face-down in the gutter.

224
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,479
I've already prepared a
press release. Take a look.

225
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,611
All right. So it says that B-Bone
is at fault. And then what?

226
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,115
And then the press gets hungry
and they start scavenging around.

227
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,701
And l've already sent it out.

228
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,705
You know, sometimes l think l shouldn't be
watching my back for these hood mo'fuckers.

229
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,207
Really it's you, Joanie,

230
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,627
and people like you
that scare me more.

231
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,339
It's good that l scare you.
It'll keep you on your toes.

232
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,884
A-Maze! We're back on the clock. Let's go,
man.

233
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,678
Okay, go get 'em, tiger!

234
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,890
Thank you, sir.

235
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,983
That'll be 22 .50.

236
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,735
Yeah, fool.

237
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,029
L'll see you on the other side.

238
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,574
You already know we
do to that, too. Ha-ha.

239
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,163
What was that all about?

240
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,998
I don't know.

241
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,714
Jay. Fuckin' Roman's
at the window, dog.

242
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,341
Who?

243
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,675
Roman.

244
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,095
Fuck.

245
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,098
You guys got
five minutes. Don't push it.

246
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,183
What up, Raff?

247
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,187
What up, bro?
That's right.

248
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,898
There you go, there.

249
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,528
Aw, man.
You know what?

250
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,614
We gonna have to change
our business location, man.

251
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,368
I can't take this motherfucker
rolling up on us like that.

252
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,286
It's his thing.
He be eyeing.

253
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,622
He ain't gunning for you.
He ain't got no reason to.

254
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,208
He ain't got to have no
reason to get at you, you know.

255
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,586
That's just what he do. He
got killing in his blood, bro.

256
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,798
You talking all superstitious.
Like he the devil or somethin'.

257
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,635
He ain't the devil,
but l just don't wanna be on his bad side.

258
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,471
You know what l'm saying?
The object of his attention.

259
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah, man. Yo,
you spoke with Tyrone, right?

260
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,309
And what he said that we still
owe him some money for that demo?

261
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,229
I mean, yeah, that what he said.
But l can always talk him down.

262
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,667
Nah. Don't even talk him down.
Let me call him and talk to him.

263
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,609
I want you to call Gary up
and act like my manager.

264
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,654
Manager? You mean
your producer?

265
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,781
Producer, whatever you wanna do.

266
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,951
Just make sure it sound real
professional and l'll call Tyrone.

267
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,744
Yeah, let's do it.

268
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,749
Gary.

269
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,002
Tyrone. Wassup, man?

270
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,628
Yeah. This is
Young Eastie.

271
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,089
This is Jay.
Young Eastie's producer.

272
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,236
Yeah, you know, l'm trying to connect
with you to come pick that demo up, man.

273
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,012
I know we short on cash,
l know that. But we need it right now

274
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,973
and l'll get the cash to you later on. No,
seriously, l promise that.

275
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,517
Yeah, we know where Del
South Records at. Course we do.

276
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,519
But l kinda really
need it tonight.

277
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,521
We gonna be there.
Yeah, one hundred.

278
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,523
All right man, yeah.

279
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,026
Shit.

280
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,946
Can you believe this motherfucker
just now told me we can't get the demo?

281
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,034
Man, fuck that shit,
man. They want you to come see A-Maze,

282
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,494
Del South records,
1:00 PM today.

283
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,580
You serious?

284
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,458
I swear to God. You now your
boy got it. What you gonna do?

285
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,378
Let's check the bank account. That's
what we gotta do. How much you got?

286
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,131
Going into pockets now.

287
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,675
I got one-forty.
What you got?

288
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,928
One-forty? l got a
little something like that.

289
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,347
That look like more
than enough right there.

290
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,516
Nah, this ain't enough. Look, this
right here is the business account, right?

291
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,812
This' like $ 1,600. And this right here's
the personal checking account. lt's 850.

292
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,481
We got a business account?

293
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,733
Yeah.

294
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,819
Shit, look like we gonna have to
go into the business account, dude.

295
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,906
Nah, we can't touch that. l got that
from Green. He gave us the package,

296
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,076
that granddaddy cush. And l
ain't trying to fuck up that connect.

297
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,579
So, l don't wanna dip into this money. So,
you know what? Let me get that right there.

298
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,123
Let me get that money. We
gotta get another hustle on,

299
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,335
but here's what l need you to do
right now. Call me in two minutes.

300
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:59,882
Two minutes. Just trust me. You're gonna
find out what we're gonna do right now.

301
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,426
l hired
you 'cause l like you.

302
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,429
But you can't just come
in any time you want to.

303
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,724
Why do black people
think 9:00 is 1 1:00?

304
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,687
You've been late everyday this week.
And you're gonna have to wear a hairnet.

305
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,232
I can't have weave hairs in
the food. l'm just telling you.

306
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,443
You don't wanna wear a hairnet,
you're gonna have to get fired.

307
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,698
All your little fat ass friends coming here
eatin' for free, that ain't gonna happen.

308
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,117
And you taking advantage of it.

309
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,412
Excuse me? Damn, are you serious?
This what happened right now?

310
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,872
What's up with you, young fella?

311
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,042
'Scuse me. You know
my little sister, Tasha.

312
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,754
She ate some peanuts and now all of
the sudden her whole neck is swollen up.

313
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,383
Look, you got a family emergency. Go
ahead take care of it. Family come first.

314
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,470
Bowman, thank you so much. This is a huge
favor. l promise you l will fill in the hours.

315
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,389
Just get going.
Handle your business.

316
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,225
Okay, l'm available.

317
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,396
Back to you, young lady. l was hoping this
evening we could probably catch dinner.

318
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,275
I'm just saying. l'm giving you more
than l'm giving the rest of these girls.

319
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,571
I'm just saying. All right,
l'm done. You can go.

320
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,118
I like that ass.

321
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,998
Hey, y'all better get the fuck out the
way before we end up hittin' one of y'all.

322
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,296
Yo,
y'all about to fall back. Come on.

323
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,011
What happened to that
receptionist last time we was here?

324
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,806
Now they got my man up
front. That isn't very welcoming.

325
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,267
Fucking place looks
like it's shrinking.

326
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,188
Posters. Yeah, that's cool.
I've got better posters than that.

327
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,190
I look tired in
that motherfucker.

328
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,525
Platinum plaques, baby.

329
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,778
Still room
for a couple more.

330
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,619
Philip. lt's my man. l ain't
seen you in a minute man.

331
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,455
Can l get you
gentlemen anything?

332
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,499
Nah, we're good.

333
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,294
L'll take one of these. Yeah.
So what's up? Where Clay at?

334
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,880
Clay's not gonna be here today.

335
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,966
What you mean Clay not here today,
man? You knew l was coming to see him.

336
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,303
I got the email that said that you and
Clay were gonna be here at the meeting.

337
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,639
You all know how
things can get for Clay.

338
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,535
Love that new track, by the way.
We've been playing it 9:00 AM, non-stop.

339
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,310
Yeah, that's cool.
Don't wear it out.

340
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,039
I think we should lead
off the album with that.

341
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,481
I think l should
finish my album.

342
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,461
That's something we need to talk about.
Clay wants to move the release date up.

343
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,778
That's bullshit.
Hell, no.

344
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,262
Listen, we're thinking we can
leak a track onto the lnternet.

345
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,075
Perhaps tie it in with a video
piece that looks sort of homemade

346
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,744
like it was shot on
a cell phone or something.

347
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,748
That way it can be downloaded and then all
over the place so that nobody buys the album.

348
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,252
It won't get downloaded all over the place.
The album will be released weeks later.

349
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,838
The l nternet's the swap
meet of the world, man.

350
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,235
We can send a track out the next couple of
weeks and get some traction on the album.

351
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,510
Wait a minute and you
listen to this, dude.

352
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,513
Since you didn't hear me the first
time real good, it ain't done, yet!

353
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,349
It can be done.

354
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,936
I'm in the studio right now! l'ma talk
louder so Dr. Phil over here can hear me!

355
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,272
It ain't done, yet!

356
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,233
It can be done. l hear the
tracks are ready to master.

357
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,610
I ain't making no bootleg shit though,
dude.

358
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,363
Of course. l know that. But
it's really time to move, A-Maze.

359
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,533
You don't understand. Yo,
you make music? You make music?

360
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,369
Nah, you don't, you don't.
You work for Clay, nigger.

361
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,705
I wanna see Clay.
Where the fuck is Clay at?

362
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,332
Clay's right here.

363
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:26,130
Yo, what's up with my release date, man? He's
telling me shit l don't want to hear, man.

364
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,632
Let me talk
to him for a minute.

365
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,472
It's cool man. Let us holla.
I'm right behind you all.

366
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,765
Hey, Phil,
Phil. Hold on for a second.

367
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,060
Y'all pull the car
around out front, all right?

368
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,980
Can l talk to you for a second?

369
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,316
What the fuck is this all about?

370
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,152
Well, because it's you,

371
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,281
l'm gonna act like you didn't just
use the word fuck in my presence.

372
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:57,578
And that's just
gonna give you arthritis.

373
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:03,083
So, you wanna know what
the fuck this is all about?

374
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,169
Yeah, l mean, l don't
really get called

375
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,421
to be in your presence
all that much.

376
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,258
Yeah, we should spend more time
together. And you do need my advice.

377
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,803
Yeah, but l still got a problem
with changing my release date.

378
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,848
To be honest, you're
the problem right now.

379
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,852
I mean, the last album,
it didn't even go gold.

380
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,855
And we gotta to make something
happen in the market place.

381
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,484
I see. So you talking about
dropping me from the label?

382
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,569
Would l do that
to an old friend?

383
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,447
I'm saying 'cause l'm ready to go. Drop me,
l'm ready to go.

384
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,617
L'll just take my masters with me
and go make my own shit happen.

385
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,704
While you're at it, why don't you just pull
a Tina Turner and ask to keep my last name?

386
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,499
I know you're busy and everything,
but when you get a second,

387
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,627
l just wanna talk to you about the
label me and Maze are putting together.

388
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,004
You got my number?

389
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,007
Yeah, yeah, l've got your number,
but what l really wanna do is,

390
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,220
l wanna get you the CD of this new kid that
we're signing first. He's fresh. Fresh!

391
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,889
Can't wait to
hear it. Call me.

392
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,642
L'll call you.
It's fresh.

393
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,019
Why release now?

394
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:08,148
Because you generated a lot of heat
last night. And we can capitalize on it.

395
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:13,571
That's all well and good, but l'm not
finished with the album, yet. lt's not ready.

396
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,156
I think you might just be
worrying a little too much.

397
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,326
Somebody around this motherfucker
gotta worry about something.

398
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,495
All the pressure
is really on me.

399
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,040
From what l heard, the album is fire,
man. Back to the old you.

400
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,420
Listen, remember l told you,
l'm like Don King.

401
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,756
I can get you with any
and everybody in the ring.

402
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,803
But it's up to you to win the
fight. Let me just do my job.

403
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,519
The meeting is over, man.
This piece of shit.

404
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,780
Tyrone.

405
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,786
Brought my money?

406
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,955
Money? What you
talking about? For what?

407
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,541
We already paid for the
session. l just need a demo.

408
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,919
I got nothin' to say to you. l had to mix
and master that shit. That shit's extra.

409
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,172
No, Jay mixed it
and mastered it.

410
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,133
Pushing sliders doesn't
constitute mixing a track, okay?

411
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,802
He had me fix his
mixes after you left.

412
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,305
Whoa, wait, wait,
listen, listen, listen.

413
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,142
Okay, we got a meeting today.
And l mean it, it is huge.

414
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,895
You see the kind of cats l'm
rolling with right now, right?

415
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,274
This is your chance to be part of the dream.
This is serious. l mean, shit is gonna happen.

416
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,693
I get a chance to be
part of the dream?

417
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,739
This is what l'll do. l'm gonna take
your dream and l'm gonna take my 1,500.

418
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,785
How 'bout that? When you get the money,
you come holla at me.

419
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,580
It's business. Nothing
personal, bro. A'ight?

420
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,582
All right.

421
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,271
Coming.
L'll be right there.

422
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,745
Where've you been
out all these weeks?

423
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,663
Things, you know?

424
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,040
I thought we had
something poppin' though.

425
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:17,212
We do have something poppin'.
I take care of my shit, don't l?

426
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,590
This taking care of shit?

427
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:24,219
What? Why would
you say that?

428
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,765
I handle my business, don't l, babe?
Come on, you know. What's the problem?

429
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,433
E, this isn't enough!

430
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,435
It ain't ever enough.

431
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,937
Whatever.

432
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,356
Your baby with your moms?

433
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:41,612
So what else is it you really want,
E? You don't ever just stop by.

434
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,281
Keisha, you believe in me?

435
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,366
Yeah.

436
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,454
So l'ma keep it
a hundred then with you.

437
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,289
I need to borrow
some money. What?

438
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,374
I knew it.

439
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,628
No, listen. l promise you l'll
pay you back with interest.

440
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,755
Fuck it.

441
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,942
Smile for me, baby.

442
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,030
Don't be a stranger.

443
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,598
Naw, the one with
the donk, remember the...

444
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,977
Yo, Roman. lsn't that that
dude that deals for Green?

445
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,354
Yeah, the little
punk-ass from Lalo's.

446
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,022
You got some l D on you?

447
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,149
No, l don't have
any l D on me, sir.

448
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,361
That bitch better not be talkin'
about what he saw last night.

449
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,323
Yeah, l'm gonna have to have a word
with his bitch-ass a little later, too.

450
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,326
This chump looks
like a snitch, Roman.

451
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,671
Bo, turn that shit down, dude.

452
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:26,508
It's kinda fresh. l like
the rhyme on this joint.

453
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,218
What's wrong with
ou? You hungry?

454
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,596
No.

455
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,140
We can stop off at this chicken
place and get some take-out.

456
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,559
The place with
the double-fried extra crispy?

457
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,354
Yes, with the hot sauce, with the
French fries underneath, bread be soggy.

458
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,733
Yo, y'all motherfuckers need to
stop thinkin' with y'all guts, man.

459
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,527
We're going to the signing.
Fuck the chicken.

460
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,452
I'm just saying, if you're hungry,
we could stop and get some for later.

461
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,658
I hear you, but stop thinking
about all this little shit all the time.

462
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:55,579
We out here tryin' to do business.
Don't nothing else really even matter.

463
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:59,082
What you gonna do with a double
extra-crispy number three with sesame seeds

464
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,585
and shit you ain't even
got no money to buy it with.

465
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,087
I was just tryin' to look out for you,
but whatever.

466
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,881
Stay focused.

467
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,431
Shit! Gun it!
Gun it! Get down, man!

468
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,731
Where he at?

469
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,858
shit. They right on us. They followin'.

470
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,027
Why the fuck they chasin' us?

471
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,906
They bust a cap in the
broad daylight. Drive! Go, go!

472
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,283
Fuck!

473
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,039
Stay down!

474
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:51,134
He gone,
fuck! Get the fuck outta here, nigga!

475
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:56,056
That motherfucker shot at
us! What kinda shit is that?

476
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,601
Gary, pull that motherfuckin'
phone out and call Roman right now.

477
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,694
Yeah.

478
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,321
Yo, Roman, what up?
It's Gary. Maze's boy.

479
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,116
What's up,
fool? We was just talkin' about you.

480
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,451
We don't see you
round here much no more.

481
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,496
Yeah, l know. But look,
we gotta talk. Maze is in some shit.

482
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,001
I got it, l got it. Yo, Roman,
you heard what's up with me, right?

483
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,920
Shit, who ain't heard? Your
business is all in the streets.

484

Yes,

It wasn't me. l just

502
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,465
You got my money?

503

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,972
Motherfucker, you're gonna
clean that shit off my wall, bro.

505
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,641
I didn't do it.

506
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,705
You did that shit. You know how long it took
me to get that shit the way it's at now?

507
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,063
I didn't do it.

508
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,397
That's your tag!

509
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,815
No, it's not.

510
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,400
It's your motherfucking tag.

511
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,569
I just came for my demo.

512
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,155
For your demo? Clean
that fucking shit off my wall.

513
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,407
If you say so, lemme

514
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,182
Yo, what up?

515
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,767
Who you with, motherfucker!

516
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,852
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I ain't with nobody.

517
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,354
Who you with?

518
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,314
I ain't with nobody,
l'm a rapper!

519
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,610
You a fucking rapper? Bust me out a rhyme,
then! Now!

520
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,781
All right. l got no battle rap, but l
see y'all pullin up in the black Cadillac,

521
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,784
two dudes, guns in hand,
y'all are tellin' me l gotta rap.

522
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,370
Y'all put me on the spot?
To see if l'm hot?

523
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,039
Like a chick given
brains l go off the top.

524
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,125
This motherfucker ain't too bad.

525
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,919
Matter of fact,
l need goons for security op.

526
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,921
Real talk l don't claim no set.

527
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,715
I'm nothin' but a rapper
tryin' to get that check.

528
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,436
Hey, yo boss, man! Why we
going through all this trouble, man?

529
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,606
Maze is washed up, he ain't
even got a new album out or nothin'.

530
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,066
It doesn't matter.
He's still a name.

531
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,528
Plus, business is hurtin'. This
promotion's gonna be beneficial.

532
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,364
Yeah, especially after he
shot some nightclub up man.

533
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,451
Ain't nothin' like the smell of
death to bring out the dogs.

534
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,329
We should be getting
danger money for this man.

535
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,373
I'm putting my life on the line,
they're gonna come in here...

536
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,335
Look, all you gotta do is be
cool and sell some records, okay?

537
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,642
How you doin',
man? Actually l'm a part of A-Maze's crew.

538
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,644
No, l got a meeting with Gary.

539
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,645
What's your name?

540
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,313
Young Eastie.

541
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,690
I ain't got no Young
Easton on this list.

542
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,902
It ain't on the list. l'm here to meet
Gary. l gotta get the demo to him.

543
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,904
You gotta go to the
back like everybody else.

544
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,171
This place is an ambush.

545
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,220
You see that? That gotta get out of here,
after yesterday?

546
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:50,392
That shit gotta get out of my site.
Motherfuckers ain't got no sense.

547
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,893
What the fuck is wrong with you?

548
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,186
What's wrong, B?

549
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,521
What's this B-Bone shit?

550
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,273
I sell his records, too.

551
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,566
This is some bullshit.

552
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,737
No, don't worry about it, l got it. Shoes,
get rid of that thing, man.

This your shit right here?

557
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,971
Yeah, man, that's all

558
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,186
This is for you. There's a track,
l know you take it, you blow it up.

559
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,319
Let me slide through here
y'all real quick, please.

560
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,488
Yo, Gary! Yo, Gary!

561

Dude, move! You

A-Maze! Was that your gun

566
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,592
This is for fans only, a'ight?

567
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,678
Can you confirm there's a rap war
going on between yourself and B-Bone?

568
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,097
He made a statement already.

569
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,808
I can make your life real tough.
Don't screw with the Miami Herald.

570
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,811
Why don't you make my life
tough? See how far that gets you.

571
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,689
I got all the answers l want.

572
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,318
Take a picture of that.

573
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,278
You corny dawg!

574
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,822

Hey! Can l get a burger and a double

Do l look stupid to you?

What're you talking about?

615
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,482
Don't play me like a fool. You know
how long it took me to build this business?

616
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,068
No, l never thought about it.

617
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,530
You should think aboput it. You don't think
l know you're dealing out of the window?

618
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,115
Dealing what? l'm not
dealing out the window.

619
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,661
Green stuff. You know what it is. l been
hearing it for the last couple of months.

620
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,705
The green stuff. Come on,
stop playin' me like l'm a fuckin' nut.

621
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,291
Plus, my cash register's
been comin' up short lately.

622
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,337
First l'm dealin', now l'm stealing
from the register? What am l doing?

623
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,881
Do me a favor and
empty your pockets.

624
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,633
Empty my pockets?
No, that's illegal.

625
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,677
Empty your pockets.
I'm gonna ask you again.

626
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,804
I'm not emptying my pockets.

627
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:41,015
Empty your pockets. l can do
whatever l want to in my store.

628
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,101
How 'bout l don't work
in your store now?

629
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,728
How about you empty
your fuckin' pockets?

630
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,064
Why don't you empty
you're fucking pockets?

631
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,484
You come in here and play
with my fucking business?

632
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,987
Play games with me,
motherfucker!

633
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,407
Come on! Come on!
I wish the fuck you would!

634
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,034
Get out of my business,
you son of a bitch!

635
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,997
You're fucking around with my business,
you understand me? Young bastard!

636
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,591
Hey, you put that shit on my fucking wall,
and l'll call the fucking cops on you.

637
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,259
L'll put it on your wall.

638
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,429
I know where you live,
you son of a bitch.

639
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:23,891
Okay. You come back around here
and see if l don't call the cops on you.

640
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,686
Lock your little black ass up.

641
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,865
Look at this little nigger Maze.

642
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,242
I thought he'd be layin'
low after last night.

643
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,078
Hey, what would you do?
He do got me feeling though

644
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,165
like he set the whole thing up
last night as a publicity stunt.

645
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,043
Yeah, probably so, but, you know,
he ain't pulled the trigger.

646
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,046
Bitch-ass nigger got somebody
else doing his dirty work.

647
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,798
Yeah, they usually do.

648

Same shit different bowl, baby.
Oatmeal better than no meal, you know.

654
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,984
We might need to talk,
you know what l'm saying?

655
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,236
I can help you out on
that management thing.

656
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,822
If you feelin' like your
people ain't up to par.

657
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,450
See that, Gary? Motherfucker's
tryin' to get your position.

658
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,994
He's trying to be a comedian,
that's what he's trying to do.

659
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,955
He a comedian?
We see y'all in a minute.

660
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,417

00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,422
Fuck him.

663
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,632
Green is green.

664
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,177
We got money.

665
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,306
I talked to Kelly Pearson, Jimmy Bailey,
nobody wants to work with this guy.

666
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,768
Any studio... Here
he comes. A-Maze!

667
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,645
What up, Mark?

668
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,981

669
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,776
I been doing things. l'm

670
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,529
Yeah, l know you're busy. This is Jennifer,
my assistant.

671
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,031
How you doing, baby?
A-Maze here.

672
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,825
Jennifer, Gary.

673
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,035
So, wassup?

674
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,456
The craziest thing has happened.
I'm gonna have to cancel, guys.

675
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:14,961
We just got a call from Los Angeles.
They need me there to tie up loose ends.

676
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,840
The producer's pulling his hair out,
as they do, you know, in emergencies.

677
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:23,302
But, um, let's, 
let's reschedule, for sure. Okay?

678
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,556
Can you ASAP them?
And we'll get you in there,

679
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,393
and we'll make you a movie star,
and l'll see you soon, okay?

680
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,520
That's what's up.

681
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,731
All right. Good seeing you.

682
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,401
You guys, you're taken
care of, anything you want.

683
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,154
He's bullshitting you.

684
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,489
We should probably just go then.

685
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,618
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me,
let me holla at her for a second.

686
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,247
Jennifer, right?

687
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,332
You say he's lying to me?

688
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,585
They all lie, sweetie,
but he's scared.

689
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,086
Shit, cuz of last night?

690
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,880
What do you think?

691
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,008
But like, now what?
You know what l mean?

692
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,552
I was counting
on this, you know?

693
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:09,599
Well, if it was left up to me, l would
say there isn't any prospect of any movie.

694
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,685
Unless you're willing
to talk about other options.

695
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,438
You making a pitch to me, Mama?

696
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,357
Absolutely.

697
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,861
Yeah? Keep pitching to me,
Mama. Keep bringin' it.

698
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,363
You know,
l feel like makin' it rain tonight, man.

699
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,283
Let's go over to Cleo's. See
some strippers or somethin'.

700
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,701
Gary, what's good?

701
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,037
It's all good.

702
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,582
For real though, you need to get
Maze some professional help right now.

703
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:40,421
Okay. Ja, look. l know your last tour
wasn't promoted too fuckin' well, right?

704
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,881
I got some people for that.

705
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,091
Is that right?

706
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,427
Yeah. And me and Maze
we're starting this little label.

707
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,138
It's artist friendly,
no fuckin' suits, you know?

708
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,766
So when you ready to drop this idiot,
just hit me up.

709
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,561
Hold up. First of all,
don't be approaching my client like that.

710
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,980
I'm just letting him know
what the business is.

711
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,108
You holla at me. l'll pass that
information along. You know what l mean?

712
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,403
Listen, y'all be easy. Let's
resolve this like men here.

713
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:07,365
Go outside and fucking fight!

714
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,495
You should come to my
show. l got a show tonight.

715
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,997
I dunno, it's not
really my scene.

716
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,125
You ain't gotta be worried about the
scene. You ain't gotta be afraid of me.

717
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,420
That shit last night? Don't let that
shit scare you. You can save that.

718
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:26,259
Come. l got you well-protected. Big strong
guy over in this motherfucker right here.

719
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,636
You can bring whoever you want.

720
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,847
Whoever l want? Okay.

721
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,600
Dude, did you see her, dude?

722
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,855
Put her on the list plus zero,
nigger. Her Mama can't come to the show.

723
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,691
I'm dead ass serious, she mine.

724
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,304
Hey, hey, hey!

725
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,473
Hey, yo, boy lemme holla at ya.

726
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,433
With a gun?

727
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,834
Who's that? Who's there?

728
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,378
What are you doing
home at this time?

729
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,130
Mom, it was an early day.

730
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,549
Don't bullshit me.
You get fired?

731
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,468
I quit.

732
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,219
What you mean you quit?

733
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,555
I quit. lt wasn't doin'
nothing for me so l left.

734
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,307
What am l gonna do wit you?

735
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,350
Mom, it didn't pay
for anything anyway.

736
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,062
You are wearing me down
with all this trouble you causin'.

737
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,938
I got other prospects.

738
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,025
Prospects? You a dreamer!
Either that or a damn fool!

739
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,736
I can't go through all
that again! Not again!

740
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,239
Relax, Mom! No, no, look,
l got everything under control.

741
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,409
You got everything under control.
You know what? l quit on you.

742
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,663
Runnin' around here on fancy ideas
and useless promises, that don't pay!

743
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:28,209
Now you takin' food outta my
babies' mouths! l quit on you!

744
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,502
You don't mean that!

745
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,170
I mean it!

746
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,672
I buy the food
and l pay the bills!

747
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,550
You pay the bills? You don't like that,
do you? You don't like it?

748
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,719
You go out there,
take charge, and be a man.

749
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:44,517
You go out there and be
a man! You don't like it?

750
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,938
Take charge, be a man, but you not gonna
worry me into grey hairs before my time!

751
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,523
You're not!

752
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,774
I can't do this right now.

753
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,692
It won't be my concern.

754
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,903
Please, stop.

755
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,286
You ain't leaving us?

756
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,624
Of course not. You know
Mom. She had a bad day.

757
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,918
Where you going?

758
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,753
Jay's l guess.

759
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,381
I can't live here
with Venice and Mom.

760
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,383
L'll go crazy and leave, too.

761
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,260
Naw, you're not gonna do that.

762
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,845
I will.

763
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,972
Then it'd be me
and you, you know that?

764
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,266
Can l go now?

765
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:37,111
I won't be gone long,
all right? All right?

766
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,834
Yo, Jay, what's up, man? Yo,
you mind if l crash at your crib for a bit?

767
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,421
Yeah, again.

768
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:59,675
No, Del South Records
was a bust. l'll explain later, B.

769
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,804
Yeah, you know, it's all good, 'cause we
gonna meet up with A-Maze tonight at H2O.

770
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,265
Yup, you know it.

00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,351
I'm telling
you, man. A'ight?

772

A'ight. Peace. Yeah.

775
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,628
Hip-hop rappers, where is it?

776
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,296
Where's fucking A-Maze?

777
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,673
We called him five
times already. No reply.

778
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,509
This hip-hop prima donna
shit is driving me crazy.

779
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:46,222
I understand. l'm gonna get things
set up so we don't lose a day waiting.

780
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,558
Hey, there he is.

00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,478
A-Maze! How

782
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,563
I'm blessed by the best man.

I'm glad to see
you here, too, man.

784
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,652
Where's Selahsi at?

Selahsi is in that trailer

It's your first video, right?

815
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,747
Nah, man,

That's what's up. Lemme holla

You know like, private,

00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,921
Outside's as private as it's gonna get big,
homie.

819
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:47,426
What'd l tell you about hangin' out with
these punk-ass mo'fuckers hanging on you shit?

820
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,304
My nigger, they're my peoples,
my nigger, my riders.

821
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,556
I can't just tell 'em to get lost,
big homie.

822
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,352
I know the story, nigger,
just be aware. Look at the trouble l'm in.

823
00:55:56,436 --> 00:56:00,147
Bitch-ass nigger should've never started
no problems with you in the first place.

824
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,524
Yeah, well,
we just learned the mo'fucker gonna live.

825
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,943
He gonna live to come at me
another mo'fucking day, too.

826
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,706
Shit, all the more reason to get
our mo'fucking drink on then, right?

827
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,783
Cuz life ain't promised. Tomorrow
l might now be here, my nigger.

828
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,327
Hey, that's why l fuck wit you right now,
man.

829
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,828
Real talk, my nigger.

830
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,830
Maze! We need you on set!

831
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,375
That's me. They're tryin' to
get me to come over there.

832
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,543
My nigger. Cheah bah. B!

833
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,255
What the fuck is that?

834
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,340
♫ I go hard in the paint ♫

835
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:16,383
♫ Hard in the paint

836
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,518
♫ Hard in the paint ♫

837
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,187
Cut! Cut! Cut!

838
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,275
Great, Maze, great. Hold that snarl,
tough, all right?

839
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,862
How the hell did these
guys get on my set?

840
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:33,198
Naw, don't worry about 'em.

841
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,868
We just need to ask
you some questions, man.

842
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,286
Nothin' official.

843
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,996
No handcuffs, no shit like that?

844
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,123
No,
not unless you're guilty of something.

845
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,584
We just wanted to have
some friendly chit-chat.

846
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:47,379
I ain't got too much to say. We
could talk about whatever, you know?

847
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:52,217
'Cause we wanna help you out, and if you
talk to us, we can help you out of your spot.

848
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,721
One fucking tight spot. Man,
l wouldn't wanna be your ass.

849
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,473
I'm doing my business, man.

850
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,559
Yeah? l bet you. That
other guys, what's...

851
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,896
I bet you his peeps, his homies,
they ain't too happy with you.

852
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,066
I'm pretty certain the way you people
operate, they're looking for some payback.

853
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,569
Okay. Anyway,
l don't got shit to say about it.

854
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,571
What was that guy's name?

855
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,573
Bones something.

856
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,992
B-Bone. Y'all
are funny, man.

857
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:21,747
No, that ain't his real name,
man. lt's Carl. Carl Washington.

858
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,125
The guy's 22 and he and his
friends got a bit of a history.

859
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,504
They could be around here right
now. Course, we couldn't do shit about it.

860
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:32,341
You got my whole story. l ain't
got shit else to add to it, l mean...

861
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,593
Look, we're just trying
to help you out, man.

862
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,428
I guess he don't
need any help then.

863
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,096
Guess not.

864
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,848
You guys are fucking comedians.

865
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,017
really? 'Cause we're not being funny

866
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,770
'cause we already know the
word's out on the street to get you.

867
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,313
Streets like where?
Streets what?

868
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,899
Now who's being the comedian?

869
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:52,277
Look, here's the deal. We don't
want you or your boys shooting anyone.

870
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,824
If there's so much as a stone
thrown between you and this B-Bone,

871
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,702
consider yourself finished.

872
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,206
Yeah, thanks for all
the extra special protection.

873
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,793
Here's my card. Call me
if you change your mind.

874
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:12,965
Say, brother,
can l get an autograph? My kid's a big fan.

875
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,133
Next time!

876
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,553
That's cold.
That is cold.

877
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,430
I didn't know your
kid listened to that.

878
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,828
What up?

879
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,043
So what's the next
move here, bro?

880
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,921
Same as before. Gonna
get the material down to Gary

881
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,383
and get that meeting with Gary
and A-Maze. l almost got to 'em.

882
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,594
This motherfucker knocked
the CD outta my hand.

883
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,220
You lost the CD?

884
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,347
No, l didn't lose it.
They cracked it.

885
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,891
And they almost
trampled me in the store.

886
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,272
L'll just get a new case
for it. That aint nothin'.

887
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,025
Fuck it, man.
We got this far.

888
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:17,863
Ain't nothin' gonna stop us. Not no Roman,
no bullet, nothin'.

889
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:22,534
I know just the way we
can handle it. Be right back.

890
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,882
This thing right here?

891
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,468
Don't nobody know
l got this thing.

892
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,471
What are we supposed to
do with that? Shoot Roman?

893
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:46,099
Nah, l mean, do whatever.
Handle your business.

894
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:52,898
Nah, put that away, man. l ain't tryin'
to fuck up my career, man. l'm good.

895
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,234

They're gonna come out

We're gonna let the whole world know how

01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,718

You thought you gonna pull that
shit on a homie and get away with it?

978
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:43,772
You's a dead man walking
and you don't even realize it.

979
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,191
When l catch your bitch-ass,

980
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,693
and put it in a bag and ship

I swear to God on everything l
love. lt's a wrap for you, homie.

982
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:58,954
They say they know where we at.

I hear gunshots go off. They come tell me,

1032
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,072
I can't go out tonight.

1033
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,552
It's A-Maze's show! l got backstage
passes! Let's go have some fun.

1034
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,595
I cannot just leave like

1035
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,662
Drop the baby at
your mom's house!

1036
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,456
My mom is not available for
whenever you decide to drop by, E.

1037
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:33,668
No, Keisha, this is serious. She
would understand this one, trust me.

1038
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:37,422
I can't do this. You can come in here
and be with me. l'll cook you something.

1039
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:41,259
No! Okay, Keisha,
l got a meeting with A-Maze and his people.

1040
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,928
So that's what
all this is about.

1041
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:47,265
You wanna meet with someone
and you want me to drive you up there.

1042
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,767
I thought we could mix
business with pleasure.

1043
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,855
I am so sick of this. Come in
here and be with me, or just leave.

1044
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,107
Keisha, come on,
please, don't test me.

But l think you should listen

1145
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:11,375
What are you doing? Like you said,
l ain't got the time, man.

1146
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,128
What do you mean? l'm
thinkin' about the label, man.

1147
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:17,465
Look, l understand that this

01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,355
I could lose all my money.

1153
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:35,274
What l'm saying is,
if you let me handle it, let me handle it,

1154
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,693
you won't have to give
it a second thought.

01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:51,832
Whatever. The motherfucker's
eyes is buggin' out of his head, dude.

He got a new single, so don't let

1192
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,225
The new single is Just
Another Day On The Block.

1193
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,520
So everybody in
here from the block,

1194
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:28,901

up for my big homie, A-Maze!

1195
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:31,612
It's hotter than

1196
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:36,909
Rock that shit, Maze!

1197
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:25,642
Hey, let's get outta here,
pack up fast and we can go, man.

1198
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:27,394
I'm on it, l'm on it.

1199
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,646
You must be exhausted.

1200
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:33,317
Naw, l ain't exhausted.
I can go all night.

1201
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:35,069
You're so damn sure of yourself.

1202
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,863
I am. When
l'm around you.

1203
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:40,407
So why don't you stick around?

1204
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:47,331
You gotta make
sure you let me get through.

1205
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:51,710
It's all good. Don't
be grabbin' my shit.

1206
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:59,593
A-Maze! Hey, Maze!

1207
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:01,220
That's how you treat a nigger?

1208
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:03,347
Go clean yourself up.

1209
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,016
That's how you treat a nigger
who's trying to come up, right?

1210
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,143
You just toss my shit?

1211
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:11,146
Don't talk to me like l owe you
somethin'. l don't owe you shit!

1212
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:14,358
I'm standing right here,
you got somethin' to say to me, say it.

1213
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,902
You gonna spit somethin' to me,

01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:22,783
Show me what you got!
Spit somethin'!

1215
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:26,578
Nigger, l'm goin'
through it. l feel like l'm fina lose it.

1216
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:29,373
Nobody ever told you Young
Eastie about to reveal it.

1217
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:32,251
Hustlin' at Lalo's
sellin' that green shit.

1218
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:34,962
Every other day it was to
get you to hear my music.

1219
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:37,214
You push me to the left
like Beyonce did.

1220
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,633
Aggravation got me
feelin' like Billy the Kid.

1221
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,885
Frustrated the nigger
made it through,

1222
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,721
only to find out that my mama
done gave me the motherfuckin' boot.

1223
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,141
Back hit the door and now
my bed is on Jay's floor.

1224
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:49,726
Had to switch my style up,
quick go south-poor.

1225
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:52,980
Bout to blow like a skinny bitch on insure,
sicker than herpe sores.

1226
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:55,149
Why you wanna hurt
me for, keep me poor.

1227
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,817
Matter of fact, fuck all y'all.

1228
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:05,742
Yo man, l'm good at
what l do so l make it look easy.

1229
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:10,747
I n the Vl P section where the Gs be,
you'll see me, A to the Z E,

1230
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,917
straight up out the hood
on your motherfuckin' TV.

1231
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:19,590
And you don't think l paid dues in the streets
where you die if you lose, Young Eastie?

1232
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:24,344
Look, l'm really surprised. l thought
what l saw was the fire in your eyes.

1233
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,805
But now you're seeing the beast,

1234
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,975
and what l'm lookin at in you,
is somethin' to fuckin' eat.

1235
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:33,187
So go home back to your mama,
and see if she lets you in.

1236
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,356
Do it all again,
'cause l don't wanna have to murder you.

1237
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,942
Besides, ain't nobody

1238
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,531
Nah, no, no,

1239
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:47,910
You all right at what you doin' right now,
you know what l'm sayin'?

1240
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:51,705
You could get better,
you a'ight though! You all right.

1241
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:53,707
Yeah, just stay active, homie.

1242
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,834
What was all that about?

1243
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:58,128
L'll just explain to you later.

1244
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,717
That's what it is.
Did you see it?

1245
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,345
You see his face?
That nigger was shook.

1246
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:09,223
We goin' to the club.

1247
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:13,393
Get in, man, hurry, hurry.

1248
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:16,980
That's the shit l'm talkin' about.
That's the shit we gonna capture on wax.

1249
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:20,567
The timing is now. lt's
right now. And he sees it!

1250
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,320
But fuck him! Maze,
l'm talking about Clay!

1251
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:27,199
So you're sayin' we're gonna sign,
we want him to sign me now?

1252
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:30,077
It's the label we got
together. lt's gonna be fresh!

1253
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:41,088
Yo, Maze! Fuck!

1254
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:46,510
I need an
ambulance. Please.

1255
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:52,432
Fuckin' right now!

1256
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:11,493
Well.

1257
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:18,625
There it is.
Your contract.

1258
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:24,298
Now, before you sign this,
l want you to take a minute to think,

1259
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:28,135
because l know this is what
you've been dreaming of all your life.

1260
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:33,557
But, son, some dreams
become nightmares.

1261
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:38,979
When you sign this,
your life is no longer your own.

1262
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:42,566
There'll be cousins that you
never seen at any family reunion.

1263
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:46,278
Chicks that can't even get pregnant,
calling Maury Povich.

1264
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:49,072
Friends that agree with
whatever the fuck you saying

1265
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,575
just as long as you
picking up the check.

1266
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,619
Cats waiting for you to give
them a stimulus package.

1267
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,497
And relatives that have
been there since day one,

1268
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:01,668
who always knew little Eastie was
gonna make something out of himself.

1269
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,463
And that's not even
counting the haters,

1270
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:07,257
the critics,

1271
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:12,971
little knuckleheads that's trying
to step to you, runnin' up on you.

1272
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:17,142
Now, if you can deal
with all that.

1273
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,729
Sign.

1274
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:25,067
But if you have the slightest doubt
in your mind, and l mean the slightest,

1275
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,197
then we can end
this meeting right now.
