your back on me.

Are you afraid of
an old man like me?

378

You will call me Papa Legba.

379
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:11,351
No, I want nothing to do
with the spirit world.

380

Open your eyes, child.

chosen by the Oracle.

What do you want?

You don't address me like that!

I know Mami taught you that.

Yes, Papa Legba.

386
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:38,444
My purpose needs
your human form.

Crack is growing more
powerful than me.

388

I'm not strong enough.

Think of power

Is that why she died?

I could teach you
to take that power.

428
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,905
Had to barter with good

00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:56,196
Come back with that.

552
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:02,402
‐I'm hungry.
‐Oh, OK, you know what?

553
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:04,505
Get back over here.

554
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:06,206
Right here.

555
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,474
That's right.

556
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,010
Yeah.

557
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:33,033
[Ti‐Jeanne]
Melba!

558
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:36,236
[whip cracking]

559
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:41,675
[Crack]
Melba, stop.

560
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,077
I was this close to being
Rudy's right hand,

561
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,479
and then, you had
to go run away

562
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:49,115
and miss your doses.

563
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:50,651
[gasps]

564
00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:52,418
Crack.

565
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:08,702
16 and a half more
Buff injections,

566
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:13,640
and I will deliver a
smart slave to Rudy.

567
00:51:13,674 --> 00:51:15,275
Docile, but

568
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:17,644
coherent enough to
follow directions.

569
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:21,447
Rudy won't call
my experiment stupid

570
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:25,118
when he sells you to the
wealthy Burbians, Melba.

571
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:30,190
He called me old and stupid

572
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:32,793
wasting his Buff.

573
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:36,396
Oh.

574
00:51:38,899 --> 00:51:41,434
No, please.

575
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,169
Give it back!

576
00:51:45,706 --> 00:51:48,308
Your son is in the Burbs.

577
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,650
Only way to get there.

578
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:02,823
[Papa Legba] Open your eyes
when you're afraid

579
00:52:02,856 --> 00:52:05,291
so you can see what to do.

580
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:14,334
[grunts]

581
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:39,459
[wristband chiming]

582
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:41,728
[Rudy]
Don't scar her.

583
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:45,566
[whip cracking]

584
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,201
Stay away from Melba.

585
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:05,519
[Mami]
You have to stop Crack.

586
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,367
[Ti‐Jeanne] Bruk Foot?

587
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:23,504
Ti‐Jeanne.

588
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,405
I saw Crack.

589
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:28,374
No one sees Crack.

590
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:30,911
She wouldn't dirty herself
coming around here.

591
00:53:33,814 --> 00:53:35,448
Bruk Foot.

592
00:53:35,481 --> 00:53:37,818
Crack is using Buff
to make a smart slave.

593
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:42,556
She showed herself to you?

594
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:43,757
Yes.

595
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:54,568
Crack's lost favor with Rudy.

596
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:56,236
She's desperate.

597
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,609
Open up to Papa Legba.

598
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:05,011
Open your eyes to see.

599
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:08,014
I left that behind.

600
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:10,751
I'm a healer now.

601
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:12,786
Those who reject their
gifts cause more havoc

602
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:14,320
than those without.

603
00:54:20,326 --> 00:54:22,428
[Mami]
Ti‐Jeanne.

604
00:54:23,964 --> 00:54:25,632
Ti‐Jeanne, you have to stop it.

605
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,500
You can't stop Crack
on your own.

606
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:30,637
You need the power
of the spirits.

607
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:35,408
[Ti‐Jeanne]
No, I'll die.

608
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:36,810
[Mami]
Be the priestess your
mother was meant to be.

609
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:38,545
[Ti‐Jeanne]
No!

610
00:54:40,814 --> 00:54:42,883
[electric static]

611
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:45,586
[Papa Legba]
My purpose needs a human form.

612
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:02,035
Melba?

613
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:03,604
Melba!

614
00:55:07,073 --> 00:55:08,942
Melba.

615
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:10,777
I can help you.

616
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:15,749
[Crack]
Baby girl.

617
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:23,356
You young people, you think
you're never gonna get old.

618
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:25,592
And Rudy likes shiny things.

619
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:28,128
But you, too,
will soon be obsolete.

620
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:29,730
[Ti‐Jeanne gasps]

621
00:55:29,763 --> 00:55:33,499
Rudy's order.
Stop your healing.

622
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:37,037
It's working too well.

623
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:41,007
Unless you want to share your
little techniques with him.

624
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:46,012
Hm?

625
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:47,514
Not yet?

626
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:52,553
This whip doesn't have
to touch your shiny skin

627
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:54,020
to cause pain.

628
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:50,777
[Ti‐Jeanne] I need water now.
I need water now!

629
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:52,679
It's OK, OK?
Don't worry about it.

630
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:55,582
No, no, I need water so I can
make my anti‐Buff mixture.

631
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:57,951
Anti‐Buff?
Crack isn't gonna like you

632
00:56:57,984 --> 00:56:59,620
messing around with
her Buff business.

633
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:01,021
Who's side are you on?

634
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:02,523
Yours.

635
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:04,190
‐Always yours.
‐Then act like it!

636
00:57:04,224 --> 00:57:05,792
Help me!

637
00:57:16,537 --> 00:57:19,172
What is that?

638
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:22,776
Ah, you know Sam. He's always
tinkering with something.

639
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:26,547
What's wrong?

640
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:30,250
So no more bike repair.

641
00:57:30,283 --> 00:57:31,985
She put the word out.

642
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:36,623
I'm worried about you.

643
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:39,492
Crack shutting me down must
be to send a message to you.

644
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:43,496
So stop making your
anti‐Buff potions, please.

645
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:45,932
Posse came by.

646
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:47,634
They want me to do
deliveries for them.

647
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:48,802
[Ti‐Jeanne]
No, Tony.

648
00:57:48,835 --> 00:57:51,071
Not Buff. Just
general deliveries.

649
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:53,774
First, you fix their bixes,
then general deliveries,

650
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:56,543
and then, you're dealing Buff.
We can beat Crack.

651
00:58:10,957 --> 00:58:12,559
Where's your bike?

652
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,160
Posse stole it.

653
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:17,564
Their way of responding
to my "No, thank you,"

654
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:19,132
for not delivering for them.

655
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,238
What do you want me to do, huh?

656
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:27,140
‐Believe in me.
‐Believe in you?

657
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:29,075
‐Believe in me!
‐Believe in you?

658
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:31,011
Ti‐Jeanne, believe this.

659
00:58:31,044 --> 00:58:34,781
You're asking me to watch you
die by not working for Crack.

660
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:37,718
Papa Legba lives here.

661
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:39,620
Papa Legba? No one lives here!

662
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:40,654
Ti‐Jeanne,
you're talking crazy!

663
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:42,155
I'm not crazy!

664
00:58:42,188 --> 00:58:43,924
Papa Legba lives here!

665
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:45,559
[Tony] Ti‐Jeanne, stop.
No one lives here!

666
00:58:45,592 --> 00:58:49,129
We promised, OK?
We promised no spirit business.

667
00:58:49,162 --> 00:58:52,298
[Ti‐Jeanne] We made
a lot of promises.

668
00:58:52,332 --> 00:58:54,167
No working for Crack.

669
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,969
[Tony] Well, what do
you want me to do?

670
00:59:03,777 --> 00:59:06,112
Not the heater.

671
00:59:06,146 --> 00:59:08,549
Barter the propane stove.

672
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,885
Not yet, Ti.

673
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:13,253
Not yet.

674
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,769
[no audio]

675
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,654
[Ti‐Jeanne] I was wrong.

676
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:49,690
We need help to stop Crack.

677
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:51,758
How?

678
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:53,326
Papa Legba.

679
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:59,299
My aunt put me on a raft
and we tried crossing

680
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:01,234
that toxic lake.

681
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:05,371
It tipped. She tried
to save me by diving

682
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:08,341
back into that water and
carry me back to the shore.

683
01:00:11,144 --> 01:00:13,880
The toxins finally ate
her when I was 14.

684
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,952
OK, don't tell me the
spirits are gonna help us.

685
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:20,353
Did they help my family?

686
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:39,806
Melba.

687
01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:43,944
Melba.

688
01:00:46,246 --> 01:00:48,381
Melba! Melba.

689
01:00:50,016 --> 01:00:51,417
[groans]

690
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:55,121
It's still reddish.

691
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:59,059
‐You haven't taken Buff
recently, have you?
‐No! No, no, no.

692
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:00,994
You have to help me.

693
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:03,697
Please.

694
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,098
[sobbing]

695
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,036
This is my last bottle,
I'm sorry.

696
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:17,443
Hide, Melba.

697
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,373
Melba?

698
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:49,209
No. No!

699
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:51,712
No, no, no, no.

700
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,251
[whip cracking]

701
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:04,457
‐You killed her.
‐No, you killed her!

702
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,760
You can't mix Datura with Buff.

703
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:08,529
I thought she had
stopped taking Buff.

704
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:10,463
Liar!

705
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:13,033
She wasn't yours to mess with.
She was mine.

706
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,202
She was my experiment.

707
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:20,140
I am gonna deliver you
to Rudy as a follower.

708
01:02:21,274 --> 01:02:23,176
Won't that be a coup.

709
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:25,345
Mami's granddaughter

710
01:02:25,378 --> 01:02:26,980
on his side.

711
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,995
Papa Legba! Papa Legba!

712
01:02:43,396 --> 01:02:47,167
Papa Legba, I killed Melba!

713
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,170
You're learning to address
me with respect.

714
01:02:50,203 --> 01:02:51,838
I killed Melba.

715
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:53,039
You're ready to open now?

716
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:56,076
I'm scared.

717
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,812
Is that what you're studying
when your people are dying?

718
01:03:01,481 --> 01:03:05,519
The less you are afraid,
the stronger conduit you are.

719
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:08,288
If I face my mother's death,

720
01:03:08,321 --> 01:03:11,091
I would be more
open to you, right?

721
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:12,593
Less afraid.

722
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:14,160
Yes.

723
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:18,999
Ask Bruk Foot Sam to help you.

724
01:03:19,032 --> 01:03:20,466
OK.

725
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,235
I'll do that first, Papa Legba.

726
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:34,080
[Bruk Foot]
Why am I here, Ti‐Jeanne?

727
01:03:36,182 --> 01:03:38,552
Help me conquer
that memory.

728
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:41,221
You were there.

729
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:45,826
Yes, it will
make you stronger.

730
01:03:48,962 --> 01:03:51,097
