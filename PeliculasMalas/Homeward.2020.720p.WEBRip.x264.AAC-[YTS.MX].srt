00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,264
- You don't know how
to patch a tire.

359
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:44,033
You blow stuff up, slime it,
stick stuff together.

360
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:46,002
- Stick stuff together?

361
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:48,404
Oh, we can make a patch!

362
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:52,942
Can I borrow your gum?

363
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,977
- Sure, Mr. Monster.

364
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:58,381
- Thanks.

365
00:19:58,383 --> 00:20:00,449
All right, Lloyd.
You're up!

366
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,818
- Me?
What am I supposed to do?

367
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,919
- Uh, how about a wind spell?

368
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:06,355
- Why do you want me
to blow them away?

369
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:07,290
- To inflate their tire.

370
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:10,660
Wow, you're the smart one,
remember?

371
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:12,828
- Ugh.

372
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:15,364
- What is he doing?

373
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:18,768
- I think he's getting into
a magic mood or something.

374
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,736
- What's he doing now?

375
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,004
- Oh, all elves
have a magic bag.

376
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:24,706
They can do anything.
You'll see.

377
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,475
- Glockenspiel!
Banana peel!

378
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,511
Inflate the Wheel!

- Aw, man! Come on!

385
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:56,471
- You put gum on a hole, Barl!

386

- Use what you have. Jeez!

387
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,809
It's not like
I've fixed a tire before.

388
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:02,610
I don't even drive.

389
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:04,945
- Exactly!
Now move it, please.

390
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,047
I'm the smart one, remember?

391
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:10,918
- It's okay.
That was a very funny noise.

392
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:15,923
- Austero!
Comparo!

- Lloyd!

397
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,674
- It just used a little
too much magic.

398
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:36,543
- Thank you again,
the both of you.

399
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,713
- Bye, Mr. Monster!
Smell you later!

- Bye!

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,438
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

403

Take me to New Orc City.

404
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:15,415
- I'm so glad you finally
see things my way, Barl.

405
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,518
- Hey, does your kidnapping
include eating?

406
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,787
I haven't eaten
since I went to bed.

407
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:23,122
And I usually eat about
15 times before morning.

408
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,758
- We'll stop tonight and
get there in the morning.

- Stop tonight and
maybe we could eat?

410

I'd love some sleep dinner,

maybe some sleep dessert,
maybe both.

412
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:37,068
- Yes, I understand, Mom.

413
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,771
But I really think
it's important for me

414
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:42,140
to bond with Barl right now.

415
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:45,444
This is gonna be my
last time with him

to Krune University.

Yes, of course, I'm gonna
be back for graduation.

she'd make us turn around!

- And what happens when you
come home and I'm not there?

or did you stink it all up?

know about the orc discount.

00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,941
- That's a lot of moon dew.

712
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:08,077
It'll be pretty expensive.

713
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,846
- Oh, hold on. Scrap?

714
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:13,648
- You havin' trouble?

715
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,116
- Yeah, what's the problem?

716
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:18,019
- No problem.
Mr. Hodges...

717
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:19,020
- What? Me?

718
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:21,689
- ...was saying the moon
dew we need is expensive.

719
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,492
Do you have any money?
I only have a few dollars.

720
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:26,361
- I thought we had
a discount here.

721
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:32,834
- Oh, of course, Mr. Thomble,
your discount.

722
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:36,604
- How much is it
with the discount?

723
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,139
- It's on the house.

724
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:41,442
- Barl, just accept
the man's gift.

725
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,610
- Thank you, Mr. Hodges.

726
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,945
- I don't want any trouble now.

727
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:47,048
I run a respectable
business here.

728
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,850
- You's have a good day.

729
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:50,451
- Oh, thanks.

730
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,687
- Wow! Orcs are really nice.

731
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:56,390
- Yeah, sure, kid.
Sweet as daisies.

732
00:38:56,392 --> 00:39:00,660
- Hop on, Barl.
Let's get this next ingredient.

733
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:03,964
- I was saying we're having a...

734
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,100
sale on goblin vine today.

735
00:39:07,102 --> 00:39:10,504
And you can just have it.

736
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:11,605
We have too much of it anyway.

737
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,840
- Hey! No! No!
- It's such a good ingredient.

738
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:17,577
- Yep. Sure is!
Well, enjoy.

739
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,579
We're closing early today!

740
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:21,615
- Bad plant, bad plant!
No! Stop!

741
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:24,818
- That's the second store
that's given us a deal today.

742
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,953
Is that right?
Feels weird.

743
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,889
- Don't worry about it, Barl.

744
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:30,891
Just... Are you getting
what you need?

745
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:33,093
- Oh, yeah.
Just one and it should be great.

746
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:38,564
- And what's that?
- Air crystals.

747
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:45,938
- Hey, what are you doing?
Ow!

748
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,880
- Excuse me.

749
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:58,117
Have you seen this orc?

750
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:03,856
Sorry. I didn't have a photo,
so I just drew this.

751
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:06,091
But he looks like an orc.

752
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:09,228
He's big like you

753
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,766
with big hands...
like you.

754
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:15,968
But you seem angrier.

755
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:27,512
Well, hey there.
You look familiar.

756
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:30,081
- You ever seen anything
like that before?

757
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,183
- We have the same
statue in Elfdale.

758
00:40:32,185 --> 00:40:34,919
- Statue?
No, you silly elf.

759
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:37,489
This hot dog.
Relish its beauty.

760
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:43,561
Be a wiener and enjoy the taste
of this delectable treat.

761
00:40:43,563 --> 00:40:44,229
Hot buns?

762
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:48,933
- You can't... look,
I'm trying to find my brother.

763
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:50,969
- Hmm.

764
00:40:52,506 --> 00:40:55,173
I see things around here.

765
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:57,575
- Have you seen my brother?

766
00:40:58,078 --> 00:40:59,109
- Hmm.

767
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:01,278
Ah. Oh.

768
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,580
Two dollars and
I'll tell you everything.

769
00:41:03,582 --> 00:41:09,019
And if you make it a dollar
more, I'll throw in a hot dog.

770
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:12,556
Two dollars, no hot dog.

771
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:14,658
Nope. Haven't seen him.

772
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,295
- Wait! Look again, please?

773
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:23,200
- Hmm.

774
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:24,201
Twins?

775
00:41:24,203 --> 00:41:27,571
- What? No!
I'm an elf.

776
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:28,639
He's an orc.

777
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:30,040
- Fraternity brothers?

778
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:31,108
- We're in high school.

779
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,676
- You're not really brothers,
are you?

780
00:41:32,678 --> 00:41:35,679
This is a setup?
I'm being punked?

781
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:36,680
Where are the cameras?

782
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:39,649
I knew I was destined
to be a movie star.

783
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,284
- No! He was adopted!

784
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:44,120
He's my brother, but adopted.

785
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:46,923
- Oh, why didn't you say so?

786
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:50,226
Oh, yeah.
I see the resemblance now.

787
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:56,098
- Never mind.
You obviously have not seen him.

788
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,901
- Do you want another hot dog?

789
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:01,637
Wait!

790
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:03,906
You want any napkins?

791
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:06,242
- Is this a joke to you?

792
00:42:06,244 --> 00:42:08,311
Is that what being an orc is?

793
00:42:08,313 --> 00:42:09,245
Laughing at others?

794
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:11,013
Being mean?
Doing pranks?

795
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:13,282
I need to find my brother.

796
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:14,083
He ran away!

797
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:16,052
- Look, kid, I don't
know where he's at.

798
00:42:16,054 --> 00:42:21,256
But he's lucky he has a brother
like you looking out for him.

799
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:25,327
Ooh, I hit a nerve.

800
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:27,228
Were you responsible for him?

801
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,831
Are you feeling guilty now?

802
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:30,799
Is that it?

803
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:33,368
- What? No.
Why would you...

804
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,336
- You're sweating.

805
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:39,040
Here's a drink with
that hot dog... on the house.

806
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:46,247
Look, elf.

807
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:50,118
Orcs grow fast and
we're strong even as kids.

808
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,921
It's hard for other people
to understand that.

809
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:56,725
- I made a mistake
and now he ran away!

810
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:59,728
- You're brothers,
and brothers fight.

811
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,863
They make up, they fight again.

812
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:03,998
You'll find him.

813
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,766
And when you do,
you'll have a nice moment,

814
00:43:05,768 --> 00:43:08,702
maybe even hug it out
until the next time.

815
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:11,939
- You know what?
This is a very good hot dog.

816
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:13,841
- I know.

817
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:16,910
- Welcome to Vrax's.
Can I help you?

818
00:43:16,912 --> 00:43:20,748
- Hello. I need a dozen of
your finest air crystals.

819
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,316
- Oh, that's a tall order.

820
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:24,952
How are you gonna be paying?

821
00:43:24,954 --> 00:43:27,821
- Um, discount?

822
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:29,023
- Sorry, little dude.

823
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,091
There is no discount
for air crystals.

824
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:35,963
We import them from Goblin Town.
Very expensive.

825
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:38,098
- I said discount.

826
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,967
- And I said no!

827
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:43,302
Besides, shouldn't you be
in school or something?

828
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:47,073
- There you are.
Did you get the crystals?

829
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:51,077
- Well, I
said discount, wink,

830
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,946
and he said no, wink.

831
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:57,350
- Oh, did he now?

832
00:43:57,352 --> 00:44:00,119
Wait outside.

833
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:03,356
- Um, you can't
just come into my store

834
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:04,323
and demand with a wink...

835
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:07,360
- I can replace air crystals
with water bugs, easy.

836
00:44:07,362 --> 00:44:11,397
Don't...
- Wait outside.

837
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,267
- Sorry?

838
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:23,342
- Barl?

839
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:25,844
Where are you going?

840
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:29,114
- Hey, I got your crystals!

841
00:44:29,116 --> 00:44:31,149
- Barl just ran off!

842
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:33,085
What did you do in there?

843
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,453
- I got the discount.

844
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:39,091
- Oh! You don't have
to be such an orc!

845
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,461
- What are you doing getting
into trouble like this?

846
00:44:42,463 --> 00:44:44,896
What were you thinking?

847
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:46,398
Mom's gonna kill me!

848
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,899
Dad's gonna kill me!

849
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:49,134
Everyone's gonna...

850
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:50,736
- Barl! Barl?

851
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:52,237
- Lloyd? Lloyd!

852
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:54,072
- Get in the car! Now!

853
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:56,942
- Hey! Hey, I thought
we were gonna hug,

854
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,844
you know, like a big moment!

855
00:44:58,846 --> 00:44:59,377
- What?

856
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:02,247
- Because you missed me and
you figured out you were wrong.

857
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:04,416
- Wrong?
I wasn't wrong!

858
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:06,450
- Is that why you came back?
To tell me that?

859
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:10,121
- I came back because
you ran off with strangers!

860
00:45:10,123 --> 00:45:11,889
- So you're kidnapping me again?

861
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:14,158
- I set up a hotel
for you to be in.

862
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,528
You'll stay there
until after I graduate.

863
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,796
- This elf again?

864
00:45:18,798 --> 00:45:21,298
- I'm his brother!
We're brothers!

865
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,803
- Is that true?
He's your family?

866
00:45:25,805 --> 00:45:27,505
- Mm-hmm.

867
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:31,776
- You said you didn't
have a home!

868
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:35,913
- He does.
It's in Elfdale.

869
00:45:35,915 --> 00:45:39,517
- Sorry, Scrap.
I should go back with Lloyd now.

870
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:42,186
- Rolf isn't gonna
just let you go.

871
00:45:42,188 --> 00:45:43,320
You know that, right?

872
00:45:43,322 --> 00:45:45,990
- Well, maybe
if you tell him nicely?

873
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:47,157
- It doesn't work that way.

874
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:52,195
- Look, Scrap, I think you're
one of the coolest people ever.

875
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:55,465
You're funny,
you're smart and...

876
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:56,533
but those other guys...

877
00:45:56,535 --> 00:46:01,037
- Careful, Barl!
That's my family!

878
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:02,872
- They're kind of mean.

879
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:05,108
- Barl, it's time to go.

880
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,009
- Well, well,

881
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:10,013
look who I found on
the wrong side of the tracks.

882
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:13,216
You're not taking Barl anywhere.

883
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:14,450
- That's not your business.

884
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:19,389
- Everything is
my business, elf.

885
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:23,226

He used your brother!

from our history,

the battle between orcs
and elves 1,000 years ago?

Impossible.

then no one is safe.

Legend has it that orcs became
10 times their normal size.

1414
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor...

[ applause ]

1416
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:48,313
It is my honor to present to
you this year's Valedictorian,

1417
01:11:48,315 --> 01:11:50,881
Lloyd Lightspinner!

1418

[ cheering ]

1419
01:11:57,323 --> 01:12:01,058
- Thank you, Principal Ashford,
student body,

1420
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,527
special members of the audience.

1421
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:06,596
I cannot thank you enough
for your warm reception.

1422
01:12:06,598 --> 01:12:09,733
You would not
believe the journey it has been

1423
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:12,069
to get here today.

1424
01:12:12,071 --> 01:12:14,571
[ laughter ]

1425
01:12:14,573 --> 01:12:19,609
No, seriously, the past few days
have given me

1426
01:12:19,611 --> 01:12:22,346
a lot to think about,

1427
01:12:22,348 --> 01:12:25,982
about what all
of this means to me.

1428
01:12:25,984 --> 01:12:29,086
High school, graduation,

1429
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:32,822
college, and I realize...

1430
01:12:32,824 --> 01:12:35,391

[ snarling ]

1432
01:12:38,796 --> 01:12:41,097
I realize that...

1433
01:12:41,099 --> 01:12:44,633
graduation is a time that...

1434
01:12:44,635 --> 01:12:47,069
brings people together.

1435
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,573
We are honored today
to have members

1436
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,075
of the orc community here.

1437
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,977
Let's give them a hand, folks.

1438
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,946
[ applause ]

1439
01:13:01,386 --> 01:13:04,787
They brought with them
a gift to share as well,

1440
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:07,757
a sign of togetherness.

1441

[ gasps ]

1442
01:13:10,395 --> 01:13:12,627
Behold!

[ gasps ]

1444
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:18,833
- That's...

1445
01:13:21,071 --> 01:13:22,704
- Mine!

[ screaming ]

1447
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,746
- You want this, Rolf?

1448
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:32,881
Do you?

1449
01:13:32,883 --> 01:13:33,915
Well you can't have this!

1450
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:38,553
Because orcs and elves have been
living in peace for 1,000 years!

1451
01:13:38,555 --> 01:13:44,426
And when I break this, they
will live in peace forever!

1452
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,165
- No!

1453
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:54,802
- Gnome Biscuits.

[ screaming ]

1455
01:14:02,011 --> 01:14:04,945
- Enjoy your party, elves!

1456
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:07,848
From now until eternity,

1457
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:11,452
orcs will rule the world!

1458
01:14:11,454 --> 01:14:14,488
[ screaming ]

1459
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:21,595
Totalus Controlus!

1460
01:14:29,004 --> 01:14:33,006
- Oh, hey, Forelle.
What's happening?

1461
01:14:33,008 --> 01:14:35,875
- Um, that big smelly orc

1462
01:14:35,877 --> 01:14:40,513
just got bigger and smellier.

1463
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:42,515
Pretty scary, actually.

1464
01:14:42,517 --> 01:14:43,483
- Your milk!

1465
01:14:43,485 --> 01:14:45,485
- Wait. Stop.

1466
01:14:45,487 --> 01:14:47,253
- Sorry.

[ screaming ]

1472
01:15:17,885 --> 01:15:21,286
- You think petty pranks
will stop me?

1473
01:15:21,288 --> 01:15:25,790
- No, but this should.

1474
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:28,760
Freezey peazy,
lemon squeezy!

1475
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:38,837
- No!

1476
01:15:58,891 --> 01:16:00,691
- I'm me.

1477
01:16:00,693 --> 01:16:02,259
I'm me!

1479
01:16:04,163 --> 01:16:06,964
- I have a headache.

1480
01:16:08,935 --> 01:16:12,036
- Help!
Somebody help...

01:16:12,038 --> 01:16:13,837
[ cheering ]

1482
01:16:18,277 --> 01:16:21,178
- Barl!
- Lloyd!

1483
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:25,015
- Barl!

1484
01:16:25,017 --> 01:16:25,816
- We did it!

1485
01:16:25,818 --> 01:16:28,652
- You did it!
This was your plan, brother!

1486
01:16:28,654 --> 01:16:32,189
- Well, it was your magic!

1487
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:33,324
- Lightspinner!

1488
01:16:33,326 --> 01:16:38,761
That was the greatest speech
in Elfdale history!

1489
01:16:38,763 --> 01:16:39,762
Congratulations, Lloyd!

1490
01:16:39,764 --> 01:16:42,665
No doubt you're Krune
University material!

1491
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,835
Your heroics will be talked
about for centuries!

1492
01:16:45,837 --> 01:16:47,770
- You're gonna take that?

1493
01:16:47,772 --> 01:16:50,206
- Yeah.
You know, Lloyd's right.

1494
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,909
Maybe I'm not cut out
to be the hero.

1495
01:16:52,911 --> 01:16:57,113
I kind of like fart jokes
and snot bombs.

1496
01:16:57,115 --> 01:16:59,616
- Me too.

1497
01:16:59,618 --> 01:17:01,384
- Huh?

1498

my speech if it's okay.

I know it's easy to get
lost in this moment.

1501
01:17:13,398 --> 01:17:16,132
Our freedom was almost
taken from us today.

1502
01:17:16,134 --> 01:17:19,668
So when the history books
write about this day,

1503
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:24,706
they just need
to remember one person:

1504
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:29,378
Barl Lightspinner, my brother.

1505
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:32,180
He's the real deal, folks.

1506
01:17:32,182 --> 01:17:33,148
These last few days,

1507
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:38,053
he taught me what it's like
to be a real hero.

1508
01:17:38,055 --> 01:17:41,957
He showed me strength,
trust, brains,

1509
01:17:41,959 --> 01:17:46,428
friendship,
even a little bit of magic.

1510
01:17:47,431 --> 01:17:48,430
Barl?
