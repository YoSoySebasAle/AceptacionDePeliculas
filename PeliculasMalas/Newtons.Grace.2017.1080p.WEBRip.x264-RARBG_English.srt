1
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,853
- Why you!

2
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:35,962
Hey, have you seen a little
boy, with height like this

3
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,938
with an apple?

4
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,776
- Yeah, over there lad.

5
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:40,109
- Wait here, ah!

6
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,368
There you are you little blimer!

7
00:01:56,882 --> 00:01:59,677
- Hold on a moment, what is going on here?

8
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:03,276
- Much obliged Pastor Newton,
now if you'll just hold him,

9
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,272
I'll give him the caning he deserves.

10
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,802
- As a point of personal
privilege sir, no one shall

11
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:09,531
be whipped in my presence.

12
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:11,053
- Then you deal with him.

13
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:11,977
- What has he done wrong?

14
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:15,527
- Sir, fighting with the
other boys, disobedience,

15
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:18,808
swearing, he tipped over me stall.

16
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,808
Oh sir, he's a bad seed.

17
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:24,942
- These are serious charges.

18
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:28,815
- I'm serious sir, please
stand back and let me give

19
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,956
him the caning he deserves.

20
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:33,858
- Not in my presence Mr. Chapman.

21
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:37,608
- Fine, he's your problem,
you deal with him!

22
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:42,139
, Ha.

23
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:46,945
- Thank you sir.

24
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:52,361
- Fighting eh, swearing,
these are serious charges.

25
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:56,981
You're Ms. Watson's oldest aren't you?

26
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:58,935
- Aye, she's me stepmom.

27
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:03,102
- Hmm, well I was about to
go inside for a spot of tea,

28
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,496
would you like to join me.

29
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:06,978
- Might there be any biscuits?

30
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,540
- Well there might be, let's go see.

31
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,469
So, fighting and swearing.

32
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,394
- You wouldn't understand.

33
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,227
No?

34
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:50,123
- How could you, you're
the parson and all.

35
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:53,422
- I think I might understand
much better than you think.

36
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:55,748
I was once a little boy myself.

37
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:58,680
And I think by the time I was
your age I had been expelled

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,893
from two different schools
for fighting and swearing.

39
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:02,976
- You, never!

40
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:08,133
- Hmm, yes I wasn't always
a church parson you know.

41
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,853
In fact I've been a great
many different things in life.

42
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,131
I've probably done things
far worse than fighting

43
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,520
and swearing.

44
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,318
- Like what?

45
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:21,743
- Well I was a cabin boy on a
ship, I was a ship's captain

46
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,872
later on, I was even a slave for a while.

47
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:26,813
- Nah sir, you're leading me on!

48
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,931
- No I'm not, would you like
to hear a little of my story?

49
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:32,598
- Well, are there more biscuits?

50
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:38,154
- Hah, there might be,
yes, and more tea as well.

51
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,519
Of course it was all a very
long time ago you understand,

52
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,053
but, I don't think that little
boys have really changed

53
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,470
that much do you?

54
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,734
I remember my dear
mother as if it were only

55
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,067
a few weeks ago.

56
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:55,794
She taught me to pray,
she taught me to read

57
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,837
by reading me the Scriptures.

58
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,254
She died when I was only six.

59
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:06,205
My father was a merchant
seaman, a captain.

60
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,721
While I'm sure that he
loved me in his own way,

61
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:13,867
I don't recall ever feeling loved by him.

62
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:16,981
He soon remarried a beautiful young woman

63
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,314
who bore him other children.

64
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,857
She wasn't terribly
interested in me and so

65
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,612
he was away at sea and I
ended up in boarding school,

66
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:30,609
it wasn't long before I was
expelled from that school

67
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:32,682
for the same sort of
trouble you've been in.

68
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:33,822
- Do you mean fighting?

69
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:36,813
- Aye and general disobedience.

70
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:40,105
When I was young I had this
hot core of anger inside of me

71
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,802
that burned all the time,
and it was out of control,

72
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,372
I couldn't control my actions always.

73
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:46,205
- Aye?

74
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:47,825
- You do understand, don't you?

75
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:50,400
It wasn't long before I was
expelled from the next school

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,478
for the same thing and my
father decided that the only

77
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,557
thing to be done was to
take me to sea and so I went

78
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,825
on a ship with him when I was 11.

79
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:11,182
We served as cabin boys,
carrying and cleaning

80
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:15,349
and doing whatever any
grownup sailor wanted done.

81
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:21,742
But that burning core of
anger was still inside me,

82
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:25,482
and when it would burn, I
would always end up in trouble.

83
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,572
- There, suck on that young master Newton,

84
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,747
maybe you'll think twice
about slinging blasphemies

85
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:31,907
around in me galley.

86
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:34,203
I took my anger out
on the other boys, the ones

87
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:38,370
who were smaller than I, and
ended up in trouble again.

88
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,928
But in spite of the trouble I got into,

89
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,622
I grew into a man aboard
merchant ships, and I became

90
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,455
an able-bodied seaman.

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,971
- Ship leaves next Wednesday
for Jamaica, we can use you

92
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,403
if you'll sign on.

93
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:59,414
- Aye sir, I will, I'll be
visiting in Kent for a few days

94
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:02,081
but I can be back for Wednesday.

95
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:05,605
Little did I know how
those few days in Kent

96
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:09,419
would affect the rest of
my life, for it was there,

97
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,970
staying with friends of
my mother, that I met

98
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,470
the love of my life, my Polly.

99
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:21,183
Her name was Mary, Mary
Catlett, and almost from

100
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:25,227
the first time I saw her,
my heart was a captive.

101
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:28,564
My secret nickname for her was Polly.

102
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,731
My dear Polly, my beloved.

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,203
She was a little younger than
I, and her beautiful smile

104
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:40,370
melted my heart and made a
permanent mark upon my soul.

105
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:53,569
- Mr. Newton, I shall speak
plainly, we loved your

106
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,157
dear mother and held her
in the highest regard,

107
00:07:57,157 --> 00:08:01,089
Mary is too young yet for
any decision, but her father

108
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,674
and I do not object to an
understanding provided--

109
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:05,749
- Yes?

110
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:08,653
- Provided that when you
return from your voyages

111
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:12,290
we will see some signs of
stability and of prospect.

112
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,606
- Prospect?

113
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:17,317
- Prospect for a living Mr.
Newton is of great importance.

114
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:20,898
- Yes, I shall keep that
in mind Mrs. Catlett,

115
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:22,138
and I shall return.

116
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,746
Now I went back to sea
with a goal in mind,

117
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:32,007
to make my way, to find
advancement, to make my fortune,

118
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:35,924
so that I could return
and marry my dear Polly.

119
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:50,416
The beautiful memory of her
smile, of her sweet face,

120
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:55,145
got me through many long watches
and lonely nights at sea.

121
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,348
But even the memory of her smile could not

122
00:08:57,348 --> 00:09:02,226
keep me from trouble, that hot
anger burned inside me still

123
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,392
and would boil over at times.

124
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:10,689
- Send him to the surgery.

125
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:14,856
And you, you're on report,
reduced rations for a week.

126
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:20,280
And of course I was
a seaman at sea, no different

127
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,110
from any other, when it
poured I joined heartily

128
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,027
in the sins that waited any sailor.

129
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,932
Oh!

130
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,202
But not all
temptations were in port.

131
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,333
- Ah you're a fool if you
believe all that blatter.

132
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:46,098
All of this can be explained
by reason and science.

133
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:50,618
Ah there's no God up there,
the rationalists have it right.

134
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:52,866
- Is that what you do
when you're off duty,

135
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,352
read philosophers?

136
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:57,349
- Aye, there's lots of hours at sea, John.

137
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:01,429
Lots of time to think, Hobbes, Voltaire.

138
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:05,278
They make more sense than a
pack of priests mumbling Latin.

139
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,959
Ah, nothing but superstition
to control the rest of us.

140
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,126
You should read Hobbes, I'll
loan you his book, Leviathan.

141
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:24,818
And so I too became
a sailor-philosopher of sorts.

142
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:28,874
Spinoza and Hobbes, often
made quite a deal of sense.

143
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:32,640
And just as often made
me doubt the simple faith

144
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,973
of my childhood.

145
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:39,599
One night, at sea, I
fell asleep over a book,

146
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:42,883
and I had the strangest dream,
one that would come back

147
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:46,111
to me again and again throughout my life.

148
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:07,216
- As long as you preserve this
ring, you will be successful

149
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:11,216
and happy, but should you
lose it or part of it,

150
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,316
you must only expect sorrow and distress.

151
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:01,108
- You believe that ring is magic?

152
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:06,525
- As long as I preserve and keep it,

153
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,832
I should be happy and successful.

154
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:12,025
- Are you knocky boy?

155
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:16,723
What a simpleton, you believe
anything you're told don't ya?

156
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:18,048
- It seemed right.

157
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:21,738
- What's right about it, some
stranger hands you a ring,

158
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:26,623
tells you it's magic, it's a
talisman, and you believe him?

159
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:29,238
What a!

160
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:33,071
Seriously John, how can
you buy such claptrap?

161
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,313
You ascribe magical powers
to a wee piece of metal,

162
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,669
shaped in a circle.

163
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:42,836
I'd be ashamed to admit such
superstitions to another man.

164
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:47,291
Don't you understand
that by subscribing to

165
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,458
such superstitions it saps your
own human powers of reason?

166
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:54,978
Throw it away.

167
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:58,645
Go on, throw it away,
create your own faith,

168
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:03,996
take control of your own
destiny, go on, throw it away,

169
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,663
go on, go on, show you're a man!

170
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,242
Aye.

171
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:40,352
Oh you are a fool, what a
, believe anything

172
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,269
you're told, but now
you're lost, for that ring

173
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:51,065
contained in it all the mercy.

174
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:54,518
And now it's gone, at your own hand.

175
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,650
What did you do with it?

176
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,349
- I threw it away.

177
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:49,014
I threw it away!

178
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:52,397
- Where did you throw it?

179
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:17,061
I brought it back for you.

180
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:19,597
No.

181
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:25,145
If you're to be entrusted
with this ring again,

182
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:28,571
you will soon bring yourself
to the same distress,

183
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:32,736
you're not able to keep it,
but, I will preserve it for

184
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:36,903
you, and whenever it is
needful, I will produce it

185
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:39,758
on your behalf.

186
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,180
It wasn't long
before that voyage was nearing

187
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,117
its end and I would be
able to return to Kent

188
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:13,562
to visit my Polly, as the ship
turned home, all my thoughts

189
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:16,630
had turned to her and the
prospect of again seeing

190
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,880
her sweet face.

191
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,208
But it was not to be.

192
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:29,013
Less than five miles from
her house, I encountered

193
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:33,144
a press gang, these were
the days of an impeding war

194
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:37,162
with France, and the Navy
needed fresh men all the time.

195
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,723
Press gangs roamed the country
authorized to virtually

196
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:42,577
kidnap a likely young
lad, and press him into

197
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,634
the service of His Majesty's Navy.

198
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:46,658
- Run, it's a press gang!

199
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:11,518
- Aye, he's awake.

200
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:16,971
Welcome to His Majesty's
Navy, what's your name son?

201
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,114
- Ah, John Newton.

202
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:26,952
We're at sea?

203
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:29,517
- Aye, a day out of
Liverpool, you was the last

204
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:33,795
conscript brought on board,
here drink something,

205
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:36,045
it'll help you feel better.

206
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:49,025
- What's the ship?

207
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:53,197
- HMS Eridge, newly
commissioned man-of-war.

208
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,730
Under the command of Captain Carteret.

209
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,189
We're on our way to France
to defend King and Country.

210
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,313
We're always fighting
with France or Spain,

211
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,813
ever since Eve bit that apple.

212
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:08,346
- I was on my ways to
propose to my beloved.

213
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:11,490
- Ah that's a shame, four
years we'll be out I expect.

214
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,621
- Four years?
- Aye.

215
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:15,003
- Oh...

216
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:58,343
Captured, carried away from
my love against my will.

217
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,843
Imprisoned at sea.

218
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,652
Each day on the ocean took
me further from Polly,

219
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,985
and increased my resentment.

220
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:23,257
- Hey Johnny, Johnny,
you got to get along with

221
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:26,312
the other sailors, we've
all got our crosses to bear.

222
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,729
- Leave me alone!

223
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,939
The smoldering anger that
had always burned in me

224
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,356
was now a fire of resentment.

225
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:44,671
I obeyed orders, I did my job,
but I did so with a solemn

226
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:48,671
attitude, in my mind God
himself had cheated me.

227
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,369
Why did you do this to me?

228
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:57,511
Am I such a sinner that
you just singled me out

229
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:59,428
for special punishment?

230
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:08,556
I've nothing to do with you.

231
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:25,265
But I was no fool, I soon
perceived that I had a greater

232
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:29,574
chance of liberty if I was
promoted and so I began to focus

233
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:32,568
all my rage into hard
work and efforts to please

234
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:37,127
the officers, not because I
had any true respect for them,

235
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:41,294
but because I saw it as my
opportunity for a change.

236
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:46,003
So I started to work hard.

237
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:47,697
Aye sir!

238
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,576
And I showed officers great respect.

239
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:51,409
- Newton.

240
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:54,196
Aye sir?

241
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:55,605
- Good job seaman.

242
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:56,813
- Thank you sir.

243
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,813
At least to their faces.

244
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:00,584
Fool.

245
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:16,226
You wish to see me sir?

246
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:18,331
- Aye, Mr. Newton.

247
00:21:18,331 --> 00:21:20,267
Your father's a merchant captain.

248
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:21,748
- Aye sir.

249
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,453
- I've heard good things
of him, he's written me

250
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:27,572
asking that I consider
you for advancement.

251
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:30,065
I've spoken to the mate
and he says that you have

252
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:32,527
been an exemplary seaman.

253
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:33,870
- I try my best sir.

254
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,566
- That's the attitude, what
would you say to being promoted

255
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:38,733
to midshipman?

256
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,946
- Aye sir, I would like that very much.

257
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:46,242
- Didn't think you'd refuse,
so be it, you are promoted

258
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:48,077
to midshipman.

259
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:02,062
- Being a midshipman meant
that I was a sort of apprentice

260
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:06,247
officer and I was set
over my former mates.

261
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:09,164
Come on you sluggards, get to work!

262
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,964
Do that mopping, I want
that cleaned up,.

263
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,631
Aye sir, set the topsail,
belay the shrouds!

264
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:24,345
Sails mended, seamen.

265
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,487
While I behaved with perfect
form to my superiors,

266
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,437
the rage inside me often
was taken out on the sailors

267
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:40,004
who were now under me, much
as I had once bullied smaller

268
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:40,837
children.

269
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,340
You call that a knot, seaman?

270
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,825
- Aye sir, figure-of-eight.

271
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:45,849
- It's a throbbing mess!

272
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,671
Take it apart and start again.

273
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:49,268
- Aye sir...

274
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:52,684
- Talk back and there'll be
no rations for you tonight.

275
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:53,601
- Aye, sir.

276
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,430
After some months at
sea patrolling the Channel,

277
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,979
and even fighting skirmishes
with French ships,

278
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:14,890
we had to put back into
Plymouth for repairs,

279
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,456
and then it was that I had my chance.

280
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:21,134
- Mr. Newton, while we have
repairs I'm going to permit

281
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:23,992
a rotational shore leave for the seamen.

282
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:26,736
I'm assigning you to go
ashore with them and supervise

283
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:29,074
to make sure none of desert.

284
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:29,907
- Aye sir.

285
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:35,469
It was as if the master had
left the cat to guard the cream.

286
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,607
I'll be back at sunset,
anyone not here and ready to

287
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:44,946
return to the ship shall
be counted as deserting,

288
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:46,405
and you'll feel the lash.

289
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:47,977
Aye sir!

290
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:49,901
- All right off with you!

291
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:57,885
Here at last was my
chance to go see my Polly.

292
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:00,974
I wasn't much on thinking
things through in those days

293
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:03,084
and it didn't really occur to me

294
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:06,251
that desertion would catch up with me.

295
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:29,749
- John Henry Newton!

296
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:33,486
I have a warrant for your
arrest for the desertion

297
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:35,486
from His Majesty's Navy!

298
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:42,263
- Mr. John Newton, charged
with desertion from

299
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:45,216
His Majesty's Royal
Navy, a charge punishable

300
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:48,377
by death when found
guilty by court-martial.

301
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:50,630
Or lesser punishment by a ship's captain

302
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,312
as defined by Article 16
of the Article of War.

303
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:59,190
Captain, what shall be the punishment?

304
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,362
- He shall be demoted
from his present position

305
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,561
and stripped of all rank.

306
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:08,815
He shall be tied to the
main mast and administered

307
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,732
12 lashes with the cat.

308
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:16,387
Let each of you witness what
happen to those who desert

309
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:18,637
from His Majesty's service.

310
00:25:56,122 --> 00:26:00,825
No one shall speak a word to
Mr. Newton for seven days.

311
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,670
No one shall show him
favor, no one shall share

312
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,595
any ration with him, other
than the bread and water

313
00:26:08,595 --> 00:26:11,917
assigned by the galley master.

314
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,113
Are these instructions clear?

315
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,696
Aye sir!

316
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:25,731
- You got your own now don't
you Mr. High and Mighty?

317
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:29,314
You got nothing more
than what you deserve.

318
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,130
Enjoy your meal, sir.

319
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:23,870
- It's healing up, you can sleep
in the hammock from now on.

320
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:28,696
We'll have you up swabbing
the deck in no time.

321
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:43,089
- Mr. Jensen.

322
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:44,486
- Master word to Mr. Jensen.

323
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:45,569
- Mr. Smythe.

324
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:48,934
- Master word to Mr. Smythe.

325
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,351
- And Mr. Newton.

326
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:54,737
- But captain, sir?

327
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:56,820
- I said Mr. Newton, sir.

328
00:27:58,036 --> 00:28:00,006
- Master word to Mr. Newton.

329
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:02,432
The captain had
conscripted two gunners from

330
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,926
a passing ship, maritime law
required that he replaced them

331
00:28:05,926 --> 00:28:08,907
with able-bodied seamen,
so that the civilian ship

332
00:28:08,907 --> 00:28:11,401
would not be shorthanded.

333
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:14,559
This gave Captain Carteret
the perfect opportunity

334
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,733
to get rid of some troublemakers.

335
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:20,536
- Able-Bodied seamen my
arse, two here with scurvy

336
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:23,698
and one barely recovered from the scourge.

337
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:25,606
Well I can tell ya,
you'll feel the cat again

338
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:27,151
you disobey on this ship.

339
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:28,718
Aye sir.

340
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:33,193
- This is a slave ship, we'll
be 18 months on the Triangle.

341
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:37,836
Serve well and you'll be
rewarded, serve poorly

342
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:40,574
and you'll be punished, understood?

343
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:42,610
Aye sir.

344
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,443
- Dismissed!

345
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:13,262
I came to like many
of the sailors of the Levant.

346
00:29:13,262 --> 00:29:17,016
But the old rage still burned inside me.

347
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,453
But now it was directed
all at the captain.

348
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,745
- That's a sloppy bit of
work there Mr. Newton.

349
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,736
If that's the way you
worked on the Eridge,

350
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:26,903
no wonder you got flogged.

351
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:37,157
- Aye listen up mates, I've
come up with a little song

352
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:39,897
about old Mr. Phelps up here.

353
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:43,021
♫ Did you ever see the
lines since you been to sea

354
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:45,776
♫ Let the good ship rock

355
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:48,509
♫ A benty-leggy captain
with a bent back knee

356
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:51,344
♫ Wobbling down the dock

357
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:53,963
♫ Wobbling down the dock

358
00:29:53,963 --> 00:29:56,872
♫ Let the good ship roll and rock

359
00:29:56,872 --> 00:29:59,878
♫ Better call a coward,
or cower up the wall

360
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:02,918
♫ Wobbling down the dock

361
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:05,618
♫ Wobbling down the dock

362
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:08,447
♫ Let the good ship roll and rock

363
00:30:08,447 --> 00:30:11,060
♫ Better call a coward,
or cower up the wall

364
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,118
♫ Wobbling down the dock

365
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,811
- We'll anchor at the Banana
Islands in Sierra Leone

366
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:28,644
tomorrow, I'll need a
crew of three to row me in

367
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:30,644
to meet with the trader.

368
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,897
Harkness, Smythe and Newton.

369
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:40,345
The following day we'll
sail to Bay

370
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,595
where we'll load the cargo.

371
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,517
- I like that.

372
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,701
Staying here.

373
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:01,841
- You like what you see then?

374
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,895
- Do I, I bet the young trader
there lives like a king.

375
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:07,967
What's not to like.

376
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,495
What do you think Newton?

377
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:11,614
- Ah you both are daft.

378
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:13,689
It might be nice for a while.

379
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,267
I wanna get back to England,

380
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,350
and I wanna see my Polly.

381
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:28,641
- Smythe, Harkness, make ready the boat.

382
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:31,141
Newton, you stay here with me.

383
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:35,623
Mr. Campbell, this is
Mr. Newton, the young man

384
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,845
I was telling you about.

385
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:38,953
- It's a pleasure to meet you Mr--

386
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:45,403
- You won't be so pleased
once you understand the deal.

387
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,591
I've traded you Mr. Newton,
you're gonna stay here

388
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:52,758
as a servant, how do you like
them apples Mr. Funnyman?

389
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:12,336
- So you've met the lash?

390
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:17,591
You'll meet again soon enough
if you don't serve well.

391
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:22,504
You're my property now
Newton, and there's no way

392
00:32:22,504 --> 00:32:25,913
off this island without me
knowledge or me permission.

393
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:29,220
So don't you go be
getting any bright ideas.

394
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,164
You have to be a servant
for me wife, serve her well,

395
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:37,006
do as your told, and your
life will be much easier.

396
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:40,019
But you buck against, and
you'll find out just how

397
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:41,602
hard a life can be.

398
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:46,499
You guards, take him to Peyai.

399
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,876
She's always wanted to have
a white man as a slave.

400
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:51,709
And now she's got one.

401
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,637
- He is not much to look at, is he?

402
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:12,873
Give him a mat, and chain
him behind the house.

403
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:14,873
First we must break him.

404
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:32,176
My defiance, my sins,
had all caught up with me.

405
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,426
I was a slave.

406
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:43,410
They gave me only a
little to eat for days,

407
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,526
just enough to drink to keep me alive.

408
00:34:17,563 --> 00:34:21,521
- We take the chains off
today, you are Peyai's slave.

409
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:23,021
Do you understand?

410
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,517
You must do exactly as she bids.

411
00:34:29,396 --> 00:34:32,729
If you try to run away, we will hunt you

412
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:37,995
and chain you, if you
disobey you will be whipped.

413
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:45,216
If you try to run away
twice, we will kill you,

414
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:49,383
slowly, in a way that will make
you wish for death to come.

415
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:52,518
Do you understand?

416
00:34:52,518 --> 00:34:53,998
- Yes.

417
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:57,831
Now go
and serve your mistress.

418
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,563
- Ah my little white man.

419
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:13,149
Oh you must be so terribly
hungry, how could you

420
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:16,533
have treated my little white man so badly?

421
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:19,200
Here, let me give you some food.

422
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:24,823
You would like something
to eat, wouldn't you?

423
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:29,227
I'm sure you would, I'm
sure you are starving.

424
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,560
The food will taste so good.

425
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:06,344
She worked me like a mule.

426
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:14,634
She seemed to take particular
delight in watching me suffer.

427
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:18,801
Often making me do chores
that were simply pointless.

428
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:24,343
- Ah, very good, now that you
have placed the logs here,

429
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,912
put them back and place them
exactly where you found them.

430
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:09,216
Newton, Newton, I want
some fresh coconut milk.

431
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,467
Go bring me some.

432
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:03,784
Newton, Newton!

433
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:11,286
Newton!

434
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,917
Where is my coconut milk, Newton?

435
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:24,678
I want my coconut milk now.

436
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:26,514
Where is he?

437
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:34,675
- You are useless, even as a slave.

438
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:47,530
For a long time
I felt nothing but hunger

439
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,448
and despair, I could never
forget that I was the lowest

440
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:55,641
form of life on the island,
even the native slaves

441
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:58,463
had thatched huts to live in.

442
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:02,438
While I had to sleep on
the ground under the stars.

443
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:05,547
On the other hand,
Campbell and Peyai lived in

444
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:10,175
a great brick house at
the center of the island,

445
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:13,260
I was seldom allowed in the big house.

446
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,010
And then only to do menial labor.

447
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:21,527
But as long as I obeyed
Peyai's abusive commands,

448
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:25,446
they fed me a little, and
I regained some strength

449
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,446
in mind as well as body.

450
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,367
One night I lay looking at
the expanse of the heavens.

451
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,501
I began to try and see how
many constellations I could

452
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:44,141
identify, how many stars
I could name, this became

453
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:47,593
a nightly game, that became
a private area of freedom

454
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:51,760
for me, and I began to dream
again of my dear Polly,

455
00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:55,055
my beautiful Polly.

456
00:39:56,981 --> 00:40:00,148
I wonder if I will ever see her again.

457
00:40:01,704 --> 00:40:04,074
Then one night it seemed
to me that a group of stars

458
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:08,108
formed a circle, a ring, a
constellation I had never seen

459
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:10,025
before and never since.

460
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,109
It may have been my eyes playing a trick

461
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:16,371
or perhaps a planet had wandered
into an unusual position

462
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:20,960
visible from this latitude
but that night I could indeed

463
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,627
see a ring, a ring like
the one in my dream.

464
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:29,716
- You're not able to keep it.

465
00:40:29,716 --> 00:40:33,883
But I will preserve it for
you and whenever it is needful

466
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,269
I will produce it on your behalf.

467
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,825
During the days when Peyai was in a mood,

468
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,743
I would work very hard but
then there would be hours

469
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:59,076
of boredom when there was nothing to do.

470
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:07,423
One day I found a small lime
tree growing near the village,

471
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,676
that seemed much like me.

472
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:13,408
Beating and starving, despairing of life.

473
00:41:13,408 --> 00:41:15,986
I adopted that little tree as my own

474
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:20,688
and began to take care of it
to water and to fertilize it.

475
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:23,540
I found other seedlings and
planted them in what became

476
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,232
my own little garden.

477
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,789
One day, Campbell had me move heavy crates

478
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:42,956
into the big house, I was
alone for a few moments,

479
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,869
and there I came upon a
dusty old geometry book.

480
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,963
I took it and hit it under my mat.

481
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:58,971
I began in my spare time
to work geometry problems.

482
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:02,397
Scratching diagrams in the sand.

483
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:06,065
Using the sun and the shadow
of my little lime tree,

484
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,479
I calculated the latitude
and longitude of the islands

485
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:09,396
we were on.

486
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:14,026
Which were commonly
called the Banana Islands.

487
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:16,909
Just like the stars, like
the little lime tree, it gave

488
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,124
me something to focus
on, a space that was mine

489
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:21,374
and mine alone.

490
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:24,994
There was little that I
could do with the knowledge,

491
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:27,913
but the exercise did much
to keep my mind occupied

492
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:28,746
and sharp.

493
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,474
One day when I was tending
to my little garden

494
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:39,745
and passing the time with
equations written in the sand,

495
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:42,305
Mr. Campbell and Peyai
walked down the path

496
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:45,388
and caught sight of what I was doing.

497
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:50,103
- Newton, what are you doing man?

498
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,567
Are you growing your own limes?

499
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:56,152
I was terrified that
Peyai, as cruel as she was

500
00:42:56,152 --> 00:42:59,695
would make me destroy my
little place of sanity.

501
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:02,162
- Well who knows, maybe
one day before those

502
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,015
trees are full grown you can sail back

503
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,880
to England and you can be
the captain of your own boat.

504
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,548
Then you can come back
here and enjoy the fruits

505
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,690
of your labor.

506
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,591
- Then again perhaps he will
become the King of Poland.

507
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,782
- What is this?

508
00:43:24,773 --> 00:43:27,018
Do you understand the mathematics?

509
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,268
- Yes sir, I taught myself.

510
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:34,645
- Oh, you might not be a
complete waste after all.

511
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:56,531
Here are a set of equations,
I'd like for you to solve them.

512
00:43:56,531 --> 00:43:58,690
- What is it, a test?

513
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,609
- Aye if you will, I want
to see just how good you are

514
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:05,192
with these mathematics,
sit down, sit down.

515
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:38,922
I'm in need of a clerk to
manage me factory at Kittam.

516
00:44:38,922 --> 00:44:41,502
They don't very many people
in Sierra Leone who understand

517
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:43,019
numbers.

518
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,118
- Factory?

519
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:47,284
- Aye, it's me slave
trading post, it's where

520
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,787
the Bombo bring the
slaves from the interior

521
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,737
and make them ready for
transport to the West Indies.

522
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:55,109
My brother runs the factory,
but he's in need of someone

523
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,656
who can keep the accounts,
you will go there,

524
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:01,155
you will serve him now.

525
00:45:01,155 --> 00:45:03,155
The guard will take you.

526
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,618
- At Kittam my life changed dramatically,

527
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,085
I had new clean clothes
to wear, Angus Campbell

528
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:53,085
treated me well, almost as an equal.

529
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:19,967
The Bombo treated me with respect,

530
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:22,511
inviting me to their feasts.

531
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,376
I thought of Polly often,
before long I had given up

532
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:45,011
any hope of ever returning to England.

533
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,637
My circumstance had changed from one

534
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,261
of daily despair to one of comfort,

535
00:46:50,261 --> 00:46:54,428
I had all I needed, food,
shelter, clothing, respect.

536
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:56,766
And even women.

537
00:46:57,903 --> 00:47:01,729
Thoughts of England faded,
and my life in Kittam

538
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:05,530
began to envelop every part of my being.

539
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,200
The other settlers even
had an expression for it,

540
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,533
they called it going native.

541
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,976
What are they saying?

542
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:29,559
- It means freedom.

543
00:47:58,913 --> 00:48:01,210
But then came the
day when my entire world

544
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,758
would suddenly change again
as if a lightning bolt

545
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:05,922
had struck.

546
00:48:05,922 --> 00:48:08,617
- Mr. Newton, a man here to see you.

547
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:11,478
- Mr. Newton, Mr. John Newton.

548
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:12,470
- Yes.

549
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,264
- I'm Archibald Gother,
Captain of the HMS Greyhound,

550
00:48:15,264 --> 00:48:16,181
out of Liverpool.

551
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:18,009
- Ah, welcome Captain Gother,
are you here to pick up

552
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:18,842
a shipment?

553
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:22,698
- Not exactly, you see
I'm here to take you home.

554
00:48:22,698 --> 00:48:24,692
- Me, what are you talking about?

555
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:27,273
- Your father commissioned me to find you

556
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:29,987
and bring you back to
England whatever the cost.

557
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:31,613
I've been stopping at
every trading post south of

558
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:35,780
the Canaries searching for
you, and finally here you are!

559
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:39,369
- My father!

560
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:43,331
- Mr. Newton!

561
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:07,402
- There she is, the Greyhound.

562
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,699
After this, we got two more ports of call.

563
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,899
To pick up ivory and beeswax.

564
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:14,783
And then we should set sail for Liverpool,

565
00:49:14,783 --> 00:49:16,283
and for you, home.

566
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:20,328
- Captain Gother, a month
ago I would've told you

567
00:49:20,328 --> 00:49:24,411
I had no hope or even dreams
of seeing England again.

568
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:26,920
I was prepared to live out my days here.

569
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,648
Perhaps marry a native, even
have my grave right here

570
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:33,648
in West Africa, if I
believed in God I would say

571
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:36,597
his hand had brought you here.

572
00:49:36,597 --> 00:49:39,680
- Believe it, for who else can it be?

573
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,178
And so I began my journey home.

574
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:17,771
Not as a crewman but as a
passenger on the Greyhound.

575
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,773
Freed of the duties I was
used to, I had many hours

576
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:24,526
at sea to think, to think about my life,

577
00:50:24,526 --> 00:50:26,693
to think about life itself.

578
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:59,926
It was during these long hours of leisure

579
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:03,432
that I discovered a book,
The Imitation of Christ

580
00:51:03,432 --> 00:51:06,682
by Thomas a Kempis, I began reading it,

581
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,148
not as a meditational work
but as a work of fiction

582
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:14,241
and entertainment to pass the time.

583
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:18,775
But as I read the involuntary
suggestion came to me.

584
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:22,117
What if these words were
true, what if the faith

585
00:51:22,117 --> 00:51:25,451
of this long dead writer
was in fact a reality

586
00:51:25,451 --> 00:51:28,985
that I simply did not understand.

587
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:33,152
I could not bear the inference
as it related to myself.

588
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:36,845
Dimly remembered Scripture
verses came unbidden

589
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:40,142
to my mind, especially
fearful passages that speak

590
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:43,147
of the judgment of those
who know the way of truth

591
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:45,189
but then depart from it.

592
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,854
What if I were one of them?

593
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:51,206
What if the faith I had
abandoned was in fact

594
00:51:51,206 --> 00:51:54,533
the driving reality of the universe?

595
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:57,494
What if God's hand had in
fact been the moving force

596
00:51:57,494 --> 00:52:00,781
that brought me to this
point, brought Gother

597
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:03,784
to Sierra Leone to rescue me.

598
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:06,704
What if I had turned
my back on the very God

599
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,537
who sought to save me?

600
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:15,130
I was so caught up in my
own thoughts and meditation

601
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,753
that I had not even been
aware of the storm that

602
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:18,928
had engulfed us.

603
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:27,961
- All hands on deck John!

604
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:44,505
- Mister, hey, get that canvas down!

605
00:53:06,685 --> 00:53:09,328
Pilot down, pilot down!

606
00:53:09,328 --> 00:53:12,945
- Get Newton, get Newton!
- I know where he is!

607
00:53:57,355 --> 00:53:58,522
- God save us!

608
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:37,504
Thank you.

609
00:54:38,644 --> 00:54:42,319
I thought back then on that
powerful recurring dream

610
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,402
that had haunted my life.

611
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:50,492
- I will preserve it for you,
and whenever it is needful,

612
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:53,205
I will produce it on your behalf.

613
00:55:05,825 --> 00:55:08,198
We had survived
the most terrifying storm

614
00:55:08,198 --> 00:55:09,698
of my life at sea.

615
00:55:10,696 --> 00:55:13,811
But more than that I had
a glimmer of new hope,

616
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:18,441
a spark of faith in my
heart, in my darkest moment,

617
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:21,653
I discovered a chance of reconciliation,

618
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:25,820
with a God that I had long
dismissed as mere fiction.

619
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:28,945
That was March 10th, 1748.

620
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:32,709
A day that I would mark
for the rest of my life

621
00:55:32,709 --> 00:55:35,042
as the day of my conversion.

622
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:50,761
There is little doubt that
our very cargo had saved us.

623
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:52,954
The beeswax and the we carried

624
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:56,027
being both lighter than water.

625
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:58,419
The Greyhound was so swamped
with water that we surely

626
00:55:58,419 --> 00:56:01,075
would've sunk if it were
not for the flotation

627
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:02,742
of the cargo itself.

628
00:56:04,033 --> 00:56:08,530
But was God's hand not
present even in this detail?

629
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,656
As we limped back toward
England, tripled with only a few

630
00:56:11,656 --> 00:56:15,823
sails, I spent most of my
time reading the Scriptures.

631
00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:20,111
Meditating and praying
to the Lord for mercy

632
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:21,444
and instruction.

633
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:34,259
I began to see my life in
a different perspective.

634
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:36,720
The burning anger that had
driven me as a younger man

635
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,887
was now faded.

636
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:41,854
I began to see that my
entire life was that as

637
00:56:41,854 --> 00:56:44,795
the Parable of the Prodigal Son.

638
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:48,785
Not in a figurative way, as
most people understand it,

639
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:51,917
but in the most literal reality.

640
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:53,584
Land ho!

641
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,460
We sighted land on
April 7th, the Irish island

642
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,960
of Tory, the next day we landed at Swilly.

643
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,183
Finally I was safely
home, after misadventures

644
00:57:08,183 --> 00:57:10,600
that seemed like a storybook.

645
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:15,720
- So did you see your father?

646
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:17,719
- No.

647
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:22,315
See God's ways are very strange.

648
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:25,844
You see the day I arrived in Liverpool

649
00:57:25,844 --> 00:57:29,292
I discovered that my father
had shipped out only the day

650
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:32,704
before for Canada, he'd been appointed

651
00:57:32,704 --> 00:57:37,077
Governor of York's Fort
in Hudson Bay Colony.

652
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:39,533
I never saw him again.

653
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:40,794
- How sad.

654
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,707
Did he know that you were safe?

655
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:45,373
- Oh yes we were able to write one another

656
00:57:45,373 --> 00:57:48,792
so he knew the whole
story, but he died there

657
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:52,959
in Canada and was buried there
and I never saw him again.

658
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:58,138
However, God gave me a
new father as it were,

659
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:00,693
Joseph Manastee who owned the ship that

660
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:03,182
I had returned on, took me under his wing

661
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:07,144
and treated me as if I were his own son.

662
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:08,634
He got me a commission as first mate

663
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:11,919
on a trade ship and I did very well.

664
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:15,368
Much of the rebellion in my
spirit, the burning anger,

665
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,988
had been washed away in
Africa and I no longer found

666
00:58:17,988 --> 00:58:20,905
myself always attracted to trouble.

667
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:26,453
My new station in life
secure, I could at long last

668
00:58:26,453 --> 00:58:29,203
go back to Kent, and to my Polly.

669
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:31,926
My beloved Polly.

670
00:58:35,836 --> 00:58:39,779
After years of remember
her face as in a dream,

671
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:43,146
I was finally able to marry my dear Polly,

672
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:44,813
the love of my life.

673
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:49,934
- According to God's holy
ordinance, and thereto,

674
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:51,601
I give you my truth.

675
00:58:52,984 --> 00:58:55,443
- With this ring I give you my heart.

676
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:57,735
With my body I give you worship.

677
00:58:57,735 --> 00:59:01,782
And with all of my worldly
goods, I thee endow.

678
00:59:01,782 --> 00:59:06,526
In the name of the Father and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

679
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:07,359
Amen.

680
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,554
Before long my benefactor
Joseph Manastee promoted me

681
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:23,270
to captain, captain of my own ship.

682
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,853
The Duke of Argyll.

683
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:31,686
The Duke of Argyll was a slaving ship.

684
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:35,502
So my job as captain was to take the ship

685
00:59:35,502 --> 00:59:37,944
to the West coast of Africa, very close to

686
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:41,405
where I had been held captive
myself, pick up slaves

687
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:44,661
there, transport them to
the West Indies, there to

688
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:48,420
exchange them for molasses
and rum, and return those

689
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,750
to England, that's why we
called it the Triangular Trade.

690
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:56,333
- Wait, you were a
captain of a slave ship?

691
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:01,678
After you were a slave yourself?

692
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:04,012
How could you do that?

693
01:00:04,012 --> 01:00:06,762
- You're a very astute young man.

694
01:00:07,976 --> 01:00:11,461
No I was infant in the
faith, and I really did not

695
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:15,951
see the evils of the
slave trade at the time.

696
01:00:15,951 --> 01:00:20,197
None of us did, it was
considered an honorable way

697
01:00:20,197 --> 01:00:21,907
to make a living.

698
01:00:21,907 --> 01:00:25,118
- But you were held captive,
how could you do that

699
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:26,451
to someone else?

700
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,460
- It was all too easy.

701
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:33,585
You see attitudes are
starting to change now,

702
01:00:33,585 --> 01:00:37,546
but 20 years ago, no one
questioned the slave trade,

703
01:00:37,546 --> 01:00:40,672
well save the Quakers and
a few Moravian missionaries

704
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:41,839
in St. Thomas.

705
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,011
Everyone in England that
had any money at all,

706
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:50,687
had it invested in the slave
trade it was very profitable.

707
01:00:50,687 --> 01:00:54,854
And where profit is concerned
we turn a blind eye, don't we?

708
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,490
All I could see at the time
was that as a Christian

709
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:03,614
ship captain, my job was to
safely transport the slaves

710
01:01:03,614 --> 01:01:06,320
from one port to the other
and treat them as well

711
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,919
as possible, the same as I
might do with a load of cattle.

712
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:14,036
It wasn't an uncommon on
slave ships for almost

713
01:01:14,036 --> 01:01:18,339
a third of them to die
on that middle passage.

714
01:01:18,339 --> 01:01:23,175
They were kept chained below
decks, fed little food.

715
01:01:23,175 --> 01:01:27,340
I prided myself on the fact
that only a few had ever died

716
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,350
on my ships.

717
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:36,845
I devised a routine of regular
exercise for the slaves,

718
01:01:36,845 --> 01:01:39,674
so that each day they would
see the sunlight and keep

719
01:01:39,674 --> 01:01:43,494
themselves as fit and healthy as possible.

720
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:46,286
I insisted with Mr. Manastee
that we have sufficient

721
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,742
provisions so that the
slaves could maintain

722
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:52,288
proper nourishment,
and not arrive starved.

723
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:55,710
I did the same with the crew,
I was proud that my ship

724
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:57,874
had one of the best records
for delivering slaves

725
01:01:57,874 --> 01:01:59,743
in good health.

726
01:01:59,743 --> 01:02:04,059
We only had a few deaths at
see, I felt each one personally

727
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:06,890
and worked harder on
each voyage to make sure

728
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,692
that both crew and cargo
stayed healthy and fit.

729
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:13,735
It may not seem like
much, but it was far more

730
01:02:13,735 --> 01:02:17,482
than most captains did in those days.

731
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:20,777
I engaged the crew in
regular times of worship.

732
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:22,839
Ye shall have a song, as in the night

733
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,657
when a holy solemnity is kept,

734
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:28,450
and gladness of heart, as
when one go with a pipe

735
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,956
to come into the mountain of the Lord,

736
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,289
to the mighty one of Israel.

737
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:35,257
Let us pray.

738
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,688
It was on this journey
that I had the chance

739
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:56,228
to return to the Banana Islands,

740
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:59,560
to my own place of enslavement.

741
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,211
I was even able to find
one of the lime trees

742
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:06,378
that I had planted with my own
hands so many years before.

743
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:26,342
Then came my third voyage,
in 1753, as captain

744
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:28,474
of The African.

745
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,930
We landed in Ghana to pick
up a load of 600 slaves

746
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,013
for transport to Jamaica.

747
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:46,826
It was on that voyage that
I began to first wonder

748
01:04:46,826 --> 01:04:48,659
about the slave trade.

749
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,541
That would be my last voyage.

750
01:05:26,432 --> 01:05:28,214
The weather looks good.

751
01:05:28,214 --> 01:05:30,758
I'm gonna sail the day after tomorrow.

752
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:33,672
- I shall miss you terribly,
I so wish you did not

753
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:35,396
have to be gone so long.

754
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:36,885
- Yes I know.

755
01:05:36,885 --> 01:05:39,922
But it is the nature of the trade.

756
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,443
- John?

757
01:05:44,226 --> 01:05:45,143
John, John!

758
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:57,428
- I'm afraid he's suffered a stroke.

759
01:06:01,787 --> 01:06:05,083
I could no longer command a ship.

760
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:06,666
How sad.

761
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,719
- It seemed very hard
at the time, but we were

762
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:14,859
later to understand that
it was a blessing from God.

763
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:16,214
- A blessing?

764
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:19,681
- Yes a blessing, you see
when God closes one way

765
01:06:19,681 --> 01:06:22,141
it is often for a reason
that we do not know

766
01:06:22,141 --> 01:06:25,811
or understand, Captain Potter, the man who

767
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:28,940
took over the ship for
me, and his entire crew

768
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,527
were killed on that voyage.

769
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,905
- God preserve us!

770
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,943
- Yes he did preserve us.

771
01:06:33,943 --> 01:06:36,363
And it was a deep lesson
because what we thought

772
01:06:36,363 --> 01:06:39,829
was a curse at the time,
actually was filled

773
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,162
with much grace.

774
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:46,052
We moved back to Polly's
family home in Kent,

775
01:06:46,052 --> 01:06:47,688
for my recuperation.

776
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:04,894
During this time living
in Kent I had many hours

777
01:07:04,894 --> 01:07:08,795
of leisure, which I often
spent outdoors, I had hours

778
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:12,898
and hours for Bible
study and for meditation.

779
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:16,002
I spent many hours discovering
the layers of grace

780
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:19,085
present in our Lord's redeeming work.

781
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:33,211
Slowly I regained some of my strength.

782
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:36,968
But I knew I would never
again captain a ship.

783
01:07:36,968 --> 01:07:39,510
However, my knowledge of
the business enabled me

784
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:44,064
to obtain a position as
tide-surveyor of Liverpool.

785
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,941
A position of great responsibility.

786
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:51,441
Ahoy,
surveyor, state your cargo.

787
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:54,985
- 100 barrels of rum and a
hundred barrels of molasses

788
01:07:54,985 --> 01:07:57,665
from the island, 75 barrels...

789
01:07:57,665 --> 01:07:59,875
I worked for the Custom's Office

790
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,405
and was responsible to
inspect incoming ships

791
01:08:02,405 --> 01:08:05,035
to make sure the proper
import customs were paid

792
01:08:05,035 --> 01:08:07,703
to the government, even
with the remaining weakness

793
01:08:07,703 --> 01:08:10,592
from my stroke, I could
still discharge the work

794
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:14,278
with responsibility, and
yet have the free time

795
01:08:14,278 --> 01:08:17,361
to study the scriptures as I desired.

796
01:08:18,686 --> 01:08:21,302
Now that we were settled
in a house in Liverpool,

797
01:08:21,302 --> 01:08:24,135
I made the most of my free time.

798
01:08:24,135 --> 01:08:26,637
I determined to know
nothing but Jesus Christ

799
01:08:26,637 --> 01:08:31,227
and him crucified as Paul
wrote in 1 Corinthians.

800
01:08:31,227 --> 01:08:33,452
And I resolved to do
nothing that would not serve

801
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:34,952
that main purpose.

802
01:08:36,036 --> 01:08:38,906
I began to learn Greek, enough
to allow me to understand

803
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:42,073
The New Testament and The
Septuagint, and then I began

804
01:08:42,073 --> 01:08:45,743
studying Hebrew the following year.

805
01:08:45,743 --> 01:08:48,276
I never attained a critical
skill in any of these

806
01:08:48,276 --> 01:08:51,558
languages, but I had no goal but to truly

807
01:08:51,558 --> 01:08:54,088
and faithfully understand
the scriptural words

808
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:57,764
and phrases so that I
could judge for myself

809
01:08:57,764 --> 01:09:00,717
the meaning of any particular passage.

810
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:02,553
Together with this I kept up a course

811
01:09:02,553 --> 01:09:05,023
of reading the best writers
of Christian theology

812
01:09:05,023 --> 01:09:06,106
I could find.

813
01:09:08,021 --> 01:09:11,889
Out of this gradually arose a new desire.

814
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:14,607
My mother's hope when I was
a child was that I should

815
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:16,735
enter the Ministry.

816
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:20,703
Now for the first time I
began to feel a strong calling

817
01:09:20,703 --> 01:09:24,366
in that direction myself,
it was not a calling of

818
01:09:24,366 --> 01:09:27,953
which I felt worthy,
but I felt in some ways

819
01:09:27,953 --> 01:09:30,367
I was the perfect person to proclaim

820
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:33,248
the faithful saying from 1 Timothy.

821
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:35,914
That Jesus Christ came
into the world to save the

822
01:09:35,914 --> 01:09:37,331
chief of sinners.

823
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:41,383
My life had been full of
such remarkable turns,

824
01:09:41,383 --> 01:09:45,466
I seemed selected to show
what the Lord could do.

825
01:09:47,536 --> 01:09:50,730
My initial enthusiasm
was damped by refusal

826
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:54,397
after refusal to consider
me for ordination.

827
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:58,815
I did not give up easily,
but in rapid order

828
01:09:58,815 --> 01:10:01,320
I was turned down by
the established church,

829
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,224
by the Dissenters, by the Methodists,

830
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:06,307
and by the Presbyterians.

831
01:10:09,202 --> 01:10:11,908
Though not yet ordained I
began to preach at churches

832
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:15,408
around Liverpool, and to be well received.

833
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:20,759
The Lord bestows many blessings
upon his people, but unless

834
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:24,130
he likewise gives 'em a thankful heart,

835
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:25,450
they lose much of the comfort

836
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:28,693
they might have in them, and
this is not only a blessing

837
01:10:28,693 --> 01:10:31,526
in itself, but in earnest of more.

838
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,689
King David, when he was
peacefully settled in

839
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:40,024
his kingdom, purposed
to express his gratitude

840
01:10:40,024 --> 01:10:42,774
by building a place for the arch.

841
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:46,629
I began to receive more and
more invitations to preach

842
01:10:46,629 --> 01:10:49,796
or to speak about my life experiences.

843
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:54,576
Polly, Polly read this.

844
01:10:57,124 --> 01:10:58,871
- You're to be the pastor of

845
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:03,336
the Parish Church of St.
Peter and St. Paul in Olney?

846
01:11:03,336 --> 01:11:07,217
Oh John, it is an answer to our prayers!

847
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:14,349
- I had to wait over seven long years,

848
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:17,476
but finally my dream to
server as a parish pastor

849
01:11:17,476 --> 01:11:18,976
would become true.

850
01:11:21,732 --> 01:11:24,529
And that Samuel is how
I came to be the pastor

851
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:27,124
of this parish, of course
that was a number of years

852
01:11:27,124 --> 01:11:29,037
ago before you were born.

853
01:11:29,037 --> 01:11:30,742
- It is quite a story.

854
01:11:30,742 --> 01:11:33,205
- Yes and let it be a lesson to you.

855
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,406
For the story that God
has in mind for you may

856
01:11:35,406 --> 01:11:39,016
be very different from
what you have planned.

857
01:11:39,016 --> 01:11:42,682
The great adventure is finding
God's will for your life.

858
01:11:42,682 --> 01:11:45,006
- Oh I did not know you had company.

859
01:11:45,006 --> 01:11:47,971
- Yes this is Samuel,
we met in the village.

860
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,719
- Ah, aren't you Ms. Watson's oldest?

861
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,642
- Aye she's me stepmom.

862
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:56,395
- Oh why don't you join us on Tuesday,

863
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:59,975
John and I have begun a Bible
School for the area children.

864
01:11:59,975 --> 01:12:02,644
- Yes, you'll improve your
reading skills and at the same

865
01:12:02,644 --> 01:12:04,858
time learn more about the Bible.

866
01:12:04,858 --> 01:12:07,195
- If you're leading it, then I'll come.

867
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:08,859
Oh very good.

868
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:11,289
- John please remember that
William Cowper is coming

869
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:13,035
later to work on the poem.

870
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:14,245
- Yes I do.
- Hmm-mm.

871
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:17,927
- Mr. Cowper and I are working
on some spiritual poems

872
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:21,704
which can be sung to popular
tunes like Black-Eyed Susan

873
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,022
or Mad Robin.

874
01:12:23,022 --> 01:12:24,015
- I know them!

875
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:25,310
Of course you do.

876
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,758
- You must be off now,
Mr. Newton and Mr. Cowper

877
01:12:27,758 --> 01:12:31,046
have some very important work to do.

878
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,081
- Mr. Newton?

879
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:32,914
Yes?

880
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:34,476
- Thanks for telling me your story.

881
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:36,263
Well thank you
for listening Samuel,

882
01:12:36,263 --> 01:12:37,847
and you'll be here on Tuesday.

883
01:12:37,847 --> 01:12:39,600
- Aye, I'll be here on Tuesday.

884
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,767
Very good, very good.

885
01:13:55,358 --> 01:13:56,441
- Here it is.

886
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,233
- John Newton?

887
01:13:59,233 --> 01:14:00,900
- Yes here, read it.

888
01:14:03,226 --> 01:14:05,017
- John Newton, Clerk.

889
01:14:05,017 --> 01:14:09,107
Once an infidel and libertine,
a servant of slaves in Africa

890
01:14:09,107 --> 01:14:12,995
was by the rich mercy of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

891
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:16,072
preserved, restored and
pardoned, and appointed to preach

892
01:14:16,072 --> 01:14:19,955
the faith he had long labored to destroy.

893
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,381
- He changed my life.

894
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:25,763
A few years later he was
called to St. Mary Roman Church

895
01:14:25,763 --> 01:14:26,596
in London.

896
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:30,299
When I was old enough I joined him there.

897
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,625
And through him I met William Wilberforce.

898
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:36,639
And joined the movement to
abolish the slave trade.

899
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:41,254
It took years, the bill
passed Parliament in 1807,

900
01:14:41,254 --> 01:14:44,362
the same year that Mr. Newton died.

901
01:14:44,362 --> 01:14:48,362
And the same year that
you were born Alexandria.

902
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:54,324
But he lived to see the
abolition of the slave trade.

903
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:56,446
- Oh so he did it?

904
01:14:56,446 --> 01:15:00,911
- Well not he alone, but
many working together.

905
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:02,911
He did change the world.

906
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:07,546
And he changed my life.

907
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:13,343
The life of a little boy
who was hurt and angry

908
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:14,426
at the world.

909
01:15:15,968 --> 01:15:19,418
He taught me something of gentleness.

910
01:15:19,418 --> 01:15:21,001
And of God's grace.

911
01:15:23,281 --> 01:15:27,448
And I hope you have a chance
to learn of that grace as well.
