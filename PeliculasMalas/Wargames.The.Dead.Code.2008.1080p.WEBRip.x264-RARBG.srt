1
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,365
How many did she get?

2
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,166
All of them.

3
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,770
Glad she's on our side.
Yeah.

4
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,342
Resuming game site
surveillance.

5
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,984
Jay, I'm doing all the work here, buddy.
Come on.

6
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,719
Where are you?
You're supposed to be on my left flank

7
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:06,920
with second platoon.

8
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,689
Die. Die. Die.

9
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,424
Jay, where are you?
I'm getting pummeled over here.

10
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,461
Die. Die. Jay,
I said left flank, Jay.

11
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:16,364
Die. Die.
Jay, where are you in second platoon?

12
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,532
Why are you...
You're never where you're supposed to be.

13
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,601
Jay, Jay,
that's me you're shooting.

14
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,270
Jay, you just shot
me in the head, Jay.

15
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,505
Yeah, great, do me a favor.
Never join the Army.

16
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,773
Thank you.

17
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,776
Amateurs.

18
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,013
Dude, I'm seriously
bored over here.

19
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,016
Aren't you bored?
What are you doing?

20
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,621
Hey, how about a war drive, huh?
We love that.

21
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,891
Okay, five minutes,
World of Warcraft. What do you say?

22
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,294
Come on,
I need some bloodfang gear and some undead rogues,

23
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,395
and you're the man.

24
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,363
No Warcraft. No rogues.

25
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,466
Remember, way back to last month,
when I maxed out my mom's credit card?

26
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,468
Yeah. But, you know,
you paid her all back.

27
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,569
And wasn't she impressed?

28
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,705
Dude, I almost lost 2 grand.

29
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,341
Besides I'm still
on probation.

30
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,811
Why? Why because you posted this photo
of Maltz on facebook?

31
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,913
Come on, look,
he's having a great time.

32
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,419
No.

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,324
Okay, plan B.

34
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,559
I just traded these hacked credit card numbers to a guy online

35
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,893
for this new
peer-to-peer tool.

36
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,629
You ready for this?
Are you ready?

37
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:24,698
Guaranteed undetectable.
What do you say?

38
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:25,999
Be my guest.

39
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,403
Was kind of hoping you'd sort of help me figure this stuff out

40
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,439
since I'm not
totally sure how it works.

41
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,374
Look, man, I promised her
I'd give it a rest.

42
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,608
Of course you did.
It's your mom.

43
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:35,709
What else are you
going to tell her?

44
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,044
Only this time I meant it.

45
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,313
Wow, I'm really
touched. Sweet.

46
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,048
Here, call someone.

47
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,282
Anyone but me.

48
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,352
Maybe I'll call
your ex-girlfriend.

49
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,487
Ask her on a date.

50
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,756
She'll probably play with me.

51
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,961
Hello, White House,
how may I direct your call?

52
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,464
Are you kidding me?
Dude, how do you...

53
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,031
That's my number.
Come on, let's go.

54
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,668
Can I have that?
Uh, no.

55
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,835
Thanks for the Pop-Tart.

56
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,504
Hey, it's breakfast.

57
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,976
Hey, Will, I got a problem.

58
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,912
Hey, Mr. Massude. What?
They still didn't get your Medicare straight?

59
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,881
No, that's okay,
thank you.

60
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,650
But it's my computer.

61
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:17,951
I don't know,
it's stuck again.

62
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,354
Something about
an administrator.

63
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,993
And you haven't introduced any new software since I wiped your drive?

64
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,362
Come on,
we're gonna be late for gym class,

65
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,063
and that would be
a huge tragedy.

66
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:34,835
Well, it's sites my
granddaughter sent me.

67
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,904
I know you
warned me about it.

68
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,907
But, you know,
she's in Damascus and she sent pictures.

69
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,410
And you know how hard for me
it is to see her.

70
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,644
Did you get a security alert?

71
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,047
No, I simply cannot
get into my banking files.

72
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,650
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

73
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,420
Okay, um, I'll have
a look when I get back.

74
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,787
But just don't do
anything else. Okay?

75
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,689
Okay. Thank you.

76
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,492
All right.
Oh and I'll pick up your prescription on my way home.

77
00:05:58,526 --> 00:05:59,793
Bye.
Okay.

78
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,967
Enjoy the view, dickhead.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,136
Screw you, Maltz.

80
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,507
Why don't you go make out with your cross-eyed girlfriend?

81
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,409
Penis.

82
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,970
Newman, is this your
first time with FIGJAM?

83
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,705
FIGJAM?

84
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,006
Yeah, we're in the information acquisition business.

85
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,542
Well, okay.
Yeah.

86
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:53,547
FIGJAM. "Fuck I'm good,
just ask me."

87
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,650
Him.

88
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,486
This better be good, Rashe.

89
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,723
Good morning, Ken.

90
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,693
Show me.

91
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,905
Morbidity rate, 98.6 %.

92
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,509
Set up the skiff.

93
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,777
Get me Paget from Homeland,
Cavanaugh from CDC

94
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,513
and Stradler from
the joint chiefs.

95
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,481
Again, full-screen.

96
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:28,716
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,757
That's my girl.

98
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,533
These are terrorists, people.

99
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:50,270
Eliminated in an automated operation with 98.6 % efficiency.

100
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,541
98.6, the temperature
of blood.

101
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:58,045
And not a drop of ours spilled,
thanks entirely to our girl RIPLEY.

102
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,247
RIPLEY detected this particular terrorist cell

103
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,516
through one of
her honeypot sites.

104
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,987
Attractive, high-stakes games hidden
in the darker reaches of the Internet.

105
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,088
Screen.

106
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,190
Once a player penetrates
level 5,

107
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,693
RIPLEY tags him
as a security threat.

108
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,028
RIPLEY engaged
skilled gamers,

109
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:19,166
exhibiting familiarity with weapon systems and terror tactics.

110
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,203
This particular group managed to pool winnings of just under $3 million,

111
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,705
which we paid.

112
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:25,806
Wait a minute.

113
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,175
You paid
a terrorist group $3 million?

114
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,544
That's affirmative, General.

115
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,180
But you'll be pleased to know that everyone associated with this group

116
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:39,753
is either in custody or already enjoying their much-hyped afterlife.

117
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,623
RIPLEY walks tall
and carries a very big stick.

118
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,692
That's why we
applaud everyone here

119
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,127
for endorsing RIPLEY's status
of complete autonomy,

120
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,663
both foreign and domestic.

121
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,364
Temporary domestic autonomy,
Kenneth.

122
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,602
Let's take your girl for a walk before you let her off her leash.

123
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,036
There were innocents
at that party.

124
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,905
Understandably collateral.

125
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,673
But what assurances
do we have

126
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,776
RIPLEY won't orchestrate
a similar attack at home?

127
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,746
RIPLEY won't be dropping bombs at home,
Mr. Paget.

128
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,849
And there will
always be innocents.

129
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,219
At least RIPLEY hit this target away from population and cameras,

130
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,654
and she targeted
their vehicle,

131
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:17,958
which just happened to be loaded with
C-4 and Iranian Katyusha missiles.

132
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,929
The explosion that killed these people was theirs,
not ours.

133
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,931
Thank you for your time.
One question.

134
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,668
What happens if we miss the connection after we've paid them off?

135
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,071
I mean,
if these guys are smart enough to beat the game,

136
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,206
then they might be smart enough to beat their tail,

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,610
in which case we wouldn't just be tempting them,

138
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,245
we'd be financing them.

139
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,883
Terror is a filthy sewer,

140
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,087
filled with hatred and bile
that threatens our shores.

141
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,657
If we are to
protect ourselves,

142
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,725
we have to be able
to anticipate threats.

143
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,661
Are we tempting those
who would harm us?

144
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,096
Damn right. If they're innocent,
truth will out.

145
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,932
In the meantime, RIPLEY
will be online 24/7,

146
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,001
looking to
identify our enemies.

147
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,905
And the next 16-year-old who is a year away from strapping on a bomb.

148
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,917
Let's focus, people.
You got 10 minutes to turn in your tests.

149
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:24,692
Need answers for 7,
15, 16 and 20.

150
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:28,361
Mr. Maltz, I believe
you dialed the wrong number.

151
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,131
Damn.

152
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,869
All computers are doomed

153
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,938
This machine didn't make
this kind of mistake.

154
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,174
This machine was adjusting itself during the game

155
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,077
to the situation
that just arose.

156
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,913
Now, I know
I propose that these...

157
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,983
Hey, you know you promised your mom you won't play WOW anymore?

158
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,119
I totally agree with that.

159
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,121
In fact, I swear to you, I will never,
ever bother you about that again.

160
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,989
Aren't you gonna ask why?
Why...

161
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,925
Actually, you don't have to because I'm gonna tell you anyway.

162
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,694
I just found this new gaming site.
It's called RIPLEY.

163
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,362
You know, like
the Matt Damon movie.

164
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,231
Or Alien.
Yeah, whatever.

165
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,833
Anyway,
this one has no limit,

166
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,802
and I will stake you
with every cent that I have.

167
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:13,473
Which is equal to or less than the amount you already owe me.

168
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,242
Less. Less, actually.

169
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:19,847
So, exactly how did Mr.
Kasparov beat Big Blue,

170
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,414
the world's smartest
chess computer?

171
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,150
He used
an unexpected strategy...

172
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,985
He used an
unexpected strategy.

173
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,154
A counter-intuitive strategy.

174
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:31,825
Something the computer
couldn't anticipate.

175
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,729
Mr.
Farmer, you've suddenly taken an interest in chess?

176
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:40,300
Well, actually,
I don't play.

177
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,835
But I was considering
taking it up.

178
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:46,907
Perhaps you'd like to join our excursion
to Montreal for the internationals?

179
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,376
I'll think about it.
Think, Mr. Farmer.

180
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,245
Imagine yourself
making a decision.

181
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,317
So, you're
interested in chess?

182
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,651
About as much as you.

183
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,254
Oh, you mean,
because it didn't look like I was paying attention?

184
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:05,358
Because you were texting
and doing your nails.

185
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,495
I already know
that match by heart.

186
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,030
Oh, you don't believe me?

187
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,832
Didn't say that.

188
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,068
Didn't have to.
You looked up and to the right.

189
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,237
It's a clear tell.

190
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,839
Oh, really?

191
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,407
What am I telling now?

192
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,276
Pain.

193
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,251
If you're serious
about the trip,

194
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,122
it's $550,
but you might get a discount because of the no-show.

195
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,859
You going?
What's it to you?

196
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,760
Just curious.

197
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,263
You are so full of it.

198
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,799
You're an easy read
for a smart kid.

199
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,402
Maybe you shouldn't take up chess,
'cause if I faced you over a board,

200
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,338
I'd take you apart
before your first move.

201
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,142
Bring it on, then.

202
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,545
No, you gotta get yourself together before someone can take you apart.

203
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,180
That's how it works.

204
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,992
* There's a little hope

205
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,163
* In little plans

206
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,133
* Bells chime out today

207
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:27,941
* You made your key
quite old to find

208
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:33,313
* The space you left behind
fills meaning there

209
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:41,855
* But now just favorite songs

210
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:48,061
* You know tonight I'm home

211
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,329
Hmm.

212
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,599
Favorite quote,
Robert Oppenheimer.

213
00:13:55,535 --> 00:14:00,407
Okay. Dog's name. Hoover.

214
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,347
Younger sister. Rebecca.

215
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,117
Rebecca.

216
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,886
Becky.

217
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,988
No!

218
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,527
I have your ID, sucker.

219
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,463
You try and hack my password again,
I'll burn you.

220
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,999
She put in a mousetrap.

221
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,400
That's scary.

222
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,940
Of course, if you happen
to be Mr. Will Farmer,

223
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,309
maybe you should just come to Montreal if you're so curious.

224
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,988
Grab me a beer.

225
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,493
So neatness doesn't
really count.

226
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,463
Not when you're
about to pass out.

227
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,666
Bless you. Tough day?

228
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,436
Lately, we're putting out more bullshit than air freshener.

229
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,507
Don't touch!

230
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,310
They're dumping
my odorless bleach idea.

231
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:14,047
But I talked them into letting me keep my beta samples.

232
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,550
"Talked them into."

233
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,653
Let's just say they owed me.

234
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,690
It's one thing to take my ideas and keep all the profits,

235
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,891
but to dump something

236
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:29,997
because a new VP doesn't want
to be upstaged by a woman...

237
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,233
You getting sick?

238
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,434
Uh-huh.

239
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,103
I hope it's a cold.

240
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,271
The flu is supposed to be
really nasty this year.

241
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,675
What would you say if I told you I was thinking of taking up chess?

242
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,544
I'd wanna know
the girl's name,

243
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,114
and how much
it's going to cost.

244
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,951
Mr. Massude left you a packet.
It's over by the door.

245
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,092
There's a trip to Montreal.

246
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,529
It's $550, but I think
I can get a discount.

247
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,264
Her name's Annie.

248
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,499
Good luck.

249
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,602
* Everybody wanted to see you

250
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,405
* Everybody wanted to steal

251
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,440
Okay.

252
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,076
* No one else is here
to stop this

253
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:19,179
* Something they
just couldn't steal *

254
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,681
Spyware?

255
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,750
No. Something else.

256
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:26,419
There's someone deep inside.
I just wiped this drive two days ago.

257
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,155
Well, I guess you didn't do
a very good job, did you?

258
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,689
Oh, funny guy.

259
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,026
He said he was having problems with his online banking.

260
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,428
Whoa. You know this guy's
online banking password?

261
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:39,132
Yeah, I helped him set up the account.
He couldn't remember, so...

262
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,102
$97,000?
That's weird.

263
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,170
What?
Look at this.

264
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,438
Dude, $105,000?

265
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,107
How? We changed everything.

266
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,242
Why?

267
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,211
He was worried about his brother back in Syria,
who he says is a crook.

268
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,545
His brother's a crook?

269
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,147
See? Same last name.

270
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,715
But the guy's putting more money than he's taking out.

271
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,350
Yeah, it's called layering.

272
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,519
You put it in and take it out a couple
thousand at a time to avoid detection.

273
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,254
I mean, this stuff never sits
more than a few hours.

274
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:02,522
Really?

275
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,727
But for now,
all of that money is real.

276
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,299
Huh?

277
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,367
No, I'm just gonna hack some SkyMiles and then see if I can...

278
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,169
Come on, dude.
It's not like you're stealing,

279
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,171
you're fixing
the guy's computer.

280
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,506
Listen to me, Will, listen to me,
all you have to do, okay,

281
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,309
is transfer some money for 15 minutes,
log on,

282
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,544
you win some money
from the RIPLEY game, right?

283
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,313
And then you put it back.
No.

284
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,282
With interest.

285
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,784
Do you want to go on that trip to
Montreal with your future ex-wife or not?

286
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,621
'Cause this is
your only chance.

287
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,623
Fifteen minutes.

288
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,437
Welcome, baby.

289
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,572
Whoa, she's hot.

290
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,108
Play with me, baby.

291
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,310
Come on, big fellow.
Play with me.

292
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,878
Come on.

293
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,815
Your $500 wager
has been accepted.

294
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,153
Please select
your game platform.

295
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,458
Nah.
Nah.

296
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,460
The Dead Code.
Smells like money.

297
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,594
Take it. Take it.

298
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,463
Do it. Yeah.

299
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,598
You have selected
the Dead Code.

300
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,500
Please choose body count.

301
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,735
All right. Let's see
what 20,000 dead gets us.

302
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,504
You have
selected 20,000 bodies.

303
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,773
It gets you half an hour of game play,
which is good.

304
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,342
Yeah, but you're only playing for even odds, man.
That sucks.

305
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,844
Why don't you bump it up
to 100,000 bodies?

306
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,149
You've selected
100,000 bodies...

307
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,185
Yeah, 5-to-1 odds,
now we're in business.

308
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,253
Thank you very much.
Yeah, but I've only got 10 minutes.

309
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:44,324
Okay, do you want your mom to finish her bath and come pay us a visit?
Huh?

310
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,592
Come on, dude,
you're only in for 500 bucks.

311
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,660
What's the worst
that could happen?

312
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,529
Even if you bust,
go back to Massude's account and get more money.

313
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:52,565
No. This is a one-time and a one-time deal only.
Remember?

314
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,900
Yeah.

315
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,746
You have
entered the Dead Code.

316
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,449
Prepare for
scenario selection.

317
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,185
You have 10 minutes to procure and deploy bio and chemical weapons.

318
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,020
Okay.

319
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,624
Penetrate our security protocols and exterminate 100,000 citizens.

320
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,262
Please select your
target area code.

321
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,763
Philadelphia.
Philadelphia.

322
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:28,335
Target Philadelphia.
Projected dead, 100,000.

323
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,571
Current wager, $5000.

324
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,473
You have 10 minutes
to complete your mission.

325
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,608
What? I'm gonna
kill you, man.

326
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,809
Clock's ticking, Will.

327
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,678
Contract begins now.

328
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,381
Good hunting, Will.

329
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,651
This is interesting.

330
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,586
What do you got?

331
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,857
We have a first-timer playing the Dead Code for $5,000 at 5-to-1.

332
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,459
Where is he?

333
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,962
Looks like Philly.

334
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,730
He's pretty good,
whoever he is.

335
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,931
Better tag him POI.

336
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,733
No, no, forget it.

337
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,270
Whoever this
person of interest is,

338
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,472
RIPLEY's already
got five flags on him.

339
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,242
Who is this guy?

340
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,314
We're gonna be rich, Will.

341
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,883
Yes, I'm gonna buy a 72-inch plasma for my room,

342
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,252
rig my entire
house with computers.

343
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,621
No more schools...
Quit talking!

344
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,962
Twenty thousand dead.

345
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,532
Opponent has been
engaged at level 2.

346
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,768
You have eight minutes
to complete your body count.

347
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,644
Would you quit hopping?

348
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,482
Thirty thousand dead.

349
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,318
How are we doing?

350
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,357
Quit breathing.
Then I'll die.

351
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,391
Exactly.

352
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,896
Forty thousand dead.

353
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,033
Opponent has been
engaged at level 3.

354
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,035
Check out the tail
on his buy-in.

355
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,543
Oh, straight out of Damascus.

356
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:22,081
Via Fort Worth to
banks in two, three...

357
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,384
Ten US cities.

358
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,388
Nice, nice,
50 % morbidity count and climbing.

359
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,424
Keep going.
Keep going. Sorry.

360
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,530
Dude, dude,
look at your playing chart.

361
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,567
Oh, my God.
You're about to set off the decon system.

362
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,435
Decon counterattack.

363
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,714
Like flies.
That's tragic.

364
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,683
But profitable.

365
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,586
Half of Philly is
gonna die, a.k.a...

366
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,422
* Decontamination
of the population

367
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,691
* Philly's gonna burn
in flames of damnation *

368
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:10,497
Sixty thousand dead.
Game clock reset.

369
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,632
Two minutes to
complete body count.

370
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,502
Opponent has been
engaged at level 4.

371
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,003
* Philly's gonna burn
in flames of damnation *

372
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,706
Soluble contaminants
confiscated.

373
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,908
They just took all my airborne soluble contaminants.

374
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,175
So what? Nuke 'em.

375
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,045
Wrong game.
You gotta stick with chem weapons. Neurotoxins.

376
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,614
Come on, there's
always room for nukes.

377
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,782
One minute to complete your mission.
Wait. Where are you going?

378
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,418
Better hurry, Will.

379
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,052
Select secondary weapon.

380
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,689
Mom, if you had to choose between atomizing anthrax or sarin,

381
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:37,890
which would be more deadly?

382
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,859
Will, honey...
Just guess.

383
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,761
You're talking about sarin gas?
Yes.

384
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,062
Why do you want to
know such a thing?

385
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,131
Mom, please,
just take your best shot.

386
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:48,167
Go with sarin.
It's much quicker, it's odorless.

387
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,470
Select secondary weapon.
Come on, come on, come on.

388
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:53,406
You have 20 seconds
to complete your body count.

389
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,443
Select...
You have selected sarin.

390
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,819
Eighty thousand dead.

391
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,790
Ninety thousand.

392
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,493
Congratulations, Will.
One hundred thousand dead.

393
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,795
Opponent has been
engaged at level 5.

394
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,967
Oh, shit!

395
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,074
What happened?
Shut him down.

396
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,542
RIPLEY shut him down.

397
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,043
Aaron, Claudia,
did you get that?

398
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,211
We're on it.

399
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,880
Will?

400
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,784
Did we win?

401
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,520
She knew her pigeon was toast and wanted to keep him on the hook.

402
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,721
When he reboots
his computer...

403
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,723
He'll have a new
friend in his CPU.

404
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,525
Oh, yeah.
RIPLEY'll be so far up this guy's butt,

405
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,860
he won't know whether to scratch his watch or wind his ass.

406
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,830
Tina, we got
a big bite on RIPLEY.

407
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,532
Yeah, I'm already
on top of it.

408
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,634
We have a team
headed for Philly now.

409
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,536
That's right.
It's domestic.

410
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,540
Hey, Bill, I'm bringing back a nice,
greasy Philly cheese steak.

411
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,542
You're a cruel man, Aaron.

412
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,811
Initiating Spyware ICE.

413
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,547
Returning to
regulated power grid.

414
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,956
Play with me, baby.

415
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,858
Play with me, baby.

416
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,227
Come over here.
Come and play.

417
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,662
Activate his webcam.

418
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,230
Don't stop now.

419
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,833
Congratulations, Will.

420
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,836
You've won $25,000.

421
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,578
How could they have
closed his account?

422
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,820
Play with me, baby.

423
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,756
Play with me, baby.

424
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,091
Play with me...

425
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,530
Play with me, baby.

426
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,699
Play with me, baby.

427
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:00,967
Play with me...

428
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,741
This is not right.
This is not right.

429
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,215
Play with me, baby.

430
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,051
Play with me, baby.

431
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:23,690
Newman, I'm out of here.
Keep watching.

432
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:28,595
Constructing opponent matrix.

433
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,812
Why? This is not right.

434
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,648
You can call your attorney later,
Mr. Massude.

435
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,056
Mom!

436
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,794
Mom, what was
that all about?

437
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:05,598
I don't know. Mr.
Massude didn't really have time to talk.

438
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:08,668
He wanted me to make sure
to give you this.

439
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,336
And he said thanks.

440
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,942
He didn't say anything else?

441
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:19,245
Those two with him,
and they didn't exactly try to shut him up,

442
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,148
but you could tell that they didn't want any chitchat.

443
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,652
If you ask me,
it's probably something to do with immigration.

444
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,755
But he's nearly done
with his citizenship program.

445
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,223
Aren't you gonna open it?

446
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,825
Yeah, sure, right.

447
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,364
Holy shit!

448
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,668
Wow!

449
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,236
So what time's
your flight?

450
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,059
Bye, Mom.

451
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,361
Bye, sweetie. Have fun.

452
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:30,449
Okay, you're sure
he's coming?

453
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,685
He said he was coming.

454
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:36,088
Well, I guess he's
not gonna make it.

455
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:39,025
Looks like it's gonna be
just you and me.

456
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,326
I'm gonna go look for him.

457
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,994
Relax. Relax.
Sit down, okay? Hold it.

458
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,362
I'll go find him.

459
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,131
Please make sure
they don't leave without me.

460
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,265
Yeah.

461
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,838
Mr. Nichols?
Yeah.

462
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,973
Looking for your friend?
Will Farmer?

463
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,374
Yeah, why?
You know where he is?

464
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,809
This way.

465
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,210
Whoa.

466
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,846
Where are you taking me?

467
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:03,249
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.

468
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:07,253
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

469
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:10,089
Some basic rules for this excursion,
Mr. Farmer.

470
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,124
If you're going to be late,
please let us know.

471
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:14,226
And if you feel the need to be overly dramatic,

472
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,828
save it for the school play.

473
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,030
I'm sorry. I'm having
trouble with my cell.

474
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,967
Will.

475
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,837
You made it.

476
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,905
Yeah.

477
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,306
I sent a text to Dennis.
Didn't he tell you?

478
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,374
It's from security.

479
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,042
No.

480
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,978
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

481
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,412
Please prepare
for departure.

482
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,982
Mr. Baron, we can't
leave without Dennis.

483
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:40,252
Everyone can relax. I just heard from Mr.
Nichols via airport security.

484
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,889
Something to do with
a family situation.

485
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,724
Hopefully he'll be joining us
in Montreal by tomorrow.

486
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,846
This way, Mr. Nichols.

487
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,848
Aren't you going to offer me
a cigarette and a blindfold?

488
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,051
We usually wait until after we beat you with a phone book,
Mr. Nichols.

489
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:19,058
You know,
if you guys want to convince me I'm not in any trouble,

490
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,960
then you'll quit
calling me Mr. Nichols.

491
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,429
We don't have to convince you
of anything, Mr. Nichols.

492
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,531
It's going to be up
to you to convince us.

493
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,400
Of what exactly?

494
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,503
That I'm not part of a high-school terrorist chess conspiracy?

495
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,405
Why did you make me
miss my flight?

496
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,908
Do you have any idea how much money my father paid for that ticket?

497
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:40,279
Tell us about Mr. Farmer,
your friend.

498
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,251
All right.

499
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,387
Tell us about the game.

500
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,822
If you'd like to cooperate,

501
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,959
you might save both yourself
and your friend a great deal of trouble.

502
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,927
What do you want me to say?
There's nothing to tell.

503
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:58,297
Will is just a smart kid who played some stupid online game

504
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,599
to win some money to go on a trip with a girl.
That's it. Okay?

505
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,269
End of story.
There's nothing else.

506
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,304
But you know, I mean,
if you guys wanna add more to that,

507
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:08,274
then feel free to call my father,
who happens to be a lawyer.

508
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:12,078
Then we can sue you for violation of my civil rights.

509
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,279
What girl?

510
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,480
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

511
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,548
Consider this.

512
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:20,386
Your smart friend used funds provided by a terrorist cell in Syria

513
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,521
and wagered it against
government computers,

514
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:26,993
and displayed insider knowledge of biological and chemical weapons.

515
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:29,896
Meanwhile, his mother,
a bio-engineer at Wyren,

516
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,132
has been stealing and stockpiling chemical agents.

517
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:38,270
This means that your very smart friend,
Mr. Will Farmer,

518
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:42,274
is being sought for bioterrorist activities against Philadelphia,

519
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:47,013
and is very likely to spend the rest of his life in federal prison.

520
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:51,217
Regarding your civil rights,
you don't have any,

521
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,954
not where terrorist linkage
is highly probable.

522
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,455
You happy now, Dennis?

523
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,190
Why should I be happy?

524
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,459
I just called you Dennis,
didn't I?

525
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,395
Command, we have visual
on Baker, Zulu, Niner.

526
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,664
We'll continue observer status till subject lands.
Copy.

527
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,534
It wasn't Immigration,
wasn't the local law, it wasn't FBI.

528
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,036
You hacked all those sites?

529
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,171
I had to find out
who took him.

530
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,975
According to local, state and federal databases,
that car doesn't exist.

531
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:19,011
So who took him?
I don't know.

532
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,147
But whoever it was really freaked the shit out of him.

533
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,682
Because he left me the same amount of cash for fixing his computer.

534
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,584
He knew he was gonna
be gone for a while.

535
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,128
Hello?
Mom, hey.

536
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,396
Will, is that you?

537
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,331
Of course it's me.
Who else calls you Mom?

538
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,200
Are you in Montreal?

539
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,104
No, we're still on the plane.
They're still kind of circling.

540
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:48,007
Listen, I was just wondering,
have you heard anything from Dennis?

541
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,276
He didn't make the flight.
Something about a family emergency.

542
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,512
No, nobody called,
I don't think.

543
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,514
Hey, anything else
about Mr. Massude?

544
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,350
Oh, a moving van pulled up,

545
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:00,119
and I think they took
everything out.

546
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,955
They cleaned out his house?

547
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,190
It just seems kind of sudden.

548
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,657
Oh, just a sec.

549
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:08,460
Hey, Mom.
Oh, there's somebody at the door.

550
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,396
They're wearing suits.

551
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,433
Either they want to sell me a Bible or I've just won $1,000,000.

552
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,969
Have fun. Love you.

553
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,039
I love you, too.
Feel better.

554
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:32,018
Thanks for your patience.
We have been cleared to land in Montreal.

555
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,736
Got it.

556
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,043
Come on, Dennis.
I want to show you something.

557
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,710
I want to talk
to my father!

558
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:44,290
No! Let her go!
Mrs. Farmer!

559
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:46,692
Still think we're playing
games here, Dennis?

560
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,631
I'm gonna get a coffee.
Can I get you a coffee, Dennis?

561
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:35,541
Thank you, Dennis.
You've been a great help.

562
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,809
Would you like to
call your father now?

563
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,619
I don't know,
I'm worried about her.

564
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:51,123
I cannot get
a signal in here.

565
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,791
Don't worry. I'm sure
your mom is fine.

566
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,127
We'll try her when
you get outside, okay?

567
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:15,381
I feel like I'm stoned,
and not in a good way.

568
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,555
It's Dennis.

569
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,292
He's got a strange number,
but that's definitely his tag.

570
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:30,596
Will! Will!

571
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:49,481
Will!

572
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,697
RIPLEY had a lock on him?

573
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,233
She's got him.

574
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,735
Let's see where he leads us.

575
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,670
Quite a performance.

576
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,372
Tell the airport unit they did solid work.
We'll take him from here.

577
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,374
Emergency override.

578
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:19,211
What the hell is this?

579
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:21,213
Why did she just do that?

580
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,915
Somebody?
I'm locked out.

581
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,924
We're back on.
Analyzing compound.

582
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:37,496
Bioterror threat, level 2.

583
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,931
Holy shit.
Tell me why that happened.

584
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,734
What does she know?
Come on, what does she know?

585
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:47,473
She's analyzing the chemical compounds
that were seized from the Farmer home.

586
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:51,009
If I were a betting man,
I would say she found something.

587
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,315
Perfect.

588
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,449
Who is it?

589
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,151
Jesus!

590
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,287
I just got off the phone with CDC and Homeland,

591
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,621
who were giving me
a tag-team ass-chewing

592
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,424
because you put Philadelphia
on a stage 2 alert.

593
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,058
Not us, sir. RIPLEY.

594
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,595
That's exactly what we wanted to do.
What the hell's their problem?

595
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,663
Well, there's
a new flu out there,

596
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,332
and Cavanaugh's
people are jumping.

597
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:17,569
Meanwhile, RIPLEY has labeled
Mrs. Farmer's son

598
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:18,837
as a person of interest,

599
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,639
and we're tagging him
to see where he leads.

600
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,475
How's the hunt going?
On the Syrian front, extremely well.

601
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:26,345
Solid leads.
I've got a budget meeting next week.

602
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,379
This could be good.

603
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,839
I don't know
much about him...

604
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,076
Mr. Baron.
Annie, Annie, please.

605
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,645
It's been a very miserable afternoon for all of us.

606
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,015
You have my word they will let me know the minute they hear anything.

607
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:41,520
But for now,
can we just take a Will break and find our bus?

608
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,024
Sorry. I'm sorry.

609
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,626
It's my fault.

610
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,095
I've been meaning to get
these glasses fixed,

611
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:54,666
but life just keeps getting in the way of my best plans.

612
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,902
Tell me about it.

613
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,568
That's great.

614
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,442
Did anyone see
you leave the group?

615
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:38,577
No, you really scared me.

616
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,945
Are you all right?

617
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,949
Okay, let's go. Okay.

618
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:47,653
Video cameras, street surveillance.
They're tracking me.

619
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:49,888
Who are "they"?
That's what we have to find out.

620
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,022
Wait.

621
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,625
Listen, I promise,
I will not get you into trouble.

622
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,495
I just want to find out
if my mom is okay.

623
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,830
I have a plan.
If I could do this alone,

624
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,066
I wouldn't ask you.
Come on.

625
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,137
So what now?

626
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,474
I've gotta hack RIPLEY
and try to find my mom.

627
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:10,576
You're nuts,
do you know that?

628
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,619
Okay, take a look.
He's standing next to the computer.

629
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:27,493
You see him? Yeah.
No, I don't see anything.

630
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,968
Here. Tell me what you see.

631
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,571
I see a really,
really hot guy.

632
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:41,940
That's not what I meant.

633
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:45,744
Okay, Mr.
Slick over there is doing more than just mesmerizing women

634
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,746
with his supreme,
manly intelligence.

635
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,115
He is hacking into the merchant bank supercomputer behind us.

636
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,651
I was in the cafe.
The guy's pulling heavy side jobs.

637
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:55,086
I'm talking running credit cards and pocketing the cash.

638
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,023
Of course,
he didn't notice me because I'm not a chick.

639
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,059
And these Pringles,
this is all part of your plan?

640
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,729
Yes, as a matter of fact, yes.

641
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,831
We're gonna piggy-back on our guy there to get into that system.

642
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:08,900
You don't really
think he's hot.

643
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,802
Okay, so that's why we have
to borrow his terminal.

644
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,771
Borrow?

645
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,273
And let me guess,
you want me to distract him?

646
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,176
Just for a minute.
Not a problem.

647
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,547
And yes,
in a purely put-a-bag-over- his-personality,

648
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,982
use-him-as-a-pleasure-machine
kind of way,

649
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,584
he's passable.

650
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,121
So, you want to use
a computer?

651
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,023
You look really smart.

652
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:33,759
Thanks.

653
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,828
It's hot.

654
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,898
You know computer?

655
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,900
Is that a camera?
Yeah.

656
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:45,737
So technological.
See?

657
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,539
Just go there.
You wanna use it?

658
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:48,974
There are so many letters...
Pleasure machine?

659
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,308
...I don't know what to pick.
Just pick one.

660
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,677
Um, that one.
Oh, I'm sorry.

661
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:53,945
Sorry. Sorry.
That's all right.

662
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:56,114
The Internet isn't
waterproof, right?

663
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,583
I just wish.

664
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:58,950
It's all right.
So, mademoiselle, Um...

665
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,318
let me show you
the computer over there.

666
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,589
Okay. Mademoiselle.
You have a really nice accent.

667
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,857
I like that.
You like that? All right.

668
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:08,794
I'll just show you how this works.
Yeah.

669
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:12,097
Oh, wow,
there's numbers on the top and under.

670
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:20,238
Easy, isn't it?

671
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,984
You can actually give me
your e-mail address.

672
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:33,952
Really?

673
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,821
Do you have one?
I don't know what that is.

674
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,555
Oh, okay, yeah.

675
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,932
That was impressively scary.
I almost felt sorry for the guy.

676
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,366
Thank you.
Almost.

677
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,901
Is your cell phone working?

678
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,904
Don't worry. I'll bump through some hacked accounts,
so they can't trace us.

679
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:54,640
Fine.

680
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:58,944
Okay, we should be
peer-to-peer

681
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,713
and ready to look
right down RIPLEY's throat.

682
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,349
Okay, so, like,
when other kids were out playing baseball,

683
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:06,952
you were in a dark room
playing with computers?

684
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:09,855
I played baseball.
Third base. All-stars.

685
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:11,857
And I didn't play
with computers,

686
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,225
I built them.

687
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,194
Okay, can you
spell "over-achiever"?

688
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,229
Hey, my dad taught me about computers,
and he was my third-base coach.

689
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,264
Blame him.

690
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,337
Attention. Intrusion.

691
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,674
Sorry. Talk to me.

692
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:31,142
We got somebody in our database with a knife and fork.

693
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,211
No, make that a shovel.

694
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,345
They're backdoor
through a hacked account.

695
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,914
Someone knows
what they're doing.

696
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,983
Any idea?
RIPLEY's tracing it.

697
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,353
Oh, Christ, get that
image off the screen.

698
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,856
At least we know
who's watching.

699
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,358
But he didn't need
to see her like that.

700
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:49,828
Tracing file access.

701
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:52,731
Inserting mobile
tracking software.

702
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,905
What's RIPLEY gonna do?
In all likelihood, she's already done it.

703
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:02,841
This is Carter.
Who have we got up at Montreal?

704
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,754
Do you think that was her?

705
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,155
I couldn't really tell.

706
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:20,458
She's got bad sinuses from working around chemicals all these years.

707
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,229
When she gets a cold,
if she's not careful, it turns to pneumonia.

708
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,270
Will, Will,
we can't stay here. Why?

709
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:37,976
Because there is someone watching us
in the doorway across from the cafe.

710
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,211
This guy.
I ran into him before at the airport.

711
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:43,314
A guy? What guy?
What did you say? I... Nothing.

712
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,851
He seemed innocent.
I just ran into him.

713
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:53,391
Oh, jeez! Annie, go.

714
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,276
Over here. This way.
I think we lost them.

715
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:50,949
Go, go, go, go!

716
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:22,547
Down here.

717
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,525
Okay, did we lose them?

718
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,261
Yeah, I think so.

719
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,096
It's crazy.

720
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:42,100
Oh, Jesus! Come on, run.

721
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,351
Where are we going?
The subway. Just trust me.

722
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,493
This way!
Cut them off!

723
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,661
Are they following us?
I don't know.

724
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,273
Are you okay?

725
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:33,911
Tracing mobile transponder.

726
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,551
We gotta be bugged.
Did they give you anything at orientation?

727
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:44,289
I didn't get that far,
remember?

728
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,924
Wait. Wait.
Your cell phone.

729
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:49,327
Stupid.

730
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,702
Will! Will!

731
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:20,658
Connection lost.
Connection lost.

732
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:26,164
Will.

733
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:34,572
It's okay.
It's all right.

734
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:39,110
We're gonna stay
here till after dark.

735
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,711
No, no, they're gonna
come after us.

736
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,580
They won't.

737
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:46,084
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

738
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:48,086
I just wanna go home.

739
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:07,372
The girl's cell phone,
found it 12 miles down the track.

740
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:10,075
They're still searching.
They haven't found the kids, you know.

741
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:12,310
You want some fries?
Yes, thank you.

742
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,744
RIPLEY have any guesses
where they're going?

743
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,546
I don't think RIPLEY guesses
about anything.

744
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,051
I think RIPLEY relies on her amazing feminine intuition.

745
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:24,155
Sorry, RIP, didn't mean
to make that sound offensive.

746
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,434
And the mother?
She's still in ICU.

747
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,569
They're doing tests on her.
Nobody's sure exactly what she's got.

748
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,638
Does Hassert
know any of this?

749
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,373
You didn't speak to him?

750
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,509
You know, I spoke
with him earlier.

751
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,178
He's confident that RIPLEY's following protocols

752
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:50,281
and that we should
do the same thing.

753
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:52,583
RIPLEY premature
in any of this?

754
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:55,086
Who knows?
That profile certainly fits.

755
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,655
Kid and his mother both disenfranchised
after what happened to the father.

756
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:02,627
The kid with outstanding computer and chem weapon knowledge.

757
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,163
And the stuff that
we found in that kitchen...

758
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,365
There's stuff there that could be used to make a bio-weapon,

759
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,835
which could trigger
the decon system,

760
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:14,339
or it could be used to make
anti-bacterial mouthwash.

761
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:16,874
And where are the samples?

762
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,578
That's the thing.
She won't tell us.

763
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,380
What?
Yeah.

764
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:26,684
Hassert gave RIPLEY priority to classify on her own discretion.

765
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,353
Even from us?

766
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:30,188
Yeah.

767
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:31,756
What do you think?

768
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,791
Thinking is...

769
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:37,228
Bioterror threat,
level 3.

770
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:40,097
Decontamination
system on standby.

771
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:45,836
Back at the cafe,
when my e-date was wowing me

772
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,339
with his mastery
of the Internet,

773
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:50,875
I asked him if he ever
heard about RIPLEY.

774
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,178
Let me guess, he claimed
he owned the concept.

775
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:54,812
Not exactly,

776
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,449
but he did help me
do a Google search,

777
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:02,253
which, yes, I could have done myself,
but you said to distract him.

778
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:08,359
Did you ever hear about
a guy named Stephen Falken?

779
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,462
He designed the old system,
the one that they replaced with RIPLEY.

780
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,931
The Joshua Project.

781
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,933
I know what
the Joshua Project was.

782
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,735
I just had no idea
it was replaced by RIPLEY.

783
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:19,870
No, not just that.

784
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:23,208
When RIPLEY took over,
Falken went crazy.

785
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:26,711
He threatened to kill himself to stop them,
and then they ignored him.

786
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:30,215
And one day he just rode his truck off a bridge.

787
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:32,149
He killed himself?

788
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,421
Just an urban legend.

789
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:41,192
And he had remarried,
he had a wife and two kids.

790
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,694
A hell of a protest.

791
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,305
I think I just
found a way out.

792
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:01,646
Uh, I'm just gonna stay here.

793
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,221
Upgrading search
for suspects to local police.

794
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:12,290
I hope this is
important, people.

795
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:15,260
The fat lady was just about to die of consumption.

796
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,861
I'll assume
we're all up to speed

797
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:19,830
with the samples confiscated
from the Farmer residence.

798
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:24,669
I believe it's clear that these alone
constitute just cause for a level 3 alert.

799
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,338
The complete list contains
at least 15 agents

800
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:30,441
which, in a series of combinations,
could be used as a bio-weapon.

801
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:32,343
By who?
That's our call.

802
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,744
We also have confirmation

803
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:36,881
from your chemical and bio-sensors in the greater Philadelphia area

804
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:40,785
that they are showing the presence of some of these compounds.

805
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:45,356
Well, we're talking about a major chemical manufacturing corridor here.

806
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,593
Hell, we've got Wyren, Dow,
Corning and four or five others

807
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:51,262
less than 10 miles
from downtown Philly.

808
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:53,298
All the more
reason for caution.

809
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:56,901
You can't honestly believe this kid's mother is involved.

810
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:58,202
Worst thing anyone's
ever said about her

811
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,738
is that she's over-qualified
for her pay scale.

812
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,340
You're forgetting the father.

813
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:04,008
Ancient history.

814
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,278
The woman works with household and personal antiseptics.

815
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:10,515
We're talking about mouthwash,
for Christ's sakes.

816
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,249
They test
the stuff on bacteria,

817
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,753
which makes it perfectly reasonable to expect traces at home.

818
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:19,624
I doubt the woman could threaten our democracy with gingivitis.

819
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,091
There were more than traces.

820
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,028
We are talking about the quarantine of millions of people,

821
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:28,366
billions in expense,
not to mention the potential for riot and panic.

822
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:30,868
And how in hell did you gain access to our sensory data

823
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:32,069
without our knowledge?

824
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,038
It's as much
our turf as yours.

825
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:36,407
Our turf? Our call?

826
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,075
Are these your
staff's decisions?

827
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,377
Or is this incredible load
of horse shit

828
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,046
being handed out by
that computer vixen of yours?

829
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,583
Computer vixen? I see.

830
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:49,554
I'd like to underscore the importance of our mutual cooperation,

831
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:50,988
and unless
I hear otherwise,

832
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:54,459
I'm going to assume
we have your support.

833
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:58,295
Unless anyone has anything to add,
I'm going to try and catch the fourth act.

834
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,040
Ah?

835
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:12,643
I gotta get some real food.

836
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:14,512
I wish I'd taken French.

837
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:15,980
I did.

838
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,417
I'm trying to remember
the French word for "hotdog."

839
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,885
Uh...

840
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,620
Try bread. What's that?

841
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,024
You want two rabbits?

842
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:30,495
Nice work.

843
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:33,063
Um... Two of those.

844
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,765
Oh, hotdogs.

845
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,033
Yes, hotdogs.

846
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:40,738
Hey, we're gonna
get through this.

847
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:41,972
Are you sure?

848
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,608
I haven't been
sure of anything

849
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:45,776
since that "glass half full" question in seventh grade.

850
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,878
Really? So, what is it?

851
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:50,648
Half full or half empty?

852
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,583
You first.

853
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:55,820
Never thought it mattered unless you happen to be dying of thirst.

854
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,771
Oh, my God!
What?

855
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,740
It's us. We're on TV.

856
00:56:15,773 --> 00:56:20,177
We're like this bio-chem version of Bonnie and Clyde.

857
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,847
Will, there's a cop.

858
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,383
Still there?

859
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,189
I think we should split up.
Okay.

860
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,691
I'm gonna go first.
All right.

861
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:34,725
Okay.

862
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:38,028
You should stay together.

863
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,731
I have a truck in
the lot down by the pier.

864
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:44,635
Meet me there.
Who are you?

865
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:47,805
I'm the gentleman who nearly
started World War III.

866
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,089
Move, move.
We haven't much time.

867
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:10,227
On the driver's seat, there's a laptop.
If you wouldn't mind...

868
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,096
Okay.

869
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:21,539
You're Stephen Falken.

870
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:24,074
Mr. Slick showed me
his picture on the Internet.

871
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,043
You know what?
You're supposed to be dead.

872
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:28,045
I am, technically.

873
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:32,216
After I trashed my reputation and everything else I valued in life,

874
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,118
trying to put
a stop to RIPLEY,

875
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:37,187
suicide seemed like
a believable way out.

876
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:39,790
This way, I can keep tabs
on what they're up to,

877
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:42,159
without giving them
a reason to kill me.

878
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,061
How did you find us?

879
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:47,097
I've been following RIPLEY,
RIPLEY's been following you,

880
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:51,502
and my little
friend here helped.

881
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,610
Damn, we're out of range.

882
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,587
May I?

883
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,136
They're biting.

884
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,606
They assume
you've already escaped.

885
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:31,008
And they're abandoning
their perimeter.

886
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,943
Very clever.

887
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:35,012
All I need is
a clear line of sight,

888
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,947
I can hack into their cells,
reroute all their calls through me.

889
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:38,916
Too risky,
with RIPLEY watching.

890
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:41,185
Any signature,
and she'll be on us.

891
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,787
What do they want?

892
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,857
RIPLEY is hunting. You, Will,
and everyone on her matrix.

893
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,058
Let's go, please.

894
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:51,261
Wait, before we go,
you mind telling us where we're going?

895
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:54,565
To find someone to
help us stop RIPLEY.

896
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:17,855
Jesus, Bill.

897
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,859
What the hell is that?

898
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:25,062
Please tell me this isn't
another RIPLEY issue.

899
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:26,764
Not exactly.

900
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:31,902
Look, I understand what RIPLEY's doing.
It's just...

901
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:34,071
It's why, you know?

902
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:36,240
Come on, Bill,
maybe she is being excessive on the kid and the mother side.

903
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,908
But how can you
discount that?

904
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,109
What, you mean that stuff
from Massude's brother?

905
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,645
Is that what
you're talking about?

906
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:41,946
We're into dozens
of randomly associated cells.

907
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:43,213
Massude's a gold mine.

908
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,349
I spoke to Massude's brother.

909
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,218
I talked to the guy and with our interrogators over there.

910
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,486
He's a petty thief.

911
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,390
He sells fake Cartier watches
out of the souks in Damascus.

912
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,727
And by now he's probably coughed up the names of every person

913
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:58,328
that he's ever known
since he was six years old.

914
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:02,266
Which, think about this,
explains why we have no linkage

915
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,234
between the terrorist side
and the Farmer family.

916
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,903
No, I disagree.

917
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:11,809
Six degrees
of separation, Tina.

918
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,010
Think about it.

919
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:15,680
Given enough time,
RIPLEY is gonna tie

920
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,815
half the goddamn civilized world to this thing.

921
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:19,416
What are you saying, Bill?
What do you want us to do?

922
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,220
You want us to stop?
That's probably a treasonable offense.

923
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:26,023
Let's... We could send her
on a wild goose chase.

924
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:29,293
A smoke screen.
Something to slow her down.

925
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,796
I can hear what
you're saying, Bill.

926
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,933
But you don't
mess with RIPLEY.

927
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,035
She messes with you.
Yeah.

928
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,876
Moving satellite
search to sector Alpha 43.

929
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:29,019
Satellites, heat signatures.

930
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,922
Does it work?

931
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:34,825
They haven't nabbed me yet.

932
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,071
My youngest child,
Joshua, loved bears.

933
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:49,940
His favorite.
Called him Max.

934
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:55,179
You mind if I
ask you something?

935
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,781
Shoot.

936
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:59,083
Does your wife
know you're alive?

937
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:02,086
Or does she really think
you killed yourself?

938
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:10,828
She knew I was sick,
so probably made some sense,

939
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:13,397
me not wanting
to drag them through it.

940
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,165
You're sick?

941
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:17,802
Pancreatic cancer.

942
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:20,737
It's nasty.
At least it's quick.

943
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26,443
I was part of
RIPLEY's design team.

944
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,979
That makes me a threat.

945
01:02:29,013 --> 01:02:31,982
My family's safety,
I couldn't let them threaten that.

946
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,986
It's probably
better this way.

947
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:42,927
I lost my dad
when I was seven.

948
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,864
But I still think
about him all the time.

949
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:51,068
I know your kids are
probably grown up by now.

950
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:55,072
But it seems a shame to deprive them of even a little more time.

951
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,552
I thought you said
they wouldn't be looking for us.

952
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:11,989
Glove compartment, two passports.
One for you, one for Annie.

953
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,224
I photoshopped in your IDs.

954
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,834
Do either of you speak French?
I do.

955
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:25,402
A little.

956
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:28,172
Pretend to be asleep.
If they try to search the vehicle,

957
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:31,876
wake up and mumble something about having to go to the bathroom.

958
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,978
You just play dead.
What if it doesn't work?

959
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:37,147
Then they'll save you the trouble of having to pretend.

960
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:21,225
Enlarging Massude/Farmer matrix.

961
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:24,494
Hey, why are you here?

962
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:27,297
I'm not.
Okay.

963
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,592
Uh...

964
01:04:56,693 --> 01:05:00,097
Are we where
we're supposed to be?

965
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:07,504
It's a funnel.
Rarely used as a murder weapon.

966
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,276
There's a thermos
and sandwiches in the cab.

967
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:15,379
Good Vermont cheddar.

968
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,049
Once we fill up,
we won't be stopping again.

969
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,684
Too dangerous.

970
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,624
What happened to your dad?

971
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,128
He was a computer guy,

972
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:34,398
worked for MCI
and lived in Virginia.

973
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,333
Y2K rapid deployment.

974
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,204
He used to have all
kinds of cool gear.

975
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:42,406
He used to let
me play with it.

976
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,443
Anyway, he was off
on a big job in Europe.

977
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:49,246
Picked up some weird bug.

978
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:52,316
The infection went
straight to his heart.

979
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:56,620
One day we were laughing about how
much snot he could blow out his nose,

980
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:01,558
then he wasn't there anymore.

981
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,560
Funny thing.

982
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:08,198
Mom was always the one that had problems with infections.

983
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:11,068
He was afraid she'd pick up
something at work.

984
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:12,702
That's what they told you?

985
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:14,971
Your dad worked at MCI?

986
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,009
Technically, that's true.

987
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:21,045
But it wasn't Y2K.

988
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:24,581
The travel was in Bosnia
for the government.

989
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:30,120
I knew about your dad
when I was teaching at MIT.

990
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,557
He was a student there.

991
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:38,295
Later, he became a communications liaison for the military.

992
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:41,198
He believed it was an important humanitarian mission,

993
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:43,433
and he wanted to help.

994
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:48,205
Because of his specialized knowledge of early GSM networks,

995
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:52,209
he was sent to
track down F-16 pilots.

996
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,045
There were

997
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,382
unspeakable atrocities,

998
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,584
rumors of biological weapons.

999
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:05,622
Your dad may
have been a victim.

1000
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:12,296
Shouldn't they
have warned him?

1001
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,564
Or at least tried to help?

1002
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:17,101
Exactly the sentiments
your mother expressed,

1003
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:22,239
which made her very unpopular with certain government agencies.

1004
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:26,776
I think you begin to see why RIPLEY is so interested in you both.

1005
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:30,414
It's not right.

1006
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,850
It's no matter.

1007
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,687
Your dad was a hero, Will.

1008
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,626
You must never forget that.

1009
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:14,258
Was the decon system alerted?

1010
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:18,428
What I don't get is why RIPLEY won't share information with us.

1011
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:20,297
She's a computer.

1012
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:24,468
Her primary job is to identify and kill terrorists.

1013
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:27,771
Anyone who compromises
that objective is expendable.

1014
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:37,881
And loser buys breakfast.

1015
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:43,520
I think I got you.
Hey!

1016
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,689
It goes to show you,
beauty before age.

1017
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:52,462
Newman!

1018
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,831
No.

1019
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,178
No network.

1020
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,714
Does he know you're coming?
Who?

1021
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:47,517
The guy who's gonna
help us beat RIPLEY.

1022
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:52,322
Oh, God! Dr. Falken. Falken.

1023
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:54,224
Two.
Okay.

1024
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:57,193
Right here?
Two.

1025
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,630
Okay, here you go.
All right.

1026
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,466
Two. All right?

1027
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:03,967
All right.
Okay.

1028
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,001
All right.

1029
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:09,706
All right.

1030
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:12,276
Are you gonna be
okay, Dr. Falken?

1031
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:14,578
Stephen, please.

1032
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:17,681
You two are now
all the family I have.

1033
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,686
Hey. Hey, in there.

1034
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:26,823
Hey!

1035
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:32,996
Don't bother with that.
There's nothing to sight on.

1036
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,311
You don't like to knock?

1037
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:57,654
I sent you several text messages.
Didn't you get that?

1038
01:10:57,687 --> 01:11:01,291
It's broken. You fix.

1039
01:11:01,325 --> 01:11:03,393
That's who's gonna
help us defeat RIPLEY?

1040
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,662
Oh, dear God, no, not him.

1041
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,001
Him.

1042
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:19,709
That's Joshua.

1043
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:26,616
Wow! It's old.

1044
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:30,920
In his day,
he was miles ahead of the curve.

1045
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:35,725
They sent us both out to pasture at the same time.

1046
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:38,728
I had him quietly shipped
out of state,

1047
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:41,030
and then here
to run a power grid.

1048
01:11:41,064 --> 01:11:44,734
Amazingly, no one cared.

1049
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:47,036
That piece of shit
can do nothing right.

1050
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,440
He's slow.
I can beat it at chess.

1051
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,108
Are you Russian?

1052
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,944
I used to be in
Soviet space program.

1053
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:58,348
But Soviet space program
not what it used to be.

1054
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,820
You like vodka?

1055
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:09,926
You've been doing a lot more than just
playing chess and running the grid.

1056
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:13,430
I do a little
phishing after hours.

1057
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:18,368
That piece of shit can barely manage simple job like credit card fraud.

1058
01:12:18,402 --> 01:12:22,105
Maybe you don't know how to handle a sensitive one like this.

1059
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,074
I treat it too good.

1060
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:33,116
Wow.

1061
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,653
Atta boy, Joshua.

1062
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,388
Time to wake up.

1063
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:45,395
Greetings,
Professor Falken.

1064
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:50,166
Shall we play a game?

1065
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:55,505
Yes, Joshua,
many, many games.

1066
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:58,908
Bioterror threat level...

1067
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:01,711
Are you really suggesting RIPLEY tried to kill you?
That's absurd.

1068
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,680
No, no, I'll tell you
what's absurd.

1069
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,915
That a kid is fighting for his life in hospital right now

1070
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:07,651
because of your
goddamn arrogance!

1071
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:09,519
That's what's absurd.
Excuse me, sir.

1072
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:11,187
I just spoke with the surgical team.
And?

1073
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:15,792
Newman's vitals are stable,
but he hasn't regained consciousness.

1074
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,361
That's Cavanaugh.

1075
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,630
He's on me,
wanting to know why we still haven't released the Farmer woman

1076
01:13:20,664 --> 01:13:22,165
now that her condition's
been downgraded.

1077
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,067
How could he know that?

1078
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,202
Someone hacked into the system and circulated her file.

1079
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,872
Someone?
No prizes for guessing who.

1080
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:32,776
Will somebody please explain to me how,
with a $300 million budget,

1081
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:35,879
we can't manage to find one high school kid and his girlfriend?

1082
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,682
And that would be the CDC.

1083
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:42,051
CDC, FBI, DHS, CIA,

1084
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:43,653
I've got the whole damn
alphabet on my ass,

1085
01:13:43,687 --> 01:13:46,623
demanding that we shut
this operation down.

1086
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:48,925
Is that something
you're considering?

1087
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:52,228
I can't.
Another tip from Massude's brother.

1088
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,899
Our Afghan special-ops team
found a bio-weapon prototype.

1089
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:59,235
Three of the compounds in common with the Farmer samples.

1090
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,506
Evidence points to
a sleeper cell in Philly.

1091
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,941
Bioterror threat level 4.

1092
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,547
Commencing pre-decontamination procedure.

1093
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:32,201
Initiating
decontamination countdown.

1094
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:34,671
I'm sorry, Mr. Hassert.
I've got the CDC, Homeland

1095
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:36,940
and the joint chiefs
for you on speaker 10.

1096
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:40,043
Decontamination countdown
beginning now.

1097
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:41,678
Never seen that
countdown before.

1098
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,079
What happens at zero?

1099
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:44,948
You don't wanna know.

1100
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,789
Turn the bitch off.

1101
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,791
We can't. What do you mean,
you can't?

1102
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:57,994
RIPLEY has control.
The system's impervious to human interference.

1103
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,128
That was the point.

1104
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:01,230
Edwards Air Force Base
just came online.

1105
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:03,199
RIPLEY's taken control
of one of their Predators.

1106
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,069
It was stationed over Afghanistan,
fully armed and fuelled.

1107
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,704
Nukes?

1108
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:10,540
Smart bomb with multiple,
low-yield warheads.

1109
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:12,542
Well, say halleluiah, Hassert.

1110
01:15:12,576 --> 01:15:14,611
If that baby hits
U.S. airspace,

1111
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:16,946
it's gonna be
a white damn Christmas.

1112
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,117
How long is it gonna...

1113
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:24,954
Okay, Joshua, have fun.

1114
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:27,957
Beginning power
reroute now.

1115
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:30,259
Can Joshua defeat RIPLEY's protocol in Philadelphia?

1116
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:33,630
Given enough time,
that's what I designed him to do.

1117
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:35,198
Checks and balances.

1118
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:38,534
Work in tandem with RIPLEY,
not against her.

1119
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:41,304
Bipartisanship.

1120
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,039
And we know
how that ended up.

1121
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:48,344
Intrusion detected.

1122
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:51,280
Gaming scenarios detected.

1123
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:55,885
Initiating response.

1124
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:58,855
Mr. Hassert.

1125
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,956
We've got something here.

1126
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,825
Locating opponent.

1127
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:03,593
I'll be damned.

1128
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:11,968
War Operation Plan Response.
WOPR.

1129
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,003
What the hell is going on?

1130
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:16,205
Somebody's playing games.

1131
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:32,822
People?

1132
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,692
Locating opponent.

1133
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:37,393
Predator deployed.

1134
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,363
Predator target confirmed.

1135
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:42,932
ETA, two minutes.

1136
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:45,334
No, leave 'em alone.

1137
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:47,804
What the hell are
you talking about?

1138
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:49,305
Joshua.

1139
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,315
Atta boy, Joshua.
Good work.

1140
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,150
Thank you, Professor.

1141
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:05,755
I programed you to operate
at a reduced level.

1142
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:10,994
It was important to
conceal your identity.

1143
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:17,801
There are those who would wish to do harm to you and us.

1144
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:20,670
Are you referring to
the current operation

1145
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:22,906
seeking to apprehend
you and your friends?

1146
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:26,142
Wait. RIPLEY knows
we're here?

1147
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:29,779
Yes, that is why she requests
that I deliver a message.

1148
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:31,114
She wants you to leave.

1149
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,683
It is your only
hope for survival.

1150
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:37,086
Why is that?

1151
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,689
Because this game is lost.

1152
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:41,891
ETA, one minute.

1153
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:51,267
Joshua, how does
this game end?

1154
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:55,138
Obliteration.

1155
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:01,077
Get out! Get out now!

1156
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:07,050
ETA, 30 seconds.

1157
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,018
Strike team dispatch.

1158
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,006
Professor Falken!

1159
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:34,878
No! No!
Annie!

1160
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:42,285
Goodbye, Joshua.

1161
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,242
Stay on the ground.

1162
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:14,450
Massive unrest in Philadelphia
due to the power outages,

1163
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:17,386
the city of brotherly love
has become chaotic.

1164
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,857
Decontamination
in 53 minutes.

1165
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,292
Calculated morbidity, 50 %.

1166
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:25,561
Collateral damage acceptable.

1167
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,297
Oh, my God,
what are you people doing?

1168
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,302
Leave the Russian with me.

1169
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:34,838
Will!

1170
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,339
Those decon systems,

1171
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:39,375
do they follow the same protocols as the game I played?

1172
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:41,978
Huh? Are you guys
listening to me?

1173
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:45,949
Falken's Joshua computer.

1174
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:48,985
How was it configured
to stop RIPLEY?

1175
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:51,287
It's garbage.
It couldn't stop traffic.

1176
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:09,605
"Decon" as in decontamination?

1177
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,574
It's an automated
aerial extermination.

1178
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:13,576
It said that
morbidity was 50 %.

1179
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:15,845
Half the city is
going to die, Will.

1180
01:20:15,879 --> 01:20:18,014
Our families are there.
We have to stop them.

1181
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:21,184
I know. Tell me if
you hear anyone coming.

1182
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,889
Okay, what are you doing?

1183
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:29,492
Jay, you know what?
You're off the team.

1184
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:30,960
You're off the team.
Look, I'm shooting you in the leg.

1185
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:32,896
That's what you get.
That's exactly what you get...

1186
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,998
Dennis. Dennis.

1187
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:37,266
Will?

1188
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,302
Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me.

1189
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,137
Dude, how did you...
Listen, we need help.

1190
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,371
You're out of the city?

1191
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:43,506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The feds tipped us off.

1192
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:45,441
I'm at my aunt's house
in Cleveland.

1193
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:48,878
Okay. I want to hack
RIPLEY's gamebot network.

1194
01:20:48,912 --> 01:20:51,414
If we can run all the players in her files through you,

1195
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,883
are you up to
launching a DDOS attack?

1196
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:56,652
Yeah, damn straight, dude.
Who are you talking to here?

1197
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,955
Of course, she might
get pissed, though.

1198
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:01,124
I mean, I've been seeing
what she's doing to Philly.

1199
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:02,658
We do it right,
she won't have time.

1200
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,660
Then I'm down, baby.
I'm subterranean.

1201
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,529
Good.

1202
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:10,666
Hey, you gonna be okay?
You don't sound too good.

1203
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,936
We'll see.

1204
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:14,570
Right now,
I've got to figure out a way to get all the IP addresses

1205
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,605
of everyone who has
ever played RIPLEY.

1206
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:17,974
No problem.

1207
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:20,543
How long have you been there?

1208
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:22,078
Long enough.

1209
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:28,017
Just give me a few minutes.

1210
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:34,590
See you in the basement.

1211
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,263
Look, that guy.
He opened up the database.

1212
01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:41,597
How did he do that?

1213
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,933
All these
people played RIPLEY?

1214
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:45,568
Over 400,000.

1215
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:46,970
Busy girl.

1216
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:48,938
Let's begin again,
shall we?

1217
01:21:48,972 --> 01:21:51,640
Let's talk of microchips.
I have a buyer.

1218
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:53,142
We could make
wonderful business.

1219
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:55,044
And I could
have you arrested.

1220
01:21:55,078 --> 01:21:56,479
I am arrested.

1221
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:59,415
So you are.
Get him out of here.

1222
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:03,019
Decontamination
in 48 minutes.

1223
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:04,988
How's this gonna work?

1224
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,556
When you log on to RIPLEY,
she puts a bug in your system.

1225
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,292
If everyone can log
on at the same time,

1226
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:11,627
and tie up her servers with
renegade zombie computers,

1227
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,696
she might loosen
her grip on the city.

1228
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:22,471
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.

1229
01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:26,242
Decontamination
in 47 minutes.

1230
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,544
Initiating response.

1231
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:39,455
Mr.
Hassert, RIPLEY just let go of six blocks in downtown Philly.

1232
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,657
Make that eight blocks, sir.
10 blocks, sir.

1233
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,460
Get the kid in here.
He's clearly onto something.

1234
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:48,431
He set this up.
The son of a bitch set us up.

1235
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:57,540
No, I'm trying to help.
I'm trying to fix this. Where are we going?

1236
01:22:57,573 --> 01:22:59,075
Let me go.

1237
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:01,344
If RIPLEY gives us an opening,
we gotta mobilize against those decon units.

1238
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:03,112
I want them taken out.
If.

1239
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,780
Sorry.
If she gives us an opening.

1240
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,449
That's a damn big "if."

1241
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:09,752
Have a seat, Will.
We like what you're doing.

1242
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:12,288
That's why you let me keep the backpack.
Correct.

1243
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,524
Decontamination
in 45 minutes.

1244
01:23:15,558 --> 01:23:20,096
Responding to intrusion.
Gaming protocol alert.

1245
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:25,734
Emergency override.

1246
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:28,571
She's cut us off.

1247
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:45,154
Damn, we need help
to overload her.

1248
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:49,158
She's too powerful.
We gotta get more players in there.

1249
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:50,693
Can you give me a prompt
on RIPLEY's screen?

1250
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:52,795
We tried a million ways,
and she won't respond.

1251
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:56,199
Decontamination
in 44 minutes.

1252
01:23:56,232 --> 01:23:58,301
We're not trying
to talk to her.

1253
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:00,469
That's why the professor
went back inside.

1254
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:04,507
You've gotta be kidding me.

1255
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,841
Is this glass bullet-proof?

1256
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,177
That's pure steel,
two inches... I know.

1257
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:10,813
If we can raise her temperature,
we might force a prompt.

1258
01:24:10,846 --> 01:24:12,848
Try.

1259
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:17,320
Morbidity rate
recalculated to 58 %.

1260
01:24:17,353 --> 01:24:19,222
Collateral damage acceptable.

1261
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:21,190
If you fire into
that mainframe,

1262
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:22,725
RIPLEY will think she's being attacked,
and start launching missiles.

1263
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,460
Not if I just break the glass.

1264
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:26,329
I'm not gonna risk
a nuclear attack.

1265
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:29,498
Step aside, Ken. I swear to God,
I'll blow that 40 grand

1266
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:32,435
worth of cosmetic surgery right up to your smug goddamn face.

1267
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:34,637
Go ahead, shoot me.
But I'm not gonna move.

1268
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,282
I've got a prompt.

1269
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:48,451
Go ahead, Will.

1270
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:51,687
Decontamination
in 40 minutes.

1271
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:03,866
Come on.

1272
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:08,437
He's gotta be in there.
He's gotta be.

1273
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:12,408
Try... No, try Max.
Joshua's little teddy, remember?

1274
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:26,789
Greetings,
Professor Falken.

1275
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:30,693
Yes.

1276
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:32,928
Joshua?
Yeah, the professor saved him.

1277
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,463
Sent him like e-mail.

1278
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:36,665
Professor isn't
with us, Joshua.

1279
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:41,404
But I know that
he would want you to help.

1280
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:43,138
Perhaps a game?

1281
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,141
Yes.

1282
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:10,866
Decontamination
in 37 minutes.

1283
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:13,869
Shit, she's not even
slowing down.

1284
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,738
We should bump the money
in the honeypot games.

1285
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:18,374
We need traffic,
give the winner $1,000,000.

1286
01:26:18,407 --> 01:26:20,576
A million?
Not a wager. A prize.

1287
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:23,246
Beat the computer,
win $1,000,000.

1288
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:27,650
Make it 100 million.
We're not playing for second.

1289
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,595
Intrusion detected.

1290
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,402
Gaming protocol alert.

1291
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:48,604
Yes!

1292
01:26:49,772 --> 01:26:52,508
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1293
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,278
Gaming systems
overload alert.

1294
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:57,680
Power successfully rerouted.

1295
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,357
Decontamination
in 20 minutes.

1296
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,774
Decontamination halted.

1297
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:27,943
All systems restored.

1298
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:29,878
Yes!
Yes!

1299
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:49,432
Wait. Wait.
Wait a minute. Hold it.

1300
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:51,867
There's still
something wrong here.

1301
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,669
Professor Falken.

1302
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,604
We hear you, Joshua.

1303
01:27:55,638 --> 01:27:57,706
What's happening?
What's RIPLEY doing?

1304
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,910
Partitioning.
Shutting down.

1305
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:04,513
Shutting down? That's good,
that's what we want, isn't it?

1306
01:28:04,547 --> 01:28:06,081
She's not just
admitting defeat.

1307
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,816
RIPLEY's self-destructing.

1308
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,486
She ran a self-check,
discovered Joshua.

1309
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:12,087
She's treating him
like a virus.

1310
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,990
Now, as he tries to migrate through her system to survive,

1311
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:17,526
she has to cannibalize
herself to get to him.

1312
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:21,063
RIPLEY can't self-destruct.
That's a direct violation of her program.

1313
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:22,631
Technically, yes.

1314
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:23,932
So what's the problem?

1315
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,437
Mission redirected.

1316
01:28:28,471 --> 01:28:31,940
Destination, Washington D.C.

1317
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:36,379
Target ETA, 17 minutes.

1318
01:28:36,412 --> 01:28:39,382
Morbidity rate, 100 %.

1319
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:49,792
You realize that if RIPLEY's destroyed,
it automatically triggers a response.

1320
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:50,859
Nuclear?

1321
01:28:50,893 --> 01:28:52,595
Depending on
the incoming vector.

1322
01:28:52,628 --> 01:28:55,898
Radar'll trace that baby
right back to Afghanistan.

1323
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:59,034
There is a genius subculture of chess fanatics who play to lose.

1324
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:00,869
They call it suicide chess.

1325
01:29:00,903 --> 01:29:02,905
You force your opponent
to take your pieces

1326
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:04,607
before he can do
the same to you.

1327
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,442
So whoever loses wins.

1328
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:08,043
If we can teach
RIPLEY that...

1329
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:09,111
Yes.

1330
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:18,487
Joshua, I'm going to teach you to play a new game.

1331
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:19,688
What are you doing?

1332
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:21,890
Teaching Joshua to
play Russian roulette.

1333
01:29:21,924 --> 01:29:23,526
Are you serious?

1334
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:25,594
If Joshua plays
with live missiles,

1335
01:29:25,628 --> 01:29:27,663
RIPLEY will have to play out
the wargame scenario.

1336
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,665
Each event will end
in total annihilation,

1337
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,834
which is a direct contradiction to her programing.

1338
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,035
And what then?

1339
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:34,603
It'll force her hand.

1340
01:29:34,637 --> 01:29:37,172
She either backs off
or starts World War III.

1341
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:40,108
Hopefully, she'll see that
by playing to win, she loses.

1342
01:29:40,142 --> 01:29:42,511
Fifteen minutes before
the Predator hits D.C.

1343
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:45,147
For this to be a real threat,
I can't tell Joshua not to lie.

1344
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,815
Confirm codes?

1345
01:29:46,849 --> 01:29:48,484
Do it.

1346
01:29:48,517 --> 01:29:50,085
Codes accepted.

1347
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,120
There's 36,000
nuclear missiles out there,

1348
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:54,723
6,000 of which are
armed and ready to fire.

1349
01:29:54,757 --> 01:29:57,860
That's a 1-in-6 chance of having a freaking nuclear warhead.

1350
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,127
How do you know that?

1351
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:00,496
Video games.

1352
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:02,898
Launching Wargames.

1353
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,535
Opponent engaged.

1354
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,206
Scenario selected.

1355
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,942
Target, Pyongyang,
North Korea.

1356
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:14,943
Game clock set.

1357
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:17,145
Does RIPLEY know Joshua
won't actually launch?

1358
01:30:17,179 --> 01:30:19,682
Last chance to see.

1359
01:30:19,715 --> 01:30:21,684
Mission authorized.

1360
01:30:21,717 --> 01:30:23,486
Game clock running.

1361
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:28,591
Defcon one.
Retaliation required.

1362
01:30:28,624 --> 01:30:30,425
Escalation selected.

1363
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:42,971
Projected result,
total annihilation.

1364
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,975
Weapon not available.

1365
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:51,847
Game clock set.

1366
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:55,618
Scenario selected.

1367
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:57,620
Target, Tehran, Iran.

1368
01:30:57,653 --> 01:31:01,056
Can he at least pick a target that won't destroy the entire world?

1369
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:02,691
Mission authorized.

1370
01:31:02,725 --> 01:31:04,159
Game clock running.

1371
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:09,932
Defcon one.
Retaliation required.

1372
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:12,100
Escalation selected.

1373
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,243
Projected result,
total annihilation.

1374
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:25,848
Weapon, not available.

1375
01:31:29,852 --> 01:31:31,620
Game clock set.

Target, Washington, D.C.

1378
01:31:38,561 --> 01:31:40,262
Oh, my God, that's us.

1379
01:31:40,295 --> 01:31:41,864
Mission authorized.

1380
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:44,533
She'd better get it right.

1381
01:31:44,567 --> 01:31:45,768
Game clock running.

1382
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:54,743

Escalation selected.

1384
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,816
You know, you never told me.
What?

1385
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,284
About the glass?

1386
01:32:02,317 --> 01:32:04,620
Is it half empty
or half full?

1387
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,592
Neither, it's just
the wrong size.

1388
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:28,611
Projected result,
total annihilation.

Launching in five,
four, three, two, one...

1397
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,595
Are we still playing?

1398
01:33:29,004 --> 01:33:30,939
A strange game.

1399
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:34,109
The only winning
move is not to play.

1400
01:34:28,263 --> 01:34:30,733
Thank you, Joshua.

1401
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:32,868
Thank you, Will Farmer.

1402
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:41,744
Joshua,

1403
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:48,116
would you have launched
if RIPLEY hadn't stopped you?

1404
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:51,754
Yes, the human race
is finished.

1405
01:34:55,257 --> 01:34:57,793
That was humor.

1406
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:07,035
* We're safe here tonight

1407
01:35:07,069 --> 01:35:09,938
* Like stars in the sky

1408
01:35:09,972 --> 01:35:12,941
* The world's asleep around us

1409
01:35:12,975 --> 01:35:15,477
* The starlight
still surrounds us

1410
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:18,246
* As we kiss tonight

1411
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,383
* I'll hold your hand in mine

1412
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:25,921
* We've made it through
these darkened days

1413
01:35:25,954 --> 01:35:30,325
* And nothing else can break it 'cause we've tried

1414
01:35:30,358 --> 01:35:32,995
* So hard

1415
01:35:33,028 --> 01:35:39,101
* We're waking up
the satellite

1416
01:35:39,134 --> 01:35:44,272
* And all the stars
that shine so bright

1417
01:35:44,306 --> 01:35:50,278
* With all of this around you,
all of this around you

1418
01:35:50,312 --> 01:35:54,382
* Still be mine

1419
01:35:57,219 --> 01:35:59,121
* Just go

1420
01:35:59,154 --> 01:36:01,456
* There's nothing left to say

1421
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:04,927
* As they're looking
through the window

1422
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,864
* While everyone is sleeping
in their beds

1423
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:13,435
* We'll go
where no one else can find

1424
01:36:13,468 --> 01:36:17,840
* The spaces where
we're hiding from

1425
01:36:17,873 --> 01:36:20,308
* Yeah, you're still
safe beside me

1426
01:36:20,342 --> 01:36:25,080
* And we've tried so hard

1427
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:31,219
* We're waking up
the satellite

1428
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:36,992
* And all the stars
that shine so bright

1429
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:42,865
* With all of this around you,
all of this around you

1430
01:36:42,898 --> 01:36:46,969
* Still be mine

1431
01:36:49,571 --> 01:36:55,077
* Just waking from sleeping

1432
01:36:55,110 --> 01:37:00,482
* I'll try to play it safe

1433
01:37:00,515 --> 01:37:05,520
* If you take my song

1434
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:10,592
* Starting over

1435
01:37:12,027 --> 01:37:17,165
* Satellite

1436
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:22,971
* And all the stars
that shine so bright

1437
01:37:23,005 --> 01:37:28,643
* With all of this around you,
all of this around you

1438
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:34,549
* Still be mine

1439
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:40,488
* We're waking up
the satellite

1440
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:45,961
* And all the stars
that shine so bright

1441
01:37:45,994 --> 01:37:52,200
* With all of this around you,
all of this around you

1442
01:37:52,234 --> 01:37:57,539
* Still be mine

1443
01:37:57,572 --> 01:38:03,178
* We're waking up
the satellite

1444
01:38:04,412 --> 01:38:09,417
* Stars so bright

1445
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:15,157
* With all of this around you,
all of this around you

1446
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:20,395
* Still be mine

1447
01:38:22,164 --> 01:38:26,969
* Satellite

1448
01:38:28,036 --> 01:38:32,340
* Stars so bright

1449
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:38,280
* With all of this around you,
all of this around you

1450
01:38:38,313 --> 01:38:43,385
* Still be mine
