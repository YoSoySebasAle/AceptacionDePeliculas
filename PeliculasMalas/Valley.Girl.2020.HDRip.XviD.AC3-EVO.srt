00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:31,351
Hey, what's up?
How you doing'?

3
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,763
Hey, could you pick me up,
please?

4
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:46,166
Like, now?

5
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:02,649
How was the movie?

6
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:04,718
I'm sorry, okay?

7
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:05,885
Yeah, get in.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,894
Hey.

9
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,264
You know, when I was your age,

10
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:21,868
I barfed all over
Grandma's favorite shag carpet

11
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:23,136
in the guest bathroom.

12
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:24,938
I told her
it was bad shellfish.

13
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:26,840
But actually,

14
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:29,509
I downed half a bottle
of peppermint schnapps

15
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:31,911
behind Sweetie Pie's
with my friends.

16
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:34,247
So, come on.

17
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:35,915
No judgment. Just tell me
what happened tonight.

18
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:39,753
Zach and I broke up.

19
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,855
Oh, my God.
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

20
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,923
No, don't... Don't...
Don't do any of that.

21
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:45,525
It's just...

22
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,661
He started talking about Japan
and how it's too far,

23
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:49,562
and that I shouldn't
do the program next year.

24
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,065
That's not cool.

25
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:52,332
What?

26
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,500
Like, Mom,
you just have no idea

27
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,734
what I'm going through, ever.

28
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:56,603
- Maybe he's right.
- Actually...

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,505
Maybe I shouldn't go. It's not
like I speak the language.

30
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,074
I don't know anyone else
who's going.

31
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,307
Why am I even going?

32
00:02:01,374 --> 00:02:02,742
Listen, when I was
in high school...

33
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:04,411
No, Mom, this isn't
the Sweetie Pie's, okay?

34
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:06,312
Things are, like,
a lot more stressful now.

35
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:07,814
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

36
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,382
Why don't you sit down,
and I'll tell you a story.

37
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,717
Because I'm gonna go to bed.
I'm tired.

38
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:12,019
Aw. Well, you're probably
just gonna

39
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:13,353
stare at your phone all night.

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,521
So, then why can't you
just text me?

41
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:17,524
Sit your butt down!

42
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:24,965
It was the early '80s...

43
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:27,267
No, please, not the '80s.

44
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,836
Yes, the '80s
in the San Fernando Valley.

45
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:31,105
And me and my friends...

46
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:32,505
Were valley girls.

47
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,240
I know, you've told me
a thousand times.

48
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:35,542
You guys were all like,

49
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:37,677
"Oh, my God.
Like, where's my brain?"

50
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:40,380
Yup. And we actually used
words like "tripendicular,"

51
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:43,717
and we wore teal eyeliner
and popped collars.

52
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:47,587
And we hung out
at the mall every night.

53
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:49,689
Wow. Deep.

54
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:52,459
Okay, so we weren't exactly
solving world hunger.

55
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:55,996

it seemed perfect.

That's how I remember it.

126

And he was, "Totally."
And then he was all like,

127
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:52,765
"Uh, call me, babe."
And I was like, "Rob!"

128
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:54,134
- Oh, my God!
- I'm so sure.

129
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,402
Oh, my God.

130
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:57,837
But you said
you wanted to call him.

131
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,772
Duh. Like, she totally does,

132
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,541
but she can't act like
she does.

133
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:04,844
See, that's why Julie has the
most bitchin' dude in school.

134
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:06,612
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

135
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,082
Ugh. I'm gonna barf.
Where should we go now?

136
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,716
- Esprit or Limited?
- Limited.

137
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:11,285
Esprit.

138
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,187
I... Esprit.

139
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:15,222
Well, I've got a radical idea.

140
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,225
Let's blow. I mean,
we could go anywhere.

141
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,592
Like another mall?

142
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:20,927
No. Like,
get on the first bus we see.

143
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,729
We could, like,
go over the hill

144
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:24,164
to Hollywood or something.

145
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,000
Or we could just, like,
see where it takes us.

146
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,073
You're freaking me out!

147
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,907
Oh, my God.
Like, freak me out.

148
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:36,343
It sounds, like,
way dangerous.

149
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,978
- Hollywood is so groady!
- Let's go.

150
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,079
Thank God.

151
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:14,348
Julie, like,
here comes your man.

152
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:17,550
- Damn, he's so fresh.
- Stop.

153
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,819
Hey, hot stuff.
Catch you at the pep rally?

154
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:21,687
Yeah. It's, like, mandatory.

155
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:28,761

162
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,548
Mickey Bowen!

163
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,615
Check out that bod.

164
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,751
All right.

165
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:04,498
It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine.

166
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:06,799
Hey, everybody.

167
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,069
And to think that some members
of the faculty

168
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,571
suggested
that we shouldn't have

169
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:11,972
a pep rally for one person.

170
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,507
Boo!

171
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:14,841
And need I remind you?

172
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:17,578
Senior prom is just
one month away!

173
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:24,318
And, uh, I have
some great news for you.

174
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:26,853
Let's get a drumroll, please.

175
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,655
Our high school
has been selected

176
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:33,193
to have our prom
broadcast live

177
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,662
on the greatest radio station
in LA, KROQ!

178
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:39,299
Oh, my God!

179
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,867
And,
everybody, remember,

180
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,469
no more spiking the punch.

181
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:44,404
Okay? Last year, I got a DUI.

182
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:47,907
Mickey, I'm not...

183
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,276
Mickey, I'm not supposed
to come in here.

184
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:50,643
Okay.

185
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,012
Mickey,
we could get in trouble.

186
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,614
We're gonna get
in trouble together.

187
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,781
- We can't...
- Hey, it's just us. Okay?

188
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:58,918
Now!

189
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,994
What do you say, Jules?

190
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:10,364
Me, you? That?

191
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:16,203
Just say yes. Just say yes.

192
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,237
- Okay.
- Okay?

193
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,305
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

194
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:19,573
Excellent!

195
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:25,045
<i>♪ Janet

196
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,746
<i>♪ Just like Janet

197
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:29,183
Hmm.

198
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,953
I, like,
totally have to practice

199
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,055
if we're gonna be live
on KROQ.

200
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:37,257
KROQ is a radio station,
Loryn.

201
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:39,159
I need UVs, like, now.

202
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:40,994
- Tell me.
- What happened?

203
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:43,463
I just got asked to prom
by five assholes.

204
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,302
I just can't decide who I want
to take me, Mike or Danny.

205
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,437
Danny has the bod,
but his brains are bad news.

206
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:52,306
I mean, he's going
to Cal State Northridge.

207
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:54,074
Like, we're going
to Northridge?

208
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:55,409
Yeah, but we're not gonna

209
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:57,044
actually date the guys
who go there.

210
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,312
But, I mean,
you don't have to worry.

211
00:10:58,378 --> 00:10:59,912
You're set for life
with Mickey.

212
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,714
Oh, my God, you guys
are so getting married.

213
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:03,450
- Totally.
- I'm so sure.

214
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:04,985
I mean, people are
waiting now, you know?

215
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:06,320
Some girls don't even
get married

216
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:07,988
until they're, like,
23 and stuff.

217
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:09,990
If I'm not married by 23,
I'll kill myself.

218
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:12,626
But I'm not even sure
what I wanna do with my life.

219
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:14,161
Yeah, that's why
you get married.

220
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:16,363
So you don't
have to do anything.

221
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,031
Yeah, like,
once the divorce is final,

222
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:19,700
my mom has to,
like, get a job.

223
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,034
Well, what does
she like to do?

224
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:22,436
Be married.

225
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:24,837
Don't bring up
your mom's divorce, Stacey,

226
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:26,206
it makes me really sad.

227
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:27,407
Sorry.

228
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,177
Does anyone want a Diet Coke?

229
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:31,511
- Okay.
- One for me.

230
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:33,280
- No ice, Stacey.
- Okay.

231
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:34,814
But what if you got
a bitchin' job?

232
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,983
You know,
like designing clothes?

233
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:37,484
Or, Loryn, dancing?

234
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:38,851
Why would you want to?

235
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,587
To have a life.
To, like, be independent.

236
00:11:40,654 --> 00:11:42,055
Ew! Bummer!

237
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,591
But it's the 1980s, guys.

271
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,815
Did you see
those illustrations?

272
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,283
It was so gross.

273
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,018
Yeah, I'd like to hear more
about this book.

274
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:26,686
Wasn't on
my summer reading list.

275
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,155
Like, I could totally give you

276
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:30,991
a full report tonight
at my friend's party.

277
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:33,760
1807 Sierra Vista Heights.

278
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:43,936
No. Get out. Like, go.

279
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:45,372
No. Ugh.

280
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,249
Sorry about my buddy there.
He can be a real dick.

281
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,485
Yeah. He's, like, way rude.

282
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:00,887
He does this all the time.

283
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:02,722
Hi. We were all just leaving.

284
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,191
Like, now.

285
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:06,726
Yeah, um... I mean...

286
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,332
Hey, wait! What's your name?

287
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,134
Hook me up with those 'chos

288
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,336
and I'll tell you where the
Val chicks are going tonight.

289
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:18,004
Dude, a bird was just
all over those.

290
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:19,272
Wicked.

291
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:22,809
<i>Wait, back up.</i>

292
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:24,244
You just left?

293
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:25,879
Well, I had a boyfriend.

294
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:27,380
Who was a total tool.

295
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:29,516
And he had all those tattoos.

296
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,284
I mean, he was actually
considered pretty,

297
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:33,086
you know, edgy back then.

298
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:34,956
You have instant chemistry
with this crazy hot guy

299
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,323
and you just bailed?

300
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,624
Well, if you'll
let me finish...

301
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:39,059
Because you were
afraid of his tattoos?

302
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,560
Ugh. You know, I'm so tired.

303
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:42,095
Maybe you should just go
text all your friends.

304
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:43,530
No.

305
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,634
I mean, you can keep going.

306
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:50,470
If you talk more about him
and not about,

307
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,640
like, leg warmers.

308
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,243
Okay. No leg warmers.

309
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:57,777
<i>I promise.</i>

310
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,914
<i>Now, take it forward, take it,</i>

311
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:03,350
<i>one, two, three...</i>

312
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,585
- Mom?
- Huh?

313
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:08,755
Have you ever, like, thought
something was totally right

314
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:10,524
that it should, like,
fit just perfectly

315
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,626
but then
it just totally doesn't?

316
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,495
Ooh, well...

317
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:18,198
I guess,
that kind of depends

318
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,767
on what you're trying
to fit where, you know.

319
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,637
I mean, sometimes,
things aren't meant to...

320
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:27,307
- be put in certain...
- Oh, my, God!

321
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:28,575
Experimenting is fun.

322
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:30,176
- Ew! Mom!
- It's exciting.

323
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:31,511
- <i>Hello, ladies.</i>
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

324
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:32,779
<i>Look at what I got.</i>

325
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:33,847
<i>What is that?</i>

326
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:35,181
Look at this new technology.

327
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:36,716
- Look at how sleek it is.
- Whoa!

328
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,152
There's a whole VCR in here.
Look how small that is.

329
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,655
<i>It's burning hot to the touch
but I think that's normal.</i>

330
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,357
<i>We could make
our own workout video.</i>

331
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,593
<i>Honey, we can make
all kinds of videos.</i>

332
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,762
- Ooh!
- No, stop, guys.

333
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:50,463
Oh, Julie Richman.

334
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,232
<i>American teenage girl...</i>

335
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,367
- <i>Stop, Dad.</i>
- <i>...of the Valley variety.</i>

336
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:55,936
But what is she
working on right now?

337
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:58,872
<i>Is it another world-famous
fashion project?</i>

338
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:01,841
<i>Um, my outfit
for Mickey's costume party.</i>

339
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:03,777
For what party?

340
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:06,413
No. I mean, are his
parents gonna be there?

341
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,948
- No Risky Business.
- Yes.

342
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:10,884
His parents will be there.
They even got it catered.

343
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,852
Well, that sounds classy.

344
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:17,524
Kamikazes!

345
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,794
It's very important
to stay hydrated.

346
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,196
I know this because I'm a mom.

347
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:25,198
Yeah. I'm a mother.

348
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,445
Do you think Dolly
Parton stuffs her bra, too?

349
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,679
Totally.

350
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,147
Oh, my God.
Do you remember the Halloween

351
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:42,349
that we made those
Houdini costumes?

352
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:43,350
Yeah, with the handcuffs.

353
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,651
You guys are so lucky

354
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,119
I rescued you
in middle school.

355
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,555
- Especially you, Stacey.
- Oh.

356
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:50,624
Hey, yo! Adrian!

357
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:54,260
Ah, it's Rob!

358
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:56,663
Oh, what happened
to your hands?

359
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,198
No pain, no gain!

360
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,403
Unbelievable.

361
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,804
You are, like, so lucky.

362
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:06,773
Seriously,
that was a perfect cannonball.

363
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:09,909
Oh.

364
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:11,478
Oh, you're soaking.

365
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:13,279
Hell, yeah.
You're smokin' too, babe.

366
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,049
What are you, anyway?

367
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:16,951
Oh, wait. Uh, Chip!

368
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:19,185
Chip!

369
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:20,988
Dukes of Hazzard!

370
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,957
Yo, Mickey!
Check this out!

371
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,324
Oh, hell, yeah!

372
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,060

373
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:27,727

But who are you?

409
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:07,487
We're young.
We're still figuring that out.

410
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,768
Good evening, my liege.

411
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,870
- Hey, Casper.
- Hey.

412
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:25,638
Oh, are you
Elliott from <i>E.T.?</i>

413
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:26,539
I am.

414
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:28,075
I love that movie!

415
00:21:28,142 --> 00:21:29,776
I know. I mean, uh...

416
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:31,377
Is it attached to your butt?

417
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:33,913
No. It's more of,
I'd say, the groin area.

418
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:34,881
Oh.

419
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,217
I mean, not...
It wasn't...

420
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:37,550
I'm Princess Diana!

421
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:38,751
- You look great.
- Thanks.

422
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:40,386
You know, I really like her.

423
00:21:40,453 --> 00:21:43,190
I know she's not
a blood princess.

424
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:44,624
I know that it's by marriage,
but I still...

425
00:21:44,824 --> 00:21:45,892
Hey!

426
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,627
- Are you a fish?
- Uh...

427
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:49,662
'Cause, son,
you're going for a swim!

428
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:52,699
That was amazing.

429
00:21:52,765 --> 00:21:55,102
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

430
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,503
Uh, I... Do you wanna come in?

431
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,939
I can't.
I borrowed my nana's wig.

432
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,096
Jules, you won't believe
what just happened!

433
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:23,830
Danny was all bragging
about his new Porsche.

434
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:25,632
And I was, like,
ribbin' him hard

435
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:27,600
sayin' he wouldn't take
that thing over 90

436
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,602
and he was, like,
"I'm so sure."

437
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:31,804
So, I'm, like,
"Okay, prove it, dude."

438
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:34,540
So, we take this thing
out to the street.

439
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:36,676
He gets it to, like, 50,
wimps out.

440
00:22:36,743 --> 00:22:39,445
So, he starts doing donuts
and then he throws up.

441
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:40,847
And then I was, like,

442
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:42,316
"There's no way you're getting

443
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:43,816
that puke
out of the glove box."

444
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:46,020
- You're not even listening.
- What?

445
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:47,820
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

446
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:50,757
Uh... You puked
in his glove box?

447
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,061
Who's that douchebag?

448
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:56,562
I don't know.

449
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:58,631
Okay, well,
I think you really need

450
00:22:58,698 --> 00:23:00,700
to see this for yourself.

451
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:07,674
Man, these
high school guys blow.

452
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,209
Oh, my God, totally.

453
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:15,848
Pretty good with that pump.

454
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,550
Maybe you can show me
what else you're good at.

455
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:20,054
Oh, gee. You're not
really my type, cro-mag.

456
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,189
I'm every girl's type, babe.

457
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:25,825
Let's just say you don't
have the right equipment.

458
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:29,495
Shut up, dude.

459
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:31,664
Dyke alert!

460
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:34,234
Dyke alert!

461
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:36,836
What?

462
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:39,206
Say that again.
Say that again!

463
00:23:39,273 --> 00:23:41,275
- Frankie says relax.
- Hey, hey, hey!

464
00:23:41,342 --> 00:23:42,742
Back up!

465
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:45,012
- Do you want this?
- Hey, hey!

466
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,114
Yo, get these guys
out of here, man.

467
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,120
I just got clocked
by Daisy Duke.

468
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:58,591
Damn!

469
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:02,062
Jock douchebag.

470
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:05,798
- Who cares?
- She's a val, man.

471
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,002
Come on.

472
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:09,602
I stole
all the remotes.

473
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,276
Looks like you lost the
War on Drugs, Mr. President.

474
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:26,819
Dude!

475
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:30,656
Yo, dude.

476
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,628
Nice recovery, Manny.

477
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:36,829
I thought you were
down-and-out

478
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:37,797
after you hurled
in the Jacuzzi.

479
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:54,214
Okay. This is your party, too.

480
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:56,716
You belong and your
camp friends were wrong.

481
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,252
Oh.

482
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,653
Just... Okay.

483
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:07,593
You looking
for someone out there?

484
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,303
Are you crazy?

485
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,340
Yeah.

486
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:26,080
Uh, we met at the beach.
I'm Randy.

487
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:27,780
I'm Julie.

488
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,349
Hey, open up!

489
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:33,253
So, do you, like,
live around here?

490
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,022
Not exactly.

491
00:25:37,091 --> 00:25:38,959
Come on, man.
Hurry up in there.

492
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:41,761
Wanna get outta here?

493
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:43,663
I'm so sure.

494
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:46,166
- Kill. Let's motor.
- Wait. As if!

495
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,004
Like, I just met you.
And this is Mickey's party.

496
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,108
The Mickey?

497
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,343
- This is Mickey's party?
- Shh.

498
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:02,748
Well, I mean,
where would you wanna go?

499
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,384
Anywhere.

500
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:07,720
What would you wanna do?

501
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:10,124
Anything.

502
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:14,827
Oh, God. I don't know.

503
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:16,530
Mickey, all of my friends,

504
00:26:16,597 --> 00:26:18,298
like, everybody would probably
have a total cow if I left.

505
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:19,799
Forget them.

506
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:23,669
What do you wanna do?

507
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:25,072

520
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,508
You can't leave
your boyfriend's party.

521
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:03,210
I mean, Karen will...

522
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:05,678
These are the kids they warn
us about in life skills class!

523
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:07,381
Come on.

524
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,249

Wait, shouldn't somebody
stop that fight?

557
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:45,706
It's called dancing!

558
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:47,907
Hardly.
Like, what's the point?

559
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:50,077
Pointlessness!

560
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:53,980
Amazing, right?

561
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,117
I don't know.
It's kinda weird.

562
00:29:57,184 --> 00:29:58,552
It's just authentic.

563
00:29:58,618 --> 00:30:00,387
But I guess you don't
get that in the valley.

564
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:02,922
I like the valley.

565
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:05,759
You think you like the valley,
but it's empty.

566
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:07,860
You dress alike,
you talk the same.

567
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,996
Oh, my God! You guys
totally dress the same!

568
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,300
Maybe you need
to get out of Hollywood.

569
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:17,404
So, when can I see you again?

570
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:21,475
Aren't you supposed to, like,

571
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,776
wait until
the end of the night

572
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:24,644
- to ask me that?
- Why?

573
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:28,582
Julie! What about Mickey?

574
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:32,786
Like, I think you're having a
mental breakdown or something.

575
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:33,653
Oh, my God.

576
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:36,690
Just a little bit longer,
please?

577
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:38,225
Look around us.

578
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,659
People have holes
where they're not supposed to.

579
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:41,395
Please?

580
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:43,430
I got stabbed
with that kid's hair.

581
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:47,067
Obviously, you, like,
wanna be here, but I don't.

582
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:49,035
I'm calling a cab!

583
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:50,737
Are you gonna be
able to get home okay?

584
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:53,540
I got a 1420 on my SAT, Jules!

585
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,609
I think I can get myself
back to Encino!

586
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,982

00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:07,107
Yeah.

620
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:09,242
But what are you into?

621
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:10,844
Um, I don't know.

622
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:14,681
Like, my friends and shopping
and, like...

623
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:20,053
I can't believe
that this is happening.

624
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,354
This is, like...

625
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:24,090
It's wild.

626
00:33:47,113 --> 00:33:48,582
I really have to go.

627
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:53,955
People just leave
their stuff out?

628
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:58,059
Yeah. It's, like, the valley.
Nobody steals things.

629
00:33:58,124 --> 00:33:59,726
That's what you think.

630
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:01,294
I'm shoving that bike
in my trunk.

631
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,586
- Jules?
- Uh, yeah?

632
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:30,290
You up?

633
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:32,692
Yeah, I am now.

634
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:35,128

I'll go fix you some Tang.

00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,468

637
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:44,270
So, are you going to win us
another championship?

638
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:46,272
Oh, yes, ma'am.
We're gonna cream Tarzana.

639
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:47,741
You don't have
to call me ma'am.

640
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,542
I'm barely old enough
to be a cool babysitter

641
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,478
that you used
to have a thing for.

642
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:54,180
Hey, there's my girl!

643
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:57,450
You go get 'em,
you little McEnroe.

644
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:58,718
I'm gonna win it for you, all right?

645
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:02,856
Okay. Let's hit it.

646
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:03,923
Mickey.

647
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,793
We need to talk.

648
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,328
Come on, babe,
it's the championship.

649
00:35:08,395 --> 00:35:09,629
Mickey, I can't
do this anymore.

650
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:13,933
Look, we all had
too much fun last night.

651
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:17,203
I got mega drunk, you left
without saying goodbye.

652
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,672
Yeah?

653
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:20,607
It's all good. We both
feel terrible.

654
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:24,344
No, no. I just think we, like,
don't want the same things.

655
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,418
Oh! Mmm.

656
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,753
Is this about...

657
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:37,524
prom night?

658
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,826
Hey. It's normal
to be nervous, okay?

659
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:42,595
But I promise,
it's gonna be special.

660
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:43,897
Mickey...

661
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:45,298
Now, come on, let's roll.

662
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:47,267
Mickey, that's not what
I was talking about.

663
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,702
Mickey, I need to talk to you.

664
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:50,870
You wanna talk to me
in the car? Let's go.

665
00:35:56,543 --> 00:35:58,445
What's going on with you?

666
00:35:58,511 --> 00:35:59,746
I'm trying to figure it out.

667
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:02,983
But I don't wanna, like,
be your cheering squad.

668
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,418
You're not even a cheerleader.

669
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:08,388
We're over.

670
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:16,629
Big mistake, Julie.

671
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,665
Big mistake!

672
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:20,667
And way to get me outta
my zone for the match!

673
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:22,635
Not cool at all!

674
00:36:23,737 --> 00:36:26,439
Big mistake!

675
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,329
You do know
if you cared about our band

676
00:36:49,395 --> 00:36:50,897
half as much as you
care about that ramen,

677
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:53,200
we'd be, like,
really rich right now.

678
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:55,802
Oh, I'm sorry.
You don't want some?

679
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:58,271
No, I want the ramen.

680
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:00,007
We're still gonna practice,

681
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:01,041
though, later, right?

682
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:09,582
The office
of Randall J. Phillips.

683
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,619
Well, hello.

684
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:14,420
<i>This is Julie Richman
returning his call.</i>

685
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:18,391
I'd like to schedule
an appointment, like, ASAP.

686
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,426
Well, I'm just looking
at his schedule right now

687
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:22,529
and it would appear
he's free forever.

688
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,533
- No!
- Yes.

689
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,600
And she just, like,
dumped Mickey?

690
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:28,835
Yes.

691
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:30,537
But don't worry.
Stacey's on it.

692
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,505
Oh, my God, Jules.

693
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:33,940
Are you okay?

694
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,775
- Hey, welcome!
- I am amazing, guys.

695
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:37,811
I think I'm really
into that guy.

696
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:39,779
Randy. He's, like,
totally tripendicular.

697
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:41,581
- Knees up.
- We don't date guys like that.

698
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:42,816
Does he even, like,
know how to play tennis?

699
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:44,051
No, but, guys,
it's just like...

700
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:45,451
Here we go.

701
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:46,954
...the way he makes me feel,
it's like...

702
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:48,321

Guys, can we just, like,
talk about this later?

740
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:27,221
Come on,
let's go to Sweetie Pie's.

741
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:28,855
Totally.

742
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:30,991
Where's Stace?

743
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:35,296
Oh, my God!

744
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:38,032
Like, what's he doing here?

745
00:39:38,098 --> 00:39:40,968
We got him to give you
another chance, Jules.

746
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:42,669
Come on. He's our ride.

747
00:39:42,735 --> 00:39:44,271
Are you guys joking?

748
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:47,408
It's okay. Some people
totally freak out senior year.

749
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:48,976
Just like in that book,
<i>Go Ask Alice.</i>

750
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:51,378
Oh, my God.
I'm not freaking out.

751
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,946
You so are.

752
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:56,016
I mean,
this is just like my, um...

753
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,784
The divorce.

754
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,086
Come on.

755
00:39:59,153 --> 00:40:00,220
No!

756
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:06,226
Fine. Be a skank.

757
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:12,232
Is she coming?

758
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,201
Screw her.

759
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:17,503
To the max.

760
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,151
- Come on.
- It's over.

761
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:32,652
Looks good, dweeb.

762
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:40,760
Julie thinks she's, like,
way too cool for us now.

763
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:42,229
- No.
- You think?

764
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:44,530
What, she likes this guy
because he's different?

765
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:46,000
Different from who?

766
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,602
Hey, can we not
talk about Julie?

767
00:40:50,837 --> 00:40:52,272
Yeah, you're right.

768
00:40:53,673 --> 00:40:55,042
Let's just have fun tonight.

769
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:04,084
What?
Mickey and Karen hooked up?

770
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,452
I know. Crazy, right?

771
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:07,087
I mean, I get that you didn't,
like, want him anymore,

772
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:09,156
- but still.
- Right? Thank you.

773
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:11,058
Okay, first of all,
she's the skank.

774
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,360
Well, I'm ambivalent
about that word.

775
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:15,029
But, yes.

776
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:16,729
Okay, well, were you
freaking out about it?

777
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:19,266
Well, at the time,
I was a little preoccupied.

778
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:29,842
Ooh, la, la.
French restaurant? Fancy.

779
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:31,311
At least we know
he has good taste.

780
00:41:31,378 --> 00:41:33,480
Mom, what do you even know
about France?

781
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:37,683
Nothing, I guess.
I just always wanted to go.

782
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,453
Okay. Bye.

783
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,787
So, you're just going to dinner
and a movie with this boy?

784
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,622
- Yes.
- Okay.

785
00:41:42,688 --> 00:41:44,791
And, um,
you'll be home by midnight?

786
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:46,160
Yes, Mom.

787
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:47,760
Sorry. It's important
to your father.

788
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:50,030
Okay.

789
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:51,898
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

790
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:53,267
Bye.

791
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:55,502
Just say no.

792
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:57,337
- To what?
- Everything.

793
00:43:21,488 --> 00:43:23,290
They have these
secret shows every month.

794
00:43:23,357 --> 00:43:25,359
- X even played once.
- X?

795
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:27,227
- Yeah, the band.
- Yeah, the band.

796
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:30,430
Oh, sorry, did you not know
anything at all about music?

797
00:43:31,398 --> 00:43:33,100
Not punk music.

798
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:35,935
- So, why don't you tell me?
- Oh.

799
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:40,407
Okay, well, for starters,
punk is dead.

800
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:43,410
Well, I'm sure the dead band
is gonna be totally bitchin',

801
00:43:43,477 --> 00:43:44,978
but I have curfew.

802
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:46,413
But you're gonna miss
your one-week anniversary.

803
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,048
I mean, that's a big record
for this guy.

804
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:49,516
- Hey, shut up.
- Ow!

805
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:52,919
Well, we can celebrate
another time,

806
00:43:52,986 --> 00:43:54,188
but I have to get home.

807
00:43:54,254 --> 00:43:55,522
My parents are, like,
gonna kill me.

808
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:56,990
Okay, I'll take you home.

809
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:58,525
I'm not gonna make you leave.
That's crazy.

810
00:43:58,592 --> 00:43:59,759
I'm not putting you on a bus
on Hollywood Boulevard.

811
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:01,328
A bus?

812
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,263
Not. I'll totally cab it.

813
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:06,200
Like, why stop there?
Why not a stretch limo?

814
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:09,303
We'll hang tomorrow?

815
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:17,144
Oh, yeah,
that's what I like.

816
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:18,111
Randy.

817
00:44:18,178 --> 00:44:19,912
Yeah, I like it.
Oh, Randy.

818
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:29,423
Honey?
How was the date?

819
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:31,625
Fine.

820
00:44:31,692 --> 00:44:34,261
Sweetheart, come in
here and tell us about it.

821
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:37,897
Okay.

822
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,866
- So?
- Hey, ya.

823
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:42,669
- Hi.
- So what did you guys see?

824
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:43,836
<i>Return of the Jedi.</i>

825
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,138
Ooh.

826
00:44:45,205 --> 00:44:46,473
Is Darth Vader Luke's father?

827
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,209
Tell me. Tell me.

828
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:51,678
No, don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Okay, tell me.

829
00:44:51,744 --> 00:44:53,380
- Yeah, he's...
- No, don't tell me!

830
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:56,049
- Okay, tell me.
- Yeah, he's the dad.

831
00:44:56,116 --> 00:44:57,951
Wait.
Who's whose dad?

832
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:00,454
Well, the Jedi.

833
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:05,192
Are you lying to us?

834
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:07,127
I can tell you're lying
'cause your mouth is open.

835
00:45:07,194 --> 00:45:08,562
Close your mouth.

836
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:10,530
We try to be so chill
and you're lying to us?

837
00:45:10,597 --> 00:45:13,799
Our... Our plans changed
and I didn't have a dime,

838
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:17,537
and it's not like I have some
kind of satellite phone device

839
00:45:17,604 --> 00:45:19,473
I can keep in my pocket and
just transmit to outer space

840
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:21,841
and call you guys
whenever I want to.

841
00:45:23,277 --> 00:45:24,978
You're grounded, young lady.

842
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:27,114
Thank you for turning me
into a typical mother.

843
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,582
I'd like you
to go wash your face

844
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:30,417
and go to bed.

845
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:31,917
Wash it.

846
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:33,954
Is that how you ground
a child? I don't even know.

847
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:35,555
I think you did it the best
you could have done it.

848
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:51,204
What are you doing here?

849
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:52,973
I figured we could be
grounded together.

850
00:45:54,308 --> 00:45:55,542
Shh.

851
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:56,576
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:02,082
Oh. Nice top hat.

853
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:03,984
I may have gone through

854
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:06,253
a brief magician stage
in fifth grade.

855
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:14,594
Yeah, that's the day
that Karen got her car.

856
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:16,963
Nice.

857
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:28,442
Oh, yeah, that's just, like,
a thing that Stacey and I do.

858
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:31,511
I've been making clothes
since I was, like, seven.

859
00:46:31,578 --> 00:46:32,746
So, what's this guy's story?

860
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:35,449
- Well, this is Shaun.
- Shaun?

861
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:37,384
I named him
after Shaun Cassidy,

862
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:38,652
who was, like,
my first true love.

863
00:46:39,186 --> 00:46:40,920
Here, I'll show you.

864
00:46:40,987 --> 00:46:42,422
See, I was, like,
kind of obsessed.

865
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,157
- Oh, wow. Hot.
- Shut up!

866
00:46:55,335 --> 00:46:56,536
Wow.

867
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:01,074
It's like...

868
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,477
It's like art.

869
00:47:03,543 --> 00:47:04,944
The way
you put clothes together.

870
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,615
I just think it's, like,
why be boring?

871
00:47:09,049 --> 00:47:10,050
You know?

872
00:47:11,718 --> 00:47:12,652
Yeah.

873
00:47:17,224 --> 00:47:19,826
My guidance counselor
told me there's this college,

874
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:22,629
Fashion Institute
of Technology.

875
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,197
Yeah, where is it?

876
00:47:24,264 --> 00:47:26,133
- New York City.
- Ooh!

877
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:27,868
Yeah.

878
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:30,370
- But I mean, I don't know.
- Well, let's do it. Let's go.

879
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:33,607
I mean, some day.

880
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:36,476
But, like, I have to finish
senior year and...

881
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:38,979
Oh, my God,
did I tell you that,

882
00:47:39,045 --> 00:47:41,014
like, KROQ is
throwing our prom?

883
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:42,649
No, no, no.

884
00:47:42,716 --> 00:47:45,085
I know what you're thinking.
But it's gonna be awesome.

885
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:48,388
- Is it?
- No. It is. I promise.

886
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:50,957
Especially if I have
the right date.

887
00:47:52,058 --> 00:47:54,995
What, you mean, like,
Shaun Cassidy over here?

888
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:02,002
I hear he's got a lock
on prom king.

So,
are you sick of me yet?

927
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:58,012
No.

928
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,113
But you know
what would be rad?

929
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,617
If you, like, hung out in
the valley a little bit more?

930
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:06,853
Do you really want me to?

931
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,189
No, come on, my friends,
they're not, like, contagious.

932
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:14,294
- I did some research.
- Research?

933
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:15,528
About New York.

934
00:51:17,197 --> 00:51:19,532
The scene there is exploding.

935
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:21,901
The East Village.

936
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:25,205
We could rent a railroad flat
on Avenue A.

937
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:26,673
We'd be so broke,
we'd have to eat

938
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,575
Chef Boyardee 24/7.

939
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:30,577
And you'd be
in fashion school.

940
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:32,079
Mmm-hmm.

941
00:51:32,145 --> 00:51:34,714
I'd write you songs and play
them for you on stage at CBGB.

942
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,622
8I don't know. I mean, I...

943
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,259
No, I'm supposed to, like,

944
00:51:46,326 --> 00:51:49,030
go to Northridge in the fall
and, you know,

945
00:51:49,596 --> 00:51:51,631
my parents would, like...

946
00:51:54,334 --> 00:51:55,535
I mean, what do yours think?

947
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,178
Look, I don't have that.

948
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,349
It's just me and you.

949
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:13,319

Hey, you okay?

957
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:42,575
Did I tell you guys that
Randy's writing me a song?

958
00:53:42,642 --> 00:53:45,545
Oh, he's in a band?
I didn't know that.

959
00:53:45,612 --> 00:53:47,881
Let me guess, a punk band.

960
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:49,783
Technically speaking,
punk is dead.

961
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:56,556
You know, uh, honey...

962
00:53:57,258 --> 00:53:58,525
I was thinking that, uh...

963
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,094
I, uh...

964
00:54:01,061 --> 00:54:02,862
I'm not so sure
that he's the guy for you.

965
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:04,464
You know?

966
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:07,767
You know, Dad,
you don't even know him.

967
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:10,271
Well, I think that
he's too old for ya.

968
00:54:10,336 --> 00:54:11,738
And I think he drives too fast

969
00:54:11,805 --> 00:54:13,373
and I think he does
too many drugs.

970
00:54:13,439 --> 00:54:14,574
Which is any amount of drugs,
in my book.

971
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:15,942
And also, I...

972
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,644
He's never once come
to the front door

973
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,678
to pick you up. He's never
knocked on the door,

974
00:54:18,745 --> 00:54:20,080
and introduced himself...

975
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:21,481
Yeah, who doesn't
introduce themselves?

976
00:54:21,548 --> 00:54:23,083
- Like Mickey used to do?
- Yes.

977
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,584
- Sure, like Mickey.
- Yes. Like Mickey.

978
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:25,785
By the way,
Barry said that Mickey

979
00:54:25,852 --> 00:54:27,353
is torn up without you.
Torn up.

980
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,421
Well, that doesn't
surprise me at all.

981
00:54:28,488 --> 00:54:29,823
Wait, you talked to his dad?

982
00:54:29,889 --> 00:54:31,992
Honey, it was
an investment thing, okay?

983
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:33,560
Oh, my God.

984
00:54:33,626 --> 00:54:35,728
By the way, we're not
investing in, uh, Macintosh.

985
00:54:35,795 --> 00:54:36,863
We're gonna go with Commodore.

986
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,032
You're the boss.

987
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:41,235
Point is, honey,
Mickey, he's got a future.

988
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:43,937
Mickey is the kind of person
who will take care of you.

989
00:54:44,004 --> 00:54:45,872
He's reliable.
He's going places.

990
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:47,607
- He'll take care of your kids.
- And he can take care of you.

991
00:54:47,674 --> 00:54:49,276
Oh, my God. What are
you guys even talking about?

992
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:50,777
I mean, honey,

993
00:54:50,844 --> 00:54:52,545
you know, next year, you're
gonna be at Northridge

994
00:54:52,612 --> 00:54:53,947
and you're gonna have to make
a lot of big decisions.

995
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:55,448
And your mom and I
wanna help prepare you.

996
00:54:55,515 --> 00:54:57,051
I might not even go
to Northridge.

997
00:55:03,324 --> 00:55:05,292
There's some
really rad fashion stuff

998
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:06,559
happening in New York.

999
00:55:08,028 --> 00:55:09,296
New York City?

1000
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:10,830
Yeah, and Randy said that...

1001
00:55:10,897 --> 00:55:12,632
Honey, you're not moving
across the country

1002
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:14,001
with a guy we've never met.

1003
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:15,302
Dad. It's not...

1004
00:55:15,368 --> 00:55:16,303
Especially not
to New York City, okay?

1005
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:17,604
No.

1006
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,772
That's the crime capital
of the world.

1007
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,275
Okay, the crime statistics...

1008
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:22,642
So, basically,
it's a giant...

1009
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:24,410
- Oh, it's a murder capital.
- ...jail!

1010
00:55:24,477 --> 00:55:26,713
You walk down the
street and it's just stabbings.

1011
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:28,882
- Stabbing!
- Whoa, whoa, guys.

1012
00:55:31,252 --> 00:55:34,587
Okay. What if I just
invite him over? For dinner?

1013
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:37,157
That way, you guys could
get to know him.

1014
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:39,392
Could we start there?

1015
00:55:51,938 --> 00:55:53,806
What?

1016
00:55:53,873 --> 00:55:55,441
I mean, I know I haven't
seen you in a while,

1017
00:55:55,508 --> 00:55:57,477
but pretty sure
the guy I remember

1018
00:55:57,543 --> 00:55:59,179
didn't dress
like Kenny Loggins

1019
00:55:59,246 --> 00:56:01,215
and go hang out with
a bunch of old yuppies.

1020
00:56:01,282 --> 00:56:02,815
Gimme a break.

1021
00:56:02,882 --> 00:56:04,684
Like you haven't done
some warped stuff for chicks.

1022
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:07,021
Remember Mad Dog Marie?

1023
00:56:07,087 --> 00:56:10,490
Oh, yes, who went off
to Marie-hab.

1024
00:56:10,556 --> 00:56:12,492
Yeah, I mean, this is, sort of,
the first phase of our plan.

1025
00:56:13,227 --> 00:56:14,694
She wants her folks to know

1026
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:16,696
the guy who's taking
their girl away.

1027
00:56:16,763 --> 00:56:18,399
She's not moving in here.

1028
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:19,432
- That's not happening.
- No, no, no.

1029
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:20,934
NYC, man.

1030
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:26,806
What do you mean, "NYC, man"?

1031
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,676
Going to New York now?

1032
00:56:29,742 --> 00:56:32,212
So, that's just it, then?

1033
00:56:32,279 --> 00:56:35,015
No more band.
I mean... Okay.

1034
00:56:35,082 --> 00:56:36,883
Cool. Well, thanks
for letting me know.

1035
00:56:36,951 --> 00:56:38,718
You and Sticky should come.

1036
00:56:38,785 --> 00:56:40,020
Look, I've got some new songs.

1037
00:56:40,087 --> 00:56:42,056
And a new scene
gives us freedom...

1038
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:43,756
Why are you doing this?

1039
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:46,193
We have people here
who like our music,

1040
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,262
and they actually, like,
come to our shows.

1041
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:49,929
That's everything
that we've been working for.

1042
00:56:49,997 --> 00:56:51,698
You really wanna spend
the rest of your life

1043
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:53,566
playing the same five songs
to the same 50 people

1044
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:54,767
- in the same club?
- Man!

1045
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:56,403
This girl is Nancy.

1046
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:58,671
You're Sid and she's Nancy!

1047
00:56:58,738 --> 00:56:59,906
And not in a good way.

1048
00:56:59,974 --> 00:57:01,976
What, you think
that's gonna work?

1049
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:04,510
Those rich assholes,
they're gonna hate you, man.

1050
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:06,013
They already hate you.

1051
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,982
She digs me and her parents
are gonna dig me, too.

1052
00:57:08,048 --> 00:57:10,150
News flash. Parents don't
dig you, all right?

1053
00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:11,484
Not even your own.

1054
00:57:16,357 --> 00:57:17,757
Damn it, I'm late!

1055
00:57:20,327 --> 00:57:21,761
And don't grill him
about his parents.

1056
00:57:21,828 --> 00:57:22,997
He doesn't like
to talk about them.

1057
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:24,530
- Honey.
- Or is grades or whatever.

1058
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:25,966
He's totally smart.

1059
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:27,700
Sweetheart, I am gonna keep
an open mind.

1060
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:44,584
There's so many cul-de-sacs
in the neighborhood.

1061
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:47,820
It's easy to
drive around in circles.

1062
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,302
Hello? Julie?

1063
00:58:04,604 --> 00:58:06,006
Julie.

1064
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,444
I'm wondering if we need
to buy Randy a Timex.

1065
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,312
Ha-ha.

1066
00:58:29,096 --> 00:58:30,830
Okay, I'm gonna start.

1067
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:32,966
- Dad, no.
- No, I am.

1068
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:35,235
It's rude. Your mother made
a lot of food.

1069
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:36,669
And I don't like someone
treating you like this.

1070
00:58:36,736 --> 00:58:38,638
We've been waiting
for a long time.

1071
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:40,441
I bet you guys are thrilled
he's not here.

1072
00:58:40,507 --> 00:58:42,242
- Don't say that, dear.
- We're not thrilled, okay?

1073
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:43,776
But we are validated.

1074
00:58:43,843 --> 00:58:45,312
The truth is,
it is better

1075
00:58:45,379 --> 00:58:48,182
to just find out now
what kind of a person he is.

1076
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,317
You can find someone
who can take care of you.

1077
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:52,453
Not everybody is as needy

1078
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:54,354
and scared of the world
as you are.

1079
00:59:03,629 --> 00:59:05,566
Jesus, guys can suck.

1080
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:08,168
- Yeah.
- You must've been so pissed.

1081
00:59:08,601 --> 00:59:09,802
Yeah, pissed.

1082
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:11,972
Embarrassed.

1083
00:59:12,573 --> 00:59:14,874
Mostly just sad.

1084
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:19,179
So, I mean, was that it?
It was just over?

1085
00:59:19,246 --> 00:59:20,447
Well, I didn't know.

1086
00:59:20,514 --> 00:59:23,350
I called
and there was no answer.

1087
00:59:24,284 --> 00:59:25,352
I thought maybe it was.

1088
00:59:27,054 --> 00:59:29,123
<i>But then...</i>

1089
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:35,129
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1090
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:36,964
Well, then why didn't
you show up?

1091
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:40,400
Parents are hard for me, okay?

1092
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:41,868
That's your big excuse?

1093
00:59:42,768 --> 00:59:44,637
You know what,
trigonometry is hard for me,

1094
00:59:44,704 --> 00:59:46,006
but I still show up.

1095
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:48,674
What do you want me
to say, Julie?

1096
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:52,678
You want my whole
pathetic life story?

1097
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:54,780
How my dad bailed on me
before I was even born?

1098
00:59:54,847 --> 00:59:56,617
How my mom kicked me
outta the house

1099
00:59:56,682 --> 00:59:59,353
because she wanted
to start a real family?

1100
01:00:02,256 --> 01:00:06,627
Look, you have this life.

1101
01:00:06,692 --> 01:00:08,996
This shiny, bright, perfect...

1102
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:11,431
I... I saw it. I...

1103
01:00:14,867 --> 01:00:16,370
I don't know how
to fit into this.

1104
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:21,841
You could start by showing up.

1105
01:00:24,311 --> 01:00:25,312
I will.

1106
01:00:27,514 --> 01:00:29,216
Cool.

1107
01:00:33,387 --> 01:00:34,820
I need to work
on my dance moves

1108
01:00:34,887 --> 01:00:36,223
if I'm ever gonna be on MTV.

1109
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,924
You're so good at dancing.

1110
01:00:37,991 --> 01:00:39,259
Who has time for that?

1111
01:00:39,326 --> 01:00:40,561
Like,
I totally was watching

1112
01:00:40,627 --> 01:00:41,995
the "Thriller" video today...

1113
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:46,400
Happy birthday.

1114
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:49,469
Is it...

1115
01:00:50,703 --> 01:00:51,837
Oh, my God.

1116
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:56,543
Oh, I love it.

1117
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,412
Oh, thank you.

1118
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:01,948
Hey, I'm kind of having a
birthday party this Saturday.

1119
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:04,484
Oh. I didn't know.

1120
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:06,553
I mean, it was, like,
totally last minute.

1121
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,955
But you're totally invited

1122
01:01:08,021 --> 01:01:11,491
as long as you're okay
with, you know...

1123
01:01:12,993 --> 01:01:14,394
Oh, my God, stop.

1124
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:15,996
You're, like, totally
putting me in the middle

1125
01:01:16,063 --> 01:01:17,730
- just like my mom does.
- Spaz down, Stacey.

1126
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:19,032
God.

1127
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:20,733
Mickey will be there with me.

1128
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:23,403
Yeah. I heard about you two.

1129
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:25,138
Oh, yeah, what'd you hear?
Was it something like,

1130
01:01:25,205 --> 01:01:28,709
"Oh! Mickey!
Oh, my God, Mickey!"

1131
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:30,943
We used to say that exes
were off-limits.

1132
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:33,046
Yeah, well, we used to say
a lot of stuff.

1133
01:01:33,113 --> 01:01:34,947
What do you care now?
You have Randy.

1134
01:01:38,585 --> 01:01:40,053
God, this is so stupid.

1135
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,455
I think you guys
would actually

1136
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:43,490
just really like him
if you got to know him.

1137
01:01:43,557 --> 01:01:46,226
Well, why don't you bring him
to my birthday party?

1138
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:52,199
Okay.

1139
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:58,238
Whoo! Keep on wheelin'!

1140
01:01:59,106 --> 01:02:00,173
Hey, that's for you.

1141
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,341
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

1142
01:02:01,408 --> 01:02:02,743
It's a book.

1143
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,719
Oh, my God, Karen.

1144
01:02:12,785 --> 01:02:15,088
I have tiny cars on my feet.

1145
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:19,226
This is really good practice.

1146
01:02:20,227 --> 01:02:21,794
- For what?
- Prom.

1147
01:02:22,496 --> 01:02:24,531
Oh, my God, you guys came!

1148
01:02:25,198 --> 01:02:26,866
Oh, happy birthday.

1149
01:02:26,932 --> 01:02:29,336
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, totally.

1150
01:02:29,403 --> 01:02:30,936
Hey, Randy.

1151
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:32,872
Right on. Happy birthday.

1152
01:02:32,938 --> 01:02:36,043
Oh, it's a scratch-off
lottery ticket

1153
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:38,078
that's already
been scratched off.

1154
01:02:38,145 --> 01:02:39,313
You take that
to any gas station,

1155
01:02:39,379 --> 01:02:40,547
they'll give you
three bucks. Cash.

1156
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:43,283
Oh! Thank you.

1157
01:02:48,422 --> 01:02:50,424
I'm here
with the birthday girl,

1158
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,858
and it is time
for "The Safety Dance".

1159
01:02:53,593 --> 01:02:55,062
You know the dance.

1160
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:10,477
Time to grab your partner
and show me what you got!

1161
01:03:10,544 --> 01:03:13,846
But if you hear the whistle,
baby, you out!

1162
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,029
Stacey. Hey, hey!

1163
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,397
Stacey.

1164
01:03:30,464 --> 01:03:32,032
Oh! Are you okay?

1165
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:35,535
Yeah, I take karate sometimes.

1166
01:03:35,602 --> 01:03:37,804

1171
01:03:49,716 --> 01:03:51,284

we always wear underwear

Ugh. The things we do

We're down

- That was amazing, right?
- Yep.

1190
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:25,412
Uh-oh!
If you lost a tooth,

1191
01:05:25,479 --> 01:05:27,747
it's over
at the lost and found.

1192
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,251
That was awesome.

1193
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:32,752
- With so many spins.
- Yeah, for sure, Karen.

1194
01:05:41,461 --> 01:05:43,230
What're you doing here, freak?

1195
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:47,567
I don't want any beef, dude.

1196
01:05:48,068 --> 01:05:49,402
Where's the beef, huh?

1197
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,605
I'm cool.

1198
01:05:54,407 --> 01:05:56,776
Just making sure
you're okay, buddy.

1199
01:05:56,843 --> 01:05:59,145
I mean, your girl was
kind of all over me.

1200
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:03,250
You look angry. You need
to cool off a little bit?

1201
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:10,624
Yeah, she's really something,
isn't she?

1202
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:13,627
Oh, my God.

1203
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:22,502
- Oh, my God!
- Fight! Fight!

1204
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:23,837
Guys, stop!

1205
01:06:24,137 --> 01:06:25,739
Stop!

1206
01:06:25,805 --> 01:06:27,641
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1207
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,415
Get him off me!

1208
01:06:39,853 --> 01:06:40,988
Yeah, he's crazy, man.

1209
01:06:41,054 --> 01:06:43,857
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1210
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:46,459
You think I wanna be here with
these trust fund jerk-offs?

1211
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:48,428
I'm happy to get the hell out!

1212
01:06:49,563 --> 01:06:51,231
- Get off me!
- You're done.

1213
01:06:52,766 --> 01:06:54,301
Come on, Julie, let's go!

1214
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:04,411
Wow. Classy.

1215
01:07:07,048 --> 01:07:08,715
Stacey, I am so sorry.

1216
01:07:08,782 --> 01:07:10,116
I think that you should
probably just go.

1217
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:13,853
- But, Stacey...
- Just go, please.

1218
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:19,526
Thank God.

1219
01:07:19,593 --> 01:07:21,261
I think
he's actually psychotic.

1220
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:31,871
What was that?

1221
01:07:33,173 --> 01:07:34,608
What is wrong with you?

1222
01:07:35,508 --> 01:07:36,710
You realize that everything

1223
01:07:36,776 --> 01:07:38,378
my friends
ever thought about you

1224
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:39,646
you just proved them right?

1225
01:07:39,713 --> 01:07:40,914
Why do you even care
what they think?

1226
01:07:40,982 --> 01:07:42,415
Because they're my friends.

1227
01:07:42,482 --> 01:07:45,118
What, these vapid, stupid,
rich, shitty people?

1228
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:47,287
I am one of
those people, Randy.

1229
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:53,793
You know what, all we ever do
is hang out with your friends,

1230
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:56,262
listen to your band,
do your stuff,

1231
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:58,298
but the moment I even try
to show you my world,

1232
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,333
you, like,
totally sabotage it.

1233
01:08:03,004 --> 01:08:04,170
I'm sorry, okay?

1234
01:08:05,271 --> 01:08:06,640
Wait, come here. Come on.

1235
01:08:08,775 --> 01:08:09,909
I'm sorry.

1236
01:08:14,015 --> 01:08:16,050
All those amazing things that
we said we were gonna do,

1237
01:08:16,117 --> 01:08:17,517
let's just go and do that.

1238
01:08:17,584 --> 01:08:19,086
None of this stuff matters!

1239
01:08:19,152 --> 01:08:20,320
You see, that's the problem,

1240
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,622
it's that nothing
matters to you.

1241
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:24,924
But I have things in my life
that I care about,

1242
01:08:24,992 --> 01:08:26,326
that are important to me.

1243
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:29,529
Don't tell me you're gonna
bring up prom again.

1244
01:08:31,831 --> 01:08:33,166
Seriously, Julie?

1245
01:08:34,334 --> 01:08:36,236
It's like we're
from different planets.

1246
01:08:36,302 --> 01:08:37,804
If you want a prom king,

1247
01:08:38,538 --> 01:08:39,839
maybe I'm not your guy.

1248
01:08:40,707 --> 01:08:42,308
You know what,
maybe you're not.

1249
01:08:45,545 --> 01:08:46,880
You don't mean that.

1250
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:48,882
Does this look like
it's working to you?

1251
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:51,217
I have given up
everything for you.

1252
01:08:51,284 --> 01:08:52,719
- You don't even show up.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1253
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:54,354
Your fake friends
aren't gonna call you back?

1254
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,157
You know what,
I'm sorry that I have people

1255
01:08:56,222 --> 01:08:58,858
in my life that care
about me. Okay?

1256
01:09:02,328 --> 01:09:03,830
Right.

1257
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,202
It's not working.

1258
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,408
You know what?

1259
01:09:15,842 --> 01:09:16,977
Forget it.

1260
01:09:18,611 --> 01:09:20,114
For sure.

1261
01:09:21,481 --> 01:09:22,983
Like, totally!

1262
01:11:12,092 --> 01:11:14,094
Those tots
look awfully lonely.

1263
01:11:16,263 --> 01:11:17,664
I know how they feel.

1264
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:22,036
You think, uh,

1265
01:11:22,102 --> 01:11:24,804
one of them might like to be
my date to prom?

1266
01:11:26,906 --> 01:11:27,941
What about Karen?

1267
01:11:28,008 --> 01:11:30,543
Mmm.
No, I broke up with Karen.

1268
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,713
It's never been about her.

1269
01:11:35,448 --> 01:11:36,516
Only us.

1270
01:11:39,153 --> 01:11:40,486
So, what do you say?

1271
01:11:45,825 --> 01:11:47,194
Yeah. Okay.

1272
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,330
Let's do prom.

1273
01:11:49,395 --> 01:11:51,664
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Prom could be fun.

1274
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:53,499
It will be fun.

1275
01:11:53,566 --> 01:11:55,135
But it doesn't mean
we're back together.

1276
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:57,104
Okay?

1277
01:11:57,171 --> 01:11:59,739
All right, sweet. Yes, ma'am.

1278
01:12:01,574 --> 01:12:03,376
But seriously, are you
gonna finish those tots?

So, I...

1315
01:15:12,099 --> 01:15:14,600
I saw that song
that you wrote for her.

1316
01:15:15,536 --> 01:15:16,869
It's good.

1317
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,176
You'll get her back.

1318
01:15:22,242 --> 01:15:24,944
No. I'm pretty sure
she's done.

1319
01:15:27,613 --> 01:15:28,848
Damn.

1320
01:15:31,617 --> 01:15:33,420
Maybe we should
go to New York anyway.

1321
01:15:34,388 --> 01:15:36,390
You know? I mean,
a change could be good.

1322
01:15:36,957 --> 01:15:38,691
Check out a new scene?

1323
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:42,996
Plus, we're getting evicted,
so...

1324
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:47,367
What do you think?

1325
01:15:49,436 --> 01:15:51,171
You know what, let's do it.

1326
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:52,439
Yeah?

1327
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,640
Let's get the hell outta town.

1328
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,243
Yeah!

1329
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,511
Yeah!

1330
01:16:06,752 --> 01:16:07,753
Stace?

1331
01:16:08,989 --> 01:16:10,823
Will you hear me out?

1332
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,060
Like, I don't really
have a choice.

1333
01:16:13,127 --> 01:16:16,662
Look, I am so, so sorry about
your birthday party, okay?

1334
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:18,098
And, I'm...

1335
01:16:18,165 --> 01:16:19,866
And I'm not with him anymore.

1336
01:16:19,932 --> 01:16:22,169
And, I know, it's not...

1337
01:16:22,802 --> 01:16:24,138
Are you okay?

1338
01:16:26,173 --> 01:16:29,775
I've been, like,
the worst friend recently...

1339
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:31,411
No, I said stuff, too.

1340
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:34,014
But it's just...

1341
01:16:34,081 --> 01:16:36,316
I mean, everything
at home is so...

1342
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,584
I just want everything
to stay the same.

1343
01:16:37,683 --> 01:16:38,718
Yeah, totally.

1344
01:16:38,784 --> 01:16:40,420
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1345
01:16:42,356 --> 01:16:43,423
Um...

1346
01:16:44,824 --> 01:16:46,126
I kinda got into Dartmouth.

1347
01:16:47,294 --> 01:16:48,928
Wait, what?

1348
01:16:48,996 --> 01:16:50,897
- You got into Dartmouth?
- Uh-huh.

1349
01:16:50,964 --> 01:16:52,299
Stace, that's amazing!

1350
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:53,567
I know.

1351
01:16:53,634 --> 01:16:54,968
But you all are going
to Northridge,

1352
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:56,203
and Karen will, like,
freak out at me...

1353
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,770
No, no, no. Screw Karen!

1354
01:16:57,837 --> 01:16:58,871
You have to go.

1355
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:00,307
That's Ivy League!

1356
01:17:00,374 --> 01:17:01,542
Oh, my God!

1357
01:17:01,608 --> 01:17:02,609
I'm going
to an Ivy League school.

1358
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:04,278
You got in! You're a genius!

1359
01:17:04,344 --> 01:17:07,381
You're going to Dartmouth!
Oh, my God!

1360
01:17:08,482 --> 01:17:09,449
I really have to pee, though.

1361
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:11,351
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

1362
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,320
Mom's letting me
get a waterbed.

1363
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:15,322
Whoo! Yep.

1364
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:23,363
Oh, my God.

1365
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:29,236
Wow. Four years
of silent treatment.

1366
01:17:29,303 --> 01:17:31,638
Northridge is gonna be
a blast.

1367
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:33,240
Karen? She lied.

1368
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:36,009
Didn't even get
into Northridge. Idiot.

1369
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:37,777
But I got in?

1370
01:17:37,843 --> 01:17:39,246
Maybe that's why
she went nuclear on us.

1371
01:17:39,313 --> 01:17:42,149
Hey. Don't forget
that pink dress, right?

1372
01:17:42,216 --> 01:17:44,017
The one that goes
with my cummerbund.

1373
01:17:44,084 --> 01:17:45,485
Well, I was actually thinking

1374
01:17:45,552 --> 01:17:46,719
it might be super rad
if I did something...

1375
01:17:46,786 --> 01:17:48,455
Don't you wanna match, babe?

1376
01:17:51,692 --> 01:17:53,893
Right. Julie.

1377
01:17:54,528 --> 01:17:55,728
Yeah.

1378
01:17:55,795 --> 01:17:57,397
Not babe.

1379
01:17:58,232 --> 01:17:59,299
I want a hotdog.

1380
01:17:59,366 --> 01:18:00,500
Let's go.

1381
01:18:05,905 --> 01:18:07,341
You look bitchin'.

1382
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:09,343
Thanks.

1383
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:12,246
Uh, I remember my prom.

1384
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:15,515
It's a lot of pressure, right?

1385
01:18:16,717 --> 01:18:18,185
Totally.

1386
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:24,191
Oh, my God!

1387
01:18:24,258 --> 01:18:25,325
I know!

1388
01:18:25,392 --> 01:18:26,526
Oh, wait.

1389
01:18:28,362 --> 01:18:30,998
This is gonna make it,
like, mega.

1390
01:18:31,064 --> 01:18:34,067
Oh, my God. Totally!

1391
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,136
Ah.

1392
01:18:36,203 --> 01:18:38,372
So, like, what happened
with Karen?

1393
01:18:38,438 --> 01:18:39,839
Ugh. She called you
a backstabber

1394
01:18:39,905 --> 01:18:41,141
for hanging out with him.

1395
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:42,709
And I was like,
"Wait, you totally did

1396
01:18:42,775 --> 01:18:44,544
the same thing
but, like, way worse."

1397
01:18:44,611 --> 01:18:46,179
And she freaked out,

1398
01:18:46,246 --> 01:18:47,514
totally stopped the car right
in the middle of Ventura

1399
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:49,249
and told me to get out.

1400
01:18:49,316 --> 01:18:51,817
Yeah, and then she told me not
to get out, but I did anyway.

1401
01:18:58,225 --> 01:19:00,860
Julie! Come quick,
I want you to see this.

1402
01:19:00,926 --> 01:19:02,562
Put our fight on hold
for a second.

1403
01:19:04,864 --> 01:19:06,533
Look, look.

1404
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,769
<i>T-minus ten, nine...</i>

1405
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:10,404
You know what that is?

1406
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:12,306
That's the first
female astronaut.

1407
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,707
That's Sally Ride.

1408
01:19:13,774 --> 01:19:14,940
<i>Go for main engine start</i>

1409
01:19:15,008 --> 01:19:16,176
<i>and we have ignition.</i>

1410
01:19:16,243 --> 01:19:17,611
There she goes.
There she goes.

1411
01:19:17,678 --> 01:19:19,146
<i>And now, lift-off</i>

1412
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:22,416
<i>for America's
first woman astronaut.</i>

1413
01:19:24,284 --> 01:19:25,986
<i>The launchpad is clear</i>

1414
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,454
<i>and STS-7 is free...</i>

1415
01:19:27,521 --> 01:19:29,022
There she goes.

1416
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,558
Pretty cool.

1417
01:19:31,857 --> 01:19:33,126
Yeah.

1418
01:19:35,828 --> 01:19:37,230
You know, I bet...

1419
01:19:38,165 --> 01:19:40,367
I bet her parents
had some scary times.

1420
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,935
You know,
a daughter like that?

1421
01:19:44,004 --> 01:19:46,440
Always wanting to blaze
her own trail, you know?

1422
01:19:49,509 --> 01:19:52,912
But, damn,
I bet they're proud today.

1423
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,521
You know, Sally Ride,

1424
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:04,157
she's from Encino.

1425
01:20:04,624 --> 01:20:06,026
She's a valley girl.

- Oh, this is great!
- Hello, prom night!

1473
01:24:29,889 --> 01:24:31,324
Sweetheart?

1474
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:34,028
And now, we wait
for the young female human...

1475
01:24:34,095 --> 01:24:36,262
- Now I can't see anything.
- ...to emerge from her lair.

1476
01:24:36,329 --> 01:24:37,397
Honey? Sweetheart?

1477
01:24:37,464 --> 01:24:39,299
Fully groomed for the prom.

1478
01:24:48,274 --> 01:24:49,242
Stunning.

1479
01:24:51,478 --> 01:24:53,813
All right. Can we get
a picture of you two?

1480
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,915
Mickey,
give her that corsage.

1481
01:24:55,983 --> 01:24:57,952
- What happened to the dress?
- You said pink.

1482
01:24:58,019 --> 01:25:00,121
- Just a few more photos.
- Just a couple more shots.

1483
01:25:00,186 --> 01:25:02,555
- Mom, we really have to go.
- I'm coming in close.

1484
01:25:02,622 --> 01:25:04,025
We're gonna be late.
We have to go.

1485
01:25:04,091 --> 01:25:05,692
Guys,
this is important.

1486
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:06,359
- Please be careful.
- We won't be back too late.

1487
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,527
Julie?

1488
01:25:08,129 --> 01:25:09,262
Au revoir.

1489
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:11,631
Bye, Mom.

1490
01:25:18,805 --> 01:25:21,075
Coming to you live
from the most bitchin',

1491
01:25:21,142 --> 01:25:22,742
awesomest prom in America,

1492
01:25:22,809 --> 01:25:27,313
it's Rodney on the ROQ,
KROQ, and...

1493
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,615
Raechel Donahue.

1494
01:25:28,682 --> 01:25:30,750
Happy to be here
on my day off.

1495
01:25:41,227 --> 01:25:42,529
Oh.

1496
01:25:43,229 --> 01:25:44,698
Yeah!

1497
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:46,666
Come on, Valley High,
show us how rad you are.

1498
01:26:14,195 --> 01:26:15,996
I wonder if there's a KROQ

1499
01:26:16,063 --> 01:26:18,565
prom king and queen
out there somewhere. Huh?

1500
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:20,300
There for sure is,
there for sure is.

1501
01:26:20,366 --> 01:26:22,002
Because we gotta
pick somebody.

1502
01:26:25,538 --> 01:26:26,539
Congrats on the big news,
Stacey.

1503
01:26:26,606 --> 01:26:28,308
Oh, hey, thanks, Mr. G.

1504
01:26:28,374 --> 01:26:29,676
Just don't forget
about us here in LA.

1505
01:26:29,743 --> 01:26:30,744
I won't.

1506
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:35,049
- End of an era, huh?
- Hmm?

1507
01:26:35,116 --> 01:26:36,449
Oh, yeah.

1508
01:26:36,516 --> 01:26:38,284
It's, like, so sad.

1509
01:26:38,752 --> 01:26:40,520
Are you kidding?

1510
01:26:40,587 --> 01:26:42,223
High school
hates people like me.

1511
01:26:42,288 --> 01:26:43,556
I'm sure you don't understand.

1512
01:26:43,623 --> 01:26:44,791
You're so cool and confident,

1513
01:26:44,858 --> 01:26:46,060
and always
at the best parties.

1514
01:26:46,127 --> 01:26:47,560
I hated those parties.

1515
01:26:49,896 --> 01:26:51,364
I'm going
to Dartmouth

1516
01:26:51,431 --> 01:26:52,565
for computer science.

1517
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:55,702
I'll be at MIT.

1518
01:26:55,769 --> 01:26:58,905
It's only a swift a 111 miles
as the crow flies.

1519
01:27:00,273 --> 01:27:01,708
Do you want some punch?

1520
01:27:01,775 --> 01:27:03,043
You have some.

And now, the moment that
you've all been waiting for.

01:29:38,098 --> 01:29:40,500
So, are we
back together again?

1553
01:29:40,566 --> 01:29:42,269
Because I got us
a room at the Sheraton.

1554
01:29:45,139 --> 01:29:46,206
No.

1555
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:50,476
Like, no, we're not back
together or no Sheraton?

1556
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,580
Do you really wanna
do this right now?

1557
01:29:56,449 --> 01:30:00,087
Damn it, Julie, are you, like,
wasting my prom night?

1558
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:05,192
Not anymore.

1559
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:18,871
Ladies, I'm single!

1560
01:30:18,938 --> 01:30:21,075
Yeah!

1561
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:26,612
Not exactly how we thought
prom would go, huh?

1562
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:28,614
Our last hurrah.

1563
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,252
Yeah.

1564
01:30:40,927 --> 01:30:42,062
I heard about Northridge.

1565
01:30:47,201 --> 01:30:48,601
What are you gonna do?

1566
01:30:52,605 --> 01:30:53,940
No clue.

1567
01:30:56,709 --> 01:30:58,544
Maybe that's good
for a change.

1568
01:31:01,348 --> 01:31:02,282
Yeah.

Hey. You should call this gal.

1597
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,683
She does choreography
for music videos.

1598
01:33:53,187 --> 01:33:54,454

01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:00,994

1604
01:34:26,919 --> 01:34:28,288
So, wait, this song that

1605
01:34:28,355 --> 01:34:30,157
they play on KROQ
all the time,

1606
01:34:30,224 --> 01:34:32,858
- is about you?
- Mmm-hmm.

1607
01:34:32,925 --> 01:34:36,096
It was also in a terrible
fast food commercial.

1608
01:34:36,163 --> 01:34:39,166
Oh, my God. You were,
like, actually cool once.

1609
01:34:39,233 --> 01:34:41,501
Mmm. I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

1610
01:34:41,568 --> 01:34:43,170
But then you left him for Dad?

1611
01:34:43,237 --> 01:34:45,005
Not exactly.

1612
01:34:45,072 --> 01:34:48,475
We moved to New York
and they got a record deal

1613
01:34:48,542 --> 01:34:51,111
right when I was
finishing fashion school.

1614
01:34:51,178 --> 01:34:53,746
And I did the looks
for their first tour.

1615
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:55,282
Tell me you went on that tour.

1616
01:34:55,349 --> 01:34:56,416
Yes.

1617
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,485
Wait, so,
what happened with Randy?

1618
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:02,089
Well, life happened.

1619
01:35:03,223 --> 01:35:05,192
First loves don't always last,

1620
01:35:05,259 --> 01:35:08,828
but they change everything.

1621
01:35:08,894 --> 01:35:10,330
You could have been
with a rock star.

1622
01:35:10,397 --> 01:35:12,032
You could have had,
like, a sick life.

1623
01:35:12,099 --> 01:35:15,102
I do have a really sick life.

1624
01:35:15,435 --> 01:35:16,470
I have you,

1625
01:35:17,304 --> 01:35:18,538
and my company.

1626
01:35:18,605 --> 01:35:20,540
I actually get to design
clothes for a living.

1627
01:35:21,941 --> 01:35:23,909
And I love your dad
more than anything.

1628
01:35:25,412 --> 01:35:27,247
And Randy,

1629
01:35:27,314 --> 01:35:29,349
being with him
and seeing the world,

1630
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:30,816
that made me who I am.

1631
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:38,158
What are you gonna do
about Zach?

1632
01:35:39,426 --> 01:35:40,527
I don't know.

1633
01:35:42,429 --> 01:35:44,064
Guess I'm just gonna have to
figure it out,

1634
01:35:44,598 --> 01:35:45,865
on my way to Japan.

1635
01:35:47,933 --> 01:35:50,437
You know, blaze my own trail.

1636
01:35:50,504 --> 01:35:52,272
Like, totally.

1637
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:16,530
Where do you want to go?

1638
01:36:16,596 --> 01:36:18,065
Everywhere.

1639
01:36:18,665 --> 01:36:20,300
What do you want to do?

1640
01:36:21,435 --> 01:36:22,602
Everything.

1641
01:38:00,898 --> 01:38:05,898
