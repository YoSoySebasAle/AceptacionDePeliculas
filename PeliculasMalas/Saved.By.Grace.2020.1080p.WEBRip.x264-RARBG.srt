1
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,277
- Jerk boss.

2
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,019
Mediocre policies.

3
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:25,982
Should have known better.

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,072
I should have known better,
should have known better.

5
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:27,696
What?

6
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,307
- Oh honey, I came
as soon as I heard.

7
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,961
- How sweet of you.

8
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:32,744
Did you bring me--

9
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:33,702
- Comfort food?

10
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,530
I brought you cookies and wine.

11
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:36,705
- Cheep wine?

12
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:37,836
- Just like in college.

13
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:39,795
- Mm.

14
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,277
And he let me go.

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,974
- That ain't right.

16
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:47,368
- And he said it was layoffs.

17
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,630
- That ain't right.

18
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,066
- But I know it's
just he didn't like me

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,459
because I stood up to him.

20
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:52,982
But you know what, Kat?

21
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,592
Greener pastures ahead.

22
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:55,724
- A agree.

23
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,901
You know what, you didn't need
to work at the mall anyway.

24
00:01:58,944 --> 00:01:59,902
You have a degree.

25
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:00,598
- In religion.

26
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,993
- Okay, so then
work at a church.

27
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:05,864
- Work at a, churches
are full of drama,

28
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:08,215
and you know I don't do drama.

29
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,521
- I just saw a position
today at our church.

30
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:11,392
- For what?

31
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:12,958
- Executive pastor.

32
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,743
- Executive pastor?

33
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:15,439
- Mmhmm.

34
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,703
- Executive pastor.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,251
- Hello, Pastor's office.

36
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:46,296
Yes.

37
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:48,298
Yes.

38
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,345
No.

39
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,650
Is that it?

40
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,564
Okay.

41
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:56,915
Your 5:00 canceled.

42
00:02:59,004 --> 00:02:59,918
Yes?

43
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:03,226
Mr. Sandro, I already told you,

44
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,620
once the pastor gets
one free second,

45
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,013
he will investigate a new oven.

46
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,842
Until then you're just
gonna have to make due.

47
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:11,756
Okay, bye.

48
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,194
- Sabrina, Sabrina,

49
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:18,328
you don't have to monitor
my time like this.

50
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,895
Mr. Sandro's been
waiting a long time

51
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,940
for me to fix that
oven since February.

52
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,204
- I know, but you have
your 2:00 and your 3:00

53
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:25,814
and then you have
the deacon's meeting

54
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,163
and marriage counseling,

55
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,904
I just don't think
you can fit him in.

56
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:31,820
- I always got time for
stuff that's important.

57
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,256
- It is not important.

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,563
A new stove is not gonna help
that man cook any better.

59
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:36,694
- What'd you say?

60
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:37,391
- Oh nothing.

61
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,525
- Grace Hightower,
how are you dear?

62
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,266
- I'm fine, Pastor,
just fine, and you?

63
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,049
- He's busy.

64
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,792
- Yes, I am, what
can I do for you?

65
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:49,490
- Yesterday I heard that
there was a job opening

66
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,665
here at the church,
is that right?

67
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,970
- Yes.

68
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:54,059
We have an opening
for executive pastor.

69
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:56,627
Pastor Frank quit and so we
are in desperate need of help.

70
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,542
I mean we are in desperate need.

71
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,370
You know anybody
that's interested?

72
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:02,067
- Yes, Pastor, myself.

73
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,377
- Excellent, I think you'd
make a great candidate.

74
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,031
- Well you haven't
seen this yet.

75
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,034
- Well, that's amazing, Pastor,

76
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,427
I didn't even think
you would think

77
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,080
I was qualified to do it,
but I'll tell you this,

78
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,517
I have great
management experience,

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,171
as well as volunteer
service here at the church

80
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:20,651
as well as college ministry.

81
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:22,087
- I know, I know.

82
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:26,222
Sabrina, you think we have
time for an interview?

83
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,528
- Now?

84
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,965
Sir, I'm gonna have
to advise against it.

85
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:32,272
You have a media team
meeting in only 20 minutes.

86
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,274
- And like I can,
but I'm not prepared.

87
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,146
I didn't even think you
would take my application.

88
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,540
- Actually, we got time
for a group interview.

89
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,325
-  What?

90
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,414
- Yes, Sabrina, Grace,

91
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,112
you both applied for
the same position

92
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:50,986
so let's step into my office
and have a group session.

93
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,302
So, what makes you a good
fit for this position?

94
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:05,566
- Well, I am intimately
familiar with the duties

95
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,395
of both the pastor and
the executive pastor

96
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:11,049
as I've worked for both of
you for the past two years.

97
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,529
- Hm, Grace?

98
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,966
- Well, I worked in a department
store for over eight years

99
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,404
so I have a lot of
executive like duties

100
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:18,448
that I did over there.

101
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:19,710
- Like what?

102
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,409
- Managed people,
inventory control, payroll,

103
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,367
I pretty much ran the entire

104
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,021
day-to-day activities
over there.

105
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,676
- Hm, and what is your
greatest weakness?

106
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,287
- Well, I have to say,
my greatest weakness is

107
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,290
I'm too meticulous, focusing
on tasks with perfection.

108
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,466
I mean, I just
don't like to have

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,815
things fall through the cracks.

110
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:41,036
- Hm, that sounds good, Grace.

111
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,298
- That's good.

112
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,474
My greatest weakness
would be um,

113
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,086
I care about people too much.

114
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,305
The last job that I was with,

115
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,263
it was a business
about making money,

116
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,789
but people would come in,
employees would come in

117
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:58,053
and they would ask for
advances against their checks,

118
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:01,926
you know, and I would feel
sorry for them, Pastor.

119
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,932
And so I think that's the
reason why I got fired.

120
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,109
- Mm.

121
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,243
- Sir, is there anything
that I can help you with?

122
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,940
After all, that is my job.

123
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,421
- I just got an email from Haiti

124
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,512
and I'm about to leave on
an emergency right away.

125
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,426
- Right now?

126
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,775
- Yes.

127
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,386
And I'm gonna leave
you two in charge.

128
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,040
-  What?

129
00:06:58,635 --> 00:06:59,723
- Good morning, Sabrina.

130
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,378
- Morning.

131
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,685
- Hm, up early.

132
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,383
- I always do, something
the pastor really likes.

133
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,821
- Hm, did he make
it okay yesterday?

134
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,737
- Uh, I haven't heard
from him, but uh,

135
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:16,958
I will follow up when he
should arrive at the orphanage.

136
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,002
- Okay, good.

137
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:20,701
Um, so um,

138
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:25,445
where do I sit?

139
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,882
- I was thinking the lobby.

140
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,409
- Shouldn't I have a desk?

141
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,845
- Well this is my desk

142
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,500
and the only other
desk is the pastor's

143
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,416
and I really don't think it's
appropriate for you to use it.

144
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,939
- Okay so um, what
am I supposed to do?

145
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,811
Just work on my phone?

146
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,029
- Huh, that works for me.

147
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,077
- I have an idea.

148
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,426
Why don't we switch.

149
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,427
Why don't you work
here in the morning

150
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,689
and then I'll come
in the afternoon

151
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,386
and I'll work here on the desk.

152
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,085
- Like I said, this is my desk.

153
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,043
I know where everything is.

154
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,437
It is organized with
optimal efficiency

155
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,395
and ergonomics in mind.

156
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,919
For me to leave this desk,

157
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,182
would send this church
into a downward spiral

158
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,923
of tragedy and disaster,

159
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,229
particularly when
the pastor is gone.

160
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:13,449
- Mm.

161
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,934
- Actually, it would just be
really awkward with you here.

162
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,152
- Mmhmm, yeah.

163
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,547
Awkward all right.

164
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:28,464
Oh God.

165
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,038
Listen, Sabrina, I
understand that you feel like

166
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,648
you are more qualified
than me, that's fine.

167
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,695
But the pastor put
both of us in charge.

168
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,088
We've got to stay here and
work together as a team.

169
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:46,743
- See, it would be nice
if I needed the help,

170
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,529
but I have this
all under control.

171
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,183
Personally, I think that the
pastor felt sorry for you

172
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:55,012
because you got fired
for being too nice.

173
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,666
- Mm, that was uncalled for.

174
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,189
- Just like you being here.

175
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:00,714
- This is a church.

176
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,932
We're supposed to be a team.

177
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,412
I'm not here for this bull--

178
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,545
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

179
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:09,157
what in the Siegfried and
Roy is going on in here?

180
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,553
- Oh, Deacon Thompson, I'm
sorry, did she disturb you?

181
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,512
- Well, I'm having a
prayer meeting over there.

182
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,296
I'm hearing all this
bickering over here.

183
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,559
Now what's the problem?

184
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,473
- Oh, we just were
having a bit of conflict

185
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:22,997
about a job opening.

186
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,347
- Oh, what job opening?

187
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,567
- Uh, the executive
pastor position.

188
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,612
- Executive pastor position?

189
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:30,874
First time I'm
hearing about this.

190
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,615
- Well, I heard
about it from Kat.

191
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,398
- The wino's daughter?

192
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,100
Look, as head deacon, I should
at least know about this.

193
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,405
- Well I am so sorry.

194
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,582
I forgot to post it
on the church website,

195
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,453
but probably won't
need it anyway.

196
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,541
- Well why is that?

197
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,544
- Well because the
pastor has placed myself

198
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,850
and her--
- And me.

199
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,286
- In charge in his absence.

200
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,679
So you know,

201
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,681
I guess whoever does the
best will get the position.

202
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,683
- Well what is
this position pay?

203
00:09:56,726 --> 00:10:01,035
- 60 grand, vision,
health, retirement--

204
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:02,297
- And, we get what?

205
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,212
-  The church house.

206
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,431
- Church house, you
mean the two bedroom,

207
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:11,306
the two bath, garage, that
grill and basic cable?

208
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,525
-  You sound
like a game show host.

209
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:14,918
- And a jacuzzi, right?

210
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:15,702
-  Mmhmm.

211
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,138
- I could use that bump.

212
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,487
- Mmhmm.

213
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,532
- Well, hey, where's
the pastor at anyway?

214
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,751
- Oh, he went to Haiti.

215
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:22,534
- Haiti?

216
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:23,710
-  Yeah.

217
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:24,754
- When the pastor gets back,

218
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,756
I need to talk to
him immediately.

219
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,539
You hear me, right?

220
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,540
- Loud and clear.

221
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,630
- Thank you.

222
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,546
Jacuzzi, oh yeah!

223
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,144
- S'cuse me, can I help you?

224
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,885
- Miss Grace, that you honey?

225
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:52,668
-  Yes--

226
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,625
- How you doing?

227
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:54,975
- I'm fine, Miss. Pumpkin.

228
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,367
How can I help you today?

229
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,804
- No, I'm looking for Pastor.

230
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,153
- Oh well I'm here
in his absence.

231
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,459
Is there something
that I can do for you?

232
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:02,809
- Uh, I'll just
talk to Sabrina--

233
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,245
- No, no, no, that's
what I'm here for.

234
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,202
I'm here to help.

235
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,813
What can I do for you today?

236
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,815
- Okay, well,

237
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,817
I need to talk to the pastor
about these choir robes.

238
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,383
- Uh huh.

239
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:15,865
- I mean, they're old and
frayed and we keep altering 'em

240
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,172
instead of replacing
'em with new ones.

241
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,566
- Okay well then how
much does it cost?

242
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,047
- I don't know, Sabrina
does all of that.

243
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:25,527
- Okay, well let me help you.

244
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,050
Let me figure
something out for you.

245
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,704
Okay, how many robes is it?

246
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,707
- 34.

247
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,535
- Okay, okay, wow, that's a lot.

248
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,015
I didn't know we had that
many people in the choir.

249
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,843
- Well you know, it
takes a lot to make

250
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,280
a joyful noise like us,
you know what I mean?

251
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,934
-  Yes, yes.

252
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,937
Okay, so, oh, I'm gonna
find a price point for you

253
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,199
and I'll be in contact
with you and let you know

254
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,592
how much it costs--
- No, look,

255
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,594
I'm just gonna deal
with Sabrina 'cause

256
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,640
working with you is redundant,

257
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,381
but I really do appreciate you.

258
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:54,643
I mean, I really do.

259
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,648
-  Miss
Pumpkin, how are you?

260
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:00,736
- Hi.

261
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,911
Sabrina, my girl.

262
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,826
- Miss Grace.

263
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,046
- Yes, oh hi Mr. Sandros.

264
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,744
- I heard you talking
about these robes.

265
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,268
- Uh huh, yeah, are
you in the choir?

266
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:16,099
- No, I'm a cook and I came
to see you about an oven,

267
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,798
a brand new gas, we've
got to have a gas oven.

268
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,974
- I know and I heard that you're
one of the best cooks here.

269
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:21,757
- Chicken and dumplings.

270
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,237
- Chicken and dumplings.

271
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,370
- Look, I need some money.

272
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,807
- Okay, but the thing is,

273
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,766
we don't have a budget
right now for an oven,

274
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,202
we really don't.

275
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,769
- Should a budget be an issue

276
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,729
when I'm trying to stop serving
these people burnt food?

277
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:38,905
I'm outta here.

278
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,689
I'll holler at you later on.

279
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,865
I'm going for the help.

280
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,389
Sabrina,
you up in here?

281
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,956
I need money, girl.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,652
I got to have it.

283
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,916
Where you at?

284
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:50,612
Oh.

285
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:58,925
- Hey Miss Grace, looks
like you could use a seat.

286
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,883
- Oh  thank
you, but no thank you.

287
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,755
And you, you're always working.

288
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,322
- Well you know they keep
me working, Miss Grace.

289
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,324
- Yes, but you know, we have
some new young congregates here

290
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:08,935
that could probably help
you during the week.

291
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,111
- You know what, maybe I should
talk to pastor about that.

292
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:11,894
That's a good idea.

293
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,896
- Oh, you didn't hear?

294
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,767
- Hm, hear what?

295
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,247
They going to Haiti, huh?

296
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,901
- Yes, he went to Haiti.

297
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:19,597
- Wow.

298
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,210
- I'm having like a
really rough day today.

299
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,820
- What's going on with you?

300
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,126
- Well, I lost my job--

301
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,388
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

302
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,650
- And, thanks,

303
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:29,912
and so now I'm interviewing

304
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,175
for this new executive
position here

305
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:36,876
in this crazy interview style
contest against Sabrina.

306
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,268
- Executive?

307
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,401
I don't see you as an executive.

308
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:41,315
- What do you mean?

309
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,882
- Oh, no, no, not like that.

310
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:43,970
It's just you're too nice.

311
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,494
I see you more in
the missionary work.

312
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:51,020
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could
see myself doing that.

313
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:54,284
Maybe one day I'll go out
the country, you know?

314
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,938
- A cultured woman
such as yourself

315
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,592
has never been out
of the country?

316
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:58,898
I find that hard to believe.

317
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,247
- One day I will go though.

318
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,944
I will go out of the country.

319
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,815
- Yeah and uh, maybe
I could tag along.

320
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:07,167
- There's no subtly
with you, huh?

321
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,908
- I can be subtle sometimes.

322
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:09,952
- All right.

323
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,215
Well have a beautiful
day, Mr. Troy.

324
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,435
- You do the same, Miss Grace.

325
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,500
- There's my girl, hi
beautiful, how you doing?

326
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,284
- Hi Bessie Joe, it's
so good to see you.

327
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,069
- Girl, it's good
to see you too,

328
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,419
but usually ain't up
here in this afternoon.

329
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:28,291
- I know, I'm here to help
the pastor while he's away.

330
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,858
- Girl, you got a good heart.

331
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,251
That's why you love this church.

332
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:34,123
- Yes, yes, I do have a
heart for this church.

333
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,821
- Because if you love the
church and you love God,

334
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,736
you will be blessed.

335
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,824
- That's right.

336
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:40,912
- But you know I
won the lottery.

337
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,697
I won $1,500.

338
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,654
- Today?

339
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,135
- Girl no, that was in 1993,

340
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:51,053
but if I keep the faith and
believe in God, I'ma win again.

341
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,924
- Miss Bessie,
you're a crazy fool.

342
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,491
-  For loving the Lord?

343
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,972
- No, for wasting all your
money on those lottery tickets.

344
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,408
- Really?

345
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,194
- You know, in the Bible it
says you should not gamble.

346
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,065
- Well if I don't
see it in the Bible,

347
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,241
until I do, I'm not gonna quit.

348
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:09,071
I'm gonna win this lottery,
in the name of Jesus.

349
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,507
Girl, I'll see you later.

350
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,335
- See ya later.

351
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,032
Mm, amen.

352
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,122
- Crazy lady.

353
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,950
- Don't say that about her.

354
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,909
- Look, I got some news.

355
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:21,692
- What?

356
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:22,519
- Bad news.

357
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,045
Somebody's been dipping
in the collection plate.

358
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,089
- Who?

359
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,090
- Deacon Thompson.

360
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,439
- Can't say that
about somebody--

361
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,572
- I got proof and I
wanna bust him out

362
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,182
in front of the congregation.

363
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:34,705
- Okay no, no, no,
before you do that,

364
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:38,579
look, I have an idea, tell
me the evidence that you have

365
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:41,451
and then I'll present
it to the pastor.

366
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,801
- Sweetheart, you pretty,
but you ain't that pretty.

367
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:44,976
You can't solve this problem.

368
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,160
- Usher Mike.

369
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,074
-  Deacon Thompson.

370
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,350
- You know he's dipping
in the collection plate?

371
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:13,222
And he smokes
Marijuana cigarettes.

372
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,409
- Oh my God, what is
wrong with these people?

373
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,107
- What do you mean?

374
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,805
- Back stabbing,
betrayals, gossip,

375
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,981
this is why I left
he corporate world.

376
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,156
- You know, a lot
of people think

377
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,202
that working at a church
is a bed of roses.

378
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,029
They forget about the thorns.

379
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:40,989
- Oh man, but what
if the silver linings

380
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,905
of leaving the corporate
world is avoiding politics

381
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,037
and boss butt kissing?

382
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,778
I've been here
for almost one day

383
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,650
and everybody here's
stressing me out.

384
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,652
- One day, Grace, one day.

385
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,002
This job is probably
not for you.

386
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:57,136
This is probably a
sign of what's to come.

387
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,225
- Oh don't fret yourself, honey.

388
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,923
- Mother Thomas, you always
find a way to sneak up on us.

389
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,533
- That's how you hear all
the good gossip, honey.

390
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,318
- She always does that.

391
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,885
I think, when she dies,
she's gonna haunt us

392
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,757
and we're not gonna even
know the difference.

393
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,020
- You got a funny
way of saying things,

394
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:14,588
but I'm not sure what you're
saying is good or bad.

395
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,198
- Mother Thomas,
you know I love you.

396
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:19,114
-  That-a-girl.

397
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,768
Look Grace darling,
don't come in here

398
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,378
and get yourself caught
up with all this nonsense

399
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,337
that goes along with our church.

400
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,165
It was here before Jesus
was walking the Earth

401
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,036
and it'll be here after.

402
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,169
What
matters is your heart

403
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:33,084
and whether you act or not on
the love that Jesus put there.

404
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:35,304
Everything else is
babbly nonsense.

405
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,132
Here, have a snack, baby.

406
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,699
-  No, Mother Thomas,

407
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:44,052
I just don't understand why
the church is so flawed.

408
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,227
- That's the whole point.

409
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:49,275
The church is the one
place that people can go,

410
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:52,887
be themselves and still
be accepted none-the-less.

411
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,150
You, of all people,
should know that, Grace.

412
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,020
- Ow.

413
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,152
Dammit.

414
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:57,979
I mean, shoot.

415
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,373
- See what I mean?

416
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,184
- Hey hi.

417
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,534
It's 5:00, see you tomorrow?

418
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,581
- Oh, I usually stay until 6:00.

419
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,886
- Oh, um--

420
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,541
- It's okay, you can go.

421
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:39,760
- Okay, it's just that

422
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,762
I have a dinner
meeting with a friend.

423
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,199
- Like I said, you can go.

424
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,680
It's okay, I have
everything under control.

425
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,290
-  Okay.

426
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,291
- You're kind of an
accessory right now anyway.

427
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,077
- Who made you so mean?

428
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,993
- My momma told me to go after
what I want whole-heartedly,

429
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:59,083
so if that makes me mean,
then you have to blame her,

430
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,694
but then again, you're
talking about my momma

431
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:01,999
and you know what happens

432
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,349
when you talk about
someone's momma.

433
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:06,961
- Mm mm mm, Mother Thomas
was right about you,

434
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,050
but I'ma figure you out.

435
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:09,703
- Good.

436
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:12,836
- See you tomorrow.

437
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,663
- Hm.

438
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:46,479
- Dagnabit.

439
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:49,438
Dagnabit old house.

440
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:52,920
Yes.

441
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,067
- I am late.

442
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,294
Oh my God, I'm so late, oh.

443
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,340
Oh, is there a meeting?

444
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,776
- It's the weekly
prayer meeting.

445
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,560
It's on the calendar.

446
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:26,997
- Oh, sorry to interrupt.

447
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,739
- Well ya did, but I
accept your apology.

448
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,265
Oh God, come
on, Deacon Thompson.

449
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:38,444
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

450
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:39,619
Okay, come on, come on.

451
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,867
- Oh my God, what
am I doing here?

452
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,355
- Looks like you're
still sleeping.

453
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:23,402
- Troy, thank you.

454
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,538
- That was quite an entrance.

455
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:32,498
- Well, a girl has to
make her entrance somehow.

456
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:38,895
Coffee you sweet elixir of
life, I love you so much.

457
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:41,942
- Now you're talking
to your beverages.

458
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,944
Man, you're really
going through it.

459
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,989
- That's not even half of it.

460
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,991
- It's only the first day.

461
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:49,993
Keep the faith, baby girl.

462
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,430
- You know what?

463
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,388
I don't know if that's a
good thing or a bad thing.

464
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,610
- I don't know what
was going on out there,

465
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,176
but interrupting
a prayer meeting

466
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,875
is just not professional, Grace.

467
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:04,181
Hey, hi Troy, how you doing?

468
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,055
- I'd be better if you were a
little kinder to your church

469
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:10,753
brothers and sisters,
Miss Sabrina.

470
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:15,932
- Oh Troy, you're such a man.

471
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:21,198
- Thanks Troy.

472
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,069
- Anytime, sweetie.

473
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,209
- Think I need a
little bit more coffee.

474
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:37,476
What do you mean, Sabrina?

475
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,260
Troy was just joking with you.

476
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,480
I mean, but you
could stand to be

477
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,829
a little bit nicer to people.

478
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:45,527
I mean I know I am a little
rough around the edges,

479
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,486
but it's only been
my second day.

480
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:49,836
Come in!

481
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,579
Eh, Ijitsu.

482
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:54,710
When am I gonna get
that rap song, man?

483
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:56,886
- When the good Lord
decides it's time.

484
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,192
Until then.

485
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,673
- Oh my goodness, why
you holding my cup?

486
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,631
- Well we went to the church
looking for the pastor

487
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:03,937
and he wasn't there

488
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,591
and seen your cup so I
decided to bring it to you.

489
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:06,896
- Wait, you were
looking for the pastor.

490
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,594
Is there something
I can help you with?

491
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,813
- Oh well, this was
my girlfriend, Casey,

492
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:13,250
but she's my finance now.

493
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:14,338
- Oh.

494
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,775
Oh, bling, bling, mm.

495
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:18,604
- We were hoping the pastor
can marry us by next week.

496
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:21,824
- Oh, well I don't think the
pastors gonna be here in time,

497
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:24,523
but I could marry you 'cause
I'm an ordained minister.

498
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,306
- Really?

499
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:26,263
-  Yes.

500
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:27,700
- Where'd you get your license?

501
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,397
- Church of the Internet
dot com, you heard of it?

502
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,486
- No, but it doesn't
seem that amazing,

503
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,142
but do you speak Spanish 'cause
Casey only speaks Spanish.

504
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:37,144
- Of course I speak Spanish.

505
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:58,426
- Oh, um, okay.

506
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:00,384
Mi Espanol no es bueno.

507
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:01,647
It's all good.

508
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,083
- Well if the pastor's
not here on time,

509
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:04,780
maybe you can marry us.

510
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:06,782
- Well I'ma work on some
marriage verses for you.

511
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,088
- Yeah, well let me know.

512
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,438
We gotta go cake tasting
so talk to you later.

513
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,919
- All right, get the butter
cream, that's the best one.

514
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:15,704
Oh.

515
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:17,358
Hello?

516
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,141
Oops.

517
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,026
- Ah ha.

518
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,029
- Usher Mike, what in the Tom
and Jerry are you doing here?

519
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:36,899
- You caught.

520
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,988
- Caught doing what?

521
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,556
- Deacon Thompson, I knew
you was up to something.

522
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,341
This time I'm gonna
bust you so hard

523
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,474
that the prison ministry
is the only church members

524
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:47,649
you're gonna see.

525
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:49,651
- You have no idea what
you're talking about.

526
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,000
What are you doing here?

527
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,872
- I forgot something.

528
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,874
- Yeah, you forgot something
like the money you been taking

529
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,049
out of the offering plate.

530
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:56,963
- You're kidding.

531
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:57,659
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

532
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:02,577
- No, Usher Mike, you rarely
look like you're kidding.

533
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,187
You've been dipping in
the collection plate.

534
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,624
Everybody knows it.

535
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,321
- No sir, no sir.

536
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:10,193
Everyone knows you've been
dipping in the offering plate.

537
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:13,370
-  You got the
wrong deacon.

538
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,850
- So what are you doing here?

539
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:23,467
- If I tell you, Usher Mike,

540
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:26,906
you've got to promise me
you're not gonna tell a soul.

541
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:27,820
- It depends.

542
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,651
- Have you ever heard
of an Air B & B?

543
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,062
- Why did you bring me to
the old missionary house?

544
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:56,022
- We ain't had a missionary
for the past three years.

545
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,153
You know who this house is for?

546
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:58,154
- Who?

547
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:59,634
- Frank.

548
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,940
- Thought he had a
house on the West Side.

549
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:03,682
- Exactly, this house has
just been sitting here

550
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,727
and those young'uns
are about to take it

551
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,207
and they don't deserve it.

552
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,730
- Who, Grace and Sabrina?

553
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,993
- Yeah, I got this place
booked for the next four months

554
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,516
for $150 a night.

555
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,434
- Deacon Thompson, you know
you can get in a lot of trouble

556
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,176
for using the church property
for your own personal gains.

557
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,041
- Hello?

558
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,219
No, no, it's not
today, it's tomorrow.

559
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:06,309
What day is it?

560
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:10,139
- Oh no, Troy, we can't do that.

561
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:12,794
- We have you written down
on the calendar incorrectly.

562
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:14,491
- Don't go, Troy.

563
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:17,233
- Okay Miss Johnson, we'll
see you this afternoon.

564
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,194
Have you heard from the pastor?

565
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:22,717
- No.

566
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,631
- Mm, that's weird.

567
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:24,806
It's been like almost a week.

568
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,895
Like I'm wondering,
is he still alive?

569
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,331
- Don't say that.

570
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,942
- I'm just saying, is like
a big old storm happening

571
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,596
in Haiti,
communications is down,

572
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,382
I'm exasperated, it's almost
a week and I'm just like.

573
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:39,342
- Like I've been saying--

574
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:41,475
-  Maybe this
isn't the job for you.

575
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:44,783
- Okay, sleepyhead.

576
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:48,830
- Foreclosure.

577
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:49,831
- What are you talking about?

578
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,050
- On the church.

579
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:56,882
Grace, they're gonna
foreclose on the church.

580
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,405
- What?

581
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:00,015
How is that possible?

582
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,452
-  Oh, it's
quite possible.

583
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,758
- Who are you?

584
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,804
- I'm the executer
on that account.

585
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:06,587
Kelly Burns.

586
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,242
FRS Properties.

587
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:10,809
- What is FRS Properties?

588
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,376
- Well as of next Monday,
we'll be the fine owners

589
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,814
of this lovely church
building and the surrounds.

590
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,859
- What, how?

591
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,513
- Well it is hearsay,
but apparently

592
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:22,690
your executive pastor has been
keeping the mortgage checks

593
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:24,170
for himself for years.

594
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:24,997
- Oh!

595
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,172
- Is he here today?

596
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:27,913
- He quit two weeks ago.

597
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,088
- Sneaky bastard.

598
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,831
He made off with
over $1,000,000,

599
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,137
leaving you with a massive debt.

600
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:38,140
FRS specializes in foreclosures,

601
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:40,882
in particular,
inner city churches.

602
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,144
- Who specializes in that?

603
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,755
- A smart company.

604
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,149
Now it's nothing personal,

605
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:49,717
we only see the color green.

606
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,938
Bank lives do matter,
don't they?

607
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,897
Any who, the paperwork should
go through within the week

608
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,943
so you'll wanna
talk to your church

609
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,510
and let everybody know
and start packing as well.

610
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:03,035
The details are included there,

611
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:06,081
minus the dirty details
I included as hearsay.

612
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,909
I do look forward
to working with you.

613
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:08,736
Toodles.

614
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,391
Let's go make
America great again.

615
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,571
- My God, what are we gonna do?

616
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:18,920
- I don't know about you,

617
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:21,575
but I'm going to
look for another job.

618
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:25,361
Monster.com, Indeed.com, woo,

619
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:27,711
I am so glad I updated
my LinkedIn account.

620
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:28,887
- Hey, how you ladies doing?

621
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,328
- I was surprised.

622
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,156
Next thing you know,
right before she leaves,

623
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:40,507
she's like bye, toodles, let's
make America great again.

624
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,379
It was like the
she-devil took over.

625
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,293
- I can't believe it.

626
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,994
Frank was always
quiet, but this?

627
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:52,954
This church has been
home to so many people.

628
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,914
How could someone
take that from them?

629
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:59,004
I think we need to find
Frank and we need to--

630
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,396
- What?

631
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,181
What, get somebody to
put him in concrete boots

632
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:04,357
and throw him in the river?

633
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,010
No.

634
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,317
I think we need to
tell the church.

635
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:09,362
- Tell the church what?

636
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:11,930
- That we lost it.

637
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,105
- Lost it how?

638
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,019
- We're in foreclosure.

639
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:15,324
Frank stole the money.

640
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:18,588
- We need to tell Pastor.

641
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,677
- We need to find Frank.

642
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,157
- We need to find another job.

643
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,943
- I think we need to pray.

644
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,815
- Let's pray.

645
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:37,999
- Lord, we come to you
at a time of despair,

646
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,480
confusion, potential loss.

647
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:41,655
-  Yes, Lord.

648
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:43,222
- We don't know what's going on,

649
00:32:43,265 --> 00:32:45,006
why this happened
or what to do now,

650
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,836
but one thing we do know
is that you are with us.

651
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:49,880
- Yes Lord.
- Yes, yes.

652
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,927
- You said you would
never leave us,

653
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,931
nor forsake us and so
in our time of need,

654
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,718
we cling to that promise
because building or no building,

655
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,024
we are your church.

656
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,895
- Yes Lord, yes, yes.

657
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:06,245
- And we will stick together.

658
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,637
-  Yes.

659
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:09,161
- With you as our
leader, our head,

660
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,380
we will find the strength
to make it through.

661
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,338
- Yes.

662
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:13,687
- We pray for clarity,

663
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:17,952
the knowledge to
act when appropriate

664
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,824
and most of all, unity.

665
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:21,521
-  Yes.

666
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,525
- In the name of Jesus, I pray.

667
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:26,439
Amen.

668
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:27,222
-  Amen.

669
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,006
- Amen.

670
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,137
- Amen.

671
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:55,424
- What do we do, God?

672
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:58,036
What do I do?

673
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:08,932
Lord help me.

674
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,341
Lord help me.

675
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:01,985
That's it!

676
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,687
That's it, yes!

677
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,182
Hello, Sabrina?

678
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,141
I know it's early
in the morning.

679
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,142
I am so excited.

680
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,710
We're going to save the church.

681
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:31,928
Call an emergency meeting.

682
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,191
I'm on my way.

683
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:53,559
Oh, I need you, Lord.

684
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,170
Help me, Lord, give me ideas.

685
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,780
Show me the way, Lord.

686
00:36:57,824 --> 00:37:00,783
- Yes, yes yes yes, that would
be wonderful Pastor Scott.

687
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:02,829
I will see you
tomorrow at 10:00.

688
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:04,439
I'll bring my resume.

689
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,572
All right, bye.

690
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,878
Uh, do you think
it's gonna work?

691
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,446
- I guess you don't.

692
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,232
- Well my momma told me
that when it comes to work

693
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,235
to C-Y-A, cover your ass.

694
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:20,281
- You ready?

695
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:21,456
- Is everyone here?

696
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,414
-  Yes.

697
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:44,349
- Thank you, everyone.

698
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:47,003
Thank you for coming to this
emergency church meeting,

699
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,744
concerning the church health.

700
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:50,616
- What's that all about, Deacon?

701
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,530
-  Yeah.

702
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,183
- I'm missing my program.

703
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,098
I got to know, find out what
happened to Diane Kreeger

704
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,274
and her mistress.

705
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:58,711
- Have you heard of
a DVR, Bessie Jo?

706
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:00,408
- Boy, I don't mess
with that nonsense.

707
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:02,062
You know the man is watching us.

708
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,281
Don't you know that?

709
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,021
- Calm down, I
called this meeting

710
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:08,198
because I have some unfortunate
news from yesterday.

711
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,592
It seems our executive pastor

712
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,945
was taking money from the
church for the past three years.

713
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:19,862
- How much money?

714
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:21,255
- Well how bad is it?

715
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,169
- We're gonna lose the building.

716
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:26,695
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

717
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,349
- We gotta find that
man and string him up.

718
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,872
- That's what I'm talking about.

719
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,614
- Perhaps, maybe someday,
but not right now.

720
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:36,488
Right now, we only have one
week left in this building,

721
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:40,274
a building that we've called
home for the past 88 years.

722
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,232
I've watched most
of you grow up here.

723
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:47,499
That is, unless our own
Grace Hightower can help us.

724
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:48,804
-  All right Grace.

725
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,589
- Oh well, she pretty,
but that's about it.

726
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:53,766
- I'll believe it when I see it.

727
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,029
- Well she's assured
me she has a plan.

728
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:57,465
So let's hear the lady talk.

729
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:58,466
Come on Grace.

730
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,915
- Hello all, hello.

731
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,310
- Praise the Lord.

732
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,573
- I fell asleep reading the
foreclosure papers last night.

733
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:24,274
And while sleeping,
I had a dream

734
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:26,320
that I was there when Jesus fed

735
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,627
the 5,000 people in Matthew 14.

736
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:33,022
And you were all there too.

737
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:33,893
-  Hallelujah.

738
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,330
- Except for Bessie Joe,

739
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,985
she was off somewhere
gambling fish.

740
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,556
- Hallelujah.

741
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,384
-  That's Bessie Joe.

742
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:49,387
- In this dream, a
little boy showed up

743
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,824
with five loaves of
bread and two fish

744
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,958
and everybody laughed
at him and they sneered

745
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,612
and they started
packing up to leave,

746
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,399
but then Jesus showed up.

747
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,406
With his eyes deep

748
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:11,713
with the confidence
of the good shepard.

749
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,456
The apostles, they were scared.

750
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,330
But Jesus was confident.

751
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,942
-  Don't play.

752
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:25,597
- Oh my God, he just
started passing fish.

753
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,295
Fish all around.

754
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:32,212
I was way in the
back in the dream.

755
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,868
The fish was going
to get to me, guys.

756
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:39,567
There were people behind
me, people beside me.

757
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:42,352
I thought they were just gonna
fight to get to the fish,

758
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:44,398
but they didn't have to.

759
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,488
We all got fish,
including you guys.

760
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:52,450
- We all got food
off'a the fish.

761
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,323
And that's when I realized,

762
00:40:57,498 --> 00:41:00,458
our God is an abundant God.

763
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:04,157
He makes a way out of no way.

764
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:11,556
And I believe God
showed me that dream

765
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,732
to represent this church.

766
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:17,562
I believe our miracle is
found in this here document.

767
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,435
- That's right,
what does it say?

768
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,135
- It says that if we can
get this debt paid off

769
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:28,398
before their next meeting,

770
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,444
the church is ours to keep.

771
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,750
- Well how we gonna do that?

772
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,578
- And how much do we
owe, three, $400,000?

773
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:35,101
- 1.2 million.

774
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:36,537
- 1.2 million?

775
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,321
- Oh man, that's
just plain crazy.

776
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,498
- Listen people,

777
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,631
there was nothing that's
impossible for God.

778
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,243
- Okay, okay.

779
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:51,944
- Come on, guys, he turned
two fish into a million.

780
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:55,991
What could he do with
the money in our pockets?

781
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:58,385
- What kind of miracle
are you expecting, Grace?

782
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:01,388
- Here's what I'm proposing,

783
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:04,522
I propose that we
give today, give.

784
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:10,266
- Where your money is, there
the heart will be also.

785
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,574
- Yes, where your money
is, there is your heart.

786
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:16,229
Right now.

787
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,018
Let's give today, everybody,
out of our pockets.

788
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:25,455
Let's make it
happen, let's give.

789
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:46,955
- 99,

790
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:51,438
100, that's $100,000.

791
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:54,484
- Plus $40,000 online.

792
00:42:54,528 --> 00:42:57,531
- That's only 1/10th
of what we owe.

793
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:01,230
- I have an idea.

794
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,538
Have you ever
heard of Air B & B?

795
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,718
We have a missionary
house that we can rent out

796
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:13,503
for say, $200.00 a night.

797
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,770
- Brilliant, excellent
idea, Usher Mike.

798
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:20,902
- That is a good idea, but
I don't think we would make

799
00:43:20,946 --> 00:43:24,297
enough money, maybe
more like $200 an hour.

800
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,954
- Hm, $200.00 an hour,
that's a great idea.

801
00:43:28,997 --> 00:43:30,695
Great idea.

802
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:31,913
- Maybe not.

803
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:42,968
That's for luck.

804
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:44,883
- There's no such thing as luck.

805
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:04,598
- I told you.

806
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:09,429
- Good speech, Gracie.

807
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:10,386
-  It's okay everyone,

808
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,692
we still have a few days left.

809
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:13,259
Keep the faith.

810
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:15,174
There's always the
second chance drawing.

811
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:18,830
- Oh, everyone, everyone listen.

812
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,528
I have an announcement to make.

813
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:24,705
- Oh snap, she about to give
her inheritance to the church.

814
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:25,880
- Shut up, fool.

815
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:28,361
I ain't got no
inheritance, just wisdom.

816
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,799
And I'm so proud of
little Gracie here

817
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:33,627
and I'm proud of all y'all too.

818
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,760
I mean, do you
know, in one hour,

819
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:39,154
we just raised over $100,000.

820
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:40,895
That's impressive.

821
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:44,464
Now the Bible says, when
you really wanna see God,

822
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:46,292
you need to fast and pray.

823
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,773
So I'm asking everybody
that's here today,

824
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:50,557
we all starting a fast tomorrow.

825
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:53,038
Even the deacons.

826
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:55,736
Now I know, I just know

827
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:59,392
that if we trust God on this,

828
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:02,700
he will bless us with the
money to keep the house

829
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:06,442
and if it's not his will
to bless us with the money,

830
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,575
then he'll give us a new house

831
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:11,099
and if not, he's gonna
come with something else.

832
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,452
- Home or no home, we
are still a church.

833
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:17,845
- Amen, sister.

834
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,804
-  Amen.

835
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:24,156
- Amen.

836
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,043
- That was really
great up there, Grace.

837
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:43,697
- Thank you, Sabrina.

838
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,178
- I really just wanna
apologize to you

839
00:45:46,221 --> 00:45:48,876
because I know that I've
been pretty harsh with you.

840
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,314
- You sure have and you
got that right.

841
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:54,360
- You know, I just get
caught up sometimes.

842
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:56,797
- You know what, God is
working on all of us.

843
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:58,103
- He is, he is,

844
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:00,322
but I still think that I will be

845
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,890
the better executive pastor,

846
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:05,719
but lead pastor, you
got me beat by miles.

847
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,895
- I'll take that.

848
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:10,898
- Troy wanted to take you out.

849
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,726
- Hm, well,

850
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,597
if he wants to take
me out this week,

851
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,382
unless he wants to feed
me water and crackers,

852
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:17,644
'cause we're fasting this week.

853
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:18,863
- Oh, oh yeah, that's right.

854
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:20,081
- Yeah.
- That's right,

855
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,735
but I really think he likes you.

856
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,391
- Hm, well you know,
I kinda like him too.

857
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,740
Yeah, it's kinda cool.

858
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,959
- Cool.

859
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:29,787
- Time to go,
ladies, time to go.

860
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,700
- Time to go.

861
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,660
Well good to see you, thank you.

862
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:36,924
Same you, all right.

863
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:45,454
For the fast.

864
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,505
I'll work on it.

865
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:39,378
- What are you doing?

866
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:40,596
Where are the guests?

867
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,163
- Our guests are
still at the airport.

868
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:43,425
- What?

869
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:44,774
- Frank, he's in
there, he's in there!

870
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:46,124
- What?

871
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:46,864
- Hold on, we don't
want him to see you.

872
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:48,126
You're gonna spook him.

873
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:49,040
- You don't think
leaving him in the car

874
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,737
isn't gonna spook him enough?

875
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,607
- He didn't recognize me,
man, he didn't recognize me

876
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:52,739
because of the shades.

877
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:55,960
He just jumped in
my car like I was

878
00:47:56,003 --> 00:47:57,483
some kind of Uber or taxi.

879
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:58,832
- What are we gonna do?

880
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,966
- I don't know, but we
just can't let him go.

881
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,283
- Get this thing off my head.

882
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,024
What's going on?

883
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,373
What's the meaning of this?

884
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:21,463
Listen, listen, I was going
to pay the money back.

885
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:24,249
- When, after your two week
trip to the Dominican Republic?

886
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:27,905
- Maybe.

887
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,310
- Sabrina, come on

888
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,357
Pastor, you're back!

889
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,662
- Good morning, Grace.

890
00:48:46,706 --> 00:48:47,925
- Good morning, when
did you get back?

891
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:48,838
- This morning.

892
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:50,710
- You must be exhausted.

893
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:53,365
- Yes, I heard
about pastor Frank.

894
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:56,542
- Pastor, tomorrow
we lose the church

895
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:59,414
unless we come up with $500,000.

896
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:02,243
- And that's exactly what
I wanna talk to you about.

897
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:21,959
My church.

898
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,047
- Hey.

899
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:26,050
- Good morning, church.

900
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,140
What a beautiful day it is.

901
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:35,015
It goes without saying that
it's been a tumultuous week

902
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,843
and I play a big part in that

903
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:40,934
and I wish to apologize to
you all, first and foremost.

904
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:44,807
As you may or may not know,

905
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:49,073
I'm part of our
denominational missions board

906
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,510
and there was a major
tragedy in Haiti.

907
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:54,687
They needed me as
soon as possible

908
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,341
and still need people.

909
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:58,952
If you feel God's
tug on your heart

910
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,608
to serve our brothers and
sisters in another country,

911
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:06,046
as a result, I was MIA for
the past couple of weeks.

912
00:50:07,656 --> 00:50:09,876
Though I feel those
who stepped up

913
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:15,751
to lead this church in my
absence did a spectacular job,

914
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:18,624
particularly Grace and Sabrina,

915
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,626
I sincerely thank you both,

916
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:25,631
which leads me to my
next announcement.

917
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:29,852
As you know, our executive
pastor, Mr. Frank,

918
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:32,420
quit a few weeks ago and
moved out of the state

919
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,642
and with him, he
took our mortgage

920
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:40,907
that he stole over the
past couple of years,

921
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,866
leaving us unexpectedly
with a massive debt.

922
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:50,656
The litigations will begin
shortly, I assure you,

923
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,007
but that doesn't negate the
issues we face as a church.

924
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,140
How can we keep this building?

925
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:59,404
How can we keep our
home of over 80 years?

926
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:04,626
I understand Miss
Grace Hightower

927
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,282
managed to muster up
about 60% of what we need,

928
00:51:08,326 --> 00:51:10,458
which is an amazing
feat in itself,

929
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,594
but there is still a deficit
and a large one at that,

930
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:17,204
so what do we do?

931
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:21,078
We find ourselves in a
valley, a dark valley

932
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:23,950
and not from our
own doing this time.

933
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:27,823
Someone pushed us, but this
shouldn't be a surprise

934
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:31,044
for God assures us that
this life is filled with

935
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,176
both valleys and peaks.

936
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,700
But what would a peak look like

937
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:36,919
without experiencing the valley?

938
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:40,314
Furthermore, the one
who caused us the fall,

939
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:42,447
what should we say about him?

940
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:45,711
Do we condemn him or forgive?

941
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:49,367
As our Lord, I'm
sure already has.

942
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,151
I would argue that
the first step

943
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:55,112
towards escaping this
valley is forgiveness

944
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:58,289
and so I urge all of
you to find your own way

945
00:51:58,332 --> 00:52:02,641
to let go of this sin and
once we have forgiven again,

946
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:06,645
follow in the footsteps of
the one we claim to follow.

947
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:09,213
Once we have, with his help,

948
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:13,913
moved past the offense, the
next step is to simply look up.

949
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,958
Though it be dark in the valley,

950
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:19,223
the sun will yet rise and
though it will take time

951
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:23,966
for the blessed rays to strive
our darkest faces, they will

952
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:28,406
and when they do, the path of
the darkness will be revealed

953
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:30,321
and we can step forward.

954
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:34,063
I am very happy to stand
here today and say that.

955
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:36,457
Your prayers have been answered.

956
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,807
It seems that while
I was in Haiti,

957
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:41,810
a fellow missionary,
who I have never met,

958
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,203
approached me.

959
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:47,164
He is from a church about
our size in Illinois,

960
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,731
one that has done
great work worldwide

961
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:53,213
and domestically, even
here in Los Angeles.

962
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:55,084
This man approached me and said

963
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:58,566
he felt a tug on his heart
about three months ago

964
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,482
to raise a significant
amount of money

965
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:03,223
for an unknown congregation

966
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,138
somewhere in
Southern California,

967
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:09,229
one he felt was located none
other than the city of Angels

968
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,796
and as it turns out,

969
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,668
this man's church
managed to raise exactly

970
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:17,106
a half million dollars, an
incredible amount of money

971
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,065
for an unknown cause.

972
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:20,458
Am I right?

973
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:23,330
Now before you all start
looking for jobs in Illinois,

974
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:28,335
some of you may know that
despite your valent efforts

975
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:29,684
in fund raising,

976
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:33,775
we are short exactly a
half million dollars,

977
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:38,302
plus a few cents, which is
why it was 100% God's doing

978
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:42,262
when this man approached me
and offered all of the money

979
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:45,657
he had to give to
us, to our church.

980
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:50,052
Hallelujah.

981
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,579

and that's what

00:54:57,772 --> 00:54:59,513
with the blessings of the Lord.

00:54:59,557 --> 00:55:01,733
- Pastor I've got some news!

1010
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:27,367
- Pastor, yes sir,
Pastor, yes sir.

1011
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:28,325
- S'cuse us, Pastor.

1012
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:29,108
Little bit of respect.

1013
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:29,804
- Oh yeah.

1014
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,477

1015
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:52,436
He done got caught.

1016
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:53,785
- God is so good.

1017
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,090
-  Yes, he is.

1018
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:57,266
- Now we need to talk
about that job position.

1019
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,269
- Pastor, Grace has really
been doing a good job

1020
00:56:00,313 --> 00:56:01,183
under pressure.

1021
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:02,315
- I knew she would.

1022
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,273
- Thank you, Sabrina.

1023
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:07,364
Man, Pastor, I have
been drowning in water.

1024
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:09,453
This woman here, was
swimming like a dolphin.

1025
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,237
She is definitely more
qualified than me.

1026
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,413
- You know what, I'm glad
you said that, Grace,

1027
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:15,284
'cause you got the job.

1028
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:19,114
-  Oh my God, Pastor,
thank you, thank you!

1029
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,073
Oh.
- Oh my God.

1030
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:22,466
- And Grace?

1031
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:24,816
I'm creating a new
position for you,

1032
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:26,339
associate pastor.

1033
00:56:27,558 --> 00:56:28,559
- What?
- Yes.

1034
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:29,908
-  Congratulations.

1035
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,648
- Oh my God, what
does that entail?

1036
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:31,431
- Missionary work.

1037
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:35,827
- Is something wrong?

1038
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:42,573
-  God is so good, it's
something that I prayed for

1039
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,532
and I hoped for.

1040
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:46,925
- So is that a yes?

1041
00:56:46,968 --> 00:56:48,709
- Yes, yes!

1042
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:49,797
- Congratulations.

1043
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,146
- Thank you.

1044
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,626
- Actually, I have some
questions about my--

1045
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:55,499
- Okay, all right, all right.

1046
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:09,469
- Congratulations
associate pastor.

1047
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,384

Now you can call me
Reverend Hightower.

-  Is that right?

1050

- Yes, and I will be able
to point out all your sins.

1051
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:23,396
- Hm, well is it a sin for a
pastor to go out on a date?

1052
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,487
- Uh, I guess if she lets him.

1053
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:30,403
- Hm, well let's
go break this fast.
