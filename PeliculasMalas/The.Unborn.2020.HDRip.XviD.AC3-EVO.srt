00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:55,412
Hi, Tiffany?

3
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:56,246
I'm Natalie.

4
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:58,181
I understand this is your first.

5
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,286
Please just lie back and lift
your shirt from your stomach.

6
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,181
There it is.

7
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:33,251
Eight weeks old and already
has a beating heart.

8
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:45,295
Most mothers-to-be like
to record the heartbeat.

9
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:46,632
We can do it on your phone.

10
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,055
Hello?

11
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,826
Boo!

12
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:57,460
Oh fuck!

13
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,997
I got you!

14
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,233
I told you you were the jumpy
type.

15
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:04,400
You're an asshole,
Joey!

16
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:05,903
What, it's funny.

17
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:06,806
It wasn't funny.

18
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,574
I thought it was funny.

19
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,416
I really need to go
now.

20
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,186
She'll be here any
minute.

21
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:23,453
Henry?

22
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:24,454
Hey.

23
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:25,289
I thought you were about to be
late

24
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,893
for the first time in your life.

25
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,399
What's with this tie?

26
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,568
The demolition crew bought it
for me.

27
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,404
As a joke?

28
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,604
What, you think?

29
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:42,873
Yeah.

30
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,176
Like your stupid ringtone.

31
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,447
Ah, so you love them after all.

32
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,616
Love is a pretty
strong word,

33
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:55,254
but I like to make you happy,
so.

34
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:59,292
Hey, I'm gonna start my
patrol.

35
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,027
Okay.

36
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,029
Oh.

37
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:06,931
Sorry.

38
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,431
Uh, Mick's waiting for you.

39
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,937
He's kinda itching to leave.

40
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,739
I'll be there in a minute.

41
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:19,643
Listen, um...

42
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:20,746
Hey, Tiffany.

43
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,479
Hey, Carl.

44
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:24,848
How is Maggie?

45
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,919
Took her first steps
yesterday.

46
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,387
Only nine months old.

47
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,156
Can you believe that?

48
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,059
She's beautiful.

49
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,728
Well.

50
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,096
I'll be back with the demolition
team

51
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,866
at four am for the final checks.

52
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,337
Have a good last night guarding
this dump.

53
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,237
His daughter is so cute.

54
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,341
He really adores her.

55
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,409
Better him than me.

56
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:56,914
You okay?

57
00:05:57,883 --> 00:05:59,952
I will see you tomorrow.

58
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:06,724
I'm taking my mom to bingo.

59
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:07,660
I need to go.

60
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:10,461
Do you hear me?

61
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:11,596
The dead heard you.

62
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:18,371
Fuck.

63
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,886
Hello?

64
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:39,992
Anybody there?

65
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,633
I thought you were in a hurry.

66
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,635
I need to make sure
I packed all my stuff.

67
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:55,406
Joey to control, level
20 ready to be demolished.

68
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:56,509
Copy that.

69
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:43,554
Joey to control, level
19 secure

70
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:45,091
and ready for demolition.

71
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,726
Are you checking
everything properly, Joey?

72
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:50,563
Yes.

73
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:53,330
Lying little shit.

74
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:54,765
You're moving too fast.

75
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,834
Ensure everything has been
checked.

76
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,969
Every door needs to be checked.

77
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:01,972
Every corner needs a light shone
into it.

78
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,208
You dropped the ball this week.

79
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,042
It was one guy.

80
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,944
In a secured location.

81
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:07,780
Do it right.

82
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:31,835
Joey to control.

83
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:35,405
You should see the level 19
west stairwell door and alarm.

84
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:38,008
The sensor's broken,
but the door's secure.

85
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,844
Copy.

86
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:36,969
Welcome to your tour
of the old dead building.

87
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:41,305
I'll be your tour guide, Joey
Rambosa.

88
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:42,773
- Now...
- Joey!

89
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:47,044
And right here and we
have a real human turd.

90
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:49,813
I know I can't say turd on the
radio,

91
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:53,850
but on the private tour we
can get all the fun facts...

92
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:54,885
All right, Joey, knock it off.

93
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:59,489
So, this beauty here, she is
34 days old

94
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:00,724
though we don't know
much else about her

95
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,125
or who created her

96
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:05,262
but that's how
exciting my job is.

97
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,864
Can literally measure it in
shit.

98
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,967
Joey, that's enough.

99
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:14,004
Tune in next week when
we play my favorite game.

100
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:16,440
Guess That Smear!

101
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:18,510
So dumb.

102
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:22,716
Level 18 ready to be
blown up.

103
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,384
Okay.

104
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:53,036
Joey to control.

105
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:55,172
Level 17 secure, door seal
intact.

106
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,451
You copy, Tiff?

107
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:08,287
Oh shit.

108
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:11,090
Yes, copy.

110

115
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:43,875
Hey, hey, this is
Henry.

116
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,544
You know what to do.

117
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:11,468
Are you studying your
security course right now?

118
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,103
Yes.

119
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,306
What are you studying?

120
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:19,944
How to secure a room that
has multiple entry points.

121
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:22,414
Ah, using only
a toothpick and a condom?

122
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,719
Hey, Joey, we have an
alarm on level 13.

123
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,553
Moving.

124
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,692
It's an east tenancy door.

125
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:35,993
No other alarms.

126
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:37,296
Stairwells reading secure.

127
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,967
I'm here, going mobile.

128
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,604
Unlock east stairwell door,
please.

129
00:15:58,617 --> 00:15:59,953
The security seal's broken.

130
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:04,657
Door hardware seems to be
intact.

131
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:09,896
It could just be water
compromised the seal.

132
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,433
Am I authorized to enter?

133
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,069
We are authorized.

134
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:19,369
Enter with caution.

135
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:22,539
Every brief in
this dump ends with caution.

136
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,076
Shaking with caution.

137
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,978
No alarm on the shaking.

138
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,279
Okay, will shake the
door now

139
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,347
and not just my booty.

140
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:31,181
All right, be alert.

141
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:32,650
Stop the clowning.

142
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:36,087
Door's an alarm.

143
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,556
Door remains secure.

144
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:45,464
Entering.

145
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:44,487
Have you found
anything?

146
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:47,592
Something to do with
babies.

147
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,497
Photos and stuff of birth
announcements.

148
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,301
Are you saying the
tenancy hasn't been cleared?

149
00:17:58,303 --> 00:17:59,939
Yeah, I guess.

150
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,475
Take photos of
everything and send it to me.

151
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:12,275
Joey!

152
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,346
Joey, is everything okay?

153
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:17,817
Yeah, uh.

154
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:24,755
The babies.

155
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:25,756
What babies?

156
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:26,824
Where?

157
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:28,558
In the jar.

158
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,060
Babies.

159
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:32,098
One of them has a belly cord.

160
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:33,866
Fuck!

161
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:40,773
Do you see them?

162
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:43,974
Yeah.

163
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,179
What does it say on that label?

164
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:48,444
The thing is really old,

165
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:50,049
I can't make out the first part.

166
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,716
Thatcher it says in the middle.

167
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:55,054
The rest is faded and
unreadable.

168
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:02,293
This is fucking disturbing,
Tiff.

169
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:03,729
This is a colossal fuck up.

170
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:06,329
They can't just demolish the
building

171
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,098
with two dead babies in it.

172
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,099
Ya think?

173
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,202
How could
they have missed this?

174
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:12,069
This?

175
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:13,637
They put a damn security seal on
the door

176
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,206
saying that the room was
cleared.

177
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,473
I mean, that's a downright lie.

178
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,844
How many other tenancies
haven't been cleared?

179
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:22,114
I don't know, but somebody's
getting their ass kicked.

180
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,052
Yeah, well, you know who
that'll be.

181
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:29,387
What?

182
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:31,356
What do you know?

183
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,024
Forget it.

184
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,592
What do you know?

185
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:38,494
Henry signed off on it,
it's his responsibility.

186
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:40,199
Get him down here
to deal with it.

187
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,334
Oh, oh, don't get angry at me.

188
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:45,636
We can't cross doors with
intact security seals on it,

189
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:46,739
those are the rules.

190
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:54,881
Right.

191
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:57,513
Said the wrong thing.

192
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:59,151
You took
photographs, right?

193
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:03,654
Yes.

194
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:05,992
Send them to me.

195
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:09,962
File sent.

196
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,134
Continue with the
patrol.

197
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:18,202
Right after the seven shots of
tequila

198
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:19,504
I need to calm down.

199
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:30,615
Oh, God, Jesus.

200
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:43,787
Hey, hey, this is
Henry.

201
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:44,922
You know what to do.

202
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:47,291
Hey, Henry, call me back
immediately.

203
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:50,094
We discovered a tenancy
that hasn't been cleared.

204
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:53,232
Due to the nature of it I
need to call the police.

205
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:09,913
Metro Police
non-emergency,

206
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:11,181
how can I help you?

207
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:22,726
Ma'am, you can call 911 if it's
urgent.

208
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:24,361
No, it's not an emergency.

209
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:26,030
We will send
officers in the morning.

210
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:26,930
I understand.

211
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:28,065
Okay.

212
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:30,069
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

213
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:34,306
You scared the shit outta me!

214
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:38,509
I found this in the room.

215
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:39,712
And this was outside.

216
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:43,981
You're not supposed to
take items out of that room.

217
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:45,615
Look at the drawings in it.

218
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:46,584
It's insane.

219
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,028
Did you call Henry?

220
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:00,531
I called the police, I made
them aware of the situation.

221
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:01,365
They'll be here in the morning.

222
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,567
It's not an emergency.

223
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:06,637
That couldn't of been easy.

224
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:07,840
It's called procedure.

225
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:11,508
Now follow procedure and
get your ass back out there

226
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,644
because there are floors
that haven't been checked.

227
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:16,947
Yep, and each one of them has
signs

228
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:18,982
warning of impending death.

229
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:20,517
"Do Not Enter."

230
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,584
"Demolition Area."

231
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:25,621
"Explosives, you will
fucking die if you enter."

232
00:24:25,623 --> 00:24:27,191
I mean, seriously, fuck anyone
who doesn't

233
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:28,527
pay attention to them.

234
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:30,794
Our standing orders state that
a patrol

235
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:32,064
may not be broken.

236
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,732
I just saw dead babies in a
jar.

237
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,203
Fuck our standing orders.

238
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:00,726
Hey!

239
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:05,898
What is it?

240
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:21,013
What'd you see?

241
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:24,917
Don't leave the control room
unstaffed.

242
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:37,196
Who are you?

243
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,666
This is a restricted area.

244
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:45,804
The building is dangerous,
you must leave immediately.

245
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:52,978
There's someone here.

246
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:12,598
Get in.

247
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:15,999
What'd you see?

248
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:16,833
I don't know.

249
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:17,870
A man I think.

250
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:20,237
You saw him in the dark?

251
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,373
I know how it sounds.

252
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,808
There was someone in the
darkness

253
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,512
and we have to go find him.

254
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:32,382
21%.

255
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,252
If we use the lights we
lose the security cameras.

256
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:36,688
What asshole designed this
thing?

257
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,422
The lowest bidder.

258
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,324
How long until enough charge
builds up?

259
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:41,760
An hour, probably more.

260
00:26:42,662 --> 00:26:44,261
It's a lot of darkness for me
to search

261
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:45,495
with a flashlight.

262
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:48,732
Not to mention the guy
running around in the shadows.

263
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:49,568
I know.

264
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:53,103
You're sure you saw this guy?

265
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:53,939
I saw him.

266
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:57,610
Shit.

267
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:10,589
Wow.

268
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:17,995
Why would you want children with
him?

269
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:20,399
This isn't any of your
damn business, okay?

270
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,134
East alarm again.

271
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:25,569
I checked it
and I locked it again...

272
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:28,572
I'll deal with it.

273
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,833
Alarms have ceased.

274
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:59,403
If there's someone there
they're still on that floor.

275
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:01,138
Stairwells remain secure.

276
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,273
Proceed with caution, I
get it.

277
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:04,778
Proceed with weapons drawn.

278
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:33,305
Door is secure and locked.

279
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:50,889
Hello?

280
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,658
Hi, this is Michael's
mother.

281
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,126
He was supposed to pick me up
awhile ago.

282
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:57,563
Are you keeping him late?

283
00:28:58,897 --> 00:29:00,530
Mick left on time, Glenda.

284
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:01,965
I'm sure he'll be there.

285
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:04,101
Oh, okay.

286
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:04,937
Bye.

287
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,353
Hello?

288
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:30,195
Can you hear that?

289
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:35,198
Where are they?

290
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,801
I don't know.

291
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:37,869
I can't find them.

292
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:40,874
It sounds like they're in the
walls.

293
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,676
Kids?

294
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:47,146
It isn't safe to be here.

295
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:35,427
Joey?

296
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:38,665
Something is...

297
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,335
He's in the basement stairwell.

298
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:46,271
On my way.

299
00:30:57,684 --> 00:30:58,852
Somebody's down here.

300
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:01,788
I'm seconds away.

301
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:11,127
Be careful.

302
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:12,030
Drag your sidearm.

303
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:21,406
Yes, he's in there.

304
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:56,475
Joey!

305
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:58,945
Fucking hell, Tiff.

306
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:03,748
What is it?

307
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,317
Is everything okay?

308
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:08,220
I'm all good.

309
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:10,657
I'll make it back to you.

310
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:08,280
That's weird.

311
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:27,698
You were right, someone's down
here.

312
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,332
I see their footprints.

313
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:31,336
It's like they appeared out of
thin air.

314
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:56,727
No one's
come through that door.

315
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:57,594
They have a way of
moving through

316
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:00,733
the building that we don't know
about.

317
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:02,599
Hey, Joey.

318
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,070
Level 13 is in alarm again.

319
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:08,107
We still need to investigate.

320
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,881
Fuck it, I know.

321
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,389
Fuel level on the generator's
low.

322
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,161
I'll fill
it when you get back.

323
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:45,308
Elevator stopped, what's going
on?

324
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,379
I don't know.

325
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,353
What the fuck was that?

326
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:58,189
What?

327
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,255
What did you see?

328
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:00,525
I don't know.

329
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:05,665
An animal or...

330
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:09,301
Stay alert down there.

331
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:11,936
I do not get paid enough
for this bullshit.

332
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:13,236
I heard that.

333
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:14,306
You were meant to.

334
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:05,990
The elevator's not here.

335
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:07,126
Check your six!

336
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:55,540
Uh.

337
00:37:10,957 --> 00:37:11,856
What happened?

338
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,624
I got spiked!

339
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:15,025
By what?

340
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:17,562
Fuck this place,
where are fucking police!

341
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,537
What are you doing?

342
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:28,440
It isn't me.

343
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:30,877
Help me!

344
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,392
Open the door!

345
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,562
Open the fucking door!

346
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:53,596
Jesus.

347
00:37:53,598 --> 00:37:54,667
They're not people.

348
00:37:55,668 --> 00:37:56,667
What are you talking about?

349
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:57,500
I saw 'em.

350
00:37:57,502 --> 00:37:58,335
I saw 'em, look at these photos.

351
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:00,204
You're not supposed to
remove...

352
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:01,338
Just shut up and look at them.

353
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,174
What do you see?

354
00:38:11,717 --> 00:38:12,950
Oh my god.

355
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:14,519
They're the same kids.

356
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,222
The can't be, they're decades
apart.

357
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:19,690
I saw them.

358
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:20,523
Those kids.

359
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:22,061
They chased me to the elevator.

360
00:38:23,362 --> 00:38:24,328
These children?

361
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,629
Yes, these children and the
others too.

362
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:27,264
They're not fucking human.

363
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,135
They're not fucking human.

364
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:31,270
Joey, show me.

365
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:41,378
What the hell is that?

366
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,880
Is that bone?

367
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:43,948
Get it out.

368
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,550
Just pull the fucking thing out!

369
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,089
This needs a doctor.

370
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:54,224
It's moving into me.

371
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:56,459
It's burrowing into me.

372
00:39:05,204 --> 00:39:06,305
They're singing again.

373
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,144
We have to get you out of here.

374
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:15,848
I'll protect you, I promise.

375
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,150
Saddle up.

376
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:21,617
Are you fucking insane?

377
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:22,686
We need to be able to see
them.

378
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:25,289
That was all the power we had
left.

379
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:31,097
What the fuck, Joey?

380
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:33,799
Is that Mick?

381
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:37,103
Why is he screaming?

382
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:39,970
Why is he screaming?

383
00:39:39,972 --> 00:39:42,308
I didn't see him.

384
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:46,944
No, no, no, come
back!

385
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:49,382
Get your ass back here, Joey!

386
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:56,353
Mick!

387
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:14,340
Mick!

388
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:07,960
Mick, where you at?

389
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:21,972
This is Mick.

390
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:24,477
Please leave a brief
message after the tone.

391
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:54,634
What did you do to
her?

392
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,367
Mick?

393
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:32,538
Kill me.

394
00:44:05,037 --> 00:44:06,205
Tiff!

395
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:12,378
Kill me.

396
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:20,417
Kill me.

397
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:23,322
Kill.

398
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:47,244
Move, move!

399
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:48,078
Kids!

400
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,945
They're not fucking kids.

401
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:49,783
Run!

402
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:56,656
Inhaler.

403
00:45:01,427 --> 00:45:02,594
You're okay.

404
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:06,865
You saved me.

405
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,866
You need to control your
breathing.

406
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:15,439
You're gonna be a great
mother.

407
00:45:19,478 --> 00:45:20,579
They're gonna kill us.

408
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:23,748
Where's Mick?

409
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,981
Did you find Mick?

410
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:25,819
Yeah.

411
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:28,786
He's dead.

412
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:31,855
No, please don't.

413
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:32,690
- Please don't go.
- Let me go.

414
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:34,625
I tried, I tried, I tried.

415
00:45:34,627 --> 00:45:35,992
He was screaming for me to kill
him.

416
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,628
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean
to!

417
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:38,663
No!

418
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,576
Mick.

419
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:27,571
There's no body.

420
00:47:27,573 --> 00:47:28,407
What?

421
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:30,974
I fucking shot him.

422
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:33,045
He didn't just get up and walk
away.

423
00:47:33,947 --> 00:47:35,746
We need the police here.

424
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:37,915
We need to get outta
here.

425
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,454
Hi, this is Tiff with 115, I...

426
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,873
They're gonna drag us to hell.

427
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:02,508
We run.

428
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:19,291
No.

429
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:29,634
It's growing.

430
00:48:29,636 --> 00:48:30,536
What is it?

431
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:33,603
Get it out!

432
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:34,437
Pull it out!

433
00:48:34,439 --> 00:48:35,474
Get it out now!

434
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:38,310
Get it out!

435
00:48:39,979 --> 00:48:41,444
- Stop!
- God!

436
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:42,947
Oh, pull harder!

437
00:48:53,091 --> 00:48:53,925
It's moving.

438
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:00,564
We're leaving.

439
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:01,398
Get up.

440
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:04,469
No.

441
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,842
- Stop!
- What's happening?

442
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:12,542
The building's going into
lockdown.

443
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:13,378
It'll trap us.

444
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:19,752
We need to run while
I'm still of use to you.

445
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:23,688
We need to get outta here.

446
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,956
You're not just saving yourself
anymore.

447
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,558
They control the building now.

448
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:29,392
We survive by digging in.

449
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:30,861
We're armed and we're
sheltered...

450
00:49:30,863 --> 00:49:33,229
We're armed against
ghosts that can't be killed.

451
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:34,832
We are burrowing like ticks
until Carl

452
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,566
and the demolition team
arrive in the morning, okay?

453
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:38,537
Just let me get you out!

454
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:42,840
Fuck you!

455
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:51,682
I'll lead them away.

456
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,550
You make a run for it.

457
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:54,384
No, no!

458
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:55,853
No, no, Joey, no!

459
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:07,832
We need help!

460
00:50:13,673 --> 00:50:15,340
What is it you want?

461
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,765
Joey.

462
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:44,202
I can't get out.

463
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,371
The door won't open.

464
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:49,676
Can you force it?

465
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:04,287
It hurts so bad.

466
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:05,490
What floor are you on?

467
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:10,930
I don't know.

468
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,466
Please try pushing the
basement button.

469
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:17,302
Please.

470
00:51:23,275 --> 00:51:24,110
Joey.

471
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:30,650
I love you, Tiff.

472
00:51:33,452 --> 00:51:35,154
I wish I would've told you
sooner.

473
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:43,295
Hindsight is life's shittiest
teacher.

474
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:09,987
Joey!

475
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:11,456
Can you see anything outside?

476
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:17,596
Joey, it's opening!

477
00:52:18,563 --> 00:52:20,731
Move, run!

478
00:52:34,046 --> 00:52:34,945
Joey, stop!

479
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:35,782
Don't do it!

480
00:52:45,524 --> 00:52:47,057
My god.

481
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:48,324
Joey!

482
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,231
What are you doing?

483
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:56,702
Joey, no!

484
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,670
Joey, please!

485
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:01,007
Joey, oh my god!

486
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:20,660
I can't breathe.

487
00:53:25,064 --> 00:53:27,198
Tell me where you are!

488
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,209
It's him!

489
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:39,310
Joey, run!

490
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:50,587
What floor, Joey?

491
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:52,524
God damn it, what fucking floor?

492
00:53:55,862 --> 00:53:56,760
Shit.

493
00:53:59,564 --> 00:54:00,666
No, okay, um.

494
00:54:17,116 --> 00:54:17,950
Do it.

495
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:32,425
I can see you, you fucker!

496
00:55:34,894 --> 00:55:37,595
If I can see you, I can kill
you.

497
00:56:29,915 --> 00:56:30,750
Joey.

498
00:56:33,786 --> 00:56:34,718
Joey, say something.

499
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,553
Where are you?

500
00:56:36,956 --> 00:56:38,391
Tell me what floor you're on!

501
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:41,394
What is that?

502
00:56:48,467 --> 00:56:49,301
Henry?

503
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:51,569
Is that you?

504
00:57:15,494 --> 00:57:17,061
What do you want?

505
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:18,164
Four!

506
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:23,400
Oh no.

507
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,369
Three!

508
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:28,105
It's not religious people.

509
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:29,075
Two!

510
00:57:30,876 --> 00:57:32,176
Fuck you!

511
00:57:32,178 --> 00:57:33,310
One!

512
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,294
Joey.

513
00:57:49,962 --> 00:57:51,594
Where are you?

514
00:58:06,512 --> 00:58:07,346
13.

515
00:59:10,743 --> 00:59:12,178
Oh my god, Henry?

516
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:15,080
What happened to you?

517
00:59:44,009 --> 00:59:44,843
Joey!

518
00:59:45,744 --> 00:59:46,579
Joey.

519
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,124
Joey.

520
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:11,136
Run.

521
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:14,340
This is what you wanted.

522
01:00:15,241 --> 01:00:16,240
Run.

523
01:00:38,197 --> 01:00:40,430
Let me go, you fucker.

524
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:41,699
Let me go!

525
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:55,814
Six.

526
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,652
Don't you fucking touch me.

527
01:01:16,402 --> 01:01:18,738
You shall bring them back.

528
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,006
Oh my god!

529
01:03:07,847 --> 01:03:09,948
Don't you fucking come near me.

530
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:14,953
Afraid of the light?

531
01:03:31,003 --> 01:03:31,838
You want this?

532
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:33,740
Go get it.

533
01:04:04,503 --> 01:04:06,405
Everything seems fine.

534
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,911
You can put all of this behind
you now.

535
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:16,181
Now what is this here?

536
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:21,487
Excuse me one moment.

537
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:14,905
