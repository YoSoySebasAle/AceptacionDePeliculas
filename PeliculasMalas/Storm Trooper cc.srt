Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,049
That's ridin' music.

Yeah, well, don't

Just give me the green light,

Just take him down

Well, sure, why not?

223
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,912
Everything else around
here is ass backwards.

McCleary can head him
off at Orchard road.

This is the last time I send
two women to do a man's job.

Enough of your jerking around.

245

Find him and eliminate him now.

It's up to you now.
MCCLEARY: 10-4 base.

But I want a damn big
bonus when I do it.

Aw, shit.

OK, baby You gotta--

372
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,749
That was a good one.

373
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:10,683
Oh, shit.

374
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,457
Uh, OK.

375
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,092
All right, ready?

376
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,094
1, 2, 3.

377
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,599
OK.

378
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:32,539
Ugh.

379
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:44,050
OK, here we go.

380
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,452
I guess not.

381
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:48,154
Oh my God.

382
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,155
Come on, Randal.

383
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,256
Give me a little hand here.

384
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:51,157
Ugh.

385
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,179
What a mess.

Oh, Rocky.

398
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:45,705
What have you done?

[dog barking]

400
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,274
Come on.

Rocky!
Oh, god.

408
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,629
Rocky, stop it!
Stop it!

409
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,198
Come on!
Come here.

410
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,199
Oh, god.

411
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,167
Yuck.

412
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,135
Rocky, easy.

413
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,536
Now, easy.

414
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,505
Now, damn it.

415
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,340
Easy, I said.

416
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,942
Come on.

417
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:26,212
Now, stay in here and behave.

418
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:30,182
[dog barking]

419
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,090
I have a gun.

420
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,667
Twitch, and I will shoot.

421
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,039
Shit.

422
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:12,091
[inaudible] He's still alive.

423
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,025
Can you hear me?

424
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,732
You just come just to the
wrong place at the wrong time.

425
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,116
What am I thinking?

426
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,089
I must be losing--

427
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,871
OK, calm down.

428
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,073
Think, I gotta think.

429
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,074
OK, so think.

430
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,258
Now, stay there.

431
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,870
GENERAL BECKETT: I
want the whole mess

432
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,238
cleared up before sunrise.

433
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,910
I think it's time you
put a call in to Denton.

434
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,911
You can't be serious.

435
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:39,846
Face it, Kreigal.

436
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,480
You failed.

437
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,815
You're failing loudly now.

438
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:45,117
And it's getting
louder each minute.

439
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,286
Denton and his boys
can stop the bleeding.

440
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,120
Denton's a lunatic.

441
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,688
He'll destroy the countryside.

442
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,123
As long as he
gets the job done.

443
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,159
Why can't we use a
platoon of your men?

444
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,961
That way we'll be covered
in case this thing

445
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:56,195
goes south on us.

446
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,664
Are you completely
out of your mind?

447
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,232
I'm not even here, son.

448
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,901
This is you we're
trying to save.

449
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,803
It's Denton or your ass.

450
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,575
Denton it is.

451
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,510
Good thinking.

452
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,782
[screaming]

453
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:19,251
DENTON: You don't look
too good, my friend.

454
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,553
Not good at all.

455
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:26,492
But this is just simple problem,
requires a simple answer.

456
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:31,063
Tell me where the chip
is, and I will let you go.

457
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,564
I don't have the chip.

458
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,100
[screaming]

459
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,201
DENTON: All right, break.

460
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,440
Captain Kozinski, now my
team went to a lot of trouble

461
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,875
to get you out.

462
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,911
Now, I know that
you have that chip

463
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,478
hidden somewhere on your body.

464
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,016
Now, I don't want to have
to take you apart to get it.

465
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,418
But I am a soldier.

466
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,253
And I will if I have to.

467
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,255
[spitting]

468
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,990
KOZINSKI: You're
no soldier, Denton.

469
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,926
You're a filthy mercenary.

470
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,560
You have no loyalties.

471
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,295
I will not betray my people.

472
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:09,201
[screaming]

473
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:14,840
Captain Kozinski,
for the last time,

474
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:17,977
I don't particularly
like this kind of thing.

475
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,278
But now Lieutenant
Michaels here,

476
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:24,550
well, he's an artist
at loosening tongues.

477
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,520
And he prefers to work
slowly and deliberately.

478
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:35,161
Now, unless you tell
me what I want to know,

479
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,397
I'm going to turn
you over to him.

480
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,331
What's it going to be?

481
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,902
Go to hell.

482
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,511
Pull his head back.

483
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:04,490
[screaming]

484
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,293
MICHAELS: Sir, I think
I found something.

485
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,660
[screaming]

486
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,103
Well, I'll be damned.

487
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:20,406
I haven't seen anything like
this since the Cold War ended.

488
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,508
Now, see I told you it would
have been easier my way.

489
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,079
Wouldn't it have just
been easier to tell me

490
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,048
what I wanted to know?

491
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,316
[phone ringing]

492
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,050
Restrain him.

493
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,351
I need quiet.

494
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:36,522
[groaning]

495
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,789
Yeah?

496
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,957
KREIGAL ON PHONE:
Denton, this is Kreigal.

497
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,126
I got a runner.
Can you pick him up?

498
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:41,493
If the price is right.

499
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,665
KREIGAL ON PHONE: I want
it done immediately.

500
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,067
Sounds expensive.

501
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,235
Why don't you fax
me the details?

502
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:50,869
I'll decode it in the car.

503
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,838
KREIGAL ON PHONE: How
soon can you be here?

504
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:57,443
[groaning]

505
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:00,112
Well, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

506
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,314
I can scramble the team
and see you in an hour.

507
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,715
KREIGAL ON PHONE: Just hurry.

508
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,752
Kreigal, I detect a
little panic in your voice.

509
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,890
We broke him.

510
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,460
Mitchell, I did
not want him killed.

511
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,894
I'm sorry.

512
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,529
We'll discuss it later.

513
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,433
Right now, we've got
to call in the dogs.

514
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:27,406
[dog barking]

515
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,674
Rocky, quiet!

516
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,520
It'll just have to do.

517
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,703
Jeez, Randal, you're a mess.

518
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,475
I'm not doing too good either.

519
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,292
Now, don't look.

520
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,941
You know, Randal, you
look kind of depressed.

521
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:39,545
I only did it for you.

522
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:43,715
The problem is what am
I going to do with you?

523
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:51,056
You know, this is nice.

524
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:54,626
We haven't showered
together for years.

525
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,628

00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,168
[groaning]

527
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,449
Help me.

528
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,460
Look, I don't know what
kind of trouble you're in.

529
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,732
I don't want any.

530
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:38,637
Please, help me.

531
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:39,571
Just don't move.

532
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:46,412
What are you, drunk?

533
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,483
I'm hurt I think.

534
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,392
Well, let's just take a look.

535
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,060
OK.

536
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,330
Try to get up.

537
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,032
You try anything,
and I will kill you.

538
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:07,933
OK.

539
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:08,867
Ooo.

540
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,475
[dog whimpering]

541
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,410
I brought you some old clothes.

542
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,178
I think they should fit.

543
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:26,084
I'm going to, uh, clean you off
a little bit, see how bad off

544
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,219
you really are.

545
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:37,162
I'm not going to hurt
you unless, of course,

546
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,697
you try something.

547
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:45,637
OK?

548
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,382
Jeez, you must spend
your life in the gym.

549
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,255
I'm gonna touch your face, OK?

550
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,434
It looks worse than it is.

551
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:16,735
Underneath all
this mud and dirt,

552
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:21,407
you don't look too bad
at all, not at all.

553
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:27,746
OK.

554
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:28,980
I guess that's enough.

555
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,049
I'll be right back.

556
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,618
Don't you move.

557
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:50,035
You're not going to
believe this, Randal.

558
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:53,339
But I met a new man.

559
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:56,375
I hope you don't think
that it's too soon.

560
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:57,976
Because I warned you.

561
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:02,548
Believe me, I did.

562
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,745
Well, you've really caught
your dick in the wringer

563
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,213
this time, Kreigal.

564
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,948
I don't need any
lectures from you, Denton.

565
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,384
Just do your job.

566
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,185
Don't worry about it.

567
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,820
I'll put your boy in a box.

568
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,123
He's already killed a
dozen men by now, maybe more.

569
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:46,392
Yeah.

570
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,226
Well those were your men.

571
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,327
These are mine.

572
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,104
[dog whimpering]

573
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:09,247
[thunder]

574
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,181
What are you doing?

575
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,349
I told you not to move.

576
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,451
I'm sorry.

577
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,156
I was trying to remember.

578
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,925
Remember what?

579
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,960
Anything.

580
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,031
Oh, give me a break.

581
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,933
What is your name?

582
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:28,867
I don't know.

583
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,101
[thunder]

584
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,271
Oh, you are good.

585
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,806
You know, your name?

586
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:35,641
What is your name?

587
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,008
Like, some people call me Grace.

588
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,411
What do they call you?

589
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,346
I don't know.

590
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:43,949
Your shirt had
a name tag on it.

591
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,217
Convenient, huh?

592
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,821
Stark, is that your name?

593
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:50,956
I suppose it is.

594
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,624
You know, you came in
here armed to the teeth.

595
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,326
What are you some kind of
survivalist or something?

596
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,395
I don't know.

597
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:58,964
I suppose if you
were, you probably

598
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,732
wouldn't tell me anyway.

599
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,367
Maybe you do have
some kind of amnesia,

600
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,670
or maybe this is just
a really great act

601
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,171
that I am not falling for.

602
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:10,676
I don't know.

603
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:11,943
Well, I know you don't know!

604
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,411
You keep saying you don't know.
I get it!

605
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:16,247
I get it already!
You not know!

606
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,248
Are you angry?

607
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,184
Are you kidding?

608
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:20,318
I don't even know you are.

609
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,687
And frankly, I
don't really care.

610
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,154
But you come into my
house in the middle

611
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,892
of the night-- in the
middle of the wrong night.

612
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:27,793
What do you mean?

613
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:31,930
Never mind.

614
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,167
You don't have any shoes.

615
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,102
Shoes?

616
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,807
Do you want some shoes?

617
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:42,741
Yes.

618
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,213
Don't move.

619
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:49,114
Do you understand?

620
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,415
I mean it.

621
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:51,550
Yes.

622
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,824
[thunder]

623
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:05,964
Kreigal still has men in the
field continuing their search.

624
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,735
So let's try not to
tag the wrong man.

625
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,403
This is a high priority mission.

626
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:15,173
Local authorities have
not been notified.

627
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,509
But if they become a problem,
you've got my full permission

628
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,677
to go code seven.

629
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,751
You have a problem, soldier?

630
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:29,420
Sir, permission to speak, sir.

631
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,222
By all means.

632
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,960
Permission to
speak freely, sir.

633
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,394
Understood.

634
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,829
Sir, I did not
join this operation

635
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,497
to kill innocent civilians.

636
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:47,806
Well, Corporal Roth, your
objection is duly noted.

637
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:48,807
[thwack]

638
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:50,175
[groaning]

639
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:57,082
Now, let's have a little
understanding here.

640
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,717
This is my mission.

641
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,820
And when you work for
me, you do things my way,

642
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,789
or I'll carry your ass
out of here in a body bag.

643
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,660
What's it good to be, Corporal?

644
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,932
I think we can work
together on this, sir.

645
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:20,371
Well, there you have
it, boys and girls.

646
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,640
Anybody else got a problem?

647
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,945
Good.

648
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:27,879
Let's move out.

649
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,622
[thunder]

650
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,458
Good.

651
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,593
Perfect fit.

652
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,494
Just about my husband's size.

653
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:45,496
Where is your husband?

654
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,398
He's around.

655
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,667
Who is this?

656
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,301
Give me that.

657
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,402
I made you angry again.

658
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,139
That was my son.

659
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,240
He's dead.

660
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,642
Got it?

661
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,376
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:58,476 --> 00:42:59,911
I didn't mean anything by it.

663
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,546
Yeah, well, that's exactly
what the kid who shot Kenny

664
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:02,814
said.

665
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,884
He didn't mean anything by it.

666
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:08,754
He meant to shoot somebody else,
and Kenny just got in the way.

667
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,998
My son was only eight years old.

668
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,933
Eight years old.

669
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,936
That boy will be
punished for his crime.

670
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:28,740
That boy will be out
of jail in five years.

671
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,342
That's justice for you.

672
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,911
Justice?

673
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,513
What's a person supposed to
do when their reason for living

674
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,148
has been taken away from them?

675
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,190
You survive.

676
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,558
How do you do that?

677
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:48,660
Can you tell me?

678
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:57,602
Listen, I'm really sorry
that you caught me this way.

679
00:43:57,703 --> 00:44:00,672
But I can't help you any
more than you can help me.

680
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:01,907
I don't think you understand.

681
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:04,342
No, I don't think
that you understand.

682
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,912
Just go.

683
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:08,646
Pretend that we never met.

684
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:11,983
Your life is in danger,
and I want to protect you.

685
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,985
Well, that's really all
fine and good, you know?

686
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,687
But I don't think that
there's anything that you

687
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:16,788
can do that can help me.

688
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,558
What is that?

689
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,260
What is?

690
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:34,139
[gun shots]

691
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,175
[dog barking]

692
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:37,876
[screaming]

693
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,078
Keep your head down!

694
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:44,015
[gun shots]

695
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:56,694
What was that?

696
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:58,129
Grace, Grace, listen to me.

697
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,064
Yeah.

698
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,531
They're here.

699
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,100
Mm-mm.

700
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,369
I want you to get you gun,
and crawl over behind the chair.

701
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:05,603
My gun.

702
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,905
I [inaudible] by the window.
- OK, OK.

703
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:08,039
I'll get it.
- OK.

704
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:08,974
On go.

705
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:10,608
When I say go, we go.
- OK, OK.

706
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,043
- Ready?
- Uh, yeah.

707
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:12,944
Go.

708
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,782
[screaming]

709
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,016
Oh!

710
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:22,087
[thwack]

711
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,488
[gun shot]

712
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:29,427
[groaning]

713
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,029
[bones breaking]

714
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:40,371
[dog growling]

715
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,774
[gun shot]

716
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:43,741
[gun shot]

717
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:52,717
[groaning]

718
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,652
Grace?

719
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,787
You all right?

720
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,026
[thunder]

721
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,033
It's-- it's OK.

722
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:10,268
I think it's over for now.

723
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,202
What's over?

724
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,303
What happened?

725
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,972
I'm not sure.

726
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,841
But I think there's
going to be more of them.

727
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:24,950
Oh, Rocky!

728
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:32,557
[thunder]

729
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,428
Looks like one of your
men stopped the target here,

730
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,164
but couldn't finish the job.

731
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:42,433
Last report had them tracking
him north by northwest,

732
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,770
then the radio went dead.

733
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,038
Let's fan out.

734
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,374
Begin a hard target
search of the area.

735
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,878
If you make contact with
the target, do not engage.

736
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,380
I repeat, do not engage.

737
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,648
I do not want this man
to escape our perimeter.

738
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,852
You notify me and the
rest of the squad.

739
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:01,953
Move out.

740
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:08,526
You got any more men
left alive out there,

741
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,195
you better call 'em in.

742
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,129
Why?

743
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:14,199
They're just gonna
be in our way.

744
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,467
My men are highly
skilled professionals.

745
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,836
But if they were, you
wouldn't have called me.

746
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:20,771
I'm not going to stand
here and argue with you.

747
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:22,107
Good.

748
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:24,575
Either call them in or
suffer the consequences.

749
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,710
What do you mean?

750
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,178
I've turned
these wolves loose.

751
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,679
They're going to shoot
anything that moves out there

752
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:29,847
and ask questions later.

753
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,225
Michaels.

754
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:41,226
Yes, sir.

755
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:42,393
I need to talk to
you for a minute.

756
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:48,333
Look, I've been given full
clearance to kill this target.

757
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,969
But there's a substantial
cash bonus in it for all of us

758
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:52,938
if we can bring him back alive.

759
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,672
Now, I turn you
loose on this guy,

760
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:55,806
and he doesn't stand a chance.

761
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:57,742
That's going to cost me money.

762
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:00,979
Now, I need to know,
can you follow orders?

763
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:01,913
Of course, I can, sir.

764
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:02,948
You know I--

765
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,183
Don't bullshit me, Michaels.

766
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:07,385
Between Roth goin' soft on
me and you killin' everything

767
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:08,686
in sight, I'm
starting to think I

768
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,521
got in the wrong line of work.

769
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,290
Now, I do not want to
mess up this mission.

770
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,558
So I need to know.

771
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:15,126
Can you obey orders?

772
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,929
Sir, I am a soldier.

773
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:19,164
I can follow orders.

774
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,432
Yeah, Just Like you
did with Kozinski?

775
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:24,069
Sir, I apologize
for the incident, OK?

776
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:26,004
I had no idea the
guy was so fragile.

777
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:27,405
He just kind of came apart.

778
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,008
I overestimated his
tolerance for pain.

779
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:31,876
No, what you did
was underestimate

780
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:33,444
your own strength.

781
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,113
Now, I do not want to
mess up this mission.

782
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:36,781
So I need to know,
unequivocally,

783
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,817
can you obey orders?

784
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,751
Yeah.

785
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,752
Good.

786
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,421
You damn well better.

787
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:44,355
Get the hell outta here.

788
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,466
[crying]

789
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,501
Grace?

790
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,103
You're gonna have
to leave this place.

791
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:04,042
And where will we go?

792
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,144
We are gonna separate.

793
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,852
They're after me.

794
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,255
They will kill you.

795
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:18,023
Why?

796
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:19,057
Who are these people?

797
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:20,558
Why would they kill me?

798
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:21,792
Because you've seen me.

799
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,229
Because I've seen you?

800
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,663
What the fuck does that mean?

801
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:26,597
I don't know.

802
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:30,968
You've got a very
selective memory.

803
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:38,609
Grace, it's not my memory.

804
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,311
I see things in flashes.

805
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:43,981
I know I was their prisoner,
but I don't know why.

806
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:45,950
But if you don't
even know who they are

807
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:47,352
or why they are after
you, how do you even

808
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:49,220
know there's going to be more?

809
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,523
Do you want to stay here and
take the chance that I'm wrong?

810
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:01,532
No.

811
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:02,900
I don't.

812
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,870
OK.

813
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,038
Let's go.

814
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:14,812
Yeah, that's a copy.

815
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:16,981
Sir.

816
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:18,116
Yes, Mitchell.

817
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:19,484
You know, if Roth
poses a problem,

818
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,519
I'd be more than happy
to take care of him.

819
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,654
I don't think that will
be necessary, Mitchell.

820
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,691
Besides, I'd rather you
concentrate on the target.

821
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,426
Have I ever let you down?

822
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,095
No, you haven't.

823
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:31,662
In fact, Mitchell, you've
got the three qualities

824
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:35,266
I admire most in a soldier,
loyalty, expertise,

825
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,137
and thirst for blood.

826
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:42,940
Well, now, you can't be a
great fighter unless you've got

827
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,275
something worth fightin' for.

828
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,248
[thunder]

829
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:18,576
Don't move.

830
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:19,977
What, what?

831
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,579
They rigged the
car with a grenade.

832
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:22,980
GRACE: Oh, sweet Jesus.

833
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,585
[gun shots]

834
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:36,961

845
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,199

846
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:02,773
[choking]

847
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,753
[no dial tone]

848
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:29,734
[groaning]

849
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,323
[thunder]

850
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:53,591
You missed one man.

851
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:07,538
[groaning]

852
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:09,940

[gun shot]

861
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:55,185
Stark!

862
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,655
Is that you?

863
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:59,557
Identify yourself, or
I'm going to shoot!

864
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:06,897
Goddamn it, why
didn't you answer me?

865
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:09,534
Well, I been kind busy.

866
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,841
You're shot?

867
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:17,842
Yes.

868
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:19,309
Gimme this.

869
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,511
What happened out there?

870
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:21,646
How many are there?

871
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:24,749
There were eight of them.

872
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,884
Were eight?

873
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,018
You got 'em all?

874
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,488
Yes.

875
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,590
What is it exactly that
you said that you did?

876
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:42,633
Electricity's out, and
the phone is not working.

877
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,503
Standard operating procedure.

878
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,905
Restricts enemy's access
to all communications

879
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,140
and transportation.

880
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,209
This looks really bad.

881
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:54,178
How can you stand it?

882
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:55,079
Stand it?

883
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:00,184
Doesn't it hurt?

884
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,787
Yes.

885
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,856
Whoever trained you
trained you really well.

886
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:06,757
[beeping]

887
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,859
What is that?

888
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:11,095
[beeping]

889
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:12,262
I-- I--

890
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,163
That's it.

891
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,131
I've had enough.

892
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,966
Who or what are you?

893
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:19,136
It just happened to me
in the hospital, Grace?

894
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:20,838
A hospital.

895
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:21,906
Yes, a hospital.

896
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:23,173
They did this to me.

897
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,076
Man, this is
too fuckin' weird.

898
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,011
Grace.

899
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,378
Grace.

900
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:29,313
Grace.

901
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:30,280
[screaming]

902
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,816
No!

903
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:32,783
Grace!

904
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,752
[struggling]

905
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:35,486
No!

906
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,421
Let go of me!

907
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:39,223
They will kill you.

908
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:40,658
I don't care.

909
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:41,892
I do.

910
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,060
I do.

911
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,361
I do.

912
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,496
Men.

913
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:48,833
OK.

914
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:56,507
[phone ringing]

915
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:58,042
General Gardner here.

916
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,210
GENERAL BECKETT: I have Denton
and his crew on the case.

917
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,447
The initial problem should
be solved within the hour.

918
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:05,249
But I think this
entire incident has

919
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:08,786
exposed how precarious our
position is with this project.

920
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:10,420
I think we need to make
an immediate correction

921
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,122
in our policy.

922
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,390
What do you suggest?

923
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,526
I feel we should
terminate this operation

924
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:19,096
before it gets out of control.

925
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:22,066
We've got $6 billion
wrapped into your operation

926
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,367
there, General.

927
00:58:23,467 --> 00:58:24,635
And now you want us
to just let everything

928
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,403
go right down the
drain, because you lost

929
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,504
your handle on the situation?

930
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:29,106
Is that it?

931
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,008
If we cut our losses now, we
can walk away with our careers

932
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:31,942
intact.

933
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:38,783
All right, and what is your
suggested course of action?

934
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:41,852
Oh, an industrial
accident of some sort,

935
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:44,789
an explosion, something big.

936
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:50,160
Wipe out the plant and
everyone and everything in it.

937
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,631
Well, I will, uh, give
that some thought, General.

938
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:56,634
Meanwhile, do nothing.

939
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:58,535
Retrieve the soldier.

940
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,405
And you wait for further
instructions, understand?

941
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:02,539
Yes, sir.

942
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,781
He's gone quite insane.

943
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:16,020
You'll have to intercede.

944
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,489
How long will it take
you to get to the plant?

945
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:24,261
I can take an F14, be
there before sunrise.

946
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,496
All right.

947
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:30,400
General Beckett,
he's a patriot, one

948
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,436
of this country's great heroes.

949
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:36,073
I want you to show him
the proper respect.

950
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:39,043
I'll handle the matter
with velvet gloves.

951
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:39,944
All right.

952
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,149
Oh, Caulder.

953
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,584
You know what I find most
repellent about the agency

954
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:50,020
you work for?

955
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,890
What's that, sir?

956
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,293
How easy it is for you
boys to do the hard thing.

957
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,228
Someone's got to do it.

958
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,830
Don't they, sir?

959
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:00,731
Yes.

960
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,368
Someone's got to do it.

961
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:15,045
ROTH: Omega to home base.

962
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:16,647
Omega to home base.

963
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:17,614
That's a copy, Omega.

964
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:18,749
What's your 20?

965
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,217
I'm standing at
the target point.

966
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,820
Brasha, Stinson, and Berg
have been neutralized

967
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,488
along with bravo group.

968
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:25,622
We've located the target.

969
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:26,991
Should we move in?

970
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,192
Negative.

971
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,695
You engage combat only if
target attempts escape.

972
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,329
Everybody maintain positions.

973
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:33,330
I'm coming in.

974
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,264
Copy.

975
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,704
[thunder]

976
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:43,974
Did you hear that?

977
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:44,809
We heard.

978
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:45,976
Well, what are you waiting for?

979
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:47,444
Let's hit it.

980
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:48,713
You secured the target.

981
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:51,081
We'll mop up the mess
when you're done.

982
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:55,352
Kreigal, you got the
heart of a [inaudible]

983
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,988
And I plan on keeping it.

984
01:00:58,088 --> 01:00:59,356
[thunder]

985
01:01:13,938 --> 01:01:17,274
It's a prosthetic device.

986
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:18,776
You were bleeding.

987
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:21,311
It's a lubricant of some sort.

988
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,513
I can still move my arm.

989
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,350
But I can't feel anything.

990
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,651
So what do we do now?

991
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:29,286
I'm going to leave.

992
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:30,320
I'm the target.

993
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,089
I'm the one they want to kill.

994
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:35,025
Your best chances of survival
are to hide in the woods.

995
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,226
Oh, great.

996
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,462
So I squat in the woods
all night like Pocahontas,

997
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:39,964
then what?

998
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:42,933
As soon as I can, I will
alert the right authorities.

999
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,134
And what are you
going to tell them?

1000
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,870
You don't even know
who's chasing you.

1001
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,805
These people,
they're not the police.

1002
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:50,040
They make their own
rules, own laws.

1003
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,876
That's why I had to
escape from them.

1004
01:01:51,976 --> 01:01:53,510
And you just remembered that?

1005
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,012
Yes.

1006
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:58,548
They had me in a hospital,
and they did things to me.

1007
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:02,719
And when I escaped,
people got hurt.

1008
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,121
No shit.

1009
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,623
Well, people are
still getting hurt.

1010
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:13,197
There was another
one with me, my friend.

1011
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,264
A woman?

1012
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:15,199
Yes.

1013
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,138
We have to leave.

1014
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,151
It's a complete breakdown.

1015
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,286
She as scrambled as
yesterday's eggs.

1016
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:37,421
Looks bad.

1017
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:39,857
- They found the other one yet?
- I'm not sure.

1018
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:47,031
[thunder]

1019
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:50,134
It's too late.

1020
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:51,501
They're here.

1021
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,470
Get away from the window.

1022
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,905
Why aren't they attacking us?

1023
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,907
Because they're
waiting for more men.

1024
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,275
They want to make
certain this time.

1025
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,176
Son of a bitch.

1026
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,010
Son of a bitch.

1027
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,545
I am so tired of being scared.

1028
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:06,083
[gun shots]

1029
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,394
OK.

1030
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:18,295
I'm scared.

1031
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:19,363
I'm scared.

1032
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,765
[gun shots]

1033
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:24,534
Ceasefire, ceasefire.

1034
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,469
Vargas?

1035
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:26,871
Yes, sir.

1036
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:28,138
Use the XR5.

1037
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:29,506
But, sir, that
might contaminate--

1038
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:30,540
Just do it.

1039
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,475
Yes, sir.

1040
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:36,646
Don't move.

1041
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:37,614
No problem.

1042
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:39,216
[gun shot]

1043
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:47,391
Put this on for protection.

1044
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,425
What about you?

1045
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:49,459
I'll take care of it.

1046
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,794
I want you to go to the bedroom.

1047
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:51,695
Stay there.

1048
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:52,629
Go.

1049
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:54,064
[coughing]

1050
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,047
Roth, you got anything?

1051
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:14,184
That's a negative, sir.

1052
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:15,352
No activity.

1053
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:17,521
Might have gotten lucky.

1054
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:18,889
Don't count on it.

1055
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,926
Mitchell, how about you?

1056
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:22,993
Nothing, sir.

1057
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,561
No movement whatsoever.

1058
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,496
ROTH: I say we blow the house.

1059
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:27,531
Forget that.

1060
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,366
They want this guy intact.

1061
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,435
Then we're moving in.

1062
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:35,139
Soon, people, very soon.

1063
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:37,942
Just sit tight and hold
your current positions.

1064
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:54,091
Stark.

1065
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:55,259
Yeah.

1066
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,860
You all right?

1067
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:58,795
Yeah.

1068
01:04:58,895 --> 01:04:59,863
What now?

1069
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:01,465
We let them come to us.

1070
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:04,301
They think we're dead.

1071
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,404
I'm beginning to
believe that, too.

1072
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:08,538
Not yet.

1073
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,740
How many do you
think there are?

1074
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,443
Four, maybe five.

1075
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:16,113
When do you think they're
going to stop coming?

1076
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:19,583
When they've succeeded.

1077
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:22,719
So we are dead.

1078
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:32,729
You want to give up

1079
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,064
No.

1080
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,799
Let's take as many
of them as we can.

1081
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:36,700
All right.

1082
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,841
Sun will be coming up soon.

1083
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,744
This place is going to
be buzzing with locals.

1084
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:51,948
It's time to hit this house
now, people, hard and fast.

1085
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,618
Vargas, you ready for
an adrenaline fix?

1086
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:56,686
Been dying for it, sir.

1087
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,988
All right, people.

1088
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:01,158
Lock and load on a three count.

1089
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:03,793
1.

1090
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,462
2.

1091
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:06,396
3.

1092
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:28,752
[glass breaking]

1093
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:35,359
[punching and groaning]

1094
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,760
[bones breaking]

1095
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:49,739
[punching and groaning]

1096
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:02,386
[gun shots]

1097
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:03,320
[thwack]

1098
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,221
Ugh.

1099
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:11,695
[glass breaking]

1100
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:12,696
[gun shots]

1101
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:13,697
Ow, fuck.

1102
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,035
Fucking bitch, you shot me!

1103
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:20,437
What are you
gonna do about it?

1104
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:25,442
You'll never make it.

1105
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,376
Try me.

1106
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:29,846
[gun shot]

1107
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:33,817
[moaning]

1108
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:34,818
I married a cop.

1109
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:54,804
Did you get them all?

1110
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:05,782
I got one, too.

1111
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:07,384
[gun shots]

1112
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:09,786
Stark!

1113
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:14,391
[gun shots]

1114
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,760
Freeze!

1115
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,761
Drop the gun.

1116
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,774
Target is neutralized.

1117
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:33,243
Location is secure.

1118
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:34,811
You can come in now, Kreigal.

1119
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:35,745
Be there in five.

1120
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:42,652
Ow.

1121
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:49,058
Ow, Jesus.

1122
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,160
Ow.

1123
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:58,067
Who else did he
make contact with?

1124
01:08:58,168 --> 01:08:59,269
Huh?

1125
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,638
Was anybody else here?

1126
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,873
Did anybody leave this
place after he arrived?

1127
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,875
No.

1128
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,878
Who are you?

1129
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,781
Let me ask the questions.

1130
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:12,682
Where's the kid?

1131
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:17,854
- What?
- The kid in this picture.

1132
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:18,988
Where is he?

1133
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,724
He's dead.

1134
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,526
I'm sorry about that.

1135
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:23,527
Sorry?

1136
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:27,797
[thwack]

1137
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,333
Easy, easy.

1138
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:31,301
Now, fucker, I got a million
goddamned questions to ask

1139
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:33,002
you before I blow you to hell.

1140
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:33,937
Who are you?

1141
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:34,838
Denton.

1142
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:35,939
My name is Denton.

1143
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,441
I don't care about your name.

1144
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,708
What are you, and
why are you here?

1145
01:09:38,808 --> 01:09:41,077
I was hired to
plug a security leak,

1146
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,512
to kill that freak
in your bathroom.

1147
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:43,247
Why?

1148
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:44,514
What did he do?

1149
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:46,216
He's just an
experiment that got away.

1150
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:47,651
What kind of experiment?

1151
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,986
He's the corporation's
answer to a dwindling police

1152
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:53,323
recruitment, a cyborg, robot.

1153
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:56,260
Do I look like
an idiot to you?

1154
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,761
You mean you couldn't tell?

1155
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:00,063
You didn't notice the way
he moved, the way he spoke?

1156
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:01,331
What about it.

1157
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:03,066
He was designed to
be the ultimate cop,

1158
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:07,471
judge, jury, and executioner all
rolled into one tight package.

1159
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:09,673
Except the corporation
went too far.

1160
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:12,041
They planned on using him
for covert operations.

1161
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,643
He's an assassin, not a cop.

1162
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:14,378
Yeah.

1163
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:15,812
But you see, his--

1164
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,981
his data banks, they
recognized the contradiction,

1165
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:20,617
and they rebelled.

1166
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,887
It was a little programming
snag they didn't count on.

1167
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,323
Your boyfriend in there
is too good of a cop.

1168
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,325
He's not a cop.
I know cops.

1169
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:29,893
He didn't know
shit about the law.

1170
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:32,161
Yeah, well, his systems were
scrambled during the escape.

1171
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:33,763
But he's a fully
self-repairing unit.

1172
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:35,832
I mean, he-- he woulda been
back online in-- in maybe

1173
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,000
two or three days.

1174
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,167
What kind of crazy
garbage is this?

1175
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:40,103
What are you telling me?

1176
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:41,137
I've had it.

1177
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,241
[clicking]

1178
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:46,943
This is not my day.

1179
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:47,877
[thwack]

1180
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:48,778
Ugh.

1181
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:54,351
You owe me, Denton.

1182
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:57,186
It's about time you showed up.

1183
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:58,755
I was starting to
run out of story.

1184
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:01,425
If she'd been any kind of
a pro, I'd be dead by now.

1185
01:11:01,525 --> 01:11:05,128
Well, that's your
fault. Where's our man?

1186
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:06,396
In the bathroom.

1187
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,598
I told you not to
leave him unattended.

1188
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,667
Well, he's as
dead as a doorknob.

1189
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,636
You cannot kill
what's never been alive.

1190
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:14,070
He's a machine.

1191
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,673
He needs to be switched off.

1192
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:17,741
You watch her.

1193
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:18,775
You two come with me.

1194
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,698
At least Denton got two of them.

1195
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,004
GENERAL BECKETT: Yes?

1196
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:48,905
We got him.

1197
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:49,973
He's down and out.

1198
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:51,307
How should I proceed?

1199
01:11:51,408 --> 01:11:52,842
Cancel his contract.

1200
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,077
Cleanse the landscape.

1201
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:56,713
No witnesses, no prisoners.

1202
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,214
Just get it done.

1203
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,549
It's a done deal.

1204
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:00,950
I've been hearing
that all night.

1205
01:12:09,626 --> 01:12:11,628
Kreigal, she's comin' to.

1206
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:13,262
What do you want
me to do with her?

1207
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:15,899
Kill her.

1208
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:16,833
Kill them both.

1209
01:12:31,247 --> 01:12:34,951
[gun shots]

1210
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,821
I can hear a fly shit in
the woods from a mile away.

1211
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:43,727
Now, what am I going
to do with you?

1212
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:45,261
Drop dead.

1213
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,396
Not just yet.

1214
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:18,094
[beeping]

1215
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,505
You are under arrest for
assaulting a police officer.

1216
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,406
Do not resist.

1217
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:32,442
Do not resist.

1218
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,043
[bones breaking]

1219
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:52,762
[beeping]

1220
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,599
[beeping]

1221
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:06,976
Kreigal, come on out.

1222
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:08,111
I've got the girl.

1223
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:10,279
And we both know enough
to put you away for life

1224
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,481
if we walk out of here.

1225
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:15,251
God.

1226
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:17,186
You stay down there, honey.

1227
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,722
This'll all be over soon.

1228
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,858
Kreigal, don't make
me come in after you.

1229
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:37,106
[gun shots]

1230
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:44,047
[punching and groaning]

1231
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:52,956
[punching and groaning]

1232
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:02,899
Thank god you're alive.

1233
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:03,867
Are you OK?

1234
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:18,181
[beeping]

1235
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:21,217
What?

1236
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:23,219
(DEEP ROBOT VOICE) You
are charged with the murder

1237
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:25,021
of your husband Randal Tolson.

1238
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,122
What?

1239
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:26,923
(DEEP ROBOT VOICE)
You are under arrest.

1240
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,257
No!

1241
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,593
(DEEP ROBOT VOICE) You have
the right to remain silent.

1242
01:15:29,693 --> 01:15:30,459
You have the right
to an attorney.

1243
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,928
Let go of my hand.

1244
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,162
(DEEP ROBOT VOICE) If you
cannot afford an attorney,

1245
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,063
one will be provided for you.

1246
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:34,998
Ow, you're hurting me.

1247
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:36,032
I don't want any
goddamn attorney.

1248
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:37,000
Let go of my arm!

1249
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,167
(DEEP ROBOT VOICE)
You have waived

1250
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:38,768
your right to an attorney.

1251
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,136
No!

1252
01:15:40,236 --> 01:15:41,470
(DEEP ROBOT VOICE) This court
finds you guilty as charged.

1253
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,006
The sentence for
this crime, death.

1254
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:43,940
No!

1255
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,208
Ugh.

1256
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:47,143
(DEEP ROBOT VOICE) Execution
to commence immediately.

1257
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,149
[thunder]

1258
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:23,112
[explosion]

1259
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,085
[explosion]

1260
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:34,090
[explosion]

1261
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,497
[mechanical sounds]

[splashing]

1263
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:00,549
[gasp]

1264
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:01,651
No.

1265
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,059
[groaning and heavy breathing]

1266
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,427
No.

1267
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:13,429
No.

1268
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:14,430
No!

1269
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:17,433
[screaming]

1270
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:19,035
Get off me!

1271
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:26,409
[choking]

1272
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:29,412
[mini explosion]

1273
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:33,216
They will come for you, Grace.

1274
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,651
You must fight them.

1275
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:37,253
Fight them.

1276
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,222
[screaming]

1277
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:49,198
[crying]

1278
01:17:58,107 --> 01:18:00,910
Put the phone down, General.

1279
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,712
Who the hell are you?

1280
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:04,280
My name is Ry Caulder.

1281
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,351
I've been sent here to
terminate your command.

1282
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:09,252
Terminate my command?

1283
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:14,223
That's preposterous.

1284
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:16,826
The paperwork is
on your desk, sir.

1285
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,111
You can't be serious.

1286
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,545
I'm afraid I am.

1287
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,748
This is damage control.

1288
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,349
Please do not delay.

1289
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,250
I have much to do.

1290
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:47,056
I'm calling General Gardner.

1291
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:49,993
I want to know that
he authorized this.

1292
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:53,296
General Gardner will not
be accepting any phone calls.

1293
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:57,266
He finds the entire
situation unacceptable.

1294
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:01,170
[phone ringing]

1295
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:06,709
You bastards
can't do this to me.

1296
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:10,746
This was my project,
my brainchild.

1297
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,149
That is precisely
why you must resign.

1298
01:19:34,237 --> 01:19:37,874
Don't add disgrace to your
list of failures, General.

1299
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:49,785
What about my children?

1300
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:52,755
What will they think?

1301
01:19:52,856 --> 01:19:55,925
What will history make of me?

1302
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:57,060
That you died a hero.

1303
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:09,973
[gun shot]

1304
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:21,918
[phone ringing]

1305
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:28,091
Gardner.

1306
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:31,160
CAULDER: General Beckett
was cleaning his gun,

1307
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,161
and it went off.

1308
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:36,132
Right.

1309
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,986
[beeping]

1310
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:33,389
Help me.

1311
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:48,938
[gun shot]

1312
01:21:58,814 --> 01:21:59,915
[thunder]

1313
01:22:02,385 --> 01:22:06,289
[engine revving]

1314
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:23,639
[beeping]

1315
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:30,146
[explosion]

1316
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:38,521
STARK: They will
come for you, Grace.

1317
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,389
Fight them.

1318
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:43,626
You must fight them.

1319
01:22:43,726 --> 01:22:46,395
Fight them.

1320
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:47,530
Fight them.

1321
01:22:52,035 --> 01:22:56,572
[theme music]
