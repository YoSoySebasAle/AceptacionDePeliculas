1
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,057
- Hey, baby, I'm gonna
go get my cell phone.

2
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,767
I'll be right back.

3
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,668
- Yes!

4
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,091
- What are you
doing in there?

5
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,302
- What have you done
with my daughter?

6
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,680
- Where is she?

7
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,433
Where is my daughter!

8
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,059
Let me outta here!

9
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,066
Somebody help me!

10
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,735
Help!

11
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,404
- Somebody help me, please.

12
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,780
Go ahead and scream
all you want.

13
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,033
Cuz nobody can hear you!

14
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,595
- God, help me please.

15
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,057
Protect my little
girl and my husband,

16
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,642
wherever they are.

17
00:04:54,628 --> 00:08:15,829
♪

18
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,793
♪ baby put on your
white t-shirt...

19
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,007
♪ All thin and

20
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,926
- All that stuff.

21
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:29,801
- Awesome!

22
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,511
- Yeah.

23
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:36,308
- I'm allergic to the woods.

24
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,519
- I hope my mom packed all
my nasal sprays and stuff.

25
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,274
- I just want to make
sure, you know.

26
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,404
- It's me!

27
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,573
- What's wrong with you!

28
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,201
- That was not good!

29
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,494
- That is not funny!

30
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,496
- It's just a mask. Relax.

31
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,956
- That was so wrong!

32
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,499
- You all ready?

33
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,792
- Yeah!

34
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,752
- I heard about that scream.

35
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,003
I heard it way over there.

36
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,755
Y'all ready for this?

37
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,673
- Girl's Van is packed.

38
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,632
We're ready to go.

39
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,008
- All right. Okay. Cool!

40
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,134
- You ready?

41
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,886
- I don't know if
you can handle this.

42
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,973
- I don't know about you,
but I think you two

43
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,557
should be the ones
who's afraid.

44
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:18,684
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,977
- We're gonna deal with
that, but you know what?

46
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,062
God hasn't given us
a spirit of fear.

47
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,939
- Did you see some of
the guys in your group?

48
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,107
You two ought to be afraid.

49
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,567
- We're afraid, right.

50
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,486
- Seriously, if you guys are
up for this I want you guys

51
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,488
to take over all of
campsite b, all right?

52
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,198
- Yeah!

53
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,742
- That way we keep
everybody separated.

54
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,995
You guys on one side,
girls on the other.

55
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,413
We'll come together
for group time,

56
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,164
have Bible studies
then we'll split up.

57
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,374
We'll be close enough
if you need us

58
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,918
just holler,
but not too close.

59
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,004
- You don't have to worry
about us 'cause

60
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,964
we got a secret weapon.

61
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,090
- Yes, we do.

62
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,217
- Do tell. Let's hear it.

63
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,970
- We brought the chocolate.

64
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,056
So listen, after
the group hours,

65
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,683
I don't think we want to
have a drop of trouble

66
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,560
getting the girls
over to our side.

67
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,352
- Sounds good to me.

68
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,145
- For women only.

69
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,062
- That's right.

70
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:04,688
- I hear you.

71
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,148
- You may not partake.

72
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,110
- Definitely not you!
No!

73
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,361
- I'm gonna check
on everybody else.

74
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,946
Make sure you guys
are all packed up.

75
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,489
Let's meet back in
about ten minutes.

76
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,950
We'll have a word of
prayer and hit the road.

77
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,035
Let's go camping!

78
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,766
- Thank you.

79
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,017
Thank you so much
for being here today.

80
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,186
We have a great show
in store for you.

81
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,688
Bonnie Johnson is here
promoting her new movie,

82
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,776
run, hide, pray.

83
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,070
And currently topping the
charts with her hit single

84
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,739
white t-shirt, that's
right, Tara Leigh cobble.

85
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,577
And I'm excited to have with
us today the number one

86
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,662
best selling author
in the country

87
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,664
to tell her story
of survival.

88
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,792
You won't believe it.

89
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,045
Of course our very own
domestic diva

90
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,713
standing by in the
kitchen ready to share

91
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,716
her favorite holiday
recipes with us.

92
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,926
- That's right, Emily.

93
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,095
Today I'm gonna show you
how to make my family's

94
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,014
famous harvest casserole that
will leave your guests

95
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,518
wanting more. Yum,
you're gonna love it!

96
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,937
- So don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back.

97
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,598
- Come on!

98
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,572
- You're gonna need this.

99
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,699
It's supposed to get
really cold tonight.

100
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,342
- Hey!

101
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,136
Wait! Wait!

102
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,513
Wait!

103
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,557
Help me! Please!

104
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,601
Please!

105
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,536
- Hey lady, what are
you doing out here?

106
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,703
Are you okay?

107
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,579
- Help me, please!

108
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:42,956
- Get in.

109
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,273
- Okay Emily, we're ready.

110
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,149
You're on in 60.

111
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:13,903
- Oh.

112
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:14,654
- Thanks.

113
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,489
- Let me get that for you.

114
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,116
Where are you going
with those donuts?

115
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,299
- Welcome back.

116
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,301
Our next guest is near
and dear to my heart.

117
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,927
It's actually a story that
I covered when I was

118
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,637
still a local reporter
out in the field.

119
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,392
- Okay, okay.

120
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,227
I still can remember the
night that the call came into

121
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,646
the news room that a
young mother was missing.

122
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,690
I was one of the first
reporters out on the scene,

123
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,734
and police were everywhere
searching for answers but

124
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,485
finding very little.

125
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,697
It was such a somber scene,
and it seemed quite hopeless.

126
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,116
Fortunately our story
took a turn for the best.

127
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,577
I'm gonna let her come out
and tell the story herself.

128
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,245
Let's bring out
Laurie Curtis.

129
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,887
- Thank you for having me.

130
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,180
- Thanks for being here.
You look great.

131
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,056
- Thanks. So do you.

132
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,682
And congratulations
on your own show.

133
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,017
This is so exciting.

134
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,856
- You must have been so
scared when you did

135
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,691
decide to make a run for it.

136
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,984
- Yes. Absolutely.

137
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,070
But I kind of looked
at it this way.

138
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,864
I knew I was fighting for my
life so I'd rather take my

139
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,617
chances trying to escape than
to hang around and see what

140
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,118
he had in mind for me.

141
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,912
- Sure. Sure. I can
understand that.

142
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,163
So tell us what
happened next?

143
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,915
Did the police ever
catch up with him?

144
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,292
- Well, the police
have been very helpful.

145
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,127
I told them everything that
I knew and I even tried

146
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,088
to help them locate
where the barn was.

147
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,965
And they were able to
find out who he was

148
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,383
and where he lived.

149
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,344
But once they got there,
he had been long gone and

150
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,805
unfortunately, he's been
evading the police, I guess,

151
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,556
for about a year now
but they assure me

152
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,642
they're still on the case.

153
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,977
- It's such an
incredible store,

154
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,104
you're such an amazing woman.

155
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,271
- Oh, well thank you.

156
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,606
I give the credit
to the lord.

157
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,066
I know that without him,

158
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,484
I wouldn't have
gotten through it.

159
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,445
I just know that all good
things come from the lord,

160
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,200
and that he takes care of us,
and I knew if I had faith

161
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,285
that I would see my daughter
and my husband again.

162
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,162
So he answered my prayers.

163
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,330
Here I am.

164
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,207
- Well we're so thankful to
have you here today

165
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,126
alive and well and here
to tell your story.

166
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,211
Speaking of your little girl,

167
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,005
she's here today with
us in the audience.

168
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,589
Do you mind, can
we bring her on out?

169
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,509
- Sure. Sure.

170
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,352
- Well, Laurie and marin,
thank you for being here

171
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,479
today and sharing your
incredible story.

172
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,940
And everyone in our audience
today is gonna receive a free

173
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,525
copy of Laurie's book.

174
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,529
- We'll be right
back after this.

175
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,365
- And we're clear.

176
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,076
We'll be back from commercial
in 90 seconds everyone.

177
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,427
- There you go.

178
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,182
- This anybody's?

179
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,142
- I got mine.

180
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,686
- Got everything?

181
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,396
- Get my back pack on.

182
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,321
- Hey!

183
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,031
- Come on. Come on!

184
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,083
- Where? Where's spiders?

185
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,315
- Y'all gonna go to the lake?

186
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,441
- I think I am.

187
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,030
- Do we have the directions?

188
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,074
- We don't need directions.

189
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,202
- You sure?

190
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,708
- Somebody get Trey to help.

191
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,377
- No. We'll get Trey later.

192
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,087
Let him rest.

193
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,143
- This is so easy.

194
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,022
- You're crazy.

195
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,243
- Look at the guys.

196
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,995
They still can't
get their tent up!

197
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,707
- Do you think we
should go help them?

198
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:20,751
- Guys, this is
ridiculous. Come on.

199
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,296
- Come on, they need real
women. Let's go.

200
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,006
- Let's show 'em
how it's done.

201
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,635
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.

202
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,471
- Oh, no, what is going on!

203
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,056
- We got it. We got it.

204
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,474
- Obviously, you don't have it.

205
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,934
- It's broken!

206
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,229
- It's not broken.
Y'all are broken.

207
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,022
- We got it.

208
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,481
- No, we got it.

209
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,275
Get on out of here.

210
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,569
Is somebody under here?

211
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:47,695
Oh, my gosh!

212
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,988
Just get out of here.

213
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,075
- Just get out.

214
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,086
- I love the tiaras.

215
00:27:56,384 --> 00:28:01,806
- Quadrant two,
vector six, clear.

216
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:07,144
Quadrant three,
vector two, clear.

217
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,690
Subject perimeter clear.

218
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,026
- That's a relief.

219
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,407
What is that?

220
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,449
- What do you mean?

221
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,118
- What is that?

222
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,620
- It's a disguise
for the stake out.

223
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,080
- Stake out?

224
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,499
We are not on a stake out.

225
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,961
We're simply here to
watch Laurie's house.

226
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,546
- We want to blend in.

227
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,047
We don't want to
be conspicuous.

228
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,215
- Blend in?

229
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,300
What is that?

230
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,677
- This?

231
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,847
It's my paint ball gun,
you know, for protection.

232
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:47,935
- Could you just be serious?

233
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,230
- Okay.

234
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:05,327
Quadrant five,
vector two, clear.

235
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:09,206
Quadrant four,
vector three, clear.

236
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,255
Five of diamonds.

237
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,049
- No.

238
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,560
- Five of diamonds.

239
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,103
- No again.

240
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,987
- Ace of spades.

241
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,615
- No.

242
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,408
Do you ever get that right?

243
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,910
- Sometimes.

244
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,120
- Can't we just
be serious here?

245
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,546
- Four of clubs.

246
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,507
- You ever think about
shuffling the deck.

247
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,341
They're all...

248
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,426
- Ha!

249
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,970
- Did you invite him?

250
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,472
- Sorry, dude, I thought
it was a stake out.

251
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:09,600
- What next?

252
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,644
- Hey, guys, I'm here
for the stake out.

253
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,687
- Stake out, stake out.

254
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,856
This is not a stake out.

255
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,609
Mr. Curtis simply asked me to
watch his house while he's

256
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,152
gone out of town.

257
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:24,073
It's not a stake out, we're
just watching the house.

258
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,283
- Dude, I like your
disguise, but I thought you

259
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,118
had a pta meeting.

260
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,956
- Yeah, I got out of it.

261
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,166
- Can we just
be serious here?

262
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,292
- Hang on.

263
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,337
- I brought donuts.

264
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,672
- Sweet.

265
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,215
- Can I get in?

266
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,177
- Please, just get in,
get in, and just be quiet.

267
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,180
- Man, these are good.

268
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,891
- Sugar high, though.

269
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,726
- Want another donut?

270
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,395
- You've got...

271
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,188
You've got...

272
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,108
Go like this.

273
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,150
- Did I get it?

274
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,152
- No, other side.

275
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,654
- Did I get it?

276
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:08,075
- Yeah, whatever.

277
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,827
- These are good.

278
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:14,039
- You guys just remember
what goes up must come down,

279
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,459
so you might want to layoff
of these sugar donuts.

280
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,295
- But they're so good.

281
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,798
- Uh-huh.

282
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,341
- I like the jelly.

283
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,395
- I think it went
really well tonight.

284
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,605
- So this is what it's like
being backstage, it's really

285
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,564
cool.

286
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,149
- Yes, it's pretty neat.

287
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,066
I like to do the talk shows,
they really treat you like a

288
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,069
star.

289
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,155
Well, I know she's going
to love princesses on ice

290
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,283
tonight, and are you sure
you don't mind keeping her?

291
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,161
- Heavens no, we're
looking so forwards to it.

292
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,830
- We always like
to have marin.

293
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:59,043
- Well, try to stick to the
bedtime, and no soda

294
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,253
at least after 9.

295
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,671
- Right, we promise.

296
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,256
- What happens at Mimi and
papa's stays at

297
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,758
Mimi and papa's.

298
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:06,800
- Right.

299
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,052
- Are you ready to go baby?

300
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,803
Let's go sugar.

301
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,555
- We don't want
you to be late.

302
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,849
- Big girl.

303
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,935
- Love you guys.
- Proud of you.

304
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,187
- Thank you.

305
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:22,107
- We'll see you soon.
Okay, here we go. Bye.

306
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:25,569
- See you soon, see
you soon, love you.

307
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,987
- Love you.

308
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,448
- Okay, bye bye.
- See you guys.

309
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,828
- Mrs. Curtis, Mrs. Curtis!

310
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:50,719
- Oh, yeah, of course.

311
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,352
Thank you guys.

312
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,311
- Can we get a picture?

313
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,563
- Sure of course, yeah.

314
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,773
- Can you take it for us?

315
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,066
- Sure.

316
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,277
Smile.

317
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,487
Got it.

318
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:09,947
- All right, thank you.

319
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:10,781
- Thank you.

320
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,990
- Sure, thank you guys.

321
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,033
See you.

322
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,534
Ah!

323
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,910
- I'm so sorry.

324
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,661
Do you mind signing
this for me?

325
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,164
- No, not at all.

326
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,331
You scared me.

327
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,332
- Sorry.

328
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,002
- That's okay.

329
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:05,711
There you go.

330
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,880
- Thank you.
- Sure.

331
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,346
- It was so much fun.

332
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:20,184
I really enjoyed
doing the talk show.

333
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:23,395
I'm home safe now.

334
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,191
I'm locking it right now,
and everything looks fine.

335
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:31,195
The dead bolt, too.

336
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,490
Yeah, I think the special
forces are out there.

337
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,408
They are.

338
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,076
You know you don't have to
hire them every time

339
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:42,039
you go out of town.

340
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:46,251
Okay, honey, if it
makes you feel better.

341
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,253
I haven't seen him.

342
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:52,424
Lancer, Lancelot?

343
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,550
He's probably just upstairs
digging in the trash or

344
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,719
something.

345
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,347
Okay, well you go
onto your meeting.

346
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,431
Oh, it's going to be fine.

347
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:03,894
I've got a movie.

348
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,438
Okay, well, I will
talk to you later.

349
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,357
All right you call
me or I'll call you.

350
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,442
Love you, bye.

351
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:15,405
Lance? Lance?

352
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:20,577
Hey, good boy, are you okay?

353
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,037
What's wrong, buddy?

354
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,470
Hey, Carlie, this
is Laurie Curtis.

355
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,640
My dog's acting like he's
not feeling too well.

356
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,975
Can I bring him?

357
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,184
You're open now?

358
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,894
Awesome, thank you so much.

359
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,747
- Hey, Mrs.
Curtis, hey, Lance.

360
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:06,915
- Hey, Carlie,
thanks for waiting.

361
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,417
- No problem.

362
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,085
- He's been like
this since I got home.

363
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,420
I don't know what's going on.

364
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,171
I don't know if he's sick to
his stomach or what's wrong

365
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:18,093
with him, but he just
doesn't look good to me.

366
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,970
- You know, something's
definitely wrong with him.

367
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,722
I'm going to have to have
Dr. Bailey check him out.

368
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,849
- Okay, he ran out to grab
some dinner real quick, but

369
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,517
he'll be back in
a few minutes.

370
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,060
It's been a very busy day.

371
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,062
- Well, do you think
he's going to be okay.

372
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,064
- I'm sure he'll
probably be fine.

373
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,441
But if it's okay with you,
can I keep him here overnight

374
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,525
to run some tests?

375
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,404
- Sure, absolutely.

376
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,822
- Here's your information
from last time.

377
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,158
If I could just have you
check your home or cell phone

378
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,619
number, whichever one is
more convenient for you.

379
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:46,914
- Okay, great, my cell.

380
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,540
- Okay.

381
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,458
All right and I will go ahead
and take him back, and I'll

382
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,335
have Dr. Bailey call you as
soon as we figure out

383
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,294
what's wrong with him.

384
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,129
- Okay thank you.

385
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,464
Hey, good boy, be a
good boy, all right?

386
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,798
They're going to take
good care of you.

387
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:57,758
Okay, thanks Carlie.

388
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,051
- No problem.

389
00:36:59,176 --> 00:36:59,885
Have a safe night.

390
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,887
- All right, you, too.

391
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,166
- I'm not watching
that by myself.

392
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,247
- Oh, man.

393
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,832
Okay we need to
go to surgery now.

394
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,194
- Hello?

395
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,571
Hey, Dr. Bailey.

396
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:43,905
- Laurie, I'm
glad we found you.

397
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,283
Look, we found out what was
wrong with Lance, but there

398
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,201
may be someone in your house.

399
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,453
- What?

400
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,370
- Look, you gotta stay as
calm as possible, but there

401
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:54,374
were two adult male fingers.

402
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,793
Laurie, that's not
the worst part.

403
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,838
They were wearing
black leather gloves.

404
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,381
I don't know, maybe
broke into the house.

405
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,841
Look, Lance bit their fingers
off trying to

406
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,217
protect the home.

407
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,510
I don't know, but we
called the police already.

408
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:09,431
They're on their way, but he
could still be in the house.

409
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,100
Okay please look,
be calm, be calm.

410
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,311
He could be lying around
somewhere, loss of blood,

411
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,687
in shock somewhere.

412
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:16,688
Please look around,
anything messy,

413
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,440
blood anywhere, please.

414
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,500
- Laurie, can you hear me?
Get out of the house now!

415
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,251
If you can hear me, get
out of the house now!

416
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,170
If you can hear me, get
out of the house now!

417
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,842
- Help me, please, help me!

418
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,179
He's in here, he's
in here! Help!

419
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:57,104
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's okay.

420
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:00,982
You two take the right side.

421
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,317
Ford, we'll take the
left side of the house.

422
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,370
- Clear.

423
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:16,998
- Take the stairs.

424
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,210
- Clear at the far end.

425
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,337
- Clear, sergeant.

426
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,388
- Clear.

427
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:32,764
- Clear.

428
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,599
- And he's in the closet
downstairs or upstairs?

429
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,767
- Downstairs.

430
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,644
- Okay.

431
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,854
- Clear the closet.

432
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,153
- It's clear.

433
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,779
You guys got anything?

434
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:51,158
- Nothing, it's clear.

435
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,121
- Corporal, this is what
I need for you to do.

436
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,706
Secure an entire perimeter
around the house and the

437
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,582
whole neighborhood.

438
00:40:58,707 --> 00:40:59,624
- Yes, sir.

439
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:00,917
- Set up a
command post also.

440
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,502
- Contact ccbi immediately.

441
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,461
- Yes, sir.

442
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:04,296
- Have them
process the scene.

443
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,589
- Yes, sir.

444
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:11,303
- 460 to dispatch.

445
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,763
460 to dispatch.

446
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,724
- Dispatch go ahead, copy.

447
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:16,975
- I'm at Laurie
Curtis' place.

448
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,896
We have a suspect at large
and he is wounded, copy?

449
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,939
- The Laurie Curtis place?

450
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,233
- Affirmative.

451
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,860
I need any assistance we can
get from any local

452
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,153
police departments.

453
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,071
Also get the canine unit
en route immediately.

454
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,448
We need to lock this
whole area down.

455
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:34,701
Do you copy?

456
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,120
- Copy.

457
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,751
- He's back.

458
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,775
- That's exactly
how it happened.

459
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,526
And people think I'm lying
when I talk about it, but I

460
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,446
don't even see why I would
make something like that up.

461
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,073
- Well, it is pretty
hard to believe.

462
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,366
- Come on, man.

463
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:15,867
- No, I'm not calling you a
liar or anything, I'm just

464
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,203
saying it's pretty stretched.

465
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,288
- Why would she lie about
something like that?

466
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,207
- I mean, it's like
something out of a

467
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,083
movie, you know?

468
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,751
It's crazy.

469
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,294
- Well, I believe
you, Madison.

470
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,255
- Thank you, Lacey.

471
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,131
- Well, did they get him?

472
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,467
- Honestly, the last thing I...
- Did anybody...

473
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,928
- Shhhh.

474
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:35,512
- What? I just want to know the
score of the game.

475
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:36,388
- Shhhh.

476
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:38,348
- I heard something.

477
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,808
- Sit down, dude.

478
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,559
- No, I thought
I heard it, too.

479
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:45,981
- Yeah, me, too.

480
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,031
- Maybe it was just
a squirrel or

481
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,533
something, you know?

482
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:05,166
- Yeah, it could
have been anything.

483
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,544
- You know, the police
finally found out who the guy

484
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,797
was based on where they
found Laurie Curtis.

485
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,757
Apparently he was just a
regular guy according to the

486
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,136
people at his church, but he
got in a bad relationship

487
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,346
with some girl, and she was
kind of after him

488
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,141
because he had a good job
and some money.

489
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,767
And so eventually he figured
it out, and he got

490
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,519
fed up with it.

491
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:30,275
So he tried to end it, but
she wasn't going that easy.

492
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,945
- It's just the
relationship's not working.

493
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,323
- What's not
working about it?

494
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,949
- All of it.

495
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,409
- Tyler, you're going
to have to be a bit more

496
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,454
specific than that.

497
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,040
- We just seem to be going
in our separate directions.

498
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,542
You don't even go to
church with me on Sunday.

499
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,170
- Church has nothing
to do with anything.

500
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,048
- But it does, it has a
lot to do with what I feel.

501
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:56,092
- We're not having
this discussion again.

502
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:02,932
- Dasha, I think it's time
you go your way, and I'm just

503
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,893
going to go mine.

504
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,436
- We can work it out just
like we have

505
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,521
every other time.

506
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,691
- It hasn't worked.

507
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:15,278
I think it's time
for you to leave.

508
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,530
- No.

509
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,407
No.

510
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:20,283
- I'm sorry.

511
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,577
- You're sorry?

512
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,372
You're sorry?

513
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:30,668
For everything that I've
done for you, you're sorry?

514
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:34,089
- Yes.

515
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:39,886
- It's not over, not
until I say it is.

516
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,278
- So she went to the
police and made some nasty

517
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:58,863
accusations like he'd been
beating her and

518
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,782
things like that.

519
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,075
And unfortunately for
him, she was

520
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,618
pretty convincing so...

521
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:04,869
- He doesn't love me.

522
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,329
- I'm sergeant Jake lyons.

523
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,081
I'd like to come inside and
ask you a few questions.

524
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,084
- Okay, is everything okay?

525
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:20,927
- They gave him
five years in prison.

526
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,929
He didn't do very well there.

527
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,264
The police started getting
really worried because he was

528
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,142
extremely violent and
introverted and so they put

529
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,310
him in isolation.

530
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:31,938
And then about
three years went by.

531
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,523
Eventually, his attorney came
back and proved that his

532
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,276
girlfriend had been lying
and so they set him

533
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,319
free on probation.

534
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:40,572
- That still doesn't explain
why someone would go after

535
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,699
people like that, though.

536
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,326
- Well, people all respond
differently under pressure,

537
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,036
and I can't imagine being
convicted of a crime

538
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:50,165
I didn't commit.
It must be awful.

539
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,125
- Yeah.

540
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,890
- All right you guys,
gather around and listen up.

541
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,850
Here's the situation.

542
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:12,479
We got a suspect on the run,
probably on foot, and we have

543
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:16,816
strong reason to believe
that he is seriously injured.

544
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,527
Now, I know some of you made
big plans for tonight, but I

545
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,238
just cancelled them.

546
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:26,326
Relax, and here's what
we need to do from here.

547
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,912
We need more manpower
to aid with the search.

548
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:30,788
Let's activate a full recall.

549
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:32,957
Wake them up if you have to.

550
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,959
Let's get something very
clear right now, folks.

551
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,004
We're going all
night if we have to.

552
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,757
I want this guy apprehended
before the sun comes up.

553
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,426
Now, where's my map of the
area around highway 56?

554
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:48,515
- Got it right
here, sergeant.

555
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,977
- All right, highway 56 is
here, here's lake Mitchell

556
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,355
and these are the
surrounding woods here.

557
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,856
Now according to the
report, the suspect entered

558
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,483
the woods somewhere
around here.

559
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:02,362
We believe he's heading
east towards the highway.

560
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,030
- Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

561
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,700
I want units here,
here, and here.

562
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,537
I want to seal off
this entire area.

563
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:13,122
I want check points set up on
any road that leads anywhere

564
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:14,666
near that highway.

565
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,542
Is that understood?

566
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:16,417
- Yes, sir.

567
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:17,418
- Any questions?

568
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,169
- No sir, sir.

569
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:18,836
- No sir.

570
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:19,796
- Let's make it happen.

571
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,047
- You got it, sergeant.

572
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,468
- All right, who's
in charge here?

573
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:26,594
- That would be me.

574
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,680
- Not anymore.

575
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,599
How about some coffee?

576
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,601
- I would love some.

577
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,813
- I meant get me some.

578
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:40,608
- Officer Simpson, get
this man a cup of coffee.

579
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,361
- So what does the FBI
want with this guy anyway?

580
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,405
- We believe he's involved
in more than just these

581
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,490
local abductions.

582
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:48,825
We've been watching the grid
to see if he was going to

583
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,120
pop up anywhere.

584
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:55,748
I guess he's a bit more
obsessed than we thought.

585
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,043
Anyway, we really
want this guy.

586
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,170
And I know you've had
mayberry's finest working on

587
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:04,799
the case, but the big boys
are here now, so you girls

588
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,885
can turn in for the night.

589
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:12,015
Catch up on your
beauty sleep, perhaps.

590
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,683
- Agent manson, you
know what I think?

591
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,184
- No, what's that?

592
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,061
- I think everything was
just fine until you...

593
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,772
- Sergeant, sergeant,
serge, come on now.

594
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,567
- What's the status
on the canine units?

595
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,652
- Um...

596
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,487
- Today would be nice.

597
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:29,198
- Looks like they're
all on their way.

598
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:30,908
The first one should be there
in about five minutes, and

599
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,995
the rest should
be there in 20.

600
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,622
- Come on, people.

601
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,832
At this pace we'd be lucky if
this guy hasn't managed to

602
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:42,378
walk to the state line by the
time our net is deployed.

603
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:45,298
Look, radio them tell
them to step on it.

604
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:46,591
I want everybody there
in ten, you got it?

605
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:47,675
- Yes, sir.

606
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,093
- Now let's move, people!

607
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,535
- He's a good boy.

608
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,579
- It just seems so wrong
for all of that to happen to

609
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,122
one person.

610
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,124
- Seriously, it reminds me
of those sayings that go

611
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:23,044
around on e-mail like when
someone wrecks their car, and

612
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,922
it falls into the river, and
just when you think they're

613
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,174
about to drown, all the
sudden they kick in the

614
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,177
windshield, and then
they start swimming.

615
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,428
- I know exactly what
you're talking about.

616
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,180
So any ways they're trying to
get away from this alligator

617
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,848
and they're able to get away
from the alligator, but they

618
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,517
have the missing leg.

619
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,602
So they're trying to go up
this impossible hill, and as

620
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,062
soon as they get up the
impossible hill, they see

621
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,439
this car, like we're
going to be safe, right?

622
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,191
So they're trying to get to
the car, and as soon as they

623
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,734
get to the car, the car loses
control, hits them

624
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,611
and kills them both.

625
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,570
Isn't that crazy?

626
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,948
- That's so wrong.

627
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:52,990
- That's really rough, man.

628
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,909
- Hey, I didn't
make it up, okay?

629
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,328
It's got a name, and it's
called something like the...

630
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,747
- The worst luck award.

631
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,499
- We know, Ashley.

632
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:02,792
- Exactly.

633
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,001
But you know what?

634
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:06,629
They are kind of funny
in a morbid way.

635
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,215
But they're sad, too.

636
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,508
- Doesn't morbid mean sad?

637
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,636
- Okay, Ashley.

638
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,680
That's no squirrel.

639
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,025
- Aah!

640
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:31,487
- Are you crazy?

641
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,989
We have a like a grizzly
squirrel back here, and

642
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,323
you're cracking jokes?

643
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:35,116
- [Mocking) Oh!

644
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,701
I'm so scared!

645
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:41,789
Oh, Luke, please save me.

646
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:42,874
Please, Luke!

647
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,500
I want you to save me!

648
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,376
- Get off me!

649
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,252
You smell horrible.

650
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:48,337
- We could have done
without you on this trip.

651
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,007
- Ashley!

652
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,133
Ashley!

653
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,846
- Hey!

654
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:57,430
Hey!

655
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,598
Come back here!

656
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:02,852
- Ugh.

657
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,103
- Hold up! Hold up!

658
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,521
What are you thinking, man?

659
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,856
We could have killed you!

660
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,024
- Yeah. What's wrong with you!

661
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,317
We thought you were
going to kidnap her.

662
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:10,485
You're lucky we
didn't mess you up.

663
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,819
- Oh, how sweet.

664
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,321
Her guardian little angels.

665
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:14,489
- What are you
doing here anyway?

666
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:16,032
I thought you had some
competition or something

667
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,283
to go to.

668
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,868
- No, I got out early
so I drove out here.

669
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,704
- Yeah. Thanks, man.

670
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,539
I can't believe you.

671
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:24,415
- Come on, guys.

672
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,167
I just thought it
would be funny.

673
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:26,876
Come on.

674
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,086
It was hilarious.

675
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:34,509
- Attention, all units!

676
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,886
Please report to the
rendezvous point on the double.

677
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,430
I repeat, all units please
report to the rendezvous point

678
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,141
on the double.

679
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,268
- Serge, just got a
radio dispatch from 911.

680
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,312
They're sending
over an audio file.

681
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,980
They think it has to
do with the suspect.

682
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,442
- All right. Let's hear it.

683
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,944
- There's somebody
in my backyard.

684
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,112
- Ma'am, are you in
immediate danger?

685
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:58,866
- No. I think he went
back into the woods.

686
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,701
- Can you give me a
description of him?

687
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:03,162
- Um, it's pretty dark.

688
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,748
He's probably six foot tall,
dressed in all black.

689
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:09,168
I think he saw me.

690
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,711
- Ma'am, just remain calm.

691
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,171
We have units
very close to you.

692
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,340
- When and where was that?

693
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:18,094
- That's two miles east
of Mrs. Curtis' house.

694
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,429
It looks like it
was 15 minutes ago.

695
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,723
- 15 minutes?

696
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:26,060
Does everything happen
that slowly around here?

697
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,812
At least he
hasn't gotten away.

698
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,313
Contact the ground units.

699
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,399
Tell them they have a
gopher net deployment.

700
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:32,650
- Yes, sir.

701
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:33,985
All units! All units!

702
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:38,197
Suspect has been spotted three
clicks east 15 minutes ago

703
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,992
moving towards highway 56.

704
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:41,993
Move to intercept.

705
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,704
I repeat move to intercept.

706
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:45,663
- All right.

707
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,164
People, listen up.

708
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:47,957
We just got the go
ahead on the man hunt.

709
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,083
Let's be careful.

710
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,209
We need this guy alive.

711
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,628
No shots fired unless you
have to. Let's move it.

712
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,702
- Hey, serge, helicopter
just arrived on the pad.

713
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:25,745
It's waiting for you.

714
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,165
- Oh, it's about time.

715
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,878
Agent manson, if you
will excuse me.

716
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,714
We've got a bad guy to catch.

717
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,507
You can just sit
back and relax.

718
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,843
Enjoy the show.

719
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,678
If you need more coffee,
officer simps can

720
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:43,846
help you with that.

721
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,014
Don't worry.

722
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,141
We'll do all the hard work.

723
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:52,104
But I'm sure as usual you
gotta take all credit for it.

724
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,451
Whirring overhead]

725
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,790
- Corporal, I think
we got something.

726
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,378
- Yeah. He's definitely
been through here.

727
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:19,298
14 apex command, he's definitely
been through this way.

728
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,760
All right, everybody, from
now on we're going silent.

729
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:44,657
- You want one?

730
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,785
- Yeah.

731
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,718
- Does anybody have an extra
wire hanger so we don't have

732
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:05,428
to do this?

733
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:07,471
- Ah.

734
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:08,639
- Take mine.

735
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,224
- It will work.

736
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,559
- It's not working.

737
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:15,604
- Oh.

738
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,189
- It's not going to work.

739
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,368
- Got another marshmallow?

740
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,747
So I haven't seen you
around church much lately.

741
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:33,873
What's up?

742
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,584
- Oh, um, nothing is up.

743
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,419
I've just been busy.

744
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,463
That's all.

745
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:41,797
- That's cool.

746
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,758
I know you got
a lot going on.

747
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:44,633
I just miss
seeing you around.

748
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:45,885
That's all.

749
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,346
- Thanks, brother Dave.

750
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:50,556
Who knows.

751
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,726
Maybe I'll be back some day.

752
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,187
- Yeah.

753
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:59,190
Just don't wait too
long, all right.

754
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,150
- What do you mean?

755
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,443
- Aw, nothing.

756
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,028
Forget it.

757
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:06,906
- No. Seriously what
do you mean?

758
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:10,117
- Well, you see
this fire here?

759
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:13,370
There's this guy and
everybody liked him.

760
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:14,455
I mean, a really cool guy.

761
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,289
Class act.

762
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:16,707
Made good grades.

763
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,417
Had a great girlfriend.

764
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,002
Even got along good
with his parents.

765
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,921
Went to church regularly.

766
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,048
He just had it
all going for him.

767
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:28,052
And then one day out of
the blue his girlfriend

768
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:29,512
dumped him.

769
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:30,888
I mean, no warning.

770
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,140
Just like that.

771
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,975
And that just sent a
shockwave through his life.

772
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:37,895
One thing started going
bad, then another.

773
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,605
Pretty soon his grades
started to slip.

774
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,192
And that led to more fights
with his parents, and then

775
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,278
before long he dropped
out of church completely.

776
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:52,034
It's so funny how we run
from the one place that can

777
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,746
actually help us, you know.

778
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,457
Anyway, this guy's life
is in a free fall.

779
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,418
I mean, even his close friends
have just given up on him.

780
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:03,379
Just wrote him off.

781
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,382
Next thing you know several
weeks have passed and he's

782
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,176
sitting at home by
himself, depressed.

783
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:12,388
Alone in the dark.

784
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:14,098
Hadn't even left the house in
a couple days and he's just

785
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:16,267
sitting there by
the fireplace.

786
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,228
That's the only light
in the entire house.

787
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,313
Then he hears a
knock at the door.

788
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:23,858
- Kind of scares him.

789
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,734
He knew he hadn't invited
anyone over, so he ignores it.

790
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,322
A few seconds later
the knock is back.

791
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,408
This time a little louder.

792
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,201
Little more intense.

793
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:35,744
He says all right, I didn't
invite anybody over.

794
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,829
So he just ignores it.

795
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,372
A third time
boom, boom, boom.

796
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,500
- Even louder.

797
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,920
So finally he gets up and he
walks to the door, and as he

798
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,464
puts his hand on the doorknob
and opens it, he looks out

799
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,717
and sees this huge
dark silhouette.

800
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,969
As he's peering into the
darkness trying to find out

801
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,054
who it is, his eyes adjust.

802
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,141
And he sees an old friend
from church standing there.

803
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,268
It's a freezing cold night
and his friend is just

804
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,103
staring at home, and he
says, "can I come in?"

805
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,813
And he guys is like,
"well, yeah. Come on in."

806
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,983
So he reluctantly let's him
in and they walk into the

807
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:07,484
living room.

808
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,403
Again there's no lights on,
so now there's two guys

809
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,447
sitting there staring
at the same fire.

810
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:14,700
Neither of them
saying a word.

811
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,578
So a few minutes go by
and then a few more.

812
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,372
Before you know it, a
half hour has gone by.

813
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,458
These guys have said nothing.

814
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:26,378
Finally the friend that
invited himself over gets up

815
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,423
and the guy thinks he's
fixing to leave, but instead

816
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,426
he walks up to the fireplace
just like this, and he takes

817
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:36,430
those fireplace tongs and
he reaches into the fire and

818
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:41,018
he grabs one red hot coal,
and takes it out and he holds

819
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,979
it up and then he sets it
right in front of them on the

820
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,983
brick hearth, and he
just watches it.

821
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,443
So his friend looks at it.

822
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:51,612
They stair at it as
it was bright red.

823
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:55,115
And then it turns kind of a
light orange and then a soft

824
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:59,286
pink, and before
long it turns gray

825
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,455
and goes out completely.

826
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,958
Completely cold.

827
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,334
So he stares at that
for a few minutes.

828
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:06,835
And then his friend without
saying a word grabs the same

829
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:09,505
tongs, picks up the coal
that's completely lifeless

830
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,342
and he sets it right back
in the middle of the fire.

831
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:18,013
And immediately the coal
burst to life, alive with

832
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:21,600
flame, red, all the
coals igniting it.

833
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,938
And they just stare at
it for a few seconds.

834
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:31,443
And then the guy gets up,
pats his friend on the back

835
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,363
and he walks out
without saying a word.

836
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:45,582
And just before he gets to
the door, our depressed

837
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,918
friend stops and
says, "hey, wait!

838
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:52,298
You're right.

839
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,466
I appreciate what you just
said even though you didn't

840
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,218
speak a word.

841
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,970
Your sermon came
through loud and clear.

842
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,472
I needed that.

843
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,727
I have grown cold, but I
promise you this, I'll be

844
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:07,521
back where I belong among my
friends back in church

845
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,356
this Sunday. I promise."

846
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,823
- So what happened next?

847
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:26,165
- Well, since you asked I
watched my friend put his

848
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,208
hand on my doorknob
at the house.

849
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,169
He opened it and he let
himself out of my house and

850
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:38,635
he walked into the
cold night air.

851
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:40,679
- That was you?

852
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:44,308
- Yeah. That was me.

853
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:48,562
And by the way, I've
kept my promise.

854
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:52,024
I've been back at church ever
since, where I belong among

855
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,943
my friends.

856
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:58,530
Now when the struggles of
life come my way and the

857
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,034
cares of this world seem to
weigh me down, I run to the

858
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:07,331
place that can help
me and not from it.

859
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:13,212
Make sense?

860
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:16,799
- Oh. Ok. Fine.

861
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:18,467
You can all pick me up
this Sunday morning.

862
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,220
- All right!

863
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:22,721
That's what I'm
talkin' about!

864
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,723
Shaggy!

865
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,058
That was good.

866
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,226
It will be good
to have you back.

867
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:35,651
- Take that.

868
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:38,529
- Got any chocolate?

869
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:58,859
- Little boy grabs his
sister by the hand.

870
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,487
He goes up to the door and
he turns the doorknob and he

871
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:03,322
opens the door.

872
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:06,325
And then he sees this huge
black coffin staring down at

873
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,869
them, its mouth just
opening and closing.

874
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,913
Opening and closing.

875
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:12,831
The little boy and the
little girl they scream.

876
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:13,874
They run to the bathroom.

877
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,292
It's their last chance.

878
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:18,629
They lock it and the little
boy is so scared, he hops

879
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:21,340
into the bathtub and he
closes the shower curtain.

880
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,383
And the little girl is in the
corner just cowering, rocking

881
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:24,676
back and forth.

882
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,679
Well, finally she gets up
and she opens the medicine

883
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,432
cabinet and she grabs the
cough drops and she throws

884
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,601
them at the coffin.

885
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,354
And it stops the coffin!

886
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,148
- Lisa, that's awful!

887
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,566
There was nothing scary
about that at all.

888
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:41,443
- Seriously.

889
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,070
- I want my life back after
you telling that story.

890
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:44,488
- You can't get it back.

891
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:47,366
- That scared me, you guys.

892
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,575
- What?

893
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,701
- What?

894
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:50,536
- That scared you?

895
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:51,537
Are you serious?

896
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:52,955
- That scared you?

897
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,796
- Hey. Hey, can you
guys hear that?

898
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,259
- Yeah, it sounds like a
motorcycle or something.

899
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,719
Who would be riding out
in the woods at night?

900
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,354
- Look. I think that
guy just crashed!

[Thud)

902
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,024
- Let's go check it out.

903
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:21,858
- My gosh.

904
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:22,693
No!

905
01:04:22,818 --> 01:04:24,570
No!

906
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,040
- Guys, is he ok?

907
01:04:41,128 --> 01:04:45,007
- What's going on?

908
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:03,984
- Get away from him!

909
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,402
Get away!

910
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,404
Back up!

911
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:11,199
Back up!

912
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:12,784
Let me see your hands!

913
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,078
Put your hands where
I can see them!

914
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:28,717
- You have the right
to remain silent.

915
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,218
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a

916
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:33,889
court of law.

917
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:35,223
If you can't afford an
attorney, one will be

918
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,683
appointed to represent you.

919
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:37,768
Do you have any questions?

920
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,561
Do you understand that?

921
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:54,034
- Your lawyer is
here to see you.

922
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,913
Over here.

923
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:12,594
- Step back.

924
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:40,372
- Let's see what
we can do here.

925
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,290
I got to tell you with this
kind of evidence, you really

926
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:44,292
could be in here for life.

927
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,670
- Wait.

928
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:51,425
There's something I
need to tell you but --

929
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:56,388
can they hear us?

930
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,514
- Yes, we're
being monitored.

931
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:01,685
Just a minute.

932
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,937
Write it down.

933
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:24,916
- There's no way.

934
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,794
- Yeah.

935
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,430
- Your attorney said you
need to make a phone call.

936
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,683
You got two minutes.

937
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:53,653
- So you're just going to
let me rot here in jail?

938
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:57,073
It's not right.

939
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,494
One man shouldn't pay
for another man's sins.

940
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,370
- Oh really?

941
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:07,876
Isn't that what you've been
preaching to me for years?

942
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:10,128
- That's not fair,
and you know it.

943
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,465

always fair, brother!
