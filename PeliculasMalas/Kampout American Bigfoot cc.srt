1
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,715
(electric sizzling)

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,690
(ominous music)

3
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,900
(creature huffs and growls)

4
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,470
(creature breathes loudly)

5
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,818
- I'm so bored.

6
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:56,290
(creature huffs)

7
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,898
All right.

8
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,235
I'm gonna make some popcorn.

9
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,983
(creature huffs)

10
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,523
(ominous music)

11
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,876
(creature huffs)

12
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:28,749
(creature growls
 softly and sniffs)

13
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,321
(creature grunts)

14
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,056
(crashing)

15
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:39,059
(suspenseful music)

16
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,740
(creature growls)

17
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,038
(creature growls)

18
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,924
There's something in the house.

19
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,593
Yes, there's something
 in the house.

20
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,963
There's something in the house.

21
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,032
Oh my gosh, please hurry!

22
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,375
(creature huffs and pants)

23
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,298
(creature pants)

24
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,274
(suspenseful music)

25
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,108
- Kayla!

26
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,878
Get in the house!

27
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,581
It's not in there,
 it's out here!

28
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,823
(crickets chirping)

29
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,047
(soft breathing)

30
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:57,425
(creature grunts softly)

31
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,160
(creature pants)

32
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,797
(creature growls)

33
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,902
(creature growls loudly)

34
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,270
- [Man] Holy shit!

35
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,474
(creature roars)

36
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,910
(creature growls softly)

37
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,286
(creature sniffs)

38
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,557
(creature growls)

39
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,392
(creature growls)

40
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,498
(creature growls loudly)

41
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:41,602
(dramatic, energetic rock music)

42
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,353
(indistinct chattering)

43
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,596
- [Woman] Your boyfriend's here.

44
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,532
- Um, hey, will you tell him
 I'll be there in a minute?

45
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,233
I've gotta drop this
 coffee off at table seven

46
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,501
and then check in
 on the kitchen.

47
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,503
- I sure will, in a sec.

48
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,409
(man grunts softly)

49
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,081
- Oh, crap.

50
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,116
- Is everything all
 right here, sir?

51
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,585
- Uh, actually no.

52
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,119
My bacon wasn't crispy,

53
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,487
my eggs were running
 all over the place,

54
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,455
and my toast is burned.

55
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,558
- Well, your eggs
 were scrambled.

56
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,627
But it seems like you
ate a lot of it already.

57
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,828
- Well, I struggled
 with most of it,

58
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,430
and I'm not satisfied at all.

59
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,566
- How about I go get the kitchen
to make you another plate?

60
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,500
How's that sound?

61
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,434
- No, no!

62
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,670
No, my stomach's upset now.

63
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,673
- Hey Nick, Marilynn
 is busy over there.

64
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,708
But she'll be here in a minute.

65
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,275
Can I get you anything?

66
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,143
- Coffee.

67
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,177
- Extra cream, right?

68
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,212
- Yeah.
- Okay, got it.

69
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,113
There we go.

70
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,347
- Joan.
- Yeah?

71
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,281
- Why's Lisa here today?

72
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,216
Shouldn't she be at school?

73
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,417
- Oh, she wasn't feeling well.

74
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,119
And you know, on
 such a short notice,

75
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,487
there's no way she
 could get a sitter.

76
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,624
- I'm sorry, sir.

77
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,458
Like I said, I'd be happy
 to get you another plate.

78
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,962
- [Customer] I said I
 wanted crispy bacon!

79
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,232
- Hi, Nick.

80
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,900
- Lisa, how you doing?

81
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,401
- I'm good.

82
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,603
- Ah, you're good?

83
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,904
I heard you were sick today.

84
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,440
- Oh, that's what I
 meant. (coughs weakly)

85
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,342
I'm not feeling so well.

86
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,977
- Well, I hope you feel
a little bit better.

87
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,612
Wouldn't want you
 getting behind in school.

88
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,147
- Can you keep a secret?

89
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,514
- Of course.

90
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,583
- Well, I'm not really sick.

91
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,253
I just didn't wanna
 go to school today.

92
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,755
- Why didn't you wanna
 go to school today?

93
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,089
- Well, I told Marty Schulz

94
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,958
that I wanted to
 marry him someday.

95
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,793
And he told all of his friends

96
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,662
and they all laughed at me.

97
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,163
- Lisa, you're in sixth grade.

98
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,097
I think you're a
little too young

99
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,565
to be worrying about marriage.

100
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,935
- Oh silly, I meant in
high school or someday.

101
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,837
- Well, I think
 Marty'd be a lucky man

102
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,338
to marry you at any age.

103
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,007
- You really think so?

104
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,308
- I'm sure of it.

105
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,278
- Now, when will you
 come to your senses?

106
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,479
- Come into my senses?

107
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,782
- When are you
 gonna marry my mom?

108
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,952
- I'd be better off if you
 were better at your job.

109
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,955
Oh, what's this?

110
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,857
You called the Army in?

111
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,195
What can I do for you, captain?

112
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,898
- Is that any way
 to talk to a lady?

113
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,565
- Well, you know, I mean,
 there'd be no problem here

114
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,102
if they got my order right.

115
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,503
- John, I get it.

116
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,672
After they closed the mine,

117
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,107
times have been
 tough for everybody.

118
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,442
But you can't be treating
 people like this.

119
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,510
- That's easy for you to say.

120
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,678
You got a job.

121
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,447
- Tell you what.

122
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,252
- What's this for?

123
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,353
- If you don't want
 it, I'll take it back.

124
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,222
- No, that's okay.

125
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,124
I'm just asking what it's for.

126
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,459
- Just like to help you out.

127
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,463
Got a job opening, State Park.

128
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,365
- A state job?

129
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,667
That's a great job, man.

130
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,303
That's better than shoveling
 shit at Jacob's farm.

131
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,372
- All right, the
 pay's not that great.

132
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,306
It's my old position.

133
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,908
But at least it'd be a start.

134
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,845
- Well, that's okay,
 man, I need a job.

135
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,880
- [Nick] Could you come in
 for an interview Monday at 11?

136
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,914
- Absolutely.

137
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,883
My wife would be really happy.

138
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,852
- One more thing.

139
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,187
You've got to quit drinking.

140
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,588
Can you do that?

141
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,390
- Yeah, I can do that.

142
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,892
- Can I have that?

143
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,228
- You just asked me
 to quit drinking.

144
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,931
Now you want my flask
 and you drink my alcohol?

145
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,567
- I want your flask
 so you don't drink it.

146
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,401
- Oh.

147
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,240
- All right.

148
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,143
I'll see you Monday
 at 11 o'clock.

149
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,545
Make sure she gets a
 good tip, all right?

150
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,882
And don't forget, no drinking.

151
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:55,849
You can do that?

152
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,117
- Right, yeah, I can do that.

153
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,653
- [Nick] All right,
 see you Monday.

154
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,289
- Starting tomorrow.

155
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,660
- [Joan] Hi, Tom.

156
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,096
- Hey, Joan, can I get
a cup of coffee, please?

157
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,865
- Sure, I'll bring
 it right over.

158
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,068
(Tom sighs)

159
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,346
- Oh, hello, Tom.

160
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,848
- Hey John, how you doing?

161
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,983
- I'm doing all right.

162
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,853
- How about a little ride home?

163
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,087
- I'd like that.

164
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,655
- I'm ready when you are.

165
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,190
- All right.

166
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,460
- Joan, I'm gonna have to
 cancel that coffee, okay?

167
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,294
Thank you.

168
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,401
- Howdy, babe.

169
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,236
I know you are so busy.

170
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,670
I'm sorry to stop in.

171
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,006
But tonight, I got
 something special planned.

172
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:53,841
- Yeah?

173
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,242
- [Nick] Six o'clock.

174
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,109
- Okay.
 - I'm picking you up.

175
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,177
Put something nice on.

176
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,278
I'll see you then.

177
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,446
- Okay.

178
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,648
- Right, I love you.
 - Love you.

179
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,823
- [Tom] How you doing there?

180
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,758
- Fine, thanks.

181
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:12,993
- Where you headed?

182
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,761
- I was gonna go up
 in the hills to camp.

183
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,996
- Oh yeah.

184
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,298
Well, there are plenty
of places to pick from.

185
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,400
Looks like you got
 perfect weather, too.

186
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,902
- Sure is.

187
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,303
- Well, you go and have
 yourself a good time now,

188
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,005
and be safe, okay?

189
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,874
- All right, thank you.

190
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:30,043
(gentle guitar music)

191
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,616
- I wanna live a metaphor life.

192
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,785
You know, like I
 read in that book.

193
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,489
People say, "He lived
 a life worth living."

194
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,657
That's what I'm going for.

195
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,829
And right there.

196
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,766
Morning sun, man.

197
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,035
This is where we get

198
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,570
the National
 Geographic-level finish, man.

199
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,106
- Heck, yeah.

200
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:03,010
I was here last week and
 there were turkeys everywhere.

201
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,045
- That's what I'm talking about.

202
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,981
See, we don't have to
 sell a documentary series.

203
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,150
I don't need to be a star.

204
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,254
We're the documentary, the
 turkeys are right there.

205
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,523
- I wanna be a
 filmmaker and stuff.

206
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,357
- Exactly.

207
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,093
So we go slow, right?

208
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,628
Stealth, whatnot.

209
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:26,166
And then you utilize your
 cinematographic expertise.

210
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,068
- Like cinematic art.

211
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,870
- I'm talking Smithsonian
 Channel, brother.

212
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,405
This ain't no Honey Boo Boo.

213
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,575
(gentle guitar music)

214
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,153
(huffs)

215
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,323
(gentle guitar music)

216
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,486
(engine starts)

217
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:03,563
(car rumbles softly)

218
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,468
- Goddammit!

219
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:10,437
John Hicks.

220
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,007
Oh hi, Honey, how you doing?

221
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:14,841
Yeah.

222
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,813
Look, you never mind about
that land and my brother, okay?

223
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,783
My daddy said, "Do not
 sell the land to anybody."

224
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,851
I don't,

225
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,319
(stutters)

226
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,154
Honey, I,

227
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,326
listen, (stutters)
 wait a minute.

228
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,162
I was down at Tammy's.

229
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,434
Tammy's, the restaurant
down on Canal Street.

230
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,735
Yes.

231
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,805
Listen, the Ranger
 came over to me

232
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,007
and he told me that I
 have a job interview

233
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,710
at 10 o'clock on Monday.

234
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,245
Yes.

235
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,513
I am not drunk.

236
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,485
Honey, (stutters) look.

237
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,488
(stutters and huffs)

238
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,428
Honey, look, honey.

239
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:15,802
Whoa, Honey, (vocalizes
hissing and grumbling)

240
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,071
yeah, (stutters) breaking up.

241
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,241
Yeah, oh, (stutters).

242
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,715
(soft guitar music)

243
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,685
Why'd she got to piss me off?

244
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,292
(mutters to himself)

245
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,362
(twig crackles)

246
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,796
Hey, who is that?

247
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,669
(eerie guitar music)

248
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,414
(door squeals)

249
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,715
- Hi.

250
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,749
- Hi.

251
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,185
- Are we still on for tonight?

252
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,986
- Of course.

253
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,088
- What time am I picking you up?

254
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:42,922
- 7:30.

255
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:44,891
- Nice.

256
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,396
That's a real nice
 color on you, too.

257
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:50,230
- Thanks.

258
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,500
- You're welcome.

259
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,069
- So you're gonna
 pick me up at my home?

260
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,738
- Yeah, 'course.
- Okay.

261
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,309
- Now, you gotta drive over
 to the diner by yourself.

262
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,412
(woman huffs)

263
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,415
- All right, so 7:30, okay?

264
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,749
- Yeah, I'll pick
 you up at your house.

265
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:10,583
- [woman] Okay.

266
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,418
- All right, Sweetheart.

267
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,252
- Bye.

268
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,422
(gentle guitar music)

269
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,495
(gunshot bangs)

270
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,437
- [Man] Woo-hoo, heck yeah!

271
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:31,838
It's a damn clean shot.

272
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,774
- [Nick] You boys
 enjoying yourselves?

273
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,175
- [Both] Uh.

274
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,878
- Yeah, guess you
 could say that.

275
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,179
- You guys do know
 that shooting a deer

276
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,216
outside of the season is
against the law, right?

277
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,717
- Well, yeah, but,

278
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,488
we didn't shoot this deer.

279
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,323
This deer was dead
 when we come upon it.

280
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,591
Ain't that right, Ernest?

281
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,592
- That's right,
 Jeb, it was dead.

282
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,126
We just walked right up on it.

283
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,362
- [Jeb] Yep.

284
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,863
- All right, so you're
expecting me to believe

285
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,266
that you guys were just
 walking through the forest

286
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,368
on this trail, with guns,

287
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,671
and you came across a dead deer?

288
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:05,938
- Yup, yes sir.

289
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,941
That's quite a story.

290
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,577
Well, you don't mind if I
 check your guns, then, do you?

291
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,579
- [Jeb] Wait, don't you
 need a warrant to do that?

292
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,913
- Oh yeah, don't
 you need a warrant?

293
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,081
- A warrant?

294
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,616
No, no, we're all good.

295
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,351
Don't worry about it.

296
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,390
All right, this gun is clean.

297
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,492
Mind if I check this gun?

298
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,063
(gun clicks)

299
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,366
Yeah, we got a problem, guys.

300
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,168
(both grunt and stutter)

301
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,637
(shot blasts)

302
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,372
Get back here.

303
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,874
(Jeb chuckles)

304
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,376
Why?

305
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,711
Why would you run?

306
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,212
- Scared, I guess.

307
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,650
- That gun was fine.

308
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,519
I don't think I need to ask,

309
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,187
but who's the owner of this gun?

310
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,590
- That'd be mine, sir.

311
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,826
- Now, wasn't that
 easier than lying?

312
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,395
- Oh man, you're not gonna
 give us a ticket, are you?

313
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,297
- Don't you think
 you deserve one?

314
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,798
- Well, yeah, but,

315
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,101
couldn't you give us a break?

316
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,870
- Yeah, come on,
give us a break.

317
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,238
- Did you give
 this deer a break?

318
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,239
- Yeah, right through the neck,

319
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,073
can't you see that? (chuckles)

320
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,575
- Shut up, Ernest.

321
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,809
- All right, guys.

322
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,711
You're catching me
 in a very good mood,

323
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,414
'cause I'm gonna be
 proposing to my lady tonight.

324
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,382
- Oh!

325
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,083
Hey, well, congratulations.

326
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:24,917
- Good luck, man.

327
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:25,852
- Yeah, yeah.

328
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,119
I'm sure she's gonna say yes.

329
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,621
You're a good looking
 man, don't you think?

330
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,889
- What, you getting
 queer on me or something?

331
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,190
- No man, I'm just saying.

332
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,224
- Whatever.

333
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,593
- Anyway.

334
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,761
I'm gonna let you guys off

335
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,930
with just a warning
 this one time.

336
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,300
But I want you guys
 to take this deer

337
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,702
down to my truck.

338
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:43,670
(Ernest huffs)

339
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,904
I'll take the guns, you grab--

340
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,807
- You serious?
 - Are you serious?

341
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,676
- Do I look serious?

342
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:50,510
Let's go.

343
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,981
- (stutters) Could
 we gut it first?

344
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,549
- Does it look like we
 have time to gut it?

345
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,384
Let's go!

346
00:21:58,551 --> 00:21:59,819
- Shot it through the neck.

347
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,654
What were you thinking?

348
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,924
(both grunt and groan)

349
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,797
(soft breathing)

350
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,438
- Hey, who is that?

351
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,949
Hey, who is that?

352
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,654
You don't understand
who you're messing with!

353
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,424
Hey, who keeps doing that?

354
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,525
Cut that out!

355
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:43,763
You know I'm gonna find you.

356
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,299
(creature grunts softly)

357
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,267
Hey, come out here!

358
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,336
(creature grunts softly)

359
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,404
Who's out there?

360
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,172
Oh, the heck with it.

361
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:57,276
(mutters to himself)

362
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,079
You ain't supposed to be here.

363
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,781
This is private land.

364
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,486
(shot booms, creature roars)

365
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:09,388
(low, tense music)

366
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,802
(creature grunts)

367
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,076
Hey, you come out
 from behind that tree.

368
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,681
(creature huffs and grunts)

369
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,283
(shot booms)

370
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:40,119
(creature grunts)

371
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,056
(creature roars)

372
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,328
(John screams)

373
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,266
(blood squelches)

374
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:59,472
(creature grunts and whines)

375
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,355
(roars sadly)

376
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,035
- [Paula] Wow.

377
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,303
First class service.

378
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,207
- I'm not quite sure
 I understand what
 you mean by that.

379
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,342
- Car, silly.

380
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,176
- Oh.

381
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,147
Well, my real car
 is in the shop,

382
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,615
so it's gonna have to do.

383
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,415
- That's okay.

384
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,951
This is awesome.

385
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,285
Can you turn the lights on?

386
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,954
- Uh, for you I can.

387
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:49,956
Boom.
- Whoop, whoop!

388
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,190
- There you go.

389
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,058
- That's awesome.
 - Pretty cool, huh?

390
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,025
You like that?

391
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,460
- I like it.

392
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,494
- Guess where I'm taking you.

393
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,663
- [Paula] Where?

394
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:57,930
- Just, we're going
 to this place,

395
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,032
they serve nothing but
 caviar and champagne.

396
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,400
- That's it?

397
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,235
I have to work
 after, I can't drink.

398
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,938
- Okay, well, actually I'm
 taking you to the diner.

399
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:06,773
I was messing with you.

400
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:07,674
- [Paula] Ooh, wow.

401
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,609
(both chuckle)

402
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,877
- Is that okay?
- That's okay.

403
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:11,844
- It's all right? All right.

404
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,112
- Let's do it.

405
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,513
- You sure?
 - Yeah.

406
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,150
- All right, let's do it.
 - Okay, let's go.

407
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,554
(creature growls softly)

408
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,527
(both creatures growl
 and grunt softly)

409
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,917
(larger creature
 roars and grunts)

410
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,356
(roars)

411
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:09,568
(creature breathes softly)

412
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,874
(sniffs)

413
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,778
(breathes softly)

414
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:29,221
(tense, suspenseful music)

415
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,737
(breathes softly)

416
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:08,527
(tent rustles softly)

417
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,929
- Shit.

418
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,432
(creatures growls softly)

419
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,075
(tense music intensifies)

420
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,834
(creature breathes softly)

421
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,540
(creature growls loudly)

422
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,878
(creature roars)

423
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,412
(cracking and squelching)

424
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:37,016
(creature roars and huffs)

425
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,361
(roars)

426
00:28:56,202 --> 00:29:00,406
- So, uh, Paula, I had
 a really nice time.

427
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,708
- I had a really
 awesome time, Tom.

428
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,844
- Really?
 - Um-hm.

429
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:07,346
- Is it something
you'd like to do again?

430
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,447
- Of course.

431
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:09,381
- Okay.

432
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,317
Well, we definitely should then.

433
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,318
- We should.

434
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,034
Oh wow, I gotta be at
 work in 15 minutes.

435
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:29,135
- Okay.
- Okay.

436
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,136
- All right.

437
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,605
(car door slams)

438
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,773
- See you tomorrow.
 - Yes, ma'am.

439
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,607
- Okay.

440
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,851
(sighs)

441
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,619
- Ma'am?

442
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,720
Uh, you okay?

443
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,192
- Did you see it?

444
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,027
- Uh, see what, ma'am?

445
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:33,065
- A big, hairy
 creature or something.

446
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,567
It just jumped up
 in front of me.

447
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,837
I swerved to miss it
 and hit this tree.

448
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,443
- Are you sure about that?

449
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,611
- Yes, it was,

450
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,982
it just jumped out
 so fast that I, uh,

451
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,652
didn't have time to react.

452
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:59,325
- Uh, well, it was most likely
 a deer, don't you think?

453
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,793
- Sonny, I know what
 a deer looks like,

454
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,562
and this was no deer.

455
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,798
It was ungodly big, huge.

456
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,070
- Uh-huh.

457
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,339
Ma'am, could you tell
 me your name, please?

458
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,173
- Oh yeah.

459
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,641
My name is Lois Stevens.

460
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,044
I live up the road from here.

461
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,880
- I'm gonna need
 to see your license

462
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,815
and your proof of
 insurance, please.

463
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,184
I'm gonna call you an ambulance

464
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,020
and probably most
 likely a tow truck.

465
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,191
If you could give me that
 paperwork, I'd appreciate it.

466
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,896
- You sit tight, okay?

467
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,265
I'll be right back.

468
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:40,766
Just sit there.

469
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,001
Don't move too much 'cause
 you might be injured, okay?

470
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,070
I'm not allowed to
 touch you or move you.

471
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,371
- Thank you.

472
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,574
- I'll be back couple
 of minutes, sit tight.

473
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,294
Dispatch, it's 239.

474
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,996
I got a single car accident,

475
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:14,400
license plate Frank, Nora,
Edward, five, one, nine, seven.

476
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,105
I'm out on Route 28, about two
 and a half miles south of 33.

477
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,839
Looks like I'm gonna
 need an ambulance

478
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,242
and most likely a tow truck.

479
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,743
Copy that?

480
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,713
- [Paula Through Speaker]
 Okay, 239, we're on it.

481
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,215
- Okay, copy that.

482
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,961
Miss Stevens, hi.

483
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,431
I'm gonna try and open the door,

484
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:46,965
just give you a little
 bit more room, okay?

485
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,434
Looks like it's a little
jammed, so hang on.

486
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,268
- Okay.

487
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,005
(Tom grunts softly)

488
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:56,442
(door thuds, Lois gasps)

489
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,709
- [Tom] You okay?

490
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,610
- Uh, yeah.

491
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:01,980
- The ambulance is
 on its way, okay?

492
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,782
I'm not really allows to
touch you or move you.

493
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,219
But why don't we just
 get back to, you know,

494
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,387
what you were talking about,

495
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:11,890
you telling me
 about what you saw?

496
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,895
- Uh, well, at first sight
 I thought it was a person.

497
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,565
But it was way too big for that.

498
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,268
No way it was a man.

499
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,503
- [Tom] Too big, huh?

500
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,674
- It was huge and furry,
 with long arms and very tall.

501
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:35,347
It took maybe two or three
 steps to cross the road.

502
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,849
- Uh-hm.

503
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:45,391
- Well, you do
 believe me, don't you?

504
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,063
- Oh yeah, no, of course I do.

505
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,064
- [Lois] Oh.

506
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,073
- Ambulance is
 gonna be here soon.

507
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,241
- Okay.
- Okay.

508
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,312
(Lois sighs)

509
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:08,814
(dog barking)

510
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,318
- Bear, quiet down.

511
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,324
- Hey, why is Bear
 barking, Tommy?

512
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,026
- I don't know, Mom.

513
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,428
What is it, Bear?

514
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,632
Something out there, buddy?

515
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,135
(dog barking)

516
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:42,114
- Tommy, I got
 another bag for you!

517
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,517
- [Tommy] Okay, Mom,
 I'll be right there!

518
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,019
(dog barking)

519
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,029
Who's there?

520
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,003
Man!

521
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,739
What is that smell?

522
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,245
(creature growls)

523
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:17,249
(creature roars, Tommy screams)

524
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:19,718
- Tommy!

525
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,253
Tommy, what is it?

526
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,889
(pants) What?

527
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,425
Tommy, where are you?

528
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:29,161
Tommy, please come out.

529
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,330
Oh my God, what was that?

530
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,266
Oh my God! (pants)

531
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,737
- 911, may I help you?

532
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,006
- Yes, it's my son.

533
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,508
He's been kidnapped.

534
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:45,377
- Okay, ma'am, calm down
 and tell me where you are.

535
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,446
- I live at 1314
School Rod Road.

536
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,181
Please send someone, hurry!

537
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,649
- Okay, tell me what happened.

538
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,351
- Oh, he was taking
 out the garbage

539
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,052
and I asked him to come
and get another bag,

540
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,921
and he said okay and
 the next thing I know,

541
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,723
he's screaming for me.

542
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:58,957
He's screaming my name, "Mom!"

543
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,627
I go running out of the
house and I'm looking

544
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:02,894
and I don't see him anywhere.

545
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,763
I heard him calling for
me, started coming out,

546
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,298
and all of a sudden
 I see someone running

547
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,834
really, really fast
 through the woods.

548
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,736
- Was it your son going
through the woods?

549
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,438
- No, no, there's no way!

550
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:13,572
It was going way too fast

551
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,674
and he's only 12 years old.

552
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,976
Please, please send
 someone, hurry!

553
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,479
Hurry, come and
 help me get my son.

554
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,447
- Okay, Mrs. Jones.

555
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,881
I have a deputy nearby.

556
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,451
- Okay, okay, send
 him down please.

557
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:26,852
Thank you, thank you so much.

558
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,620
Please hurry!

559
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,491
- [Paula Through
 Speaker] 239 dispatch.

560
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,426
- Yeah, dispatch, it's 239.

561
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,427
- [Paula Through Speaker]
 We have a missing child

562
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,829
over at 1314 School Rod Road.

563
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,198
Is it possible for
 you to check this out

564
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,800
as soon as possible?

565
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,035
- Well, I'm finishing up here
 in about five, 10 minutes.

566
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,004
So I can get there real
quick if you need me to.

567
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,640
- [Paula Through Speaker]
 All right, thank you.

568
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,641
- Copy that.

569
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,291
- Ambulance is coming,
 but here's my card.

570
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,692
Wanna give it to you.

571
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:07,626
If you have any questions,
 you need anything,

572
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,227
you just give me a call, okay?

573
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,729
- Okay, all right.

574
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:12,931
- [Tom] Ambulance
 be here any second.

575
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:13,932
You just hang tight, all right?

576
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,701
- Thank you, officer.

577
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,875
(tense music)

578
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:31,016
(brake squeals, creature growls)

579
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,496
- (pants) Help me, help me!

580
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,865
Oh my God, it's my son.

581
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,133
- What's the matter, ma'am?
 - He's missing!

582
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,401
My son is missing!

583
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,636
- Okay, okay, calm
 down, calm down.

584
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:51,937
Step away from the
 vehicle, please,

585
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,104
so I can help you.

586
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,940
- [Mrs. Jones] Please,
 please help me.

587
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,042
- Talk to me, slow
 down, calm down.

588
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,176
Calm down, tell
 me what happened.

589
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,811
- He was taking out the trash.

590
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,547
He was taking out the trash,

591
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,048
and then he was
 already out there,

592
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:06,318
so I asked him, please just
 take another bag for me.

593
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,953
- All right, ma'am, show
me where this happened.

594
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,855
- It was right over there.

595
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,490
- Do you see it, can
 you see the barrel?

596
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,924
- Yeah, I can see it.
 - He was right there.

597
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,993
And then they was running
really fast right through there.

598
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,463
It was something, I
 know it was my son.

599
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:18,296
(gasps)

600
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,798
- Okay.

601
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,033
Was there anything that you
 noticed that was unusual?

602
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,201
- Just the dog.

603
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,036
Our dog was barking
 hysterically.

604
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,505
And it wasn't like him at all.

605
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:27,606
It was just odd.

606
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,408
- Uh-uh, how so?

607
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,877
- Well, like it was trying
 to protect him or something.

608
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,111
It was just really different.

609
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,646
- Okay, okay.
- I don't know.

610
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,647
- Okay, ma'am,
 I'm gonna need you

611
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,383
to just calm down, okay?

612
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:39,985
I'm gonna go up there, I'm
 gonna check it out, all right?

613
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,520
- Okay.
 - So stay right here.

614
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,788
- Okay.

615
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:45,857
Just, just please be careful.

616
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:46,792
Be careful!

617
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:51,897
(suspenseful music)

618
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,450
(tense music)

619
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,636
(sniffs)

620
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:31,970
Oh my God, damn!

621
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,907
Shit. (huffs)

622
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:39,978
All right, ma'am.

623
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,213
I did not see
 anything out there.

624
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,515
- Okay.
- Okay?

625
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:44,783
But if something did happen,

626
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,218
they probably went
 in that direction.

627
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,319
- [Mrs. Jones] So
 what are you saying?

628
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,555
Are you saying
somebody kidnapped him?

629
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:50,689
- No, no, no, no.

630
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,459
Don't jump to conclusions, okay?

631
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,760
I'm gonna go over to my radio,

632
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,595
I'm gonna call in
search and rescue team.

633
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,029
They're gonna come down--
 - Thank you.

634
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,531
- And they're gonna
 look for your son,

635
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,232
see if they can find him, okay?

636
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,068
This is what I want
 you to do right now.

637
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,804
No, stop, stop, don't talk.

638
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,106
Don't jump to conclusions, okay?

639
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,742
We don't know anything
 that happened, all right?

640
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,410
Okay, so this is what
 I need you to do.

641
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,012
I'm gonna give you my card.
 - Okay.

642
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,080
- Okay?

643
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,615
You have any
questions, you call me.

644
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,949
But I need you to go in there,

645
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,619
sit down, and wait until
search and rescue comes,

646
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,420
'cause I'm gonna go, I'm
 gonna call 'em in right now.

647
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,222
- Thank you so much.
 - Okay?

648
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,791
Calm down, it'll be fine.

649
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,593
We'll find your son,
 everything's gonna be fine.

650
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:28,694
- [Mrs. Jones] I
 just want him home.

651
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:29,528
- Of course you do.

652
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:30,829
I do, too, ma'am.

653
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,430
Go in there and
 sit down, darlin'.

654
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,431
- Thank you so much.

655
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,399
- I'm gonna call
it in right now.

656
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:38,069
- [Mrs. Jones] Okay. (sobs)

657
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:47,245
(creature huffs
 and grunts softly)

658
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,636
- [Tom] Hey Paul, will
 you check this out for me?

659
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,470
- [Paul] What you got?

660
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,508
- [Tom] I found it about an
 hour ago at a crime scene.

661
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:17,976
Mrs. Jones' boy.

662
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,244
- This is ripe.

663
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,848
Well, it's not canine.

664
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,885
There's pieces of hide here.

665
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:27,986
(mumbles)

666
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,454
- Can you just give me a second?

667
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,689
I gotta talk to dispatch.

668
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:31,990
- [Paul] Yeah,
 I'll be right here.

669
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,892
- [Tom] Okay.

670
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:37,062
(gentle guitar music)

671
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,800
(men chatter softly)

672
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,071
- Camera right there.
 - Okay.

673
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,708
- [Younger Man] Man, this is it.

674
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,176
- Don't get any
 better than that.

675
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,310
- Hey, check, it's
 a turkey call.

676
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,112
Turkey call, no turkey call?

677
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,683
Yeah? Meh, I'll give
 it to you later.

678
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,719
(mutters to himself)

679
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,854
Lookin'.

680
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,491
We need a flashlight.

681
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,698
- What the hell?

682
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,202
Brian, Brian, you
 gotta see this.

683
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,436
- [Brian] Hold on, man.

684
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,370
I gotta find my, my
 other flashlight--

685
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,306
- No, no, you gotta see this.

686
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,608
- What?

687
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:23,675
- [Man] Look!

688
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:25,777
- Oh shit.

689
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,247
(creature huffs)

690
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,417
That's like a big-ass
 bear or something.

691
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,286
- That ain't no freaking bear.

692
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,454
It's got arms!

693
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,859
It's a Sasquatch.

694
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,193
- Goddammit, man!

695
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,662
I'm on meds and I drink!

696
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:46,231
Not funny, I don't believe you!

697
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,270
He's,

698
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,206
it's moving,

699
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,843
it's moving this way.

700
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:01,880
Uh.

701
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,714
No, no.

702
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:05,283
It's running this way.

703
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,752
- Oh shit, man!

704
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,820
(creature grunts)

705
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,923
(both yammer)

706
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,760
(creature growls)

707
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:19,698
- Man, this is gonna be
historical damn footage!

708
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,967
- Come on, let's--
 - Okay, okay, okay.

709
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,636
(Brian babbles)

710
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,741
Damn, no signal.

711
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:30,909
Damn Obamaphone!

712
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,043
- Who the hell are you calling?

713
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:32,978
- I'm gonna call Bobby.

714
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,212
He knows the park ranger.

715
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,013
- Run, we gotta
 get to the truck!

716
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:36,014
(creature growls)

717
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,382
- This way!
 - This way.

718
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:39,484
- Faster, faster!
 - I am, I am.

719
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:41,887
- My back is killing me, man!

720
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,992
(creature roars)

721
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,373
I got a signal, I got a signal.

722
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,921
(mutters to himself)

723
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,490
(phone rings)

724
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:21,659
- Hello?

725
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:25,396
- Hey Bob, how you doin'?

726
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,464
- Hey, Brian.

727
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,400
Uh, how are you?

728
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:32,704
- I'm doing fine, Bob.

729
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,372
Hey, I just need the number
 for that park ranger guy

730
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,041
that you know.

731
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,108
- Ranger Nick.

732
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:40,345
Why are you gonna bother him?

733
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,513
- Well, don't worry
 about it, Bob.

734
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,083
I just, me and Duane were
 out filming some turkeys

735
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,987
and we seen ourselves
 a straight up Bigfoot.

736
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:49,988
- A Bigfoot?

737
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,322
Yeah, okay.

738
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,324
- Yeah, we got the
 shit on video, okay?

739
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,193
So ha ha, Bob.

740
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,395
- Yeah, oh yeah, I see Bigfoots

741
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,330
out in my back
 yard all the time,

742
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,001
like seven feet tall
 some of them are.

743
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:07,538
- Oh yeah, you ever seen
a nine-foot, jackass?

744
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,476
- (sighs) Yeah, okay, um.

745
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,479
So here's his number,
 it's 555-7634.

746
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:21,719
Don't tell him I
 gave you this number.

747
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,121
- We'll try, Bob.

748
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:23,955
Thanks.

749
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,760
- He tried to call
 bullshit on you, didn't he?

750
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,028
- Yeah.

751
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:31,562
He was laughing until I
told him how big it was.

752
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,563
Son of a bitch.

753
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,698
(Duane giggles)

754
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,967
- So what do you got, Paul?

755
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,072
- Well, I can see what it's not.

756
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,508
It's not bear, it's not boar.

757
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,612
And it's not really a primate.

758
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,582
Whatever it is, it
 gashed itself pretty good

759
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,652
because there's
 traces of blood here.

760
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,122
- Look.

761
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,358
I gotta tell you something,

762
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,229
but you gotta promise to
keep it private, okay?

763
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:07,098
A few hours ago, I
 was investigating
 an accident, right?

764
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,434
A woman had wrecked her car.

765
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,836
And get this.

766
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:14,072
She told me the reason
 why she wrecked was

767
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:18,243
because a big, hairy creature
 jumped in front of her car.

768
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:21,712
- And?

769
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:25,616
- I didn't think much of it.

770
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,918
I thought she was kind of nuts.

771
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,987
So I got in my car,
 I was going over

772
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,956
and checking another
 scene, you know,

773
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,590
the missing Jones boy,

774
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,424
and, uh,

775
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,727
I saw it too.

776
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,100
Gotta understand something.

777
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,801
This thing was huge.

778
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,471
Okay, it was enormous.

779
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,607
It were covered in hair,
 too, like wool or something,

780
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:52,643
it jumped right out
 in front of my car.

781
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,646
And it took off at
 tremendous speed.

782
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:59,584
- And you found this
 sample in that area?

783
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:01,086
- Yeah!

784
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:05,023
Listen, Paul, I know what
 I saw, okay, I know it.

785
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:10,561
I know it sounds totally
crazy, like, (stutters)

786
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:13,564
I can't even believe it myself.

787
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,468
But I think we may have
a Bigfoot on our hands.

788
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,905
Or something like it.

789
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:20,805
- We might.

790
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,009
You know, I have an
 old friend of mine,

791
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:28,579
was very experienced in
incidences like this.

792
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,149
He knows what that smell means.

793
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:35,086
- Okay, great, could
 you call him even now?

794
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:38,023
- He lives about
 100 miles from here.

795
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:39,457
He'll be here in an hour

796
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:42,793
when I call him with
 this information.

797
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,363
We just have to keep
 it on the down low.

798
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,297
- No doubt.

799
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:52,503
- I'll get right on it.
- Okay, thanks, buddy.

800
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:55,006
(phone rings)

801
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:57,475
- Ranger Nick Thomas.

802
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:00,045
- Hey, hi, my name
 is Brian Johnson.

803
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:02,080
I'm a friend of Bob Wilkes.

804
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,983
- (laughs) How is
 old Bob nowadays?

805
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,184
- Oh, he's doing fine, sir.

806
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,852
Hey, listen, the reason
why I'm calling is,

807
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:10,855
me and my partner, we see a
 really, really weird thing

808
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:13,791
up on the, in the Hawking
 Hills area this morning.

809
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:14,625
- Okay.

810
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:18,496
What exactly did you see?

811
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:20,798
- Well, I'm just gonna give
 it to you straight, ranger.

812
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22,300
We seen a Bigfoot.

813
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,303
- A Bigfoot?

814
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,172
- It might sound a little crazy.

815
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:30,175
But the fact is,
 we got it on video.

816
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:33,878
Me and my partner Duane have it.

817
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,714
- All right, first things first.

818
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,816
Where exactly did you see this?

819
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:42,920
It's only about a mile
up on Happy Hollow Road.

820
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,422
- Okay.

821
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,224
You know, I'm actually not
 that far from that spot.

822
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:47,825
How about you meet me
 at the intersection

823
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:52,563
of 56 and Happy Hollow Road
 in, say, 15, 20 minutes?

824
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,165
- You've got it, man.

825
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:57,002
- All right, I
 will see you there.

826
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:03,241
- Boom!

827
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,143
(both yell over each other)

828
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,144
Very dangerous, very dangerous.

829
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:07,778
Drive, drive without passing.

830
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,679
Please, go.

831
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,233
- Hey, thanks for
 meeting me, guys.

832
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:29,434
Ranger Nick Thomas.

833
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:31,102
- How ya doing, man?

834
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:32,037
- Duane.

835
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:33,838
- So, uh, area's right up there.

836
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:35,006
Are you ready to go?

837
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,674
- Yeah, let's do it.

838
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:44,215
(gun safeties click)

839
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,050
Who, uh,

840
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,155
we're not gonna
 need those, are we?

841
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:54,292
- When you see the size of
 this thing, you'll understand.

842
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:57,262
- Okay, well, why don't
you show me the footage

843
00:49:57,262 --> 00:49:58,529
and then I'll understand.

844
00:49:58,529 --> 00:49:59,997
- Well, we kinda
 figured it'd be best

845
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,100
to take you to the actual place.

846
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,402
That way you can get
 an idea how big it is.

847
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:05,436
- All right, fair enough.

848
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,271
Let's go.

849
00:50:12,277 --> 00:50:13,711
All right, so which
 one of these trails

850
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,180
are we gonna be taking here?

851
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,614
- Well, we ain't going that way,

852
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,216
'cause that's where
 the Bigfoot went.

853
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:19,417
We'll go up this way.

854
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:20,718
- Sure, boss, come on.

855
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,387
- [Duane] After you.

856
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,829
- You guys ever hunted
 in this area before?

857
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,064
- Yeah, I have.

858
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:35,866
- Who owns this land?

859
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,435
- Old man Turner.

860
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,204
He's my dad's friend.

861
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,109
(creature huffs)

862
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:46,211
(sniffs)

863
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:52,583
(huffs and grunts)

864
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:14,139
This is it.

865
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,342
- This is where you saw it?

866
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:18,676
- Yep, this is it.

867
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:19,844
Tell him, Duane.

868
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,579
- Well, we were
 setting up right here,

869
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,914
and he was right down there.

870
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:28,186
- Can I see the footage now?

871
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:29,187
- Well, sure.

872
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,087
- Go ahead.

873
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,394
- All right.

874
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:37,695
That's the trigger right there?

875
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:38,863
- Right there.

876
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:41,766
- Oh my God.

877
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,168
That thing is huge!

878
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:44,435
- Thank you.

879
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,238
- [Duane] No, it's
 monstrous huge.

880
00:51:48,573 --> 00:51:51,008
- Let's go down to that tree.

881
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,313
- All right, I guess
 I'm not scared.

882
00:51:58,649 --> 00:51:59,984
- I mean, look at this.

883
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:01,852
Its arms are lower
 than its knees.

884
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,554
This thing is not human.

885
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,556
- It's all right there, bro.

886
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:09,527
- All right, I'm
 looking at this tree.

887
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:14,432
If we're at standing, this
 thing's almost nine feet tall.

888
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:15,266
- So who do we call?

889
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:16,767
CNN? Ghostbusters?

890
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,506
- Let's take it easy here, man.

891
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:22,740
This is huge.

892
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,242
- Life is different
 from hereon out, bro.

893
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:26,644
It's like alien contact.

894
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,146
- So it started
 walking this way.

895
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,450
- [Duane] It's a good thing we
 got out of here when we did.

896
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,419
- It was definitely
 heading in your direction.

897
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:37,988
- So you had sightings like
 this reported before, huh?

898
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,824
- Yeah, all the time.

899
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,227
But it's normally pretty hokey.

900
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:43,661
This is different.

901
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,995
We've got proof.

902
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,665
This is incredible.

903
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,435
- So much for turkey
 hunting videos, huh?

904
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:51,736
- Francis Coppola says

905
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:53,971
film is a series of
 brilliant accidents.

906
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,040
- Accidents, whatever,
 brilliant or not,

907
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,008
you guys, this thing
 does look aggressive.

908
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,944
I'm just, I'm glad
 nobody got hurt.

909
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:00,878
(twig cracks)

910
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,146
- Holy shit, did you hear that?

911
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:03,514
- Hold on, you guys,
 just hold on a sec.

912
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:04,982
Don't go shooting.

913
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:05,816
That brush is thick.

914
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,385
Just everybody relax.

915
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:08,219
- Oh, oh!

916
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,119
(shots crack)

917
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,355
Son of a bitch!

918
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,758
- [Duane] I hear that.

919
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,995
- Whoa, wait a minute.

920
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:21,031
Oh, you guys, look at this.

921
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,032
- [Brian] Wow.

922
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,303
- You know, that
is a foot print.

923
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:28,873
About 20 inches
 long, 10 inches wide.

924
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,141
- I thought I had big feet.

925
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:34,612
- Yeah, the more
 I think about it,

926
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:36,914
I'm convinced this
 thing is dangerous.

927
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,082
We should get out of here.

928
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,250
I got a couple
 calls I gotta make.

929
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,286
- [Brian] Heck, yeah.

930
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:42,820
- Brian, are you comfortable
 with me holding on

931
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,022
to this footage
 for a little bit?

932
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:46,457
- Tell you what, man.

933
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:49,093
I'm gonna keep the original,
 I'll give you a copy.

934
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,628
- Okay, but seriously, you guys,

935
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:52,162
we gotta keep this on lockdown.

936
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,432
Don't be putting it on TMZ,
 don't go on YouTube with it.

937
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,267
- No, man, I'm
 calling Gloria Allred.

938
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:57,968
This shit's serious.

939
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,236
(Nick huffs)

940
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,806
- Yeah, this is my
 retirement, man.

941
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:03,207
- Let's go, guys.

942
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,079
(knocking)

943
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,981
- There's no birthday
 party for me here.

944
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,783
- Hey, I'm glad you could come.

945
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,319
- Hey, good to see you, man.

946
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,386
How you doing?

947
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:16,186
- Well.

948
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:20,991
This is very fresh,

949
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,327
like last night.

950
00:54:23,528 --> 00:54:24,895
- (sniffs) Ho!

951
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:25,730
- Yeah.

952
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:28,366
- Where'd you get this?

953
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:29,300
- Tom found it.

954
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,702
Let me see if he's still here.

955
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,577
- Tired of sitting in my
 chair, like, flipping buggers,

956
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:40,511
you know what I mean?

957
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,746
- [Duane] I'm hip with that.

958
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:43,481
- My future's bright!

959
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:45,550
- Boom!
- Yes!

960
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:47,718
(knocking)

961
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:49,720
- [Woman] Come to this
 goddamn door, Duane!

962
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,489
Open it or I'll beat your ass!

963
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:52,790
- I don't have to take that.

964
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,724
(bangs on door)

965
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:54,792
- [Woman] Open this door!

966
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:55,726
- I'm busy.

967
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:59,664
- [Woman] I don't care if
you're walking on the damn moon!

968
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:01,699
I need my smokes and
 my lady products.

969
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,901
- You ain't gonna believe
 what's about to happen, Betty!

970
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:05,470
- [Betty] Shut the
 fuck up, Brian!

971
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,237
- You better pack for L.A.

972
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,874
- [Betty] Duane,
I'm warning you.

973
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:12,610
- I hear you, Baby, I hear you.

974
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,878
- You'll see, Betty.

975
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,279
- [Betty] Shut up, crack head.

976
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:16,714
- Hey, I'm sober.

977
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:20,351
I might drink a beer
 every now and then,

978
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,887
snort a little
Klonopin, but not like,

979
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:26,524
you know, (vocalizes buzzing).

980
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:27,892
- And here we go.

981
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:29,727
- Yes, yes! All right.

982
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,563
We got the original in--

983
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:33,798
- The place.

984
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,033
- The place, hell yeah,
full Shawshank, bitch.

985
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:37,167
Worst case scenario?

986
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,903
- We meet in the place.

987
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:40,371
Yes!

988
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:41,205
- Okay.

989
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:43,708
- Follow me.
 - I'll follow you.

990
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,942
Listen, we'll get my truck

991
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,143
at the end of the driveway.

992
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:47,211
You got the camera.

993
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:48,746
- I got the.

994
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:52,216
- Before we go out, you look
 right, I'm gonna look left.

995
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,088
I think we're safe.

996
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,256
- Let's do it.

997
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,463
- I see you, motherfuckers!

998
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,498
- [Brian] She's a
 scary son of a bitch!

999
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:09,400
She scares me more than Bigfoot.

1000
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,902
- [Duane] You ain't
 married to her!

1001
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,538
- [Brian] God, I love this shit.

1002
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:14,872
I'm so in my fricking element.

1003
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,106
- I hear ya.

1004
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:16,941
- [Brian] Who needs drugs?

1005
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:17,875
- Yeah.

1006
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,176
- [Brian] Crack is whack.

1007
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:20,177
- Holy shit, look out!

1008
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:21,879
(both scream)

1009
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,080
(creature roars)

1010
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,416
(both yell)

1011
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:28,118
(creature growls)

1012
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,053
- [Brian] Grab your shotgun.

1013
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,287
- Doggone, I got no shotgun.

1014
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:33,491
- [Brian] It's behind
 your seat, you fool.

1015
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:34,925
Shoot that bitch!

1016
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,398
- It, it's gone.

1017
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,101
- [Brian] Shit, it's gone.

1018
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,571
Thing's a hairy ghost, man.

1019
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,738
- Why don't we,

1020
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,640
we take the long way into town?

1021
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,908
- [Brian] I heard that.

1022
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,343
I'll turn this thing around.

1023
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,645
- All right, I basically just

1024
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:57,347
moved the reservation
 back an hour.

1025
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,550
No, everything, no,
 everything's fine.

1026
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,986
No, I appreciate you
 being so flexible.

1027
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,754
Um, you know what?

1028
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,723
I gotta get going here.

1029
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:08,493
No, tonight's gonna be awesome.

1030
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:09,560
All right, I love you, too.

1031
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,828
Bye.

1032
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:13,531
- [Brian] Ooh, shit is
 getting thick, ranger.

1033
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:14,499
- Why, what happened?

1034
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:15,966
Did somebody contact you?

1035
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,535
- Somebody needs to call
 the fucking Air Force, man!

1036
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,604
- We saw the thing again.

1037
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,338
And we think the
 thing is chasing us.

1038
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:23,608
- All right, calm down,
 everybody just calm down.

1039
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:24,441
Where's the video?

1040
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,275
Do you have it?

1041
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,644
- Go ahead, Duane.

1042
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:27,912
Take the whole camera, man.

1043
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:29,146
Analyze it all you want.

1044
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:31,381
We got the original
 copy sequestered.

1045
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,751
So anybody starts any
 shit about who owns what,

1046
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,419
everybody can suck my ass.

1047
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,287
- We'll see you in court.

1048
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,323
- Um, this is a digital chip.

1049
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:40,758
- So what?

1050
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:42,527
It ain't the golden chalice,
 brother, don't worry.

1051
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:43,961
- Uh, my point is,
 it doesn't matter

1052
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,229
where you hid the original.

1053
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:46,731
That's not how the
 technology works.

1054
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,198
- You know what, ranger?

1055
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,501
This whole thing is frankly
 fucking above you, dude.

1056
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,402
We should have gone
 straight to the damn FBI.

1057
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,038
I mean, come on,
you wear shorts.

1058
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:55,139
- I was in the Army
 for five years.

1059
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,240
I could kick your ass.

1060
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,542
- Well, wrong on me, then.

1061
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:59,409
I was a drug addict
 and I could not serve.

1062
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,879
- (sighs) One day, guys.

1063
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,814
All I'm asking for is one day.

1064
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:04,649
I just don't want
 the whole county

1065
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:05,750
going up in hysteria.

1066
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,217
You know, after that, you can do

1067
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,385
whatever you want
 with the footage.

1068
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:09,319
- Yeah, well, what
about the son of a bitch

1069
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,588
that's chasing me right now?

1070
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:11,956
- Us.

1071
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:14,324
- You guys, I gotta get
some work done here.

1072
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,160
- I must be speaking
 in gibberish.

1073
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,462
- The thing is out there, man.

1074
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:21,532
- All right, we need to do
 things one step at a time.

1075
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:22,767
(Brian sighs)

1076
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:24,669
Right now, the step
 I need you to take

1077
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:26,571
is to please leave.

1078
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:27,738
- Yeah, right.

1079
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,207
- Out.

1080
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,811
(Brian mutters to himself)

1081
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:42,386
- I'm Joe Hicks.

1082
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:43,187
I'm here to pick
 up the survey maps

1083
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:44,488
for the Hicks estate.

1084
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,924
- Are you John Hicks' brother?

1085
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:47,758
- Yeah.

1086
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:59,604
- Police department,
 may I help you?

1087
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,038
- Hello, officer.

1088
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,108
Yeah, this is Ranger Nick Thomas
from Lake National Forest.

1089
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:06,543
I, uh, I think we've
 got a problem here.

1090
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,279
- Okay, what might
 your problem be, sir?

1091
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,016
- Well, I got a call earlier
 from a few turkey hunters,

1092
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:14,151
and they've got
 some video footage

1093
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:17,087
of what they think
 to be a Bigfoot.

1094
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,591
- Really, a Bigfoot?

1095
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:24,829
First off, Mr. Thomas, isn't
 it, say, a little crazy?

1096
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,330
- Well, consider
 this a curtesy call

1097
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,565
because I do believe that
 this thing is aggressive

1098
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,300
and it's in the area.

1099
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,170
- Now, did you see this Bigfoot,

1100
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,774
or did some cracked out
 crack head tell you about it?

1101
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:38,676
- Sir, I think you should
 be taking this call

1102
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,711
a little bit more seriously.

1103
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:42,647
- Oh yeah, why is
 that, Mr. Ranger?

1104
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:44,815
You gonna call my Chief?

1105
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,917
- Hey Paul, you
 needed to see me?

1106
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,187
- Oh, Tom, this is the friend
 I was telling you about,

1107
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:52,690
the expert in the field.

1108
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,724
- Tom Benson.

1109
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:55,292
- Hank Fletcher, good to see ya.

1110
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,293
So you're the one
 that saw this, huh?

1111
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:57,527
- Yes, sir.

1112
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,929
- Why don't you
 tell me about it?

1113
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,932
- Uh, well, (sighs)

1114
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,770
I was investigating a woman
 who drove off the road.

1115
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,004
So I thought drunk driving.

1116
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:09,606
But now, she drove off the road

1117
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:13,644
because she saw a
 giant hairy Bigfoot.

1118
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,815
- Because we don't know
what this thing is,

1119
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:20,584
what it's capable of
doing, or what it wants.

1120
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:22,119
- Answer me this.

1121
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:25,155
How do you know that it is
 not someone in a costume?

1122
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:28,959
- It's too damn big to
 be a guy in a costume.

1123
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,561
- It's just down here,
 follow me, please.

1124
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:32,797
I wanna thank you, first of all,

1125
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:33,831
for coming in on
 such short notice.

1126
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,499
- No, it's my pleasure.

1127
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:36,834
I'm excited about this.

1128
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:38,936
- You instituted a (mumbles)?

1129
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,637
- [Hank] Yeah.

1130
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,906
- Yeah, so the first location

1131
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:43,340
I wanna take you
 to is real close.

1132
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,775
- Good, sooner the better.

1133
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,343
- Okay, enough is enough!

1134
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,378
No more of this Bigfoot crap!

1135
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,213
- Excuse me.

1136
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:50,748
Sergeant.

1137
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:52,482
Who're you talking to?

1138
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,685
- It's only a park ranger
 who claims, get this,

1139
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:57,487
there's a Bigfoot on
 the loose. (scoffs)

1140
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,923
- Give me that phone, please.

1141
01:00:58,923 --> 01:00:59,824
Gimme that!

1142
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,093
This is Detective
 Benson, who is this?

1143
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:04,528
Uh-huh.

1144
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:06,797
Okay, hang on, slow
 down, slow down.

1145
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,198
Where are you?

1146
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,033
Uh-huh.

1147
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,968
I know exactly where that is.

1148
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,636
Can you stay put for 15 minutes?

1149
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:14,304
I'll be right there.

1150
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:18,308
You're getting on my bad side.

1151
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,684
- [Woman] Are we still
 picking everyone else up?

1152
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,553
- [Man] No, we're just
 gonna meet them there.

1153
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:30,988
- [Woman] You're gonna
 love this place, Claudia.

1154
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,857
There are so many
 cute boys there.

1155
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:34,058
- [Young woman] (chuckles)
 Frankie, Steph said

1156
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,192
you're hooking me up

1157
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,226
with one of your
friends, though, right?

1158
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,461
- [Woman] Wait, what, Steph?

1159
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,996
- [Frankie] Yeah,
 I hooked her up.

1160
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:41,298
- [Claudia] Come on, Frankie,
 you hook Susan up and not me?

1161
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:42,699
I love you, too.

1162
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,934
- [Frankie] Sorry, Claudia,
 but there's gonna be

1163
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:45,202
other guys there,
 don't worry about it.

1164
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:48,005
- [Claudia] Yeah,
 you better hope so.

1165
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,391
- What the hell is this?

1166
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:10,394
- (sighs) What the?

1167
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:18,368
- Looks like someone drug
 it here or something.

1168
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:20,370
- [Woman] Yeah, it does.

1169
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:28,913
- Hey.

1170
01:02:28,913 --> 01:02:29,847
- Shit.

1171
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:31,248
- Sorry.

1172
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,283
- Was just looking at
what you're looking at.

1173
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:34,518
- I don't know.

1174
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:38,588
It's fine, I just don't
get why I'm so jumpy.

1175
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,723
- What's up, guys?

1176
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:40,858
- Just looking around.

1177
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:42,092
We should help.

1178
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,861
- Yeah, we need help
 moving this tree.

1179
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:45,229
- [Woman] Okay.

1180
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:47,697
(twig snaps)

1181
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,833
- You guys hear that?

1182
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:50,434
- Yeah, I heard it.

1183
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,539
- Damn, dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

1184
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:56,974
- What are you all doing?

1185
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,843
- We heard a noise and
 we're checking it out.

1186
01:02:58,843 --> 01:03:02,947
- Oh man, let's just move
 this tree and get out of here.

1187
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,057
- [Man] What's up, guys?!

1188
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:13,891
(girl squeals)

1189
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:14,825
- Oh my God!

1190
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:15,725
- You scared the shit out of me.

1191
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,827
(girl laughs)

1192
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:18,829
- Sorry, bro, just having fun.

1193
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:19,997
- [Man In Blue
 Shirt] Yeah, funny.

1194
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:21,398
- It's good to see you, man.

1195
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:22,967
- Yeah, you too.

1196
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,468
You put this tree here?

1197
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:27,404
- Yeah, had to get you to
 stop somehow, didn't I?

1198
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:28,605
- All right, can
 we please move this

1199
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,107
and just get out of here?

1200
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:34,078
- [Man In Gray Shirt] All
 right, you're the boss.

1201
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,551
- [Woman] One, two, three, now.

1202
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:55,465
- Thanks for meeting me, guys.

1203
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:56,733
Ranger Nick Thomas.

1204
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:58,202
- Tom Benson, this
 is Hank Fletcher.

1205
01:03:58,202 --> 01:03:59,303
- It's nice to meet you.

1206
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:00,704
What do you got?

1207
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:01,939
- All right, well,
 earlier today I got a call

1208
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:03,040
from a couple turkey hunters

1209
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,808
out in the Hawking Hills area.

1210
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,510
Now they're doing
 a documentary film,

1211
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,680
and they came across what
 they believe to be a Bigfoot.

1212
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,449
So I went out, checked
 everything out,

1213
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,351
and saw the location
 of the sighting.

1214
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,387
And get this, they got a video.

1215
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:19,523
- Where can we see this video?

1216
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,424
- Got it right in the truck.

1217
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:21,258
Let's go.

1218
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:25,896
- God, look at the
 size of that thing.

1219
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,164
It's gotta be eight feet.

1220
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:29,299
- Nine, and a beauty.

1221
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,135
- Yeah, I was right
 there at that tree.

1222
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:32,736
We're looking at nine feet.

1223
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:36,173
There's also a footprint
about 20 inches long.

1224
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:38,542
- I say we go check out
the footprint right now.

1225
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,077
- Nick, you tell anybody else?

1226
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:43,447
- No, just called your office
 and talked to Sergeant Moody.

1227
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:44,848
- Oh God, what'd he say?

1228
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,584
- (scoffs) More like
 Sergeant Asshole.

1229
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:50,420
Told me I was crazy, said the
 guys are probably on drugs.

1230
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,721
Very unprofessional.

1231
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,690
- He's not exactly
 Mr. Popularity.

1232
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,759
The other day I was dealing
 with a missing child case--

1233
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,427
- Wait, wait.

1234
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,196
You say there's a missing child?

1235
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,965
- Yeah, what about it?

1236
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,202
- This is just a
 hunch, all right?

1237
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,904
But just maybe this missing kid

1238
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,906
and our Sasquatch are connected.

1239
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,441
- How do you figure?

1240
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:14,478
- [Hank] Humans and primates
 share 96% of their DNA code.

1241
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:16,446
It's the most of
 any other mammal.

1242
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,648
There been actual cases
where human children

1243
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,750
have been raised by primates.

1244
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,753
Most recently, the
 feral child of Borneo

1245
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,490
and the Nigerian chimp boy.

1246
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,258
Maybe the Sasquatch
 abducted this kid

1247
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,128
to raise it as one of
 their own for some reason.

1248
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:32,862
I don't know, but
 it's just a guess.

1249
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,265
And I say we should
 go check the area.

1250
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,666
- Well, now, search and
rescue is still there,

1251
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,135
searching for the kid.

1252
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:39,369
- Great.

1253
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,138
If it did take him,
 maybe we'll find him.

1254
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:43,940
- Let's take my truck, just
 in case we got to off road.

1255
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,110
- I'll get a couple of
 walkies and a shotgun.

1256
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,844
- All right, pilgrim.

1257
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:10,067
- Hey.

1258
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:11,301
(people muttering)

1259
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,736
- I'm glad to see you
made it, little brother.

1260
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:14,871
- Hey, how you doing?

1261
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:16,206
- Another day in paradise.

1262
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:19,176
- You still (mumbles)
 like Rambo up here?

1263
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,778
- Always running
 your mouth, smartass.

1264
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:24,714
But yeah, little
 bit of Rambo here.

1265
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:27,751
- [Woman] Wait, I don't think

1266
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:28,818
that's the one I'm looking for.

1267
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,788
- I mean--
 - I'm hypnotizing you.

1268
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:33,657
- I mean, you could
 be tantalizing.

1269
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:34,491
If that's--

1270
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,759
- Ooh!

1271
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:38,362
(man chuckles)

1272
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:41,865
- Is it cool?

1273
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,968
- Aren't there more
 people than this?

1274
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:47,571
- Yeah, but there's a concert
 or something going on in town.

1275
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:49,906
It's supposed to be
 a pretty big thing.

1276
01:06:49,906 --> 01:06:51,175
But I mean, we got
 enough people anyways.

1277
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:52,342
We'll be fine.

1278
01:06:53,277 --> 01:06:54,744
Where's Steph?

1279
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,446
- Uh, she forgot her cell
 phone back in the car.

1280
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:57,414
She'll be back in a second.

1281
01:06:57,414 --> 01:06:59,483
She's walking to the car.

1282
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:02,519
Dude!

1283
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,288
- What's up, brother?

1284
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:08,358
Hey, so, which one's my date?

1285
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,462
- [Man] Oh, you see brown
 haired girl over there?

1286
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:15,799
- You serious?

1287
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,834
- Fuck yeah, man.

1288
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:20,337
(both chuckle)

1289
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:22,472
- Oh. So who's the blond girl?

1290
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:25,175
- Oh, that's Steph's
 friend Claudia.

1291
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,476
(mumbles) I'm gonna
 get them over.

1292
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:27,377
Hey guys, you come here.

1293
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,645
Check this out.

1294
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:34,984
- Hello.

1295
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,020
Hi, I'm Terry.

1296
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:38,922
- Susan.

1297
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:39,923
Nice to meet you, Terry.

1298
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:41,425
- Likewise, Susan.

1299
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,429
So you wanna go sit down?

1300
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:46,263
- Sure.

1301
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:50,134
(chuckles)

1302
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,602
- Anything to see around here?

1303
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:53,837
- The trail you
 guys just came up

1304
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:55,305
is the only one in and
out of the parking lot.

1305
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,141
Every other trail will
 take you to a dead end

1306
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:58,775
or it twists and turns.

1307
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,610
So I wouldn't go on a walk
 by yourself or anything.

1308
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,180
But yeah, that's basically
 the main in and out trail.

1309
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,013
- Seriously?

1310
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:04,981
- Yeah.

1311
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:06,116
I mean, it's nice out here.

1312
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:08,418
Just not much to see.

1313
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,253
You know?

1314
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:11,888
- Stevens wrecked
 right over there,

1315
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:15,725
and I saw the Bigfoot
 probably right about there.

1316
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,102
- Little kid's sneaker.

1317
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,771
- That could have
 come from anybody.

1318
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,038
- Could be.

1319
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,274
How many little kids'
 sneakers you know

1320
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:33,109
have a long, thick
 hair attached to it

1321
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,644
that smells like shit?

1322
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,012
- Probably not too many.

1323
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:37,847
- [Nick] Not too many.

1324
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:41,185
- Looks like he
 went through here.

1325
01:08:41,185 --> 01:08:42,252
I'm gonna follow this trail up,

1326
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:43,520
see what else I can find.

1327
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,189
- Hank, it might be
 a little dangerous.

1328
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,356
(gun clicks)

1329
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:48,192
- [Hank] I'll be fine.

1330
01:08:48,192 --> 01:08:49,025
- Hank!

1331
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:50,927
Do yourself a favor.

1332
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,229
Take that.

1333
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,563
- Thanks.

1334
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:54,398
Talk to you in a bit.

1335
01:08:54,398 --> 01:08:55,465
- You got it.

1336
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:20,690
(grunts softly)

1337
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,932
(creature grunts)

1338
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:34,137
(creature grunts loudly)

1339
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:47,751
(creature roars)

1340
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,520
(creature huffs)

1341
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:34,431
(creature growls)

1342
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:02,592
(dramatic music)

1343
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,262
- Oh, shit!
(creature roars)

1344
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:11,267
(creature growls)

1345
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:25,982
(creature huffs softly)

1346
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,149
(suspenseful music)

1347
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:18,402
- Holy shit!

1348
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:25,575
Benson, this is Hank.

1349
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:27,944
I'm about a mile
 up the trail here,

1350
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,746
and I just came
 across a dead guy

1351
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:31,080
hanging about 10
 feet up in a tree

1352
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,216
with a branch through his chest.

1353
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:37,320
- [Tom Through Phone] Me
and Nick are on our way.

1354
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:41,991
(creature grunts softly)

1355
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:55,539
(creature grunts agitatedly)

1356
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,144
(creature grunts sadly)

1357
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:15,358
- Hank, what you got?

1358
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:16,526
- Right there.

1359
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,034
- God.

1360
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,071
- Yeah, that's John.

1361
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,739
- You know that guy?

1362
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:31,508
- Yeah.

1363
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:36,079
- I gotta go back to the car,

1364
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,481
go call his wife.

1365
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:41,818
- I'm gonna follow this trail,

1366
01:13:41,818 --> 01:13:43,820
see where this end goes.

1367
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,824
- All right, I'll
 just stay here.

1368
01:13:54,731 --> 01:13:57,934
(door clatters)

1369
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:01,137
(raps sharply on door)

1370
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:09,112
- Can I help you?

1371
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:12,081
(Tommy sobs softly)

1372
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:13,650
What happened?

1373
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:16,385
- I was taken by a big creature
from my house last night,

1374
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,588
and I just got away.

1375
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:20,089
- Your name Tommy Jones?

1376
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,257
- Yes, sir.

1377
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:23,159
How did you know?

1378
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:24,994
- You're all over
 the news, sonny.

1379
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,329
Come on in here.

1380
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:30,466
Now, let's come on in here.

1381
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,268
We gotta get ahold
 of some folks.

1382
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:33,603
I know they're
 gonna be real happy

1383
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,672
to know that you're okay.

1384
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,476
I'll bet you're really hungry.

1385
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,678
Sit down here and have a seat.

1386
01:14:41,678 --> 01:14:42,912
We'll get you something
to eat in a minute.

1387
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,581
I gotta make a call.

1388
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:59,262
Yes, ma'am, my
 name is Dan Jones.

1389
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:01,565
That boy that's been missing,

1390
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:05,735
well, he just showed up at
 church on Brewer Boulevard.

1391
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:09,639
All right, thank you.

1392
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:15,812
Okay, buddy, they're sending
 somebody over here right now,

1393
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,914
pick you up, take you home.

1394
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:20,483
- Thanks, could I call my mom?

1395
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:22,952
I'm sure she's awful
 worried about me.

1396
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,220
- You sure can.

1397
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,724
Come on over here and
 let's make that call.

1398
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,962
(indistinct chattering)

1399
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,497
(leaves rustling)

1400
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:35,565
- Hey, whoa, whoa.

1401
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:36,499
Did you guys hear that?

1402
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:38,668
- Yeah, I heard something.

1403
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:40,103
(rustling)

1404
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:41,470
(girl speaks indistinctly)

1405
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,874
- Hell with it, I'll
 go see what it is.

1406
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,243
Anybody wanna come with me?

1407
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:48,511
How about you, sweetheart?

1408
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,213
- [Man] Screw that shit.

1409
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,047
- Wuss.

1410
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,315
Frankie, come on.

1411
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:55,919
(tense, suspenseful music)

1412
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,729
(boy roars)

1413
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,332
(laughs)

1414
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,602
- Dude, that's some
 fucking funny shit, right?

1415
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:14,503
- No, you're a fucking asshole.

1416
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:15,939
- Hey dude, that
 was fucking funny,

1417
01:16:15,939 --> 01:16:16,873
shut the fuck up.

1418
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:19,508
(boys talk over each other)

1419
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,945
(boys laugh)

1420
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:26,315
Where are you guys going?

1421
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,384
- Oh, we're just gonna
 take a little walk.

1422
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:29,385
- All right.

1423
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:32,188
- Watch out for the grass man!

1424
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:33,389
- Yeah?

1425
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:35,358
- [Man] Yeah, I'll do that.

1426
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:39,028
- So do you wanna
 go for a walk, too?

1427
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:39,863
- Where?

1428
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,965
- I don't know,

1429
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:44,300
maybe somewhere a little
more private, I guess.

1430
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,134
- Sure.

1431
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:48,772
- You guys heading out?

1432
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,273
- Yeah.

1433
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,541
Beautiful night for a walk.

1434
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,111
- [Susan] Steph, do you
 and Frankie wanna come too?

1435
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,345
- Yeah--

1436
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,614
- I think we're actually
just gonna hang here.

1437
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,949
All right, babe.

1438
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:03,987
- Yeah, just go on,
 have a nice walk.

1439
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:06,422
- [Susan] See you guys later.

1440
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:08,792
- Why did you do that?

1441
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:09,693
That was so mean?

1442
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:10,927
- What?

1443
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:11,861
Give them some time to
get to know each other.

1444
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,897
- Yeah, I'm sure that's why.

1445
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:15,064
- Well, it is.

1446
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,835
- Yeah, whatever, Frankie.

1447
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:24,607
- Sure are a lot of
 cars out here tonight.

1448
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,476
- Yeah, this event
 does well every year.

1449
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,246
I used to come here
 when I was a kid.

1450
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,081
- They ever give
you any trouble?

1451
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:34,250
- These kids? No.

1452
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,085
They're all good kids.

1453
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:38,888
- It's awfully quiet.

1454
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,323
Little too quiet.

1455
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:41,157
- Yeah.

1456
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:46,796
Well, let's just hang out
 here just a little bit longer.

1457
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,933
See what happens.

1458
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,871
- Wanna sit here and
 talk a little more?

1459
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:56,205
- Sure, why not?

1460
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:03,679
- Do you mind if I kiss you?

1461
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,748
- Sure.

1462
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:08,084
(smooching and sighing)

1463
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:14,357
You're a good kisser, Gary.

1464
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:15,792
- You're not so bad
 yourself, Susan.

1465
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,426
(Susan mumbles softly)

1466
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,596
(both chuckle softly)

1467
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:26,435
Do you wanna do something else?

1468
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,772
- I thought you'd never ask.

1469
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:33,309
(both pant)

1470
01:18:41,484 --> 01:18:42,685
Wait, did you hear that?

1471
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:43,519
- Hear what?

1472
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:44,754
- What was that sound?

1473
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:45,855
- It's probably just
 animals or something.

1474
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:47,156
- There's animals out here?

1475
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:50,593
- Yeah, just nothing
 that can hurt you.

1476
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:54,764
- Okay, sounds like whatever
 it is is gone anyway.

1477
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:56,132
- Good.

1478
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:57,333
Now, where were we?

1479
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,568
- We were right about here?

1480
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:03,973
(deep breathing)

1481
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,447
Wait, what is that smell?

1482
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,216
- Whoa, I don't know.

1483
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,751
Oh!

1484
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,187
(Susan gags and coughs)

1485
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:19,622
- So, was it you?

1486
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,794
- (chuckles) It was you.

1487
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:26,562
(creature growls)

1488
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:27,931
(screams)

1489
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:31,167
(Susan gags and coughs)

1490
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,702
- That sounded like Susan.

1491
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:37,006
- Uh, Terry probably
 jumped out and scared her.

1492
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:39,508
Look, it's nothing
 to worry about, babe.

1493
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:43,379
- I don't know, that scream
 sounded really weird.

1494
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:46,115
(creature huffs)

1495
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,688
- You hear that?

1496
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:53,857
- I sure did.
 - Yeah.

1497
01:19:53,857 --> 01:19:54,891
Come on, guys, let's go.

1498
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:55,724
- Go!

1499
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:02,731
(creature huffs softly)

1500
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:09,472
- Ew, what is that smell?

1501
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:11,740
- Oh!

1502
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,410
I don't know what that smell is.

1503
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,617
(creature huffs softly)

1504
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:22,451
Liz?

1505
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:24,753
Get ready to run.

1506
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,322
- What is it?

1507
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,991
- Just get ready.

1508
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:30,960
(exiting rock music)

1509
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,796
(creature growls)

1510
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:37,066
(Liz screams)

1511
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:39,802
(creature roars)

1512
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:44,040
(creature huffs)

1513
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:50,079
(creature grunts and growls)

1514
01:21:00,556 --> 01:21:01,424
Whoa, shit!

1515
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,762
(creature grunts and growls)

1516
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:09,065
- [Liz] No, please no!

1517
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:11,334
(creature roars)

1518
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:12,801
- Police department!

1519
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,170
- [Boy] Watch out, there's
 a Bigfoot over there!

1520
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,505
- [Girl] My God, what do I do?

1521
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:17,740
(creature roars)

1522
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,343
(shots blast)

1523
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:23,246
(creature grunts)

1524
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:25,648
(groans)

1525
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:26,882
- Nick, are you okay?

1526
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,751
- [Nick] Son of a
 bitch! (mutters)

1527
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:31,187
- You guys, you gotta get me
 some duct tape or some sticks,

1528
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:32,121
(Nick groans)

1529
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,522
rags, something like that.

1530
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:34,757
Go, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1531
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:35,591
- Here.

1532
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,727
- Now get me some
 sticks, come on!

1533
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,363
Don't stand there.

1534
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:42,465
(tape rips)

1535
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:43,299
- Here you go, sir.

1536
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:44,467
- Here you go.

1537
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:47,170
All right, Nick.

1538
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:48,604
I'm gonna set your leg.

1539
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:49,838
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1540
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:50,974
It's gonna hurt
 like a bitch, okay?

1541
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:53,576
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.

1542
01:21:54,477 --> 01:21:56,779
(Nick groans)

1543
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:57,813
Sorry about that, buddy.

1544
01:21:57,813 --> 01:22:00,449
(Nick groans)
 Hang on.

1545
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:01,284
(Nick groans)

1546
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:02,718
Here we go.

1547
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:03,987
That's good.

1548
01:22:03,987 --> 01:22:05,521
That's done.

1549
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:08,291
(creature huffs)

1550
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,198
(creature roars)

1551
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:16,732
- It's back, guys.

1552
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:20,236
- All right,
 everybody, stay calm.

1553
01:22:20,236 --> 01:22:21,404
Nick, I gotta call this in.

1554
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:23,172
Where's the radio?

1555
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:25,408
- I must have dropped
 it when it threw me.

1556
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,476
- Damn, Elwood.

1557
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:29,245
- I don't hear any more.

1558
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:31,214
- No, it's just toying with us.

1559
01:22:31,214 --> 01:22:32,848
- Hey, how many
 kids are up here?

1560
01:22:32,848 --> 01:22:36,385
- Uh, 10, but four
 are still missing.

1561
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,521
- Can't worry about
 that right now.

1562
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:41,557
The creature's out here and
 it's not going anywhere.

1563
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:44,160
I haven't been up on
 this hill for years.

1564
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,630
Does anybody know if there's
 another way off this hill?

1565
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,099
- No, just the path
 you all came up.

1566
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:52,201
Terry knows other ways,
but we can't find him.

1567
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,936
(exhales sharply)

1568
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:55,204
- I guess we're just gonna

1569
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:56,672
have to find a way
 with that path.

1570
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:59,442
(creature huffs)

1571
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:03,879
- I do know one thing for sure.

1572
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:05,148
Something really
 pissed that thing off,

1573
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:06,949
for it to go after
 humans like this.

1574
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:09,785
It's like it's on a vendetta.

1575
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:13,222
- How long ago did
 it attack you guys?

1576
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:14,190
- Not a long time ago.

1577
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,492
About an hour ago.

1578
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,927
- Did you get a good
 hit when you shot it?

1579
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,530
- I definitely hit it once.

1580
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,832
Might have missed
 the other times.

1581
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,534
- If it's wounded, we'll
definitely have a better chance

1582
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:26,735
of getting out of here alive.

1583
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:30,606
But you guys saw that
 thing, it's huge.

1584
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:34,243
- All right, guys, everybody
 try and stay calm, okay?

1585
01:23:34,243 --> 01:23:37,012
The less frantic, the better.

1586
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,614
Just stay cool.

1587
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:40,283
We'll all get off
 this hill alive.

1588
01:23:40,283 --> 01:23:41,950
- Sounds good to me.

1589
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:46,255
- Nick, you okay to do this?

1590
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:48,157
- Time to find out.

1591
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:50,025
- Couple of you guys help
 the ranger down the hill?

1592
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,160
- Yeah, no problem.

1593
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,328
Come on, Char.

1594
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:57,833
(Nick grunts)

1595
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:58,801
Sorry, sir.

1596
01:23:58,801 --> 01:23:59,702
- [Nick] No, that's all right.

1597
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:01,237
Thanks for the help.

1598
01:24:01,237 --> 01:24:02,938
- [Boy] Let's do it.

1599
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,574
(creature roars, kids scream)

1600
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:08,344
(creature huffs)

1601
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:43,779
(Nick groans)

1602
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,047
- That's the way.

1603
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:46,549
Yeah, right there.

1604
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:48,784
You okay, man?

1605
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:50,819
- No, I'm not okay, but hey,

1606
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,288
Jimmy, do you have a cell phone?

1607
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:53,389
- Yeah, yeah.

1608
01:24:54,457 --> 01:24:55,291
Here.

1609
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,993
Hey, I'm gonna go check
on the rest of 'em,

1610
01:24:57,993 --> 01:24:58,961
make sure they're all right.

1611
01:24:58,961 --> 01:24:59,795
- Yeah, be careful.

1612
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:00,596
- Yeah.

1613
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,900
- Yeah, dispatch, this
 is Ranger Nick Thomas.

1614
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,835
I'm gonna need some emergency
 service vehicles sent

1615
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,104
up to the Buck Doll Hill
camp-out parking lot.

1616
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,907
If we can get those on the fly.

1617
01:25:11,907 --> 01:25:14,877
- What is the state
 of emergency, sir?

1618
01:25:14,877 --> 01:25:18,614
- My colleagues and I were
 attacked by a Bigfoot.

1619
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,983
- Did you say a Bigfoot?

1620
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:22,785
Are you sure?

1621
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:23,986
- I know.

1622
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:27,723
Just please, we need
an ambulance here ASAP.

1623
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:28,891
- Sir, they're on their way.

1624
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:32,361
I told the authorities
 to use caution.

1625
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:34,430
Can I ask who your
 colleagues are?

1626
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:37,466
- Um, yeah, we've got
 a Bigfoot researcher

1627
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,635
and a detective.

1628
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:43,172
- (sighs) Oh no, Tom.

1629
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:45,508
- You know Detective Benson?

1630
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:48,377
- Yes, I do.

1631
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:49,278
Is he okay?

1632
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:53,682
- As of right now.

1633
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:55,318
I don't know.

1634
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:59,255
Okay, please keep me
informed, Ranger Thomas.

1635
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:00,323
- No problem.

1636
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:09,465
(sighs)

1637
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:13,602
(suspenseful music)

1638
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,673
- What do you think
 our next move is?

1639
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,108
- I don't know, I'm thinking.

1640
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:21,610
- [Dispatch] Unit 312 central,

1641
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:24,146
we have a report of some
type of animal attack

1642
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:26,148
near the old gym
 on Buck Doll Hill

1643
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:28,751
with multiple fatalities.

1644
01:26:28,751 --> 01:26:29,785
- We gotta get over there.

1645
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:30,919
- You're darn tootin'.

1646
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:31,754
- Shit.

1647
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:47,202
- Yeah, hey Marilynn.

1648
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:50,306
Babe, I'm sorry about tonight.

1649
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:52,275
No, everything's fine.

1650
01:26:52,275 --> 01:26:54,209
No, you wouldn't
even believe it.

1651
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,745
But yeah, I'm up by the
camp-out parking lot

1652
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:59,248
up near Buck Doll Hill.

1653
01:26:59,248 --> 01:27:01,384
No, don't come up here, we've
 got this all taken care of.

1654
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:03,619
But I'm sorry about the.

1655
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:04,453
No.

1656
01:27:06,255 --> 01:27:07,856
Hey, I gotta talk to you.

1657
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:09,992
Let me give you a
 call back later.

1658
01:27:09,992 --> 01:27:10,826
Bye.

1659
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:17,500
(creature growls and huffs)

1660
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:23,205
- Ranger!

1661
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:24,307
Hey, we heard on the radio.

1662
01:27:24,307 --> 01:27:25,508
Are you okay?

1663
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:27,976
- Dang, ranger,
 your leg is jacked.

1664
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:30,879
- It's fucking broke, man.

1665
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:33,782
- They say we're going live mic.

1666
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:34,783
All right, what the heck?

1667
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:37,185
Going live in five, four, three,

1668
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,555
(huffs) two.

1669
01:27:39,555 --> 01:27:41,023
Good evening.

1670
01:27:41,023 --> 01:27:42,725
Action News reporter Steve
 Darnell reporting live

1671
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:45,994
from what is rumored to
be a scene of horrors.

1672
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:48,997
I'm in normally tranquil
 Buckland, just off Highway 83.

1673
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,634
If what sources are
 reporting is true,

1674
01:27:51,634 --> 01:27:56,071
it is a scene of gargantuan
 animal violence and murder.

1675
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:57,072
- Holy moly.

1676
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,610
Man, you're, (stutters)

1677
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,079
you're drooling, man.

1678
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:06,315
- Come on, you guys,
 that's my girlfriend.

1679
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:07,583
- Excuse me, sir.

1680
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,084
Can you tell me
 what's going on here?

1681
01:28:09,084 --> 01:28:10,018
- No, come on, man.

1682
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:11,587
I'm dealing with this.

1683
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:12,721
Hey, you wanna know
 something about the Bigfoot,

1684
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,857
talk to those guys.

1685
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:15,891
Not me, them.

1686
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:17,626
- Right, thank you so much.

1687
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,628
- Sir, hi, can't seem
 to grab a sheriff

1688
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:20,996
or a law enforcement.

1689
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:22,731
Can you tell me
 what's going on here?

1690
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:24,066
- Yeah, uh--

1691
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:25,233
- Let me, let me talk to you.

1692
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:27,370
Hi, yes, my name
is Brian Johnson

1693
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:30,272
and this is my business
partner Duane McCoy.

1694
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:32,875
First of all, I wanna offer
 prayers and condolences

1695
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:35,511
to the families of all those
 who've lost their lives.

1696
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:38,481
We have people up here who've
 literally been torn to bits.

1697
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:39,882
- Torn to bits.

1698
01:28:39,882 --> 01:28:41,350
By what, did they say?

1699
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,986
- Uh, that would be by
 Bigfoot, sir, the Bigfoot.

1700
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:47,356
Possible even Bigfeet,
 I kid you not.

1701
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:50,058
- We got it on film,
 secretly hidden away.

1702
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,960
- Goddamn, Duane, you old turd.

1703
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,995
- There you have it, folks.

1704
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,296
I'm gonna try to get closer

1705
01:28:54,296 --> 01:28:56,131
to speak to one of
 the first responders

1706
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:57,900
or hopefully law enforcement

1707
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,602
as we are live on scene.

1708
01:28:59,602 --> 01:29:01,870
- Actually, we were
 first on scene, sir.

1709
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:03,105
First to see the thing

1710
01:29:03,105 --> 01:29:05,908
and first to capture
 the beast on film.

1711
01:29:05,908 --> 01:29:07,109
- Wait a minute.

1712
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:08,711
Why are you talking
 to these losers?

1713
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:10,212
- Hey, get the fuck out of here.

1714
01:29:10,212 --> 01:29:11,313
- Go!
 - Dumbass!

1715
01:29:11,313 --> 01:29:13,148
- Fellas, we can't do that.

1716
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,117
No f-bombs, please,
 we're live on air.

1717
01:29:15,117 --> 01:29:18,921
I am so sorry,
 ladies and gentlemen.

1718
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:20,856
- I wanna apologize
 for my partner, sir.

1719
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,459
He's very sensitive
 and protective.

1720
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:25,828
We're actually two
documentary filmmakers.

1721
01:29:25,828 --> 01:29:27,496
We have historical footage.

1722
01:29:27,496 --> 01:29:31,667
All inquiries call
T-U-R-K-E-Y-S-H-O-T, Turkeyshot.

1723
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:36,038
The area code and phone number
 goes directly to our office.

1724
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:38,206
- And our website
 is temporary down,

1725
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,141
a little bit overloaded.

1726
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:41,176
But it will be updated soon.

1727
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:43,812
- All moneyed inquiries,
call Turkeyshot.

1728
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:45,814
This footage will blow
 your fucking mind!

1729
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:47,650
- Okay, all right, thank you.

1730
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:48,484
Thank you.

1731
01:29:48,484 --> 01:29:49,317
Officer!

1732
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:50,886
- [Brian] Good job!

1733
01:29:52,821 --> 01:29:56,058
- Look, there's the
 detective and Hank.

1734
01:29:57,325 --> 01:30:01,263
(Hank huffs and grunts softly)

1735
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,508
(creature roars)

1736
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:17,245
(second creature roars)

1737
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:24,953
(both creatures roar)

1738
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:34,096
(both creatures roar)

1739
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,203
(creature roars)

1740
01:30:42,805 --> 01:30:45,574
(creature roars)

1741
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:49,044
(creature howls)

1742
01:30:49,044 --> 01:30:51,780
(creature roars)

1743
01:30:53,849 --> 01:30:57,352
(creatures howl and roar)

1744
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:26,582
(up-tempo rock music)
