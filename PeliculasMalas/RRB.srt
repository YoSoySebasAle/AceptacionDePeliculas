1
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:19,283
<i>I want to be free.
Naked as a little girl.</i>

2
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,955
<i>I want to make every man feel
like he's the first one to possess me.</i>

3
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,373
<i>I hope there will be many.</i>

4
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:27,417
<i>Hundreds...</i>

5
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,046
<i>thousands and more,
who will...</i>

6
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:32,969
<i>over and over again
by day and by night.</i>

7
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:35,422
<i>Men,
girls,</i>

8
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,394
<i>strong men.</i>

9
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,680
<i>My name is Lisa Romay.</i>

10
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:45,873
<i>I'm a model and actress
in erotic films.</i>

11
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:49,747
<i>They call me the Rolls-Royce baby
and this is my story.</i>

12
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:53,174
You've impressed Jack. He's very
excited that you're doing this.

13
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,378
He says you're a great actress
and I agree with him.

14
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:58,925
Now you're exaggerating.

15
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:00,848
No really, you're great.
A real talent.

16
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,480
I can't argue with honesty.

17
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:06,332
Believe me, I know about these things.
But let's get some work done.

18
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:10,135
Jack wants something really sexy
with a naked Lisa.

19
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:12,283
Are you ready?

20
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,255
Now, let your hair go.

21
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:16,192
That's it.

22
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:20,805
Sit down.

23
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,600
Now, look seductive.

24
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,699
And cross your legs like this.

25
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,469
And your arms like this.

26
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,192
Now take the pearls between your teeth,
like Marilyn Monroe.

27
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:34,444
Fantastic.
And now...

28
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,111
Now stretch out.

30
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:37,871
Yes. And we're done.

31
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:41,245
Keep that pose.
Lovely.

32
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,832
That's it.
Now arms forward.

33
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:47,578
Fine, let's keep it like that.
One moment.

34
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:52,508
And now... leg forward a bit.
That's it.

35
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:59,351
One more.
And the necklace here.

36
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:02,215
Next one.

37
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,641
Now give yourself over.
Beautiful, one moment.

38
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:12,040
Now cross the other leg.

39
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,901
And now, bend like this.
Great, fantastic.

40
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:17,920
Don't move.

41
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,045
Great.

42
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:27,533
Ok, now lean back a bit.

43
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:30,198
And the legs...
- Like this?

44
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,275
Yes, great.

45
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:37,784
And now... eh,
put the pearls in your mouth.

46
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,034
One sec.

47
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,470
Concentration...

48
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,436
Sorry, that's not right. 
Let's go again

49
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,091
We need more sex.

50
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:19,344
<i>I love the light on my naked body.</i>

51
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,900
<i>I like being photographed this way.</i>

52
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,080
<i>I am... the way that I am.</i>

53
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,581
Ok, one more.
Look at me.

54
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,991
Good as always.

55
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,917
With your talent,
you'll have a great career.

56
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,929
I like it when you flatter me.

57
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:15,321
I often imagine I'm lying in the sand...

58
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:18,022
and each grain caresses my skin.

59
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,636
Very fine sand.
- And you're alone.

60
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,048
A man loves me.

61
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:27,775
Sand is everywhere
and every grain caresses my body.

62
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:31,941
It's like fireworks 
going off inside me.

63
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:35,073
I just let go
and forget everything else.

64
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,911
<i>The sand is hot.</i>

65
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:54,466
<i>My fingers grab on to the
millions of grains...</i>

66
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:03,716
<i>and let them fall on my naked body.</i>

67
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,439
Kiss me.

67
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:55,207
You see, I am indescribably happy
just to be with a man like you.

68
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:57,425
Is that too much to ask?

69
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,043
But to be honest...

70
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:04,369
When I'm in the arms of one man,
I already long for the next.

71
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,264
I can't help myself.

72
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,374
Not that I'd want to change.

73
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:43,525
Your coffee is ready.

74
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,128
Here you go.

75
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,466
Thank you.

76
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:06,320
Do you like it?
- Delicious.

77
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:16,708
Unfortunately, I'm on a diet.
- You're kidding.

78
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:20,722
What do you do?
- Nothing special.

79
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:40,323
I like you. Strong and handsome...

80
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,498
It's all in the exercise,
nothing to it.

81
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,960
I exercise too. Yoga. Want to see?
- Yes please.

82
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,727
I have to get to the studio
for a photo shoot.

83
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:48,914
You're in all the magazines.
They show your movies everywhere.

84
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:54,643
That is now.
It wasn't always like that.

85
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:57,284
There were times I had nothing to eat.

86
00:27:58,446 --> 00:28:01,040
Always on the road,
walking, hitching rides.

87
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:50,295
Looking good.

88
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,773
Time already?

89
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:03,136
Look for yourself.
We have company.

90
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,339
How'd she get here?
- Picked her up hitch hiking.

91
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,986
Welcome aboard.
Happy to see you.

92
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:31,062
You can go first.
- I wouldn't have it another way.

93
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:35,047
Would you look at that.

94
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:39,382
So we're doing a local run?
- It's going to be a great night.

95
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:49,333
So, let's try this.
- Of course.

96
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:52,916
You're next.

97
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:08,492
See you later.
- What's the meaning of this?

97
00:35:09.001 --> 00:35:09.964
Pigs.

98
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:31,462
And now I have a Rolls Royce.

99
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,695
Maybe you can work for me.
As chauffeur I mean.

100
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:40,525
We'll drive around and pick up
some lonely hitch hikers.

101
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:47,790
I bet you look good in a uniform.
- And I am strong.

102
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:50,478
That's why I hired you.

103
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:56,441
I can see myself in uniform now.
And you in the back of the car.

104
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:29,544
<i>I was doing another shoot
with Fred for a poster.</i>

105
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:37,716
<i>And I enjoyed it as he looked at me.
And devoured me.</i>

106
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:53,427
<i>I gave him my most seductive poses.</i>

107
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,738
<i>And Fred followed my lead.</i>

108
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:06,511
<i>It wasn't long before he wanted
the poses I like the most.</i>

109
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:10,618
<i>The ones in which I feel free
and completely at ease.</i>

110
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:15,433
Ma'am.

111
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:52,544
Come in.

112
00:46:54,551 --> 00:46:56,400
You wanted me, ma'am?

113
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,770
I did.
- What can I do for you?

114
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:04,958
I need to go out today.

115
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,875
You will come with me
and do as I say.

116
00:47:13,085 --> 00:47:14,307
As you wish, ma'am.

117
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:48,190
Stop the car.

118
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,258
Here you go.

119
00:49:58,164 --> 00:49:58,974
Hello there.

120
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:21,014
Let me look at you.

121
00:53:40,899 --> 00:53:42,404
We've arrived.
- Thank you, Erik.

122
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:41,514
Do you see that man there?
- Leep on driving.

123
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,495
He wants us to stop.

124
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:59,090
Shall I pull over?
- I want to have a better look first.

125
00:58:00,232 --> 00:58:01,268
He's young.

126
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:04,056
Can I hitch a ride?

127
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:09,165
Stop the car.
- Yes ma'am.

128
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:35,905
Do you want to go for a walk?
- I'd love to.

129
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:36,866
Then let's go.

130
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:40,406
And you won't try anything?
Then I'll come along.

131
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:07,687
Ma'am?

132
01:02:07,863 --> 01:02:11,461
Erik, hand me a tissue please.
- Yes ma'am.

133
01:02:13,837 --> 01:02:15,715
Drive on.
- Yes ma'am.

134
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,739
You wanted me?
- Yes.

135
01:05:13,107 --> 01:05:16,662
I need to go out.
Please get the Rolls ready.

136
01:05:16,922 --> 01:05:19,216
As you wish, ma'am.
As you wish.

137
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,269
Thanks. Everyone else just kept going.

138
01:07:18,724 --> 01:07:21,365
Hi there.
Won't you get in?

139
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:49,490
Look, a man by the side of the road.

140
01:10:51,177 --> 01:10:52,195
He wants a ride.

141
01:10:55,321 --> 01:10:56,189
He's young.

142
01:11:01,682 --> 01:11:04,649
Let me know if you want me
to pull over.

143
01:11:12,974 --> 01:11:15,146
Pull over.
As you wish.

144
01:11:30,534 --> 01:11:31,473
Come, sir.

145
01:11:35,252 --> 01:11:36,585
Oh, I'm sorry.

146
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:40,024
Why hello.

147
01:13:49,532 --> 01:13:54,606
All I really want from men is
tenderness, and gentle caresses.

148
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:59,685
I always intend them to just
caress me, and nothing else.

149
01:14:00,788 --> 01:14:04,039
But then all good intentions disappear.

150
01:14:04,497 --> 01:14:09,887
He's there, and I want him,
and then it just happens.

151
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:22,955
Do you want me to caress you?

152
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,628
You rang for me?

153
01:24:40,646 --> 01:24:44,038
You called for me, ma'am?
- Yes.

154
01:24:45,846 --> 01:24:53,013
I'm in the mood for a ride.
- I will get the car for you.

155
01:24:53,922 --> 01:25:01,060
And then there's... can I ask...
- The girl is no longer here.

156
01:25:01,927 --> 01:25:06,140
That's great. So we're alone.
- Right. Just you and me.

157
01:25:06,345 --> 01:25:08,307
As it should be.
