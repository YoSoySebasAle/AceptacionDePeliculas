1
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,317
Jude?

2
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,448
Jude. I'm home.

3
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,666
Turn off the video games.

4
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,138
Jude.

5
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,644
Gotcha!

6
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,182
Shit!

7
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,934
<i>Another prank?
Why do you have to keep doing this?</i>

8
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,438
I got you good, didn't 1?

9
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,690
You think you're funny, huh?
Hmm.

10
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,114
Mmm. Okay. Okay.

11
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,407
Saved by your dad.

12
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,235
- Hi.
- Dad.

13
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,490
<i>What's up, mate?</i>

14
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,434
<i>You being the big man of the house
and taking care of your mum?</i>

15
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,619
More like scaring his old mom.

16
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,120
I used the shoe trick.

17
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,248
<i>The shoe trick.
Now, let me see.</i>

18
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,502
<i>No, I think you must be mistaking me
with someone else, mate.</i>

19
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,002
Real sneaky, you two.

20
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,043
I can't stay long, love.

21
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,298
<i>I've golia lake some clients out
for dinner.</i>

22
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,597
<i>But I just wanted fo check in
on my two favorite people,</i>

23
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,471
<i>and let you know that I miss you both
and I love you guys so much.</i>

24
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,176
- Love you, dad.
<i>- Bye, kiddo.</i>

25
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,351
Later!

26
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,853
You know, it's the third time this week
you've been late.

27
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,479
<i>I know, I know.</i>

28
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,186
<i>I've just got lo finish these deadlines,
then I'm done. I promise.</i>

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,737
<i>When I get back,</i>

30
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,899
<i>maybe I can find a way
to make it up fo you.</i>

31
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,076
Well, Friday night,
we do have the nanny.

32
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,367
<i>Oh, Well, then I will see you
on Friday night, lady.</i>

33
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,990
If you're lucky.

34
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,993
- Night.
<i>- Good night, love.</i>

35
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,629
Were you really scared, mom?

36
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,041
I was.

37
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,585
But next time,
let's get your dad.

38
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,265
Okay.

39
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,591
<i>Looks like Mr. brown
could use a cuddle.</i>

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,720
- Mom.
- Hmm.

41
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,101
I'm too old to still sleep
with a Teddy bear.

42
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,433
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

43
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,439
Good night.

44
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,437
Good night, mom.

45
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,324
Jude?

46
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,864
If you're trying to scare me again,
it's not funny.

47
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,167
Okay.

48
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,804
Mom!

49
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,716
What are you doing?

50
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,724
Mom, don't!

51
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,056
No! No!

52
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,769
Jude!

53
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,153
Jude!

54
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,288
Mommy!

55
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,385
I thought we could take a look
at some of those toys today.

56
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,936
Or perhaps there's something
you'd like to talk about?

57
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,198
You don't like coming here
very much, do you?

58
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,700
But you do understand
why you're here?

59
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,702
You know, Jude,
If you'd like to go,

60
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,584
all you need to do is to say,
"I'd like to go now."

61
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,685
Five months isn't an unusual time
for this kind of selective mutism.

62
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,309
I've seen children stop talking
for much longer

63
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,014
from much less severe trauma.

64
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,272
Encourage him to communicate,
but try not to force it.

65
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,024
It has to come from him.

66
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,651
The more we force things,
the more he's gonna pull back.

67
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,404
And how are the two of you holding up?

68
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,866
We're good, yeah.

69
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,993
As well as we can be.

70
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,411
We're really just trying to focus
on Jude's recovery right now.

71
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,462
Well, I commend your dedication.

72
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,505
But Jude is looking to you now.

73
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,676
And if you're not getting better,
he won't get better.

74
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,718
Thank you.

75
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,493
Another headache?

76
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,540
It's not that bad.

77
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,841
I thought the doctor
had some good things to say.

78
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,339
Yeah.

79
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,845
I think Jude is a little better.

80
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,890
<i>No. I meant, actually,
about us healing too.</i>

81
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,098
Well...

82
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,733
I'm fine, really.

83
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,027
You never leave the house.

84
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,356
You have nightmares
every night...

85
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,991
And you don't even let me touch you.

86
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,912
I'm not having this conversation again.

87
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,831
We've never had this conversation.

88
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,456
You've never talked about
what happened or how you feel.

89
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,002
What if we went away?

90
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,209
Out of the city,
some place quiet.

91
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,300
<i>You're already homeschooling Jude.
I can work wherever.</i>

92
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,871
I think it would be a good chance
for us to have a fresh start.

93
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,482
I'll think about it.

94
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,400
What is it, sweetheart?

95
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,766
Liza!

96
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,842
Liza, be quiet!

97
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,801
Liza.

98
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:05,931
Liza.

99
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,683
<i>Liza. Liza.
It's okay.</i>

100
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,558
<i>It's okay.
You're all right.</i>

101
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,314
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

102
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,694
It's okay.

103
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,327
I can't do this anymore.

104
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,446
Hiya! I'm Pamela.

105
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,115
Oh, I'm glad you found it.

106
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,367
Shall I show you the house?

107
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,821
And what's this little man's name?

108
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Jude.

109
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,754
He's a little shy.

110
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,825
Oh, well, I bet we'll be
best of friends in no time.

111
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,007
This used to be a guesthouse
of a much larger property.

112
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,305
But after the owner of
the manor house passed away,

113
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,805
some city man, no offense,
came and scooped it up.

114
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,229
I think he was gonna restore it, but I
imagine the job got too much for him.

115
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,931
Lucky for you folks, though.

116
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,311
Some time in the countryside.

117
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:35,986
It's perfect.

118
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,173
I'll give you a little tour if you like.

119
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,064
No. I think we can handle it from here.

120
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,523
Oh. All right.

121
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,279
- Thank you.
- Take care.

122
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,859
Cheers. Bye-bye.

123
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,912
So, what do you think?

124
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,163
It's beautiful.

125
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,336
<i>Yeah?
You sure? Yes.</i>

126
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,582
And what about you,
big boss?

127
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,175
All right.

128
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,638
I vote we try a little...

129
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,596
Nature exploration!

130
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,291
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, it's so quiet.

131
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,395
Look at the sun.

132
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,525
<i>Smell the air.
That's fresh air.</i>

133
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,941
I bet we'll see loads of rabbits
come spring.

134
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,192
Maybe even some deer, huh?

135
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,283
Yeah.

136
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,486
<i>Watch your step, mate.
It's slippery.</i>

137
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,952
What's that?

138
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,503
That must be the main house.

139
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,835
Let's check it out.

140
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,776
Look at that.

141
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,401
<i>Wow. Now that is what
I call a house. Come here.</i>

142
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,442
Come on, Jude.

143
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,239
<i>Jude.</i>

144
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,410
Wow.

145
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,415
This place must've been
quite something back in the day.

146
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,413
"Glennview estate."

147
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,704
<i>Jude, come play with us.</i>

148
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,174
<i>Jude.</i>

149
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,714
<i>Come here, Jude.
Over here.</i>

150
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,014
<i>Jude.</i>

151
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,092
<i>Come over here.</i>

152
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,973
<i>Now, Jude.</i>

153
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,816
We'll have to look it up.

154
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,272
Old house like this
probably got some real history to it.

155
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,406
Sean.

156
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,165
<i>Jude, Jude.
Help me, Jude.</i>

157
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,917
<i>Jude, Jude, Jude.</i>

158
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,258
<i>Yes, Jude.</i>

159
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,026
Yeah, forget the guesthouse.

160
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,444
I'm moving in here.

161
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,862
What do you say, Jude?

162
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,773
Jude?

163
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,402
- Jude!
- Jude?

164
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,414
Jude!

165
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,453
Mate, don't run off like that, please.

166
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,955
You can't run off like that,
not out here.

167
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,708
What's that?

168
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,834
Did you just find that?

169
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,051
Can I take a look?

170
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,336
<i>Oh, my goodness.
It's filthy. Look at it.</i>

171
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,505
Whereabouts did you find it?

172
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,514
Do you wanna keep it?

173
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,060
<i>Okay.
Let's get it cleaned up first.</i>

174
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,935
<i>All right. Can't wait to have
this guy in the house.</i>

175
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,168
Can I see?

176
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,929
"Rules."

177
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Huh.

178
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,065
I bet you have a story to tell.

179
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,946
Looks like he wants a friend.

180
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,260
He looks like he was broken before...

181
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,057
And put back together again.

182
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,941
<i>Okay, let's go to bed now.
Hmm?</i>

183
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,023
Come on, mate.

184
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,176
You sure you got everything
you need there, little fella? Yeah?

185
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,441
<i>You just make yourself at home.
Put your feet up.</i>

186
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,321
There's nice,
Cold beer in the fridge.

187
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,279
I could use some of those pj's.

188
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,267
You dressed him yourself.

189
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,033
That sounds lovely.

190
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Are you hungry?

191
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,459
Okay.

192
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,544
I'll make pancakes.

193
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,724
I guess it's about time for me
to start my morning commute

194
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,018
all the way down the hallway.

195
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,895
I really hope there's no traffic, guys.

196
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,270
You wanna stop by the office
for lunch today?

197
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,606
Did I mention that I was
just down the hallway?

198
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,111
I'll try to sneak by.

199
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,942
Goodbye, judester. Mwah.

200
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,536
Goodbye...

201
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,156
Did we come up with a name for him yet?

202
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,715
"Brahms." wow.

203
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,417
Like the composer?

204
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,257
<i>That's quite the name.
How'd you come up with that?</i>

205
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,518
<i>Oh, he told you.
Oh, right, yeah.</i>

206
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,474
<i>Well, of course, he did.
Silly me.</i>

207
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,694
<i>All right.
Bye, gang.</i>

208
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,483
Goodbye, brahms.

209
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,440
Well, what should we start with today,

210
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,945
math or history?

211
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,754
Okay.

212
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:42,966
<i>Over here.</i>

213
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,342
Wait up!

214
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,967
<i>Right here.</i>

215
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,845
<i>This way.</i>

216
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,659
Jude!

217
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,280
I told you not to run off like that.

218
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,494
This is where you found him?

219
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,168
Oz, get in here.

220
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,337
This is private property.

221
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,108
<i>I'm sorry. We're staying
at the guesthouse.</i>

222
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,719
<i>We were just on a walk.
I didn't know.</i>

223
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,671
<i>Of course you didn't.
You're the new family.</i>

224
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,549
Sorry, I get a lot of people
snooping around up here.

225
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,388
I'm Joseph. Joe.

226
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,221
Um, I tend the grounds around here.

227
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,647
<i>Part guard, part gardener.
This is oz.</i>

228
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,392
I'm Liza.

229
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,192
And this is Jude.

230
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,534
We can put the doll back.

231
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,289
Do you want us...

232
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,741
No, no, no.

233
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,534
<i>Keep it.
No one's gonna miss it out here.</i>

234
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,790
Just me and oz these days.

235
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,183
Unless, of course,
you'd like to put it back?

236
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,379
He's a little quiet.

237
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,761
<i>Oh, don't worry about that.
Not much of a talker meself.</i>

238
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,119
People think I'm crazy
for living out here on my own,

239
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,804
but I'm more sane than any of them.

240
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,228
The real crazy is living in the city,
packed together like a bunch of cattle.

241
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,805
Thank you, but no,
thank you.

242
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,516
You didn't really have to
walk us all the way back.

243
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,602
<i>Oh, I don't mind.
We're neighbors now.</i>

244
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,436
I suppose I'll be seeing
quite a bit of you.

245
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,611
Hey there.

246
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,232
That's a healthy-looking 12 Gauge.

247
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,442
Or a 12 bore.

248
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,869
I was worried about you.

249
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,162
This is Joseph.

250
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,410
Joseph, this is my husband, Sean.

251
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,502
- Hiya.
- Joseph...

252
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,126
<i>I tend the grounds round here.
Keep the troublemakers out.</i>

253
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,792
Caught these two red-handed.

254
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,682
Yeah, these two are trouble,
all right.

255
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,924
Well, thanks for escorting them back.

256
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,887
<i>Right. I'll be off, then.
Let me know if you need anything, yeah?</i>

257
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,465
Yeah. Nice meeting you.

258
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,016
Pleasure was all mine.

259
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,849
See you soon, little fella.

260
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,851
Bringing home the local strays
already, huh?

261
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,120
Look, he insisted on
walking us all the way home.

262
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,251
<i>Come on, oz.
Come on.</i>

263
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,874
Nice of him,
I guess.

264
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,711
Who the hell buries a doll
in the woods like that?

265
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,793
Maybe some weird little kid
put it there.

266
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,002
I don't know, sweetheart.

267
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,866
<i>Yeah, but you weren't there.
You didn't see it.</i>

268
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,973
His entire wardrobe,
in this...

269
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,593
Coffin thing.

270
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,225
<i>Okay.
So, what do you wanna do?</i>

271
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,589
You wanna take
the doll away from him?

272
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,687
Yes.

273
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,485
No.

274
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,690
I don't know.

275
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,151
I just think it's all a little bit...

276
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,406
Creepy.

277
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,527
I really don't think it's the doll
that's the problem here.

278
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,450
What does that mean?

279
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,328
<i>Nothing. Let's just
finish the dishes, yeah?</i>

280
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,263
I've got some work to do
before we go to sleep.

281
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,467
No, I wanna hear
what you were about to say.

282
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,965
What's the problem?

283
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,185
Sometimes I feel like you use Jude...

284
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,723
To avoid talking about
what happened to you.

285
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,150
And I don't think that's healthy
for either of you.

286
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,988
<i>Mommy!</i>

287
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,366
You know,
I nearly died...

288
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,287
In some random,
senseless burglary.

289
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,908
And I'm actually aware of that
every single day of my life.

290
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,956
Yes, but that's over now.

291
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,336
Lj...

292
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,347
<i>Dogs bark.
You didn't like the dog?</i>

293
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,888
The dog.

294
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,059
Dogs bark.

295
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,688
<i>I know what you mean.
He was kind of scary.</i>

296
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,936
Liza, I'm sorry.

297
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,488
Holy shit.

298
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,358
<i>Should we just leave him alone?
Do you wanna open the door?</i>

299
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,415
<i>No, I wanna go in.
I wanna see if he'll talk to us.</i>

300
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,707
Okay. Let's go.

301
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,084
So, all this is yours?

302
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,620
Hey, sweetheart.

303
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,131
We were just outside,
and we thought we heard you talking.

304
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,501
Were you talking to brahms?

305
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,049
Great.

306
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,621
So, what were you guys talking about?

307
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,942
Oh, the dog from this morning.

308
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,029
Did he scare you?

309
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,534
"Brahms doesn't like him." Oh.

310
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,791
Well, that's...

311
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,127
That's great.

312
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,089
We'll let you get back to brahms.

313
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,214
Good night.

314
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,968
Thinking about watching a movie,
if you're interested.

315
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,398
Oh, yeah.

316
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,941
Sure.

317
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,152
I guess we're keeping that doll.

318
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,734
<i>Are you kidding?
I love that creepy thing.</i>

319
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,815
<i>Liza, it's okay. Honey, it's okay.
Look at me.</i>

320
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,938
It was just a dream.

321
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,753
<i>Look at me.
It's fine. You're okay.</i>

322
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,697
Jude.

323
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,948
Jude, I'm sorry.

324
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,324
He's mine!

325
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,166
<i>You okay?
Another nightmare?</i>

326
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,455
Where's Jude?

327
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,957
He slept in his room, love.

328
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,682
This is the first time
he's slept in his own bed.

329
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,434
<i>Come on.
Let's go back to bed.</i>

330
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,269
<i>Here you go.
Do you want two, yeah?</i>

331
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,833
Does brahms want two?

332
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,216
<i>Hey, good morning.
You're up.</i>

333
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,884
I let you lie in.

334
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,927
It seemed like you could use it.

335
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,311
Thank you.

336
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,633
Cooked up a little full english.

337
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,390
Here you go, love.

338
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,727
What's this?

339
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,898
Oh. That. Yes.

340
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:20,070
Well, apparently,
brahms is handing down rules now,

341
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,148
including he'd like his own food.

342
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,584
Oh, dear.

343
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,917
What happened to Mr. brown?

344
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,917
Jude, buddy,
did you do this?

345
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,507
Come on, mate.

346
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,680
It's not very nice
to blame him now, is it?

347
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,475
Look, we're not mad at you.

348
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,186
But this is no way to treat your things.

349
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,726
And it's never okay to lie.

350
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,309
So, did you cut up Mr. brown?

351
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,331
<i>Okay. Then why don't you go to your room
and finish your homework there?</i>

352
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,130
And then when you're ready to tell me
what happened, you can come out.

353
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,669
You can leave the doll here.

354
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,219
Jude.

355
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,010
<i>You heard your mum.
Leave the doll, please.</i>

356
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,020
<i>Maybe it's a good thing.
He's getting his anger out.</i>

357
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,566
It's pretty violent.

358
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,803
Really?

359
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,028
That wasn't funny.

360
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,696
You're supposed to stay in this room,

361
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,866
and not come out again
until you're ready to apologize.

362
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,085
<i>Fine. You can stay in here
for the rest of the day, then.</i>

363
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,539
Jude,

364
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,713
your father and I said no doll.

365
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,005
Okay, I am gonna count to three,
and if this door isn't open...

366
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,257
One...

367
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,555
Two...

368
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,882
Three.

369
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,978
What are you doing here?

370
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,348
Hey.

371
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,297
I have someone here
who wants to apologize.

372
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,269
Come on.

373
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,356
Hey.

374
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,739
Thank you for apologizing.

375
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,622
<i>Okay.
Let's get you to bed, yeah?</i>

376
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,420
<i>Go brush your teeth.
Good boy.</i>

377
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,929
You okay?

378
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,631
Not good.

379
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,347
I could've sworn I saw somebody
go into his room, and then...

380
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,928
<i>You didn't.
It's fine.</i>

381
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,059
Honestly, his pranks
are getting out of hand.

382
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,795
Yeah, but I thought
everything would be better

383
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,731
once we got out of the city.

384
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,777
I don't know what to do.

385
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,161
I just feel like
I'm letting you and Jude down.

386
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,079
You're not letting anyone down.

387
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,119
Please don't be sorry.

388
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,480
You'll feel better after some sleep.

389
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,619
Yeah.

390
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,455
- Good night.
- All right.

391
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:59,230
<i>I understand that some of Jude's
recent behaviors would be upsetting.</i>

392
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,357
<i>But the doll clearly is providing him</i>

393
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,034
<i>with a safe outlet
lo process his trauma.</i>

394
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,989
<i>Now comes the hard part,
where he might try fo act out some more.</i>

395
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,324
Act out?

396
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,138
Listen, what if we just
got rid of the doll?

397
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,580
How bad would that be?

398
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,232
<i>I urge you to be patient,</i>

399
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,622
<i>and allow him to have his friend.</i>

400
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,130
<i>He's found a place with this doll
where he feels safe.</i>

401
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,221
<i>And the last thing we want fo do
is take that away.</i>

402
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,552
<i>I'll send you some links
with further information.</i>

403
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,429
Okay. Sounds good.

404
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,431
<i>Thanks, doc.
We'll speak to you soon, yeah?</i>

405
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,522
<i>Okay. Take care.</i>

406
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,474
Perfect.

407
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,560
There you go. Nice.

408
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,780
Come on, Jude.

409
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,276
<i>That's it.
One, and then move it on.</i>

410
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,656
Perfect.

411
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,284
Hello, Jude.

412
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,740
What you got there?

413
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,954
Okay.

414
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,208
You thought of a name for him yet?

415
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,248
What is it?

416
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,175
Course it is.

417
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,817
You've scrubbed up well,
little man.

418
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,735
So, I see you've found yourself
a new family.

419
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,084
How're you doing,
little fella?

420
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,838
Just look at that expression
on his face.

421
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,630
It's like he's got a secret
that only he knows.

422
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,645
Do you ever notice that?

423
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,809
Can I help you?

424
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Oh, hello there.

425
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,151
I was just looking for oz,
my daft dog.

426
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,478
We haven't seen him.

427
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,937
All right, never mind.

428
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,863
Pretty good idea
where he'll be, anyway.

429
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,778
Right, I'll be off.

430
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:51,954
You be good now.

431
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,120
<i>Come on.
It's time to go inside.</i>

432
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,509
You left Jude outside all alone?

433
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,431
I just left him for a second.

434
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,161
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

435
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,746
I just saw it. It was just there.

436
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,424
- I'm sorry.
- My god, Liza. What are you doing?

437
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,908
Jude?

438
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,855
"I'll always be with you"?

439
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,951
"They will be sorry."

440
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:36,845
Sorry.

441
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,962
I didn't know you were standing there.

442
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,472
Why are you wearing that?

443
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,600
Dinner's in 15.

444
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,215
<i>No. It's just the three of us
for dinner tonight, Jude.</i>

445
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,885
No, not tonight.

446
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,641
Does it really matter, Liza?

447
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,190
Your mum said no, mate.

448
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,325
So, I was thinking of inviting Liam out,
and the family.

449
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,099
Felt like maybe we could
use some company.

450
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,917
<i>No? You wanna see your uncle Liam,
auntie Mary, and your cousins?</i>

451
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,624
<i>I think it'll be fun.
He's always a good laugh, isn't he?</i>

452
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,459
I think he'd love
to get out of the city.

453
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,925
Not really guests.

454
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,222
They're family.

455
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,309
Yeah?

456
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,136
Your dad and I make the rules
in this house, not your doll.

457
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,439
<i>Mm-mmm.
Eat it.</i>

458
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,778
<i>All right, come on.
Enough.</i>

459
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,197
No, it's fine.

460
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:24,151
You can sit here until you decide
you can eat your food.

461
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,905
Just do as your mum says, please.

462
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,089
Look, I can handle this.

463
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,135
<i>It's okay. It's fine.
You have work to do.</i>

464
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,529
Well, if you won't talk to me,
will the doll?

465
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,694
That's because brahms is not a person.

466
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,739
He's not real.

467
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,659
<i>He doesn't need any food.
You do.</i>

468
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:25,011
The doll and his rules
do not run this house.

469
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,268
<i>Fine.
Stay here all night, then.</i>

470
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,018
What?

471
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,057
Jude.

472
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,263
Jude.

473
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,099
Liza, what in the hell happened?

474
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,577
Look, I believe you,
I do.

475
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,283
It's just...

476
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,744
So, some scary drawings.

477
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,832
<i>It's not really surprising, is it?
Considering what he's been through.</i>

478
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,083
The drawing of the dog.

479
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,721
The dog?

480
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,466
There is no dog here.

481
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,923
<i>There was one.
And others.</i>

482
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,351
Sean, there was a drawing of Jude
standing over our dead bodies

483
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,554
and he was holding a gun.

484
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,936
So, you're saying he ripped pages
out of his book?

485
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,108
No, I...

486
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,648
I don't know what happened.

487
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,278
I just know that I want that doll
out of our house.

488
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,859
<i>Look, you need to slow down.
I need to think about this.</i>

489
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,240
No, I don't want it here.

490
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,869
I don't like what it's doing to Jude.

491
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,837
What?

492
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,662
I mean, all of this.

493
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,000
This is a lot for a little kid,
don't you think?

494
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,506
This isn't a light table,
for starters.

495
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,129
Are you asking me if I did this?

496
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,806
<i>Somebody's done this.
You're the only person in here with him.</i>

497
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,227
No! Something is happening to him.

498
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,930
And it started with that doll.

499
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,937
<i>Fine. We'll get rid of the doll
in the morning, okay?</i>

500
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,899
What are we gonna do
about them, brahms?

501
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,450
Oz! Where are you, boy?

502
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,089
<i>Come here, oz.
Come here, boy.</i>

503
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,730
Oh, oz.

504
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,578
<i>Ah. Lovely.
I need that. Thank you.</i>

505
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,122
Ready? Yeah.

506
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,540
Let's do it.

507
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:45,999
Morning, mister.

508
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,085
No.

509
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,431
Sean.

510
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,602
Jude!

511
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,176
Come on, buddy!

512
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,728
It's not funny. Jude!

513
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,769
I'll go this way.

514
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,068
- You head off that way.
- Okay.

515
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,521
<i>We'll circle round.
We'll meet back at the house.</i>

516
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,775
Jude!

517
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,240
Jude!

518
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,567
Jude!

519
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,351
Jude?

520
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,757
Jude.

521
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,059
Jude?

522
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,895
Jude? Is that you?

523
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,526
Jude, what are you doing?

524
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,202
Jude, where are you?

525
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,090
This way, mommy.

526
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,925
Over here.

527
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,267
Come play with us, mommy.

528
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:48,662
Jude?

529
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,925
Jude.

530
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:57,981
I'm sorry I scared you.

531
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,933
We were just playing, mommy.

532
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,313
It's so good to hear your voice.

533
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,748
There you are.

534
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,896
<i>Been looking all over for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?</i>

535
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
No.

536
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,372
<i>Jude. What the hell
are you doing in here? It's not safe.</i>

537
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,467
I'm sorry, daddy.

538
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,795
Jude, he's...

539
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,131
You're talking.

540
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,086
Right, let's go.

541
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,548
We're not really supposed to be
in this part of the house.

542
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,722
Come on.

543
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,896
It's so nice to hear you talking.

544
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,575
Joseph, what happened in this house?

545
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,281
Uh, Jude, why don't you go
show brahms the music room?

546
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,168
Stay close, mate.

547
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,544
There was a family
that lived here a long time ago.

548
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,384
Had a son,
went a bit mad.

549
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,711
Killed a little girl.

550
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:12,219
<i>Got burnt up in fire.
Wore a mask to hide it.</i>

551
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,675
Lived inside the walls
of the house for 30 years.

552
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,180
Never came out.

553
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,386
The heelshires?

554
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,604
Yeah, the heelshires.

555
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:22,193
And?

556
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,606
And the parents committed suicide.

557
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,031
Drowned themselves.

558
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,901
It's a very sad story.

559
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,150
And the son?

560
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:34,908
Well, it all got a bit messy
after the parents had gone.

561
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,206
He killed a man, very nearly two others,

562
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,416
before he was killed himself.

563
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,708
But they're all dead and buried now.

564
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,083
What's the son's name?

565
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,095
His name was brahms.

566
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,132
Did you say brahms?

567
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,205
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to keep it from you.</i>

568
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,936
I just didn't think it'd ever come up.

569
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,597
Thank you for telling us.

570
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,311
<i>Come on, Jude.
It's time to go home.</i>

571
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,400
Hey, Joseph?

572
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,531
Did you ever find your dog?

573
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,950
Yes, I did.

574
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,703
I'm afraid oz was found
gutted in the forest.

575
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,296
I'm sorry to hear that.

576
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,841
<i>So, your parents fell me
you've been talking again.</i>

577
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,675
<i>Is this your new friend brahms?</i>

578
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,852
<i>He seems like a very nice friend.</i>

579
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,849
<i>What are some of the things
you talk about?</i>

580
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,935
He tells me all sorts of things.

581
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:52,189
Sometimes he tells me about
the other families he's lived with.

582
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,151
<i>Oh, has he lived with a lot of families?</i>

583
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,116
He wants to live with us now.

584
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,366
He was very angry that mommy and daddy
wanted to take him away.

585
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,918
<i>Oh, and when brahms gets angry,</i>

586
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:08,918
<i>does he say he wants fo
hurt someone or something?</i>

587
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,964
<i>Is there something
he wants to tell your mum and dad?</i>

588
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,895
<i>Well, if Jude had something fo do
with the dog's death,</i>

589
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,144
<i>then this is a lof more serious
than we thought.</i>

590
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,850
<i>The doll might be enabling him
fo shift blame</i>

591
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,937
<i>for all the bad things that he might do.</i>

592
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,694
<i>I think it would be a good idea
for me fo see him face-to-face.</i>

593
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,701
<i>When do you think
you can bring him down to London?</i>

594
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,788
We've got guests coming today,
but we'll bring him as soon as we can.

595
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,034
<i>All right, then.</i>

596
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,538
<i>But I urge you, keep a close eye on him
in the meanwhile.</i>

597
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,982
Jude! Everyone's here.

598
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:17,987
- Come on in, girls.
- All right.

599
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,305
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

600
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,320
<i>This is just fabulous!
I love it.</i>

601
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,489
Hello.

602
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,586
<i>Well, look.
There he is.</i>

603
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,456
You remember your old uncle Liam,
don't you?

604
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,461
Hey.

605
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:34,952
<i>What?
It's not my fault he's mental.</i>

606
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:41,298
And who's this handsome chap?

607
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,599
Brahms.

608
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,228
<i>Well, hello there, brahms.
Pleased to meet you.</i>

609
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,851
Any friend of Jude's
is a friend of mine.

610
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,755
Okay, children,
why don't we go outside and play

611
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,690
while we all have a catch-up.

612
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,781
Yes.

613
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,485
There's nothing to do outside.

614
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,532
<i>There's nature.
All right?</i>

615
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,156
<i>It's like a video game, but real.
Go, enjoy.</i>

616
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,454
<i>Come on, Jude.
Show them around.</i>

617
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,856
- Maybe I should go with them.
- Oh, nonsense. They'll be fine.

618
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,911
Just stay close to the house, guys.

619
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,580
This is so cool.

620
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,915
Shut up.

621
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,753
I like your doll.

622
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:20,963
Thanks.

623
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,342
This place sucks.

624
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,347
There's nothing to do here.

625
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,263
We could play croquet.

626
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,722
<i>I wanna play.
Come on.</i>

627
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,024
<i>Don't touch him, Sophie.
He's mental.</i>

628
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,561
No, I'm not.

629
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,191
My parents say you talk to that doll,

630
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,113
like it's a real person.

631
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,900
Because you went crazy
when your mum got attacked.

632
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,657
And we're not supposed to notice.

633
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,658
Will!

634
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,162
But they know you're mental.

635
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,618
And I know you're mental.

636
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,961
And your stupid doll,

637
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,505
he's the most mental of all.

638
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,015
He's fine, Liza.

639
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,935
Have some wine.

640
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,149
It'll do him good to hang out
with some other children.

641
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,316
Yeah.

642
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,275
I'm sorry.

643
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,488
Ever since it happened,
I just...

644
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,198
I can't seem to relax.

645
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,953
Hey, you're with family now.

646
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,035
You don't have anything to worry about.

647
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,546
And will won't let anything happen.

648
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,546
Hey, you're breaking it!

649
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,922
Shut up, nutter.

650
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,503
Stop it, will!

651
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,722
<i>Oh! You're sticking up
for your nutter boyfriend now.</i>

652
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,972
Maybe I should just smash your doll.

653
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,681
Maybe that will make you normal again.

654
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,776
Don't.

655
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,690
We get to this party,

656
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,602
and we have literally
just walked in the door,

657
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,440
and his pants split right in the bum.

658
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,992
And not just a little tear,
the whole bum!

659
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,535
I'm going to tell mum!

660
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,112
She'll probably be happy.

661
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,531
Don't touch him.

662
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,082
Or what?

663
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,119
Or he'll make you wish
you never came here.

664
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,213
Did you buy him purple boxers?

665
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,585
I did.

666
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,541
Kinky.

667
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,127
Oh, it's good to see
that smile again, Liza.

668
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,632
That old smile of yours.

669
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,091
Give it back!

670
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,471
Nah, I don't think I will.

671
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,018
Give it back to her.

672
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,096
Oh! Now your boyfriend's mad.

673
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,723
Why don't you come get it
from me, mental?

674
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,355
I wouldn't worry
about this doll thing.

675
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,607
Will used to be obsessed
with this blanket.

676
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,983
Run, mental, run.

677
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,405
Stop it, will!

678
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,858
Obsessed.

679
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:50,741
Then one day I realized that it was
quite literally a security blanket.

680
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,619
And I think this doll could be
the same thing.

681
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,085
Come on, mental.

682
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,582
You shouldn't worry about it,
is what I'm saying.

683
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,038
Kids do all sorts of weird things.

684
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,964
They go through phases.

685
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,417
And then poof, it's gone.

686
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,658
- Oh, my god.
- What? What's going on?

687
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,290
Will!

688
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,278
- Easy, on three. One, two, three.
- Mind his head!

689
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,213
Slowly. Slowly.

690
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,840
Mary, help with his head, okay?

691
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,839
Will, I'm coming in.

692
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,425
Sophie, get in the front.

693
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,956
Sweetheart, why don't you drink
some of this? It'll help you sleep.

694
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,882
A nap will do you good.

695
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,385
Okay?

696
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,438
There you go.

697
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:45,776
Mommy.

698
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,907
Everything's okay.

699
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,080
He won't let me go.

700
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,789
He wants me to live in the big house
with him forever.

701
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:09,210
He said he'd kill you and daddy
if I didn't do it.

702
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,045
He said that?

703
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,176
When did he say that?

704
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,937
He says it all the time.

705
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:25,392
I can't control him anymore.

706
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:27,648
He keeps getting stronger.

707
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,605
Well...

708
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,611
No one's gonna hurt mommy and daddy.

709
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,485
And no one's gonna hurt you.

710
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,536
Okay?

711
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:34,836
Hey, Liza, it's me.

712
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,673
<i>Um, we just saw the doctor.
I think will's gonna be okay.</i>

713
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,928
So, I'll call you from the car.

714
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,384
<i>All right.
I love you. Bye.</i>

715
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,255
Not from around here,
are you?

716
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:16,826
I'm staying at the glennview estates.

717
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,050
Glennview?

718
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,266
Oh, you mean the heelshire place.

719
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,265
Christ, you couldn't pay me money
to stop there.

720
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,889
- You what?
- You don't know?

721
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,231
Whole family went completely mad
out there.

722
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:36,156
Something fo do with a son
living inside the walls for years.

723
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,996
You see, but that's not the only thing
that happened out there.

724
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,331
There were other tragedies before.

725
01:06:54,677 --> 01:07:00,172
Back in the 50s, a kid killed
his own mother and brother,

726
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,723
convinced a doll was speaking to him.

727
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,979
And its still going on.

728
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:16,647
Last year, that city man
that bought it after the heelshires

729
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:19,232
went a bit mad and disappeared.

730
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:21,192
Never heard from again.

731
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,653
I saw him down the pub one time.

732
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,864
Old crazy Joe.

733
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:27,039
Crazy Joe?

734
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,993
<i>That's what people called him, like.
His name were Joseph...</i>

735
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,411
Oh, my god. Jude!

736
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,787
Jude!

737
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:11,878
Jude!

738
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,540
Jude!

739
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,344
Didn't have to be like this.

740
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,342
Joseph.

741
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:29,894
Is Jude okay?

742
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,648
<i>Don't worry.
He's safe.</i>

743
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,565
Safer now than he's probably
ever been in his life.

744
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,271
Why are you here?

745
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,321
I'm here because he wants me to be.

746
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,204
Who?

747
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,405
Brahms.

748
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:54,543
He doesn't like it like this,
but you've done it to yourself.

749
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,167
I just wanna know where my son is.

750
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,177
<i>I will do anything you want.
Just give me my son.</i>

751
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,957
I want you to listen!

752
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,635
He wants you to listen!

753
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,638
You asked me why I'm here.

754
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,684
It's the same reason that you are.

755
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,269
He called me.

756
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:14,598
He calls out to the ones that need him.

757
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,308
The damaged ones.

758
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,268
He looks inside you.

759
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,321
It was just a whisper...

760
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,941
At first,

761
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,652
when I first came here.

762
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,487
So quiet.

763
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,782
And he was in pieces when I found him,

764
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,367
broken.

765
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,791
And then the voice said...

766
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,039
Lo put him back together.

767
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,005
So I did.

768
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,264
Then I heard him, growing inside.

769
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,391
You must have heard it.

770
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,732
<i>Jude sure has.
Oh, yeah.</i>

771
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,568
I don't know what brahms is,

772
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,896
but you can stop this.

773
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,072
It's too late.

774
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,743
Brahms and Jude are gonna be one,
and it'll be beautiful.

775
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,537
Everybody thought that I was crazy.

776
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,874
They thought the heelshires
were crazy, but, no.

777
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,161
It's always been the doll.

778
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,676
Even before the house,
before the Davies, the ones before that.

779
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,002
I found all their old letters.

780
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:29,510
He knew that you were coming.

781
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:34,052
He knew your boy would find him.

782
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,472
That's why he told me to bury him.

783
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,707
<i>They're always so curious, aren't they?
The little ones are like...</i>

784
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,402
Like moths to a flame.

785
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,943
Joseph, where is my son?

786
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,199
I wanna see my son!

787
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,571
He's in the big house!

788
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,416
Jude!

789
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,140
Jude!

790
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:14,718
Jude!

791
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,501
Jude.

792
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:40,956
Jude?

793
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,329
<i>Over here.</i>

794
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,224
<i>This way.</i>

795
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,896
<i>We're just over here.</i>

796
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,161
Jude...

797
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,965
I know you don't wanna hurt anybody.

798
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,049
This isn't you, Jude.

799
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,763
Please, put him down.

800
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,524
It's going to be okay.

801
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,646
Can I hold brahms?

802
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,714
I used to hold you just like this.

803
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:57,718
Let's just put him down.

804
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,768
Hello, mommy.

805
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,698
Jude, put the gun down.

806
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,444
We're very angry.

807
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,743
You and daddy
have been getting in the way.

808
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,494
We're going to live here now...

809
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:31,581
Because you can't protect us.

810
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,591
Protect you from who?

811
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,502
That dog.

812
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,140
Will.

813
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,301
And those men from that night.

814
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,391
You're right.

815
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:49,148
We do need brahms to protect us.

816
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,441
It's too late.

817
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,277
You've given us no choice.

818
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,483
Goodbye, mommy.

819
01:14:55,574 --> 01:15:00,364
I know brahms
is telling you what to say.

820
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:05,619
Which is why we need
to take him home with us.

821
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,543
Brahms needs to be
a member of our family.

822
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,913
And what kind of a family
doesn't need a mother?

823
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,481
Mom?

824
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,567
Jude.

825
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:45,058
What have you done?

826
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,197
What have you done?

827
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:48,248
What have you done?

828
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:50,371
Stay back.

829
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,498
<i>It's me he'll punish.
I'm the one who didn't protect him.</i>

830
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:59,051
<i>No, no. Joseph,
brahms can't hurt you anymore.</i>

831
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,264
You don't understand.

832
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,430
It will never be over.

833
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,305
It's gonna be all right, brahms.

834
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,981
- Mom! You're home.
- Yes. I missed you.

835
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,815
- I missed you too.
- Really?

836
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,697
- Perfect timing.
- Hey.

837
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,118
<i>Hey, beautiful.
How was your day?</i>

838
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,241
It was good.

839
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,665
I think we might sign that author
I was telling you about.

840
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,162
Yeah? Nice!

841
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:37,288
All righty.

842
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,193
Wait until you taste it,
because I'm pretty confident

843
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,252
that this might be

844
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:45,551
the greatest cog au vin
ever made upon english shores.

845
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,048
I'm not even joking.

846
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,242
There's a whole bottle of wine in here,
so I'm not sure if...

847
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,972
<i>No, okay.
I will give you some.</i>

848
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,800
- Thank you.
- All right.

849
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,101
This looks so good.

850
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:55,188
Thank you.

851
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,641
Just two or three hours of my day.

852
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:57,732
- Hmm?
- Nothing much.

853
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,766
Is it my turn tomorrow?

854
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,522
Yeah. Cheers.

855
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,354
<i>Good night, my man.
You sleep tight.</i>

856
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,653
I love you, sweetie.

857
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,075
Love you too.

858
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Good night.

859
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,264
Good night, brahms.

860
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,551
I think we'll be happy here.

861
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,516
If they learn the rules.
