1
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:12,662
"THE MIND IS ITS OWN PLACE AND IN ITSELF,
CAN MAKE A HEAVEN OF HELL..."

2
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,558
"...A HELL OF HEAVEN."
- John Milton, Paradise Lost

3
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:37,390
The great poet, Goethe,
said at the end of his life

4
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,393
that he couldn't see one single mistake

5
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:47,533
among his fellow human beings
that he hadn't himself committed.

6
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:52,822
If Goethe saw his fellow
humans like this,

7
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:58,077
how do you think then that the
Son of Man looks upon us?

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,208
Jesus' message
is one of forgiveness.

9
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:10,281
So, my dear friends:
There is no Hell.

10
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,761
Now you want to sing, right?

11
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:22,727
We will. Now it happeneds that there are
two psalm numbers on the board.

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,233
So which should we take?
We'll actually do both at once.

13
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:36,574
Because it's so that
in the psalm book from 1937,

14
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:40,036
we'll be singing psalm number 21.

15
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:46,150
I've written 297 to prevent confusion in case it
should so be that any of you has the edition from 1986.

16
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,421
But both my dad and me...

17
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:54,258
...we might snort a bit about
these kinds of modern things.

18
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:02,467
But now you know. Psalm 21,
"Wonderful is the Earth".

19
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,941
If it is so that one imagines
certain things, Elsie,

20
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,236
it is possible to receive medical help.

21
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,573
One can talk to a doctor,
one can get medicial help...

22
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:22,953
Nothing helps.

23
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,166
I see things.

24
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:38,837
When is the last time that you saw a spirit?

25
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,145
I see one right now.

26
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:55,069
- Now? In here?
- Yes.

27
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,573
To the left, behind you.

28
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,708
I can't see anything.

29
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,505
- Can you see who this spirit is?
- Yes.

30
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,718
It's your mother.

31
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,100
Really? I see.

32
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,562
And what does little mom want?

33
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:35,401
She is sad.
Extremely sad.

34
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:41,949
- About whom?
- About you.

35
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,041
I think that we do so that you go home
and take a calming bath.

36
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:55,629
And then you open The Good Book
and read something from The Book of Psalms.

37
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:02,511
- And which psalm should I read?
- It doesn't matter. They're all hits.

38
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,400
- Hello.
- Hi, Karolina.

39
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:22,031
- Has he eaten? - Sausage and macaroni,
and a little chocolate ice cream.

40
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:26,410
- And a little... Seems there's always
room for that. - Just like last time.

41
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:30,956
It's gone very well.
And the meeting with Elsie?

42
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:35,711
Yes, it...
It went well.

43
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:41,175
Yes, I think so. It went well.

44
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,928
I'm meeting her tomorrow.

45
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:49,725
- Did you sleep last night?
- Yes.

46
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,689
Did you dream again?
About your mother in the kitchen?

47
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:59,652
- You have been dreaming the same dream
for two weeks. - Please, it'll work out.

48
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,988
Is he in his room?

49
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,410
He's going to be really happy about that.

50
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:28,139
How are you? Is everything going well?

51
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:37,773
It looks like it's going well,
so I won't disturb.

52
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:43,112
It's just that it feels
a little lumpy here in the sofa.

53
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:47,742
Do you think - I think there's possibly
a present lying here.

54
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:52,204
A small present
to Jesper from daddy.

55
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,839
It's not...

56
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:07,136
It's no...
Just a small thing.

57
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,528
- Hi!
- Hi, mommy.

58
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:38,250
- We're going to have fun tomorrow.
- Hi.

59
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,670
Hi.

60
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,884
I'll take it.

61
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,888
- Are you going to tell your daddy goodbye?
- You're at Henrik Horneus' place.

62
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:55,101
I'll let you steer.
Tell your daddy goodbye.

63
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:59,430
He's a little occupied.
Can I tell him anything?

64
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,442
Super. Super.

65
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,654
I understand.

66
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:12,243
- Come on.
- Goodbye.

67
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,995
Goodbye.

68
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,916
Goodbye, son.

69
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,587
- Have a good time then.
- I'll tell him.

70
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,093
Bye.

71
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,977
It's just a phase.

72
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:49,113
- Who was it? - It was the expert on
forensic medicine in Hammerdal.

73
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:55,870
The expert on forensic medicine
in Hammerdal? What did he want?

74
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,497
Henrik...

75
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,084
Your dad is dead.

76
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:15,306
- I'm sorry.
- What?

77
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:23,147
Okay. How...

78
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:28,694
- And how did he die?
- He drowned.

79
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,739
I see.

80
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:37,453
Right.
Did he say anything else?

81
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,958
But he must have said something.
Didn't he leave a number?

82
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,927
Don't you think that it's odd that it is...

83
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,967
...the expert on forensic medicine calling.

84
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:00,368
It's the Police that should be
delivering such messages.

85
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,938
Is it the expert on forensic medicine
that calls around saying such?

86
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:07,566
Maybe there's so few people
working with such up there.

87
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:13,197
- There are few working with such? And you know this?
- No I don't, but I could imagine...

88
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:19,578
Yes, you can imagine, but you don't know. And I don't
know either. None of us knows. I just find it odd.

89
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:24,125
I think it's really odd.
Extremely odd.

90
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,838
- I need to go up there and solve this.
- Now? You want to go now?

91
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:32,258
- I'm planning on leaving now, yes.
- You can't go tonight.

92
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,344
And why can't I drive now?

93
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:40,433
Because it's almost dark, and you're upset.
It's dangerous for you to go.

94
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,566
Okay.

95
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,989
- I have to go.
- Yes, of course.

96
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,617
- You...
- Goodbye. Very well.

97
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:05,958
- Tell me if there's something I can do.
- Yes, no worries.

98
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:10,004
I can sleep over if you want me to.

99
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,051
No, thank you, that's not necessary.

100
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,820
Henrik!

101
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,355
And in this late hour we have
a listener with us.

102
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,900
It's Gunn from Hede.

103
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,611
Hi, Gunn. Welcome.

104
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:03,284
Gunn, this is not the first time you're
calling Hammerdal's local radio.

105
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,038
You called last month
to reveal a recipe.

106
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:10,791
A recipe on a cake that has been passed down
in your family for generations.

107
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:15,004
- Yes, it was my father's mother's.
- And what sorts of reactions did you get?

108
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,633
- Reactions to what? - Was there a big commotion
when you revealed your family's recipe?

109
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,721
No.

110
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,724
So, what makes you call us
at an hour like this?

111
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:32,355
- I want to tell someone hi.
- And who do you want to tell hi?

112
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,776
- I want to say hello to my mother.
- Your mother?

113
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,737
- Her name is Gurli.
- And where does your mother live?

114
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:43,574
She lives at...

115
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:51,999
And what do you want to tell her?
If she listens.

116
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:57,672
Is she a night owl?

117
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,678
I want to tell her...

118
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,960
Hello!

119
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,799
Hello!

120
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,831
Hi.

121
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:52,800
You're up very late.

122
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:59,056
Do you live here? Together with your
mother and father in the house over there?

123
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,148
Has anything happened?

124
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,656
How are you?

125
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:22,038
My name is Henrik.

126
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,832
And I'm a priest.

127
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,894
- Hello?
- Who is it?

128
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:49,565
- Who is it?
- No! I'm a priest!

129
00:19:56,822 --> 00:20:02,036
I actually am a priest.

130
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:08,084
I'm a priest.
That could be good to know.

131
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:12,963
So you don't think that it's some
unpleasant person that you're letting in.

132
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:19,045
That you would possibly be willing to
let in...I hope.

133
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:29,146
I'm Henrik Horneus, by the way.
My father was Gabriel Horneus.

134
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,069
Who was...

135
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:41,167
Who was a priest up here,
from what I've understood.

136
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:47,915
We offer our condolences.

137
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,712
You can have Olle's room.
You sleep on the sofa.

138
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,802
Thank you.

139
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,805
This is better than Grand Hotel.

140
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:07,351
You... Excuse me, I didn't catch your name.

141
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,231
Nora.

142
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:19,530
- What were you doing by the barn?
- By the barn...

143
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,075
By the barn...

144
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,706
Do you have more children?

145
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:31,334
No.

146
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:37,548
No... Do you know the expert
on forensic medicine here?

147
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,343
I need to ask him some questions
in relation to my father's death.

148
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:44,555
Then we wish the priest
a good night's sleep.

149
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:53,439
- Then we say good night.
- Good night.

150
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:03,866
Olle, we're sayig good night.

151
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,552
Help me.

152
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,520
Help me.

153
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:52,928
He was a big man.

154
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:57,725
I got it from your father.
When I started at the faculty.

155
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:02,188
I quit my studies.

156
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:06,609
There were too many frauds.
The Swedish church is full of them.

157
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:15,201
It must have been fantastic
to have a father like that.

158
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:21,867
Without faith I would never
have made it in this...family.

159
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:28,255
But your father...

160
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:35,054
- At every church service he read the psalm.
- The psalm?

161
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:38,349
Psalm 21.

162
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:44,456
I assume that you, if anyone,
are familiar with it.

163
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:50,236
Yes. "Wonderful is the Earth."

164
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,572
No.

165
00:26:57,118 --> 00:27:01,664
Olle, I want to ask you how...

166
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:08,879
Whether you know how dad died?

167
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:14,760
- Was it an accident?
- I wouldn't say so.

168
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:23,978
He was murdered.

169
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,235
He was murdered?

170
00:27:33,863 --> 00:27:39,769
I don't understand what you mean.
How was he murdered?

171
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:44,498
His body was found
in the Dead Lake.

172
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:48,002
It's been light in the barn every night
since he died.

173
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:52,590
What are you talking about?

174
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:56,302
What are you talking about?
Who murdered him?

175
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:58,846
Time will show.

176
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:04,935
Wait a minute... What is it that
you're telling me? How do you know this?

177
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:10,149
- God showed me.
- God showed you?

178
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:16,247
I wasn't allowed to go to the funeral.
Ivar forbid me to.

179
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:22,119
- Has dad been buried?
- Your father was buried yesterday afternoon.

180
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:26,540
They were obviously in a hurry
to get him under ground.

181
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:06,789
- Yes, it's Henrik.
- It's me.

182
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:12,003
- How are you?
- Not so well.

183
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,673
Why not?

184
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,760
What's wrong?

185
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:24,807
- Karolina, What's wrong?
- Elsie...

186
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:28,728
What is it about Elsie?

187
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:34,525
What is it about Elsie?
Has anything happened to her?

188
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,654
Yes. She's dead.

189
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,867
- Oh, Henrik...
- When did this happen?

190
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:49,257
- Yesterday. Yesterday evening.
- When?

191
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:54,295
- Does it matter?
- At what time?

192
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:59,050
- What time?
- Sometime just before midnight.

193
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:09,560
She didn't answer when I knocked,
so I entered with my key. And in the bathroom...

194
00:30:10,353 --> 00:30:15,691
In the bathroom...
Something was written on the bathroom wall.

195
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:19,653
- What did it say?
- Something was written.

196
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:24,575
- What did it say?
- And there were containers.

197
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,746
- Containers for pills.
- What did it say on the wall?

198
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:34,085
- She had written it with blood.
- What did it say?

199
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:40,216
"Must Henrik...
Must Henrik Horneus burn in hell!"

200
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,765
And...

201
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:50,976
Her face...

202
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,274
We'll talk about it when I come home.

203
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,404
- Don't hang up.
- We'll talk about it later.

204
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,865
- Please.
- We'll talk about it later.

205
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,452
We'll talk about it later.

206
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,297
Yes, I think so.

207
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,718
I don't know.

208
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:27,805
I'll take him to the road. To the car.

209
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:32,810
Then we'll have to fix that somehow.

210
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:35,855
Yes, somehow.

211
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,777
No, I don't think so.
Then he wouldn't have stayed.

212
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:52,538
Yes... Ivar. Very well.
I thought...

213
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:57,293
Now I and the priest with go to the
priest's car and fix this.

214
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,921
Yes, but I thought we could
call the expert on forensic medicine.

215
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:06,510
Now we'll make sure that the priest's car
gets fixed. The practical part first.

216
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:11,432
Yes, right, but we said yesterday that
we should call the expert on forensic medicine...

217
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:16,228
Det practical part first. When the house
is built, can we put in the furniture.

218
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:21,776
The practical part first.
You can borrow Olle's boots.

219
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:29,283
We'll fix the car first, then we'll fix
the other things. The practical part first.

220
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:31,971
No, it's dead.

221
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:35,307
We're just going to have to
wait for the tow truck.

222
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:38,436
Let's remove it from the road.

223
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:18,054
Yes?

224
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:20,556
Hello?

225
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:28,230
- Hi, my name is Henrik.
- Go away.

226
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:34,403
Are you related to Gabriel Horneus?

227
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:41,619
Gabriel's boy. In Stockholm.

228
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:45,748
With old grandmother.

229
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:53,339
I haven't heard anything.

230
00:36:53,464 --> 00:36:56,759
He lived up there until the end.

231
00:37:08,104 --> 00:37:13,359
- And grandfather?
- Alvar?

232
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:20,291
He killed himself.
In the broken tree by the road.

233
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:25,121
Your father cut him down.

234
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:29,709
One didn't talk about such.

235
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:37,091
But my, the boy could preach.

236
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,844
You can be proud.

237
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:45,892
He frightened the entire village to
healthy fear of God.

238
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,186
He described the last judgement.

239
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:55,276
What happends with those that betray God.
What sort of pay that awaits.

240
00:37:55,401 --> 00:38:00,948
"If we can't hold our fingers in
boiling water for a second," did he say,

241
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:06,996
"how would it then feel like to be
in a boiling pot for the rest of eternity?"

242
00:38:08,873 --> 00:38:12,585
It worked.

243
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:22,470
But the Tempter hated it. Hated.

244
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:29,518
And that was why he sent
a messenger. He sendt her.

245
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:34,940
Yes, even your father
was a man in the flesh.

246
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:41,565
It was disgraceful woman.
A dirty, dirty little whore.

247
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:47,286
And he fell. Over and over again.

248
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,459
I asked him to fight!

249
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,672
And Christ was victorious.

250
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:02,927
But in the end...

251
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:10,234
From the dirty stump spread the bad,
and the bad got the upper hand.

252
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:16,482
And it screamed in him.
It screamed.

253
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:21,821
The last day he walked around here
as a foaming stallion.

254
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,195
That was the last that I saw of my boy,
when he went over to the whore for the last time.

255
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,547
I think dad was murdered.

256
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:45,928
I think it was the father
of the Lidman family...

257
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:49,306
No. No.

258
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:56,647
The father of the Lidman family is an
irreproachable man. There's a child there.

259
00:39:56,772 --> 00:40:00,901
It's no good child.
So you must have felt.

260
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:06,958
It's a damaged, horrible, evil child.

261
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:10,745
A child that killed your father.

262
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,821
No.

263
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:26,959
Henrik.

264
00:44:30,046 --> 00:44:32,089
Henrik...

265
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:36,469
Come, Henrik!

266
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:38,846
Come.

267
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:43,851
Mommy will show you.

268
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,937
Mommy will show you everything!

269
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:26,018
What were you doing in the barn?

270
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:30,898
- Nothing.
- What were you doing in the barn?

271
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:35,361
I did nothing. Please, Olle,
you have to believe me.

272
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:46,114
My father. lvar...
I hate that man.

273
00:45:48,374 --> 00:45:50,501
Hate.

274
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:55,965
But our carnal fathers are nothing.
Our spiritual father is everything.

275
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,218
"Our God is coming. God's anger
burst forwards like a storm."

276
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:05,850
But the Roman letter... Paul says we
should fight the evil with the good.

277
00:46:05,975 --> 00:46:11,889
Nahum from Alqosh: "The Lord is
a vengeful God full of suffering."

278
00:46:12,315 --> 00:46:15,609
"The Lord revenges his opponents."

279
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:20,156
Psalm 137: "Happy is the one who repays you
according to what you have done to us."

280
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:26,120
"Happy is the one who seizes your infants
and dashes them against the rocks."

281
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:30,833
"The mercy of the Lord infinite,
his compassion never ends."

282
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,711
- Psalm 58.
- To forgive is the central part.

283
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:40,384
Isaiah 1, verse 25:
"I will avenge Me of Mine enemies."

284
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:45,139
"And they shall both burn together,
in a fire that will never end."

285
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:49,310
"Glowing coal and sulphur:
burning winds is the weight they'll get."

286
00:46:49,435 --> 00:46:54,982
Jesaja 66, vers 16: "With fire and with his sword
the Lord will execute judgment on all people."

287
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:59,153
"And they will go out and look on the dead
bodies of those who rebelled against me."

288
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:04,283
"The worms that eat them will not die,
the fire that burns them will not be quenched."

289
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:10,247
The Swedish church has since 1983

290
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:14,710
- refused the existence of a hell.
- They're cowardly.

291
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:20,508
They're cowards and infidels...
The disgracful... Murderers!

292
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:24,470
Their place is in the sea
burning of sulfur and fire.

293
00:47:24,637 --> 00:47:30,976
"They shall be tormented day and night for ever
and ever." Book of Revelation, Chapter 20.

294
00:47:31,102 --> 00:47:34,271
1983...

295
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:38,859
Can you feel it?

296
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:43,864
The Bronze Gates has opened.

297
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:50,371
All the way down to the Ninth Circle.

298
00:47:50,496 --> 00:47:54,709
Open your eyes and see!

299
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:59,880
Take the sword that God
has put before you.

300
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:20,109
PSALM 21.

301
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:31,282
PSALM 21.

302
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:52,178
"Thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies..."

303
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:56,057
"thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee."

304
00:50:56,223 --> 00:51:00,478
"Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace"

305
00:51:01,479 --> 00:51:03,689
"in the time of thine anger."

306
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:09,487
"The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath,
and the fire shall devour them."

307
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:15,076
"Their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth,"

308
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:19,205
"and their seed from
among the children of men."

309
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:22,166
"For they intended evil against thee,"

310
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:24,752
"they imagined a device,"

311
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:30,383
"wherewith they shall not prevail.
For thou shalt make them turn their back,"

312
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:35,304
"thou shalt make ready with thy
bowstrings against the face of them."

313
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,683
"Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength,"

314
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:42,728
"so will we sing and praise Thy power."

315
00:51:45,523 --> 00:51:50,361
"Thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies,"

316
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:55,616
"thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee."

317
00:51:56,575 --> 00:52:00,329
"Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace"

318
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:03,416
"in the time of thine anger."

319
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:08,921
"The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath,
and the fire shall devour them."

320
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:14,468
"Their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth,"

321
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:18,014
"and their seed from
among the children of men."

322
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,766
"For they intended evil against thee,"

323
00:52:20,891 --> 00:52:25,021
"they imagined a device,
wherewith they shall not prevail."

324
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:30,359
"For thou shalt make them turn their back,"

325
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:34,280
"thou shalt make ready with thy
bowstrings against the face of them."

326
00:52:34,405 --> 00:52:36,824
"Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength,"

327
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:41,579
"so will we sing and praise Thy power."

328
00:52:42,705 --> 00:52:47,585
"Thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies,"

329
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:52,590
"thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee."

330
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:56,635
"Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace."

331
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:01,724
Henrik, why did you do it?

332
00:53:03,434 --> 00:53:06,437
Why did you leave me?

333
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:12,985
Why did you leave me?!

334
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,493
Good God, help me!

335
00:55:25,618 --> 00:55:29,789
There is no God!

336
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:40,049
Why did you leave me?!

337
00:55:55,147 --> 00:56:01,988
I believe you. It exists!
Hell exists!

338
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:29,932
What have you done?
Who told you? Who told you?

339
00:56:31,976 --> 00:56:33,811
No!

340
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:39,025
- He's coming now!
- Calm!

341
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:43,654
- Nobody's coming!
- It's coming!

342
00:56:49,827 --> 00:56:54,749
It has started now.
It's you!

343
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:02,757
They're going to take you
like they took your father.

344
00:57:02,882 --> 00:57:07,219
Don't you see? The expert of forensic
medicine is on his hunting team.

345
00:57:07,345 --> 00:57:12,725
He killed your father, and the expert
of forensic medicine covered it.

346
00:57:13,017 --> 00:57:16,062
Run!

347
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,522
Olle!

348
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:22,902
Now it's time to reap
what some has sowed.

349
00:57:23,027 --> 00:57:28,032
Tonight when the lamp in the barn
is lighted again... He's coming now!

350
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:34,105
In fire!
With the Lord's flaming sword!

351
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:16,330
Help me... Help me!

352
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:22,294
Are you so weak? Are you so weak
that you're letting him laugh scornfully?

353
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:26,298
Are you so weak that you let him murder
your father and then laugh scornfully?

354
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:31,345
No! No, I'll report him.

355
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:36,934
Report him? What do you think
that will matter?

356
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:41,689
If justice is to win, you'll have to
take fate into your own hands.

357
00:58:41,814 --> 00:58:46,736
It's time to do what you came for.
It's time to revenge your father.

358
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:52,074
I'll show you the way.
I'll give you the tool.

359
00:58:56,954 --> 00:59:00,416
I'm so tired.

360
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:05,004
Rest.

361
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:11,052
When you awake, you shall arise
in new shape.

362
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:38,704
Yes, well then.

363
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:42,667
Nora.

364
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:02,770
Olle... Where have you been?

365
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:06,440
But sit down.

366
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,456
Who lit the light in the barn?

367
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,794
Who lit the light in the barn?

368
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:31,590
Olle, who lit the light in the barn?

369
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:16,719
First I will read
a psalm to you.

370
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:22,558
A psalm that his father read
at every church service.

371
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:26,145
You'll probably remember it.

372
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:32,226
It's a psalm expressing the core
of the faith. It's about the enemies of God.

373
01:01:33,486 --> 01:01:37,365
It's about you.

374
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:43,846
- It's psalm 21.
- The priest shall... We'll call Lars- Erik.

375
01:01:44,664 --> 01:01:47,667
It's too late!

376
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,505
The priest has asked you about calling Lars-Erik
for three days, but you have declined.

377
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,257
Because you know that he's lying! You know!

378
01:01:55,383 --> 01:02:01,055
If one takes the life of a God's servant
one has commited a deadly sin.

379
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:07,753
You know. You know, and you will get your
punishment now and in all eternity.

380
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:10,648
Olle...

381
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:13,359
Psalm 21 goes like this:

382
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:17,780
- "Thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies." - It was you.

383
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:22,994
- "Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace."
- It was you that lit the light in the barn every night.

384
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,871
"Make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger."

385
01:02:25,997 --> 01:02:29,542
There's something you need to know.
There's something you don't know.

386
01:02:29,709 --> 01:02:35,965
"The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath,
and the fire shall devour them."

387
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:40,761
- There's something you need to know.
- "The fire shall devour them."

388
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:45,933
"Their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth, and their seed..."

389
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:50,730
- Tell!
- "For they intended evil against thee..."

390
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:54,233
- Tell! You've misunderstood everything!
- Silence!

391
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:58,195
- Tell him! - "...with thy bowstrings
against the face of them."

392
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:01,365
Amen!

393
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:05,745
Amen! Hit! Amen! Hit! Hit! Hit!

394
01:03:07,413 --> 01:03:11,250
He did horrible things!

395
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:20,134
One aren't allowed to do so.
One aren't allowed to do so.

396
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:24,138
Him and me in the barn
when we were reading.

397
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:30,811
"The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath,
and the fire shall devour them."

398
01:03:31,729 --> 01:03:35,441
"Their fruit shalt thou
destroy from the earth,"

399
01:03:35,608 --> 01:03:39,654
"and their seed from among
the children of men."

400
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:43,866
"So will we sing and praise Thy power."

401
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:49,705
"Thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies."

402
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:56,712
"Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger."

403
01:03:56,837 --> 01:04:01,592
"The Lord shall swallow them up
in His wrath..."

404
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:04,595
Amen.

405
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:21,320
And it continued after the wedding.

406
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:26,826
It continued after the wedding...

407
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:32,915
It was a disgraceful woman.
A shame.

408
01:04:33,124 --> 01:04:37,128
A dirty, dirty little whore.

409
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:56,047
She's lying. She's lying. Lies.

410
01:04:56,981 --> 01:05:02,236
- Hit! Hit! Hit!
- Oh, Olle.

411
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:10,661
Gabriel is your father.

412
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:26,177
It's strange...

413
01:05:27,595 --> 01:05:33,560
It strange, but I always felt
that was the way it should be.

414
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:41,609
And it makes it so much easier.

415
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:44,945
It was my fault!

416
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:51,952
There is a child there. It's not
good child, so you must have felt.

417
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:57,750
A damaged, horrible, evil child.

418
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,836
- It was me that did it.
- A child that killed your father.

419
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:06,008
It was my fault.
You and dad was in the forest.

420
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:12,932
Mom was cutting my hair.

421
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:21,148
Then...
Then came...

422
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:29,281
He talked to mom.

423
01:06:29,407 --> 01:06:32,868
They talked well.

424
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:36,372
Then...

425
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:43,796
Horneus, he...

426
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:48,926
His hand...

427
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:53,306
His hand...

428
01:06:56,684 --> 01:07:01,063
And mom...she saw...

429
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,319
Mom talked...

430
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:10,614
And mom pointed...

431
01:07:12,742 --> 01:07:16,412
He bent over...

432
01:07:18,998 --> 01:07:21,167
And mom...

433
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,921
...mom...

434
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:47,577
...mom...

435
01:09:18,117 --> 01:09:21,162
DROWNING

436
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:28,544
Olle!

437
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:42,016
lvar!

438
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:49,940
Olle!

439
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:09,437
I didn't say anything.

440
01:11:10,855 --> 01:11:13,107
Dad.

441
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:18,571
I didn't say anything.

442
01:11:18,696 --> 01:11:23,659
But you told, Henrik.
You told.

443
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,455
No, I didn't.

444
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:33,336
One isn't allowed to tell, Henrik.
And you knew.

445
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:42,553
It was our little secret.
Our little, little secret.

446
01:11:43,721 --> 01:11:49,101
That mom wasn't supposed to know.
It was between the two of us.

447
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:53,856
Between the two of us.

448
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:15,169
- But I didn't say nothing.
- Henrik, she did know.

449
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:23,094
Confess now, Henrik.
It's better that way.

450
01:12:41,988 --> 01:12:47,427
- Henrik, do you know what happends
when one tells? - No.

451
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:53,666
Henrik, I've told you
many times.

452
01:13:13,311 --> 01:13:18,733
What happends when one tells,
is that one has to be punished.

453
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:21,569
Punished hard.

454
01:13:24,155 --> 01:13:28,326
For a very long time.

455
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:31,954
Very long time.

456
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:56,437
Forgive me!

457
01:13:57,063 --> 01:14:01,651
Dad...forgive me!

458
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,905
It's too late.

459
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:19,543
Henrik, it doesn't help
that you've been standing there preaching,

460
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:24,090
pretending that the punishment
is just an idea.

461
01:14:24,215 --> 01:14:30,121
You cannot lie away the Sword
of Truth. The lies will get you.

462
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:35,434
You can't joke away the Day of Judgement.

463
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:40,815
When God shows you
His face of anger,

464
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:46,938
will you understand how
gruesome a God he is.

465
01:15:02,962 --> 01:15:10,261
I cannot believe in a God that is
less merciful than myself.

466
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:16,017
You're just making it worse for yourself.

467
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:34,618
You have to be thrown down. Now.

468
01:15:35,494 --> 01:15:41,083
Down into the dark abyss
from which noone returns.

469
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:45,004
Down into the lake that burns
of fire and sulfur.

470
01:15:45,129 --> 01:15:49,884
Down...into hell.

471
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:56,223
Oh God! Oh God!

472
01:15:58,309 --> 01:16:02,563
He can't help you now.

473
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:07,068
It's a completely different power
that you will meet.

474
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:12,031
You will meet yourself.

475
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:24,729
My boy.

476
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:29,775
My pretty, pretty boy.

477
01:18:26,499 --> 01:18:29,669
It's here.

478
01:18:46,686 --> 01:18:50,523
We found you on the floor
in the kitchen last night.

479
01:18:50,648 --> 01:18:53,901
Dad carried you up.

480
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:03,494
How are you?

481
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:28,194
Yes... Lars-Erik Niskala.
Expert on forensic medicine in Hammerdal.

482
01:20:15,191 --> 01:20:20,154
- The priest will meet at the assembly?
- Yes.

483
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:24,408
Ajna want to say something.

484
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:50,476
"It leads your way through life,"
he said.

485
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:58,359
We used to sit here and read.

486
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:08,485
Your father would have wanted that
someone believing in it should have it.

487
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:27,505
Yes, after all it does say
some good things as well.

488
01:27:17,405 --> 01:27:23,370
The topic of today's sermon
is possibly a little...

489
01:27:24,495 --> 01:27:28,874
...unorthodox. Maybe.

490
01:27:29,542 --> 01:27:33,337
The last week has been...

491
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:38,342
The last week has been
a bit odd for me.

492
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:43,472
But I sleep a lot better now.

493
01:27:44,849 --> 01:27:48,269
I sleep better than I've done
in a long time.

494
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:53,816
I dream different dreams.
Good dreams.

495
01:27:55,484 --> 01:28:01,391
I dream about a world without shame
and without blame.

496
01:28:05,077 --> 01:28:11,020
Do not judge,
so you will not yourself become judged.

497
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:18,341
A carpenter's son from Nazareth
once said this.

498
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:25,794
But what does the religions do?
What does the Churches do?

499
01:28:28,351 --> 01:28:33,230
The way I see it, religions exist
for one reason only.

500
01:28:33,356 --> 01:28:38,027
In order to repress the people.

501
01:28:38,486 --> 01:28:43,532
To scare the serving classes
into obedience.

502
01:28:43,658 --> 01:28:47,620
So they will not dare to challenge
the privileges of the elite.

503
01:28:47,745 --> 01:28:53,735
And the elite,
ladies and gentlemen, are you.

504
01:28:54,460 --> 01:29:00,400
You never had sin and shamed
beaten into you.

505
01:29:01,425 --> 01:29:07,390
The elite, that has always been sitting
in this church, not in some country church,

506
01:29:07,515 --> 01:29:11,519
has never needed
to listen to sermons about hell.

507
01:29:11,811 --> 01:29:14,355
What is he saying?

508
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:19,694
At the end of the 1800s, when one
wanted dedemonise the church,

509
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:25,825
arch bishop Sundberg said "Yes".

510
01:29:27,493 --> 01:29:32,999
"But a peasant hell
will always be needed."

511
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:41,549
"A peasant hell
will always be needed."

512
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:48,306
- Is he joking? - The one with the power
defines what's moral

513
01:29:48,389 --> 01:29:55,229
in the name of the Holy Lord.
But noone, noone, has monopoly on God!

514
01:29:56,772 --> 01:30:03,404
I told you last week, I don't know if you remember,
but I said that there is no hell. But I was wrong.

515
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:08,451
I was wrong. There is a hell.
I know now.

516
01:30:08,617 --> 01:30:13,748
Oh, yes, there is a hell.
In the religions.

517
01:30:14,165 --> 01:30:21,380
There was no hell until religions.
The religions invented hell.

518
01:30:21,714 --> 01:30:25,635
- Now he'll have to pull himself together.
- Do not judge,

519
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:32,224
so you will not yourself be judged.
So said the Son of Man!

520
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:38,273
And still this is what the church has been
doing for 1700 years!

521
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:42,568
- 1700 years...
- What is he saying?

522
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:46,739
...of torture,
execution, crusades,

523
01:30:46,864 --> 01:30:51,911
blood, fire, violence and abuse!

524
01:30:52,036 --> 01:30:58,668
John wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians:
"The one that does not love, remains in death."

525
01:30:58,793 --> 01:31:03,047
This is the Law!
This is the Answer!

526
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:10,429
- Now he'll pull himself together!
- No! Silence server the power!

527
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:15,559
The only way in which to defend oneself from
the silence is to tell the truth.

528
01:31:15,685 --> 01:31:21,591
The truth will set you free!
The truth, and love!

529
01:31:21,816 --> 01:31:26,112
The endless, unconditional love.

530
01:31:26,237 --> 01:31:31,325
This is the only God
that I have left.

531
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:43,254
Down!

532
01:31:43,379 --> 01:31:47,550
Down!

533
01:31:47,717 --> 01:31:53,389
Certain people don't agree with me. But I think
it is a good God. It's a God that I would want to be.

534
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:07,278
Out!

535
01:32:28,758 --> 01:32:32,011
Out. Out of the House of God!

536
01:32:38,893 --> 01:32:42,355
Praise the Lord in heaven...

537
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:46,359
Praise Him in height...

538
01:32:46,484 --> 01:32:51,280
Praise Him, all of His angels...

539
01:32:52,657 --> 01:32:57,536
Praise Him, all of His army...

540
01:32:59,455 --> 01:33:03,584
Praise Him, sun and moon...

541
01:33:03,751 --> 01:33:08,381
Praise Him, all shining stars...

542
01:33:08,506 --> 01:33:12,009
Praise Him, you heaven of heaven,

543
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:15,680
you water over the sky...

544
01:33:15,846 --> 01:33:21,727
They shall praise His name,
for He commanded their creation...

545
01:33:22,144 --> 01:33:26,023
He gave them their place in eternity.

546
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:30,695
Decided an orden that will never perish.

547
01:33:31,612 --> 01:33:37,118
Yours is the day.
Yours is the night.

548
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:41,580
God's river is full of water.

549
01:33:41,706 --> 01:33:47,704
You take care of the earth, give it rain,
make it fertile and rich.

550
01:33:48,671 --> 01:33:53,509
You make the seeds grow,
water the fields.

551
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:58,139
Where you pass forth
grows fat crops.

552
01:33:58,264 --> 01:34:02,727
The grazes of the wasteland goes fertile.

553
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:07,148
The heights dress in rejoicing.

554
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:11,193
The fields are adorned with flocks of sheep.

555
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:14,989
The valleys are covered with seeds.

556
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:28,002
Everything is rejoice and song.

557
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:36,260
Everything is rejoice and song.

558
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,925
