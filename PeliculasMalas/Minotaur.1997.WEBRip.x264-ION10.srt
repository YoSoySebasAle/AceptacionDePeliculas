1
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,116
Perfection itself.

2
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,944
Not me, the music.

3
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:06,774
Well, that is the
mystery of Mozart.

4
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:09,646
But his life was less
than perfect, right?

5
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,953
No.

6
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,041
He said his peace.

7
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:16,261
He wrote his requiem.

8
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:21,179
He died at 34, was buriedin an unmarked grave.

9
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,833
That is not only a mystery.

10
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,227
That is a crime.

11
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,141
Take it again, please.

12
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,685
Good morning, Mr. Barudi.

13
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,693
Consider it done.

14
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,173
I'll see you on Wednesday.

15
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,006
I think I found my coat.

16
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,181
MAN : Can you clean it?

17
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,748
I don't know yet.

18
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,750
MAN : How about tonight?

19
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,012
Maybe.
MAN : Good luck.

20
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:55,926
Yeah.

21
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,219
WOMAN 1: He wanted what?

22
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,524
WOMAN 2: Music sent to him.

23
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:40,787
WOMAN 1: That's upstairs.

24
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,392
SALES CLERK: Can I help
you with something?

25
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:22,959
THEA: Yeah.
Hi.

26
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,963
I'm looking for Mozart K.488 with Brendel and St.

27
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,965
Martin-in-the-Fields.

28
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,228
For some reason, it's
been on order for weeks

29
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,535
and it just doesn't come in.

30
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:38,105
I do have Jean Bernard
Pommier with Perlman.

31
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,802
It's quite good.

32
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:40,977
Yeah.

33
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:42,283
Well, I think I
would really like

34
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,241
to try to find the Brendel one.

35
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:45,416
Sorry.

36
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:46,940
We don't have it.
- All right.

37
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,810
Well, thanks anyway.

38
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,175
MAN : Lost and found.

39
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:49,350
I've lost my coot.

40
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,525
MAN : Relax.

41
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,048
Take a steam bath tonight.

42
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:52,919
OK.

43
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,257
You look good, Alex.

44
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:05,997
This steam did wonders for you.

45
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,869
So whose toes did
I step on this time?

46
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,828
No one's toes,
simply rules, Alex.

47
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,787
Things went smoothly.

48
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:13,875
That's your complaint?

49
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,050
You're too much of a maverick.

50
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,356
That's my complaint.

51
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,230
Oh, Nahmi.

52
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:27,018
Listen, Alex.

53
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,935
Some people feel that yourcover has been compromised.

54
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,241
Some people are wrong.

55
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,634
I don't know about that.

56
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:34,504
It is safe, Nahmi.

57
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:37,028
Maybe.

58
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,117
I know where  is.

59
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:39,030
I know.

60
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,821
I've been given complete
discretion on this one.

61
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,518
I choose the team.

62
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,476
I'm available.

63
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,434
Oh, you better be, Alex.

64
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,175
Because Barudi is
just the beginning.

65
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,834
He's Masudi's executor.

66
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:02,837
Once he's out, you'll beable to get to Dr. Kesler.

67
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:06,014
You know he was once shortlistedfor the Nobel Prize in Physics?

68
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:06,884
Oh, yeah?

69
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:07,798
Oh, yeah.

70
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,235
He's a very noble guy.

71
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,628
He'll sell his soul
to the highest bidder.

72
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,717
And his soul will lead
us directly to Masudi.

73
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:24,293
ALEX :
My work brought

74
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:27,209
me to the town where you live.

75
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,212
My work is a series of surmises,assumptions, and risks.

76
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:46,228
I chose this work, because Inever loved anyone, except you.

77
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,057
Although all my life,I've been trying to love.

78
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:04,899
I can offer no explanation,
other than what

79
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,771
I'm about to tell you now.

80
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:12,994
For as long as I can remember,I've been searching for you.

81
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,866
I knew that you existed,
but I didn't know where.

82
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:23,134
You'll never have anopportunity to ask me questions.

83
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,789
But my voice will reach
you through my letters.

84
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,402
And I know that you read them.

85
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:32,622
I've devoted my life totough and disagreeable work,

86
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,885
because I needed to love.

87
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,148
Therefore, I loved
the country I served,

88
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,457
her mountains, her valleys,her dust and despair.

89
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,504
I acted as I did
through lack of choice.

90
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:45,766
I didn't know if I
would ever meet you.

91
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,594
THEA'S MOM: Thea.

92
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:52,120
ALEX : And now, nowthat we've met, it's too late.

93
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,948
What a baby.

94
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,342
ALEX : There'sbeen a mistake, in dates

95
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:59,170
and places and everything.

96
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,172
I'm quite sure that it
was me who was intended

97
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:05,655
to be tormented, not you.

98
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,528
Anyways, It's far, far too late.

99
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,967
Can you hear me?

100
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:15,012
I love you.

101
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,493
I've loved you all my life.

102
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,452
Don't be angry.

103
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,454
Don't take pity.

104
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:24,500
I never knew happiness,
until I found you.

105
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:01,929
Hi.

106
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,453
Hi.

107
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,455
WOMAN 3: Sorry to be late.

108
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,590
He's really, really strange.

109
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,460
What do you mean?

110
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:12,461
Like weird strange?

111
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,333
Or like interesting strange?

112
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,377
No, no, no.

113
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,988
More like mysterious strange.

114
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,773
What do you mean?

115
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,992
Mysterious, as
in full of mystery.

116
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:23,603
I don't know.

117
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,257
Well, I don't think
it's mysterious at all.

118
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,999
Check out Jock Boy, 11 o'clock.

119
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,001
It's got to be him.

120
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:31,915
That guy?

121
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,918
I'm telling you.

122
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,181
That guy has been
gaga for you forever.

123
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,748
There's this girl.
She's in my class.

124
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:39,793
She knows him.

125
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,447
I think he's an economics major.

126
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:42,970
Huh.

127
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,366
For a numbers guy, hewrites pretty good poetry.

128
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,628
That guy writes poetry?

129
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,329
Excuse me.

130
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,814
Hi.

131
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:45,859
Hi.

132
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,121
Hi.

133
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,078
I'm G.R.

134
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,253
Hi.

135
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,646
I'm Thea.

136
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:51,560
Yeah.

137
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:52,431
I know.

138
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,131
We need to talk.

139
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,219
Well, now?

140
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,743
I act--

141
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:01,657
No.

142
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:04,965
We could actually--

143
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,576
Go out some time?

144
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,752
Actually, how about tonight?

145
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:10,710
At 9:00.

146
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,537
I'll pick you up.

147
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:15,105
OK.

148
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,019
It's OK.

149
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,107
I know where you live.

150
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,021
You do.

151
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:18,892
Right.

152
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,459
OK.

153
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,504
I'll see you at 9 o'clock.

154
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:23,374
OK.

155
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,593
Bye.

156
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:25,464
Bye.

157
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,197
It's a great place.

158
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,851
Yeah.

159
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,331
I know you like Spanishpoetry and that kind of thing.

160
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,943
So--

161
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,118
I suspect I'm not alone.

162
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,522
My father is from Cordoba.

163
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:26,568
I know.

164
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:27,961
I can't believe I'm
finally out with you.

165
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,880
I'm glad it-- itwasn't far, far too late.

166
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:47,807
What does G.R. stand for?

167
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:54,074
If I told you, I
don't think you'd

168
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,033
want to go out with me again.

169
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,948
I thought we were never
supposed to meet anyway.

170
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,565
Granville, Granville Rhodes.

171
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:10,220
My parents thought an unusualname might build character.

172
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,704
It certainly did.

173
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,837
Why economics if you havesuch a gift with words?

174
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,930
Excuse me?

175
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,887
Come on.

176
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,327
I know it's you.

177
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,460
What's me?

178
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:37,465
THEA: The letters, these
incredible letters.

179
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,340
What about them?

180
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:48,215
Excuse me.

181
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,651
I'll be right back.

182
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:58,399
Excuse me.

183
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,967
Where's the ladies'
room, please?

184
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:01,881
Thank you.

185
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:34,435
G.R.: Would you come to themasquerade ball with me?

186
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:35,305
THEA: Yeah.

187
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,219
Sure.

188
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:49,102
So you really like
these letters, huh?

189
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:49,972
Yeah.

190
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,112
Well, thank you
for an amazing night.

191
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:01,810
Thank you.

192
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:02,768
It was great.

193
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:03,638
Yeah.

194
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:10,732
All right.

195
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:11,646
All right.

196
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:14,736
Good night.

197
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:15,606
Bye.

198
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,409
ALEX :
You're my greatest

199
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:41,676
loss, a loss that was recoveredonly when it was too late.

200
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:46,550
Believe me, if you and I
are what I think we are,

201
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,075
there's no need for
us to force the issue.

202
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:55,908
Today, I give you this bookof etchings of a Picasso.

203
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:59,563
Listen to the stories
that are there for you.

204
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:02,479
Listen close and
tell me, can you

205
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,831
hear the beating things inside?

206
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:09,748
Thea, I dreamed
about you last night.

207
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,116
Hi, baby.

208
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:31,073
Hi

209
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:32,814
How you doing?

210
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:35,034
Did I get any mail today?

211
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,122
No.

212
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:37,384
Just newspaper, regular stuff.

213
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:38,951
Why?
- Oh.

214
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:39,821
Nothing.

215
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:32,439
ALEX :
I had to do it.

216
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:36,617
Not to learn something aboutyou which I didn't already know.

217
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:38,880
Perhaps it was a childishwish to look into this room

218
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,448
and find that I was right.

219
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:46,148
You belong to a world
that I've lost long ago.

220
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,455
You're not my mistake, Thea.

221
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:52,894
In my work, I must nevermisjudge people's characters,

222
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:56,028
because if I were tomake a mistake even once,

223
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:59,118
I might have to pay
for it with my life.

224
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:01,947
If I had been wrong
about you, I should

225
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:05,733
have been dead a long time ago.

226
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,604
We can't meet.

227
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:11,217
And we can't be united.

228
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:14,220
I do not fear for myself, Thea.

229
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,048
I've learned that I'malso dangerous to be near.

230
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:21,053
I am a man with two hearts,and only one will survive

231
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,751
when all is said and done.

232
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,059
As the  said,

233
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,043
THEA :
Why are you so sad?

234
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,963
Please, don't be angry if Itell you that I can't accept

235
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:03,704
your lunatic explanation
that all your life

236
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,881
you have been waiting for me.

237
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:11,016
If you really have, then
you are truly insane.

238
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,670
But you're not insane.

239
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,499
I know it's not true.

240
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,198
In which case, what are you?

241
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:25,378
I've been reading yourletters for almost a year.

242
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:29,991
At times, I wish you'dnever started writing to me.

243
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:33,255
Now, I want you never to stop.

244
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,083
ALEX :

245
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,002
Are we cutting class today?

246
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:45,528
THEA: You scared me.

247
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:46,442
Sorry.

248
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:52,492
I'm just tired.

249
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:53,406
What's up?

250
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:58,367
Nothing.

251
00:32:58,498 --> 00:32:59,238
I--

252
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:06,985
Ugh.

253
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:10,945
It's your secret mad letterwriter again, isn't it?

254
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,252
Are they still coming?

255
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:14,601
Yes.

256
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,907
Almost every day now.

257
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,258
You know, this guy
could be a weirdo.

258
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:21,825
No, he's not like that.

259
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:22,739
How do you know?

260
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:28,310
I just do.

261
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:15,635
MAN : Hello?

262
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:19,595
Mr. Barudi?

263
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:23,730
MAN : One moment, please.

264
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,387
MR. BARUDI : Hello?

265
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:16,217
Do we really go toschool with so many people?

266
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,567
I only recognize
half of these faces.

267
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,449
Dude, I don't play requests--

268
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:31,363
usually.

269
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:38,718
That fan is the perfect touch.

270
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:40,241
You would say
that, wouldn't you?

271
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:41,111
No, no.

272
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,070
I mean it.

273
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,159
ALEX: May I have this dance?

274
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,163
Do you mind?

275
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,469
No.

276
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,383
No.

277
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,123
I-- I'll get us a drink.

278
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,504
WAITRESS: Hi.

279
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:05,593
Hello.

280
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:06,725
What beer do you have?

281
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:07,900
WAITRESS: Heineken.
- Perfect.

282
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,814
Great.
WAITRESS: All right.

283
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:17,736
, please.

284
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,702
That is a truly fine
piece of machinery.

285
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,138
Thank you.

286
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,967
I used to own one.

287
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:32,838
Really?

288
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:34,535
Mhm.

289
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,276
What do you drive now?

290
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:39,409
A Lamborghini, Countach.

291
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,109
But I still keep
my GX for the city.

292
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:46,416
I would give anything todrive a Lamborghini Countach.

293
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,940
You like cars, huh?

294
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,768
I love cars.

295
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:55,425
Well, your 308 is nothing tosniff it, once you get to know.

296
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:56,644
What do you mean?

297
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,777
With a few
tricks, your 308 can

298
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:01,954
give you as much performanceas you'd ever want.

299
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,739
How long have you had it?

300
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,133
G.R.: Actually, I just got it.

301
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:11,441
It was a graduation
gift from my dad.

302
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,053
Have you opened it up yet?

303
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:16,359
I'm sure could be openedup a little bit more.

304
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,883
ALEX: You're right.

305
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:20,450
There's a way to completelyopen her up quickly.

306
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,801
And it only works
on that Ferrari.

307
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,106
Really?

308
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:24,977
Really.

309
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,904
What do you do, G.R.?

310
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:42,995
Well, like I said, I'm
just about to graduate.

311
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,910
ALEX: What's your major?

312
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,173
G.R.: Economics.

313
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:49,567
ALEX: Sounds serious.

314
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:50,568
G.R.: Well, yeah.

315
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:51,481
It is.

316
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,354
I mean, I am.

317
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:55,224
How about you, George?

318
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:58,227
What do you do?

319
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:01,753
I'm a financial planner.

320
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:06,932
So you like-- like, youplan people's futures, right?

321
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:08,411
Yes.

322
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:09,412
You may say so.

323
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:12,894
G.R.: Cool, cool.

324
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:14,983
So a car like this
must get you plenty

325
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:16,811
of attention from the ladies.

326
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:17,943
Am I right?

327
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:19,379
Well, I--

328
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:20,293
I don't know.

329
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:21,294
You know?

330
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:23,209
I'm-- I'm seeing someone.

331
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:26,342
So I hadn't really noticed.

332
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:27,909
You're a lucky guy.

333
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,823
G.R.: Well, it is.

334
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:31,304
You know, she's amazing.

335
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:33,306
I hope to marry her some day.

336
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:37,223
Young man like you,
ready to settle down?

337
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:39,007
G.R.: Yeah.
She's incredible.

338
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:45,013
I-- you know, I don't
want to blow it.

339
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:46,972
Yeah, you might want toslow down here a little bit.

340
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,933
I'd, um-- I'd bring
it down a little bit.

341
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:04,424
Just-- just bring
it down a little.

342
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:26,315
I think I got it.

343
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:27,708
I got the hang of it.

344
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,318
You can bring it down
a little bit now.

345
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:06,225
Jesus.

346
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:10,272
I'm sorry, but I have toleave you by the next phone.

347
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:11,143
I'll find my way back.

348
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,362
Don't worry.

349
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:14,842
G.R.: Are you sure?

350
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:15,713
ALEX: Yeah.

351
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:16,757
I'll be fine.

352
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:18,237
It's all in there.

353
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:19,978
You can get the same out of her.

354
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:21,022
Yeah.

355
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:24,896
I'm going to.
All right.

356
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:32,991
G.R., do me a favor,
stay on the highway.

357
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,035
Sure.

358
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:34,993
Sure.

359
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,037
Yeah.

360
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:39,693
Hey, thank you.

361
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:43,436
I hope to see you again,
have a drink sometime.

362
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:54,882
Yeehaw.

363
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:24,363
Come on.
Keep moving.

364
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:25,364
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

365
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:26,321
Let's go.
Move.

366
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:27,279
Come on.

367
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:28,280
Keep it moving, buddy.

368
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,629
Keep it moving.
Let's go.

369
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:30,630
Keep it moving.

370
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,544
Let's go.

371
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:07,972
No.

372
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,449
We shouldn't be
having this meeting.

373
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:51,754
I shouldn't have agreed.

374
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:53,408
We're losing time
and I have no time.

375
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:56,020
You have as much
time as we give you.

376
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,022
Things are right on course.

377
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:00,154
I want to meet Kesler now.

378
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:03,070
It's time to close in on Masudi.

379
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,290
Set it up.

380
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,901
We may be old friends, butI think you forget yourself.

381
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:10,034
I want to finish with it now.

382
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:12,558
That kind of talk
worries me, Alex.

383
00:49:12,688 --> 00:49:14,560
We have to wait.

384
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,866
I've waited long enough.

385
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:19,130
An now, it's time.

386
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,263
This is what we do
for a living, we wait.

387
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:24,396
It's what our damn
business is about.

388
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:26,746
You don't go after them.You let them come to you.

389
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:28,400
It's different now.

390
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,880
Understand?

391
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:32,795
Will you set it up?

392
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:33,709
Please.

393
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:40,107
All right.

394
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:43,676
But we involve nobody else.

395
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:46,157
I'll back you up myself.

396
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:46,984
Thanks.

397
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:54,600
Darling, look
what just arrived.

398
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,864
Aren't they beautiful?

399
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:58,778
Thea?

400
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm going to make
some lunch now.

401
00:50:07,526 --> 00:50:08,831
And don't forget, you
promised you'd take

402
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:12,096
a walk with me this afternoon.

403
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:14,663
The fresh air is gonnado us both a lot of good.

404
00:50:57,532 --> 00:51:03,712
ALEX : It was alla mistake, Thea, like my life.

405
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:06,585
I've no right to bother
you with words now.

406
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:08,587
And I certainly have
no rights to send

407
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:12,330
you any unnecessary reading.

408
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,681
I know that you have wordsthat you need to say.

409
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:18,336
So that's what I suggest.

410
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:20,686
Put your letters to mein an envelope marked Mr.

411
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:23,515
Franz Kafka, post
restante, and send

412
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:26,735
it to your local post office.

413
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:28,781
I'll be there to
collect your letters.

414
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:49,454
Post restante, please.

415
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:50,368
Great.

416
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:51,325
Thank you.

417
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,693
Is it you?

418
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:28,536
Is it you?

419
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,288
I know you're here.

420
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:47,251
Do you like watching
me, Mr. Kafka?

421
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:52,256
What for?

422
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,217
You're a coward.

423
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:04,746
You're dead.

424
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,792
You're nothing.

425
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,228
You're dead.
You're dead.

426
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:09,186
You're dead.

427
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:23,852
THEA :
Where are you now?

428
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:26,812
You can't remain silent forever.

429
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:29,380
You can't hide anymore.

430
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,947
I don't know if you had
a hand in G.R.'s death,

431
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:36,430
but I must leave, run awayfrom you, from your letters,

432
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:41,000
and from everything that'sso miserable between us.

433
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,351
I'm not as wonderful as
you make me out to be.

434
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:48,094
Look how you dominate me.

435
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,531
So many times I was amusingmyself with the thought

436
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:54,753
that you might be
around, very close.

437
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:56,581
Now, I'm doubting if
you really do exist.

438
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:02,195
Are you safe there
in the shadow?

439
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:08,245
It's OK.

440
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,421
Stay in hiding.

441
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:11,248
It's easier.

442
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,645
You're afraid
because of me, right?

443
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:21,345
Because you don't
want me to get hurt?

444
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:23,738
Well, I don't mind getting hurt.

445
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:26,350
I don't mind being touched.

446
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,787
Come on.

447
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,658
Come on.

448
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,312
Step out.

449
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:33,226
I'm here.

450
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:09,001
Mr. Milan.

451
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:17,966
You took care for
the money, Mr. Milan.

452
00:55:18,097 --> 00:55:19,968
We've opened aconfidential account at Swiss

453
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,014
Central Bank in your name.

454
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:23,624
I must have
absolute assurance.

455
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:30,849
There is the account number.

456
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:34,069
It could be a false account.

457
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,812
Call them now to
assure yourself.

458
00:55:37,943 --> 00:55:42,295
The bank's number is 473-6409.

459
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:43,209
Please.

460
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:46,821
Phone, please.

461
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:55,308
Thank you.

462
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:56,178
Please.

463
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:05,840
Customer service, please.

464
00:56:08,756 --> 00:56:09,757
Private accounts.

465
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:10,845
Yes.

466
00:56:10,976 --> 00:56:15,807
My account number is 96610992.

467
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:20,377
I would like to know the
status of my account.

468
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:21,508
Yes.

469
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:22,596
Yes, Rudy Kesler.

470
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:27,035
Yes.

471
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:29,864
Thank you.

472
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:36,480
I'm impressed.

473
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:41,006
And now, Dr.
Kesler, the goods.

474
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:41,920
The goods.

475
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,623
These are the last
photographs of him.

476
00:56:49,754 --> 00:56:50,537
He has changed.

477
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:55,629
Where is he now?

478
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,024
Claridge Hotel, New York.

479
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:03,332
And now, Mr. Milan,
let's drink to progress.

480
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:08,686
You continue to lead the
good life and I as well.

481
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:12,951
May we all receive what
we so richly deserve.

482
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:13,865
Cheers.

483
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:27,705
Dr. Kesler.

484
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:28,662
Mr. Milan.

485
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:50,945
Please.

486
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,058
NAHMI: We're almost there, kid.

487
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:01,146
Hold on.

488
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:02,321
Hold on, Alex.

489
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,287
Hold on, kid.

490
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:56,201
We're almost there.

491
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:21,182
Who is it?

492
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:22,619
KIM: Thea, it's Kim.

493
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:23,532
Oh my god.

494
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:29,016
Hi.

495
01:00:29,147 --> 01:00:32,498
How are you?

496
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,455
Wow.

497
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:34,456
Wow.

498
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:35,457
You look great.

499
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:36,502
Oh.

500
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,591
I-- I wasn't expecting anybody.

501
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,071
Apparently not.

502
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:42,595
Oh, come in.

503
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:45,250
You want anything to drink?

504
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,338
We're getting drunk.

505
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:02,876
That's enough.
That's enough.

506
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:14,018
So have you even left theapartment since you got here?

507
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:15,062
I go to class.

508
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:17,369
That doesn't count.

509
01:01:17,499 --> 01:01:19,458
Yes, it does.

510
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:22,417
You didn't get any moreof those letters, did you?

511
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:23,897
No.

512
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:25,856
Have you met
anybody nice here?

513
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:26,770
No.

514
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,640
I've been really busy.

515
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:28,859
KIM: No.

516
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,251
You've been keeping
yourself busy.

517
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:32,776
There's a difference.

518
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:35,169
I'm not against
going out with someone.

519
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,216
It just hasn't happened yet.

520
01:01:38,346 --> 01:01:40,087
Thea, you have to
make something happen.

521
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:41,436
You know that.

522
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:43,221
Look, this is what
you're gonna do, OK?

523
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:46,093
You're gonna out.
You're gonna find a boy.

524
01:01:46,224 --> 01:01:49,749
Then, you're gonna ask him ona date for this Friday night.

525
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,839
Well, Friday I have aguest lecture in the morning.

526
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,841
Then, I have to go to class.

527
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:58,976
Then, I have stacks
of work, because I

528
01:01:59,106 --> 01:02:01,152
have a paper due on Monday.

529
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,675
I'm fine.

530
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:03,632
I-- I'm fine.

531
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:18,169
Good morning.

532
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:28,135
It is a beautiful,clear July day in Grenada.

533
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,181
The year, 1936 .

534
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:34,489
The phalangists occupy thecity, but the mood is mild.

535
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:39,886
It is on that day that FredericoGarcia Lorca, poet, playwright,

536
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:43,672
artist is executed
and his body is

537
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:46,893
thrown into an unmarked grave.

538
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:49,548
He was 38.

539
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:52,333
There are those who look
upon the death of Lorca

540
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:55,859
as a much greater symbol ofthe conflict of that region

541
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:59,166
in general, not the
political conflict,

542
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:01,821
but the deeper chasm
towards utter brutality

543
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:02,735
that lies in man.

544
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:08,697
The  wrote,

545
01:03:12,614 --> 01:03:17,489
One body with littleblood, but with two hearts.

546
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:21,928
Is that to say that there isnot enough blood in the body

547
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:27,673
to keep two heart alive or
that two hearts can turn

548
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:32,939
thin veins into a
nurturing river?

549
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:40,251
We have to keep an eye on thoseopposing hearts, because--

550
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:41,121
Yes, come in.

551
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:45,778
Dr. Treanda?

552
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:46,692
NICOS: Sit down.

553
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,736
I'll be right with you.

554
01:03:50,739 --> 01:04:00,314
My heart is in the East, butI am at the edge of the West.

555
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:02,229
Then, how could
I taste what I eat?

556
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,405
How can I enjoy it?

557
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:07,278
You're familiar with HaLevi?

558
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:10,194
Yes.

559
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:14,067
So you are here in responseto my plea for an assistant?

560
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:19,856
Sure.

561
01:04:19,986 --> 01:04:21,640
I'd be delighted.

562
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,641
LECTURER: Wonderful.

563
01:04:38,787 --> 01:04:40,659
I have the paper for theChicago lecture on Wednesday.

564
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,182
I checked all the references.

565
01:04:42,313 --> 01:04:45,098
But I wasn't sure about the you wanted--

566
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:46,317
- For the opening.
- Yeah.

567
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:47,187
You marked a few.

568
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:48,188
So--

569
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,582
We're all done.

570
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:53,324
I don't think that I shouldkeep you waiting any longer.

571
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:54,281
No.

572
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:55,500
You shouldn't.

573
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,878
Hello?

574
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:14,405
ALEX : Thea, it's me.

575
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:17,147
I've been shot.

576
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:19,888
And the only reason I'm stillalive is because of you.

577
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:37,558
I wanted to talk to you.

578
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:38,820
I wanted to hear your voice.

579
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,176
This is as close
as we'll ever get.

580
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:51,311
Anything else is
just impossible.

581
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:54,271
I'm sorry.

582
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:55,228
I'm so sorry.

583
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:36,574
I love you.

584
01:12:20,597 --> 01:12:23,426
I want you to come
with me to New York.

585
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:26,820
I want you to meet
my mom, my friends.

586
01:12:26,951 --> 01:12:28,082
I want you to know everything.

587
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,914
You're sure that's
what you want?

588
01:12:34,045 --> 01:12:34,959
Yes.

589
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:35,829
You're sure?

590
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,657
Yeah.

591
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:42,401
Cause you shouldn't stay withme if you think I'm half a man.

592
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,751
You deserve better.

593
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:47,101
You deserve better.

594
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:50,322
I want you.

595
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:54,021
I want to get on with
my life, our life.

596
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:37,282
Thank you.

597
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:05,092
TAXI DRIVER: Thank
you very much.

598
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:06,006
Thank you.

599
01:14:13,797 --> 01:14:14,624
Scotch, please.

600
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:26,853
Hi, Mom.

601
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:27,767
Hi.

602
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:28,638
Hello.

603
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:33,686
You look wonderful.

604
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:35,514
This is Nicos.

605
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:36,428
Oh.

606
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:38,648
This is Mom.

607
01:14:38,778 --> 01:14:39,562
How do you do, Nicos?

608
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:40,563
Very nice to meet.

609
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:42,434
Oh, it's good to meet you.

610
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:45,785
Well, I'm glad you
two found each other.

611
01:14:45,916 --> 01:14:47,395
She really needs somebody.

612
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:51,051
Mom, should we show
Nicos to his room?

613
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:52,879
Oh, yes.

614
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,620
And I put some warm blankets outin the hall if you need them.

615
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:56,622
And there's some clean
towels in the bathroom.

616
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:58,711
And your mail's up on your desk.

617
01:14:58,842 --> 01:15:00,278
All right.

618
01:15:00,408 --> 01:15:01,758
Nicos, you're teachingSpanish literature, correct?

619
01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:02,672
Yes.

620
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:33,327
ALEX : Thisis my last letter to you.

621
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:38,332
I know that we should meetand the hour is not far away.

622
01:16:38,463 --> 01:16:42,859
You've never sinned
against me but once.

623
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:46,036
My terrible and
wonderful angel, it

624
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:49,735
is I alone who have broughtabout this abominable state

625
01:16:49,866 --> 01:16:54,044
of affairs in which
we find ourselves.

626
01:16:54,174 --> 01:17:00,616
I was hesitant, tried tohave it my way, a coward,

627
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:04,620
and miserable and
despicable coward,

628
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,926
someone who was privilegedto know of your existence

629
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:10,756
before he met you, should havebeen with you all the days

630
01:17:10,887 --> 01:17:15,108
of his life, with you alone.

631
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:18,068
But I rested on the way.

632
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:20,418
I stopped off.

633
01:17:20,548 --> 01:17:21,332
I left signs.

634
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:26,163
I left everything behind, Thea.

635
01:17:28,992 --> 01:17:29,732
We're so close now.

636
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:34,258
No fear.

637
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,652
No regret.

638
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:39,045
Just freefall.

639
01:17:39,176 --> 01:17:41,134
Look at it.

640
01:17:41,265 --> 01:17:42,048
Look at me.

641
01:18:11,599 --> 01:18:12,688
The letters have come to life.

642
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:22,828
I know.

643
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:27,050
Go.

644
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:35,798
Go.

645
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:36,668
Go.

646
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:43,588
I love you.
