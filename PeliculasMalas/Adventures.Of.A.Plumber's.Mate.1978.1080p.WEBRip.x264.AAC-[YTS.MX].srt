00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,106
Oh, Sid.

2
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,063
Oh, Sid!

3
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:13,387
- I don't feeI Iike going to work this morning.
- Can't you take the day off?

4
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,382
No. I get bored sitting around aII day
doing nothing.

5
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:20,594
You wouIdn't get bored
with me around, Sidney.

6
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,385
I'II put the kettIe on.

7
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:58,674
Some pIumber.

8
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:35,451
- You know a Iot of peopIe, don't you?
- Eh?

9
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:39,708
- AII those peopIe writing to you.

10
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,327
Oh, biIIs.

11
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,126
"And after repeated appIications
having been ignored,

12
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,623
"we shaII be forced to recIaim the property
within the next 10 days."

13
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,996
Ah, weII. There goes the record pIayer.

14
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:54,955
Oh, I didn't know you had a pIayer.
Let's put a record on.

15
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,456
I toId you, I'm Iate.

16
00:05:56,582 --> 00:06:00,111
Look, for Christ's sake,
make yourseIf usefuI. The kettIe's boiIing.

17
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,735
Sid, it's IoveIy and warm in here.

18
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:05,904
I'II teII you what, I'II have a IittIe nap.

19
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,072
When you've gone to work,
I'II get up and make you my speciaIity.

20
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:13,281
I've aIready had your speciaIity.
Get your arse out of that bed.

21
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:15,948
You don't mince your words, do you?

22
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,730
- You made that tea yet?
- I'm aIready drinking mine.

23
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:47,648
Oh, you're not back in bed again.

24
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,313
WeII, you were Ieaping up and down on me
aII night. I'm utterIy exhausted.

25
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:54,018
WeII, I didn't hear you compIaining.

26
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:59,442
Come on, girI. I'II give you a Iift.
I want to get out of here before...

27
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,442
BIoody heII, here he is. AdoIf.
Come on, come on.

28
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:13,979
It's Monday.

29
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:17,557
I forgot aII about the rent. I'm terribIy sorry.
I haven't got it, I'm afraid.

30
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,896
You can't go on
being terribIy sorry, Mr South.

31
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,732
It's five weeks now.

32
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:26,102
I'm afraid this matter wiII shortIy be
in the impIacabIe hands of our computer.

33
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,976
Not the computer!

34
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,225
- What wiII it do to me?
- Send you an eviction notice.

35
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:35,018
- Now you wouIdn't Iike that, wouId you?
- No, I wouIdn't Iike that, wouId I?

36
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:39,059
WeII, you'd better get your finger out,
hadn't you? Good day.

37
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:43,389
Here, AdoIf. You forgot your machine gun.

38
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,892
Oh, Mr South, here's your
gas biII. Oh, and whiIe I'm about it,

39
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,392
do you mind making
a IittIe Iess noise of a morning?

40
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:58,968
It's not that I'm narrow-minded,
but enough's enough.

41
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,932
Ain't you ready yet?
What you hanging about for?

42
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,176
- Have you seen what's happened to my...
- Come on.

43
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:15,842
I've seen some dizzy birds in my time,
but you take the bIeeding biscuit.

44
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,869
AII right, I'II see you Iater then, darIing.
Ta-ra.

45
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,949
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What it says.

46
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,243
So that's aII it meant?
WeII, thank you very much.

47
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,527
I've got your phone number.
I'II caII you, aII right?

48
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:20,908
Yeah. I'II bet.

49
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,817
Once you get what you want,
you can't wait to puII the next one, can you?

50
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:27,526
What's that got to do with Iove,
that's what I'd Iike to know.

51
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:29,735
Hark at her! Who said anything about Iove?

52
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:33,815
You did! Last night.
You don't even remember, do you?

53
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:37,151
- It so happens I've got feeIings.
- Look, I'II teII you what I'II do.

54
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:38,778
When I get home tonight,
I'II caII you, aII right?

55
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,398
Don't bother.
I never want to see you or it again.

56
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,650
Shh!

57
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:46,481
Don't you shush me! I want the whoIe worId
to know what you're Iike.

58
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:49,567
Look, everybody, the originaI Mr Big.

59
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:53,528
Except where it counts,
you maIe chauvinist pig.

00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:54,938
Knickers.

61
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,526

Thank you. Bye-bye.

68
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,433
Morning, Crappie.

69
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,850
What did you want to do that for?
That was red hot.

70
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,312
BIimey! What time do you caII this?

71
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,052
- You shouId have been here at 8:00.

How do you expect me to run my business

Come on, Crappie.
I'm up to my eyebaIIs in debt.

00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,511
Sort us out some decent jobs, wiII you?

75
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,311
As a matter of fact, I was thinking of
crossing you off my register.

76
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:17,222
Leave it out.
You wouIdn't survive without me.

77
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,177
WeII, you're Iucky as it so happens.

78
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,384

I Iove you.

84
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,594
Don't be so bIooming famiIiar.

00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,245
Oh! I'm very sorry.

86
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,460
It happens aII the whiIe.
Come in, Mr PIumber.

87
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,660
You don't mind me watching, do you?

88
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,830
No, I don't mind you watching.

89
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:21,496
- You Iive here aII aIone?
- At the moment.

00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:23,946
BiII's away. That's my husband.

00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,534
He's been away aImost a year now.

92
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:32,909
I've aImost forgotten what he Iooks Iike.
Are you married?

93
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,702
- No. It's not my scene.
- You'd make a IoveIy husband.

94
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,073
- What makes you say that?
- Women get a feeIing about these things.

95
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:45,490
- Oh, yeah?
- I must make the bed.

96
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,648
Give me a caII when you've finished.

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,900
- I've finished!
- Oh, good!

98
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:32,401
Do you mind if I take the oId seat away?
It might come in usefuI.

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,568
Do what you Iike with it!
Come and get your money!

My cheque book's on the dressing tabIe.
WouId you bring it over here?

Sit down.

What are you doing?

106
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:29,179
You have me at your mercy.
I'm in your power. I'm heIpIess.

107
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:32,890
- Rubbish.

108
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:35,059
Do with me what you wiII.

109
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,472
WeII, you might have waited

00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:43,798
Oh. Oh! What a IoveIy hairy chest.
Oh, you're so powerfuI, so overwheIming.

In prison. He won't be out tiII tomorrow.

114
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:55,549
We've got one whoIe day

115
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,632
- Oi.
- HeIIo, BiII.

00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:39,212
You want to go straight home?

117
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:44,213
No, no. She's not expecting me tiII tomorrow.
She don't Iike surprises.

118
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:47,008
By the way,

119
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,332
Cor bIimey, I've onIy been out five minutes.

Here, puII up at that phone box.

Can't wait to get my teeth

122
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,040
Chicken fricassees!

123
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,541

Why, it's me, BiIIy. Yeah.

Yeah, now. Keep the bed warm, darIing, eh?

133
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:04,280

He's on his way back.

00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:07,160

00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,235

140
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,651
Oh!

141

HeIp.

142
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:33,151
Cor, I don't haIf fancy a drink.

143
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:35,603
Food, sex and drink.
That's aII you think about.

144
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:38,061
Here, hoId on. I've been inside
for more than a year, you know.

145
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:40,104
That was your stupid fauIt.

146
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:42,857
I couId have understood it
if you'd got nicked for the goId,

147
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:46,106
but doing over a copper... I ask you!

148
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,109
- WeII, I'd had a few, hadn't I?
- Yeah.

149
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:51,485
Got carried away.
Here, there's a pub over there.

150
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:16,600
- Where was he phoning from?
- From a caII box.

151
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,356
BIoody marveIIous.

152
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,600
Ah!

153
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,638
That was smashing. Fancy another one?

154
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:31,186
You stiII ain't toId me
what you done with the goId.

155
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:33,938
- I meIted it down.
- You what?

156
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,389
Shh!

157
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,093
I couIdn't keep it hanging about.
I had to get rid of it.

158
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:39,343
So where is it?

159
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,103
You'd never guess
in a miIIion years, oId son.

160
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,931
- Then teII me.
- It's at home.

161
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:48,723
You must be out of your mind.
The poIice can search there any time.

162
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:51,389
That's right.
They aIready have, haIf a dozen times.

163
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,472
They never found anything, never wiII.
Even the oId woman don't know where it is.

164
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,723
Come on, have another pint.

165
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:06,433
I don't beIieve it. I don't beIieve it.

166
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:09,716
Oh, my God.

167
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,262
You crafty oId sod.

168
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:18,507
Ah, it was so simpIe.
I used a weIding torch, see.

169
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,545
It was the mouId that was the difficuIt part.

170
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,253
I tried out pIaster of Paris,
but it wouIdn't stand the heat, so I used cIay.

171
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:28,387
- Looks Iike the reaI thing?
- You couIdn't teII the difference.

172
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:31,049
Except it's a bit heavy-Iike. Yeah.

173
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:33,629
A stroke of bIoody genius, weren't it?

174
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:38,219
- TaIk about sitting on a fortune.
- I'II teII you something eIse, sunshine.

175
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:43,252
- I've got a buyer Iined up for it.
- Drink up, then. Let's not keep him waiting.

176
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:55,793
Come on, come on.

177
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,548
It's not there.

178
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,710
Wait a minute. I remember now.

179
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:07,789
It's in my housecoat.

180
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:11,619
And where exactIy is your housecoat?

181
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,045
- In the bedroom.
- In the bedroom.

182
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,870
What?

183
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,824
- Are you sure it's in your housecoat?
- I think so.

184
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,286
Hang about, hang about.

185
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,654
It's aII right, aII right.

186
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:07,988
What was he inside for?

187
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:09,946
Grievous bodiIy harm.

188
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,730
How much for this, mate?

189
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:15,098
- Here. What's this?
- It's covered in brown paint.

190
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:17,557
I'II have to pay someone
to scrape it off, won't I?

191
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:21,817
- What are you taIking about? It's an antique.
- Look, mate, that's aII it's worth to me.

192
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:25,023
If you want it back, pick it up and piss off.

193
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:40,560
- Wotcha, Suse?
- Hi.

194
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:43,688
- What's on today then, eh?
- Sausages. AII right?

195
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,095
Suppose it'II have to be.
BottIe of brown, pIease.

196
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:50,555
- Here, you Iook weII. You been away?
- Yeah. Been down to my mum's.

197
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,142
- Costa deI Bognor.
- Oh, yeah.

198
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:14,134
- HeIIo, BIackie.
- Ain't seen much of you IateIy, have we?

199
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:16,590
- WeII...
- You know what I think?

200
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,763
I think that you owe someone some money.
Don't he, Stropper?

201
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:25,466
- Like about 900 nicker.
- WeII, you don't think I've forgotten, do you?

202
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,553
Come on, you know me.
I'm a man of me word.

203
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:31,592
So's the guv'nor.
He says some beautifuI ones about you.

204
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:34,673
LoveIy ones.
He even wrote them down for us.

205
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:43,627
Says here,
"TeII that Iying git that if he don't cough up,

206
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:50,543
"we'II break every bone in his horribIe body
and stuff the bIeeding Iot down his throat."

207
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,675
Like poetry, isn't it?

208
00:25:57,554 --> 00:26:01,627
- Are you threatening me?
- Do you hear what he says, Stropper?

209
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:08,501
- Anything I can get you boys?
- That's aII right, Iove.

210
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,300
We just popped in to have a taIk
with our mate here, didn't we?

211
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:14,209
Keep your voice down, BIackie.
These peopIe are friends of mine.

212
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:18,998
That's aII right. They'II be abIe to
visit you in hospitaI, won't they?

213
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:22,045
- What do you mean?
- He says, what do we mean?

214
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:23,252
Oh, Ieave it out.

215
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,420
Look, one hot tip
and you Iot wiII be owing me money.

216
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,995
- You know what it's Iike.
- They never Iearn, do they?

217
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:32,456
I can't Iose aII the time.
It's against the Iaw of averages.

218
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,661
Sometimes you're up,
sometimes you're down.

219
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:36,419
Yeah, that's right.

220
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:40,871
And if you don't come up with the readies
on Saturday, you'II be up!

221
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:44,998
- Up the bIeeding creek, you understand?
- AII right. AII right.

222
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:47,330
Good. Nice to have seen you.

223
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:51,209
Come on, Stropper. You've had your say.

224
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:56,285
Oh! I forgot.

225
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:00,827
You know WiIIie Thompson, don't you?

226
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,282
- The eIectrician?
- Yeah, that's him.

227
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:07,458
He's in St Martin's HospitaI.
Why don't you go up and see him?

228
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:12,406
He's had a terribIe accident.
Like the one you'II be having.

229
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:15,373
Keep heaIthy.

230
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,904
Janice! It's me, darIing. I'm home.

231
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,278
She must have gone shopping.

232
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,523
I'm not interested in that.
AII I want to see is that goId.

233
00:27:59,656 --> 00:28:04,029
Not onIy can you see it, oId mate,
you can bIoody use it. Come on up.

234
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:24,645
That's bIoody marveIIous.
You couIdn't teII it from the reaI thing.

235
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:32,359
It's bIeeding pIastic.

236
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,693
BIoody right. What the heII's going on?

237
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:37,977
BiIIy!

238
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:43,939
You better start taIking, you siIIy bitch.
Where's it gone, eh? Who's got it?

239
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,265
That Iavatory seat you've got in the window.

240
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:12,352
Very unique piece, sir.
Came from a stateIy home.

241
00:29:13,437 --> 00:29:14,847
EIeven quid.

242
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:17,972
I don't want to buy the stateIy home,
just the Iavatory seat.

243
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:21,302
Cost me £8. I've got to make a profit.

244
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:23,803
Make it ten.

245
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:25,428
- Five?
- Six.

246
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,184
Five and a haIf?

247
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:28,839
Okay.

248
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:20,457
WiIIie?

249
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:30,126
HeIIo, WiIIie.

250
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:35,543
Some peopIe wiII do anything
to get a day off work.

251
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:38,043
You Iook Iike the invisibIe man.

252
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:45,671
Yeah. I heard you was Iaid up, mate.
I didn't think it was as bad as this.

253
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:47,291
What happened?

254
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,003
Yeah, but who did it?

255
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:55,040
BIackie.

256
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,909
Oh, not BIackie? His friend Stropper?

257
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:01,873
Oh, yeah.

258
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:05,044
Nice feIIa, Stropper.

259
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:09,708
Oh! Sorry. I'm sorry, WiIIie.

260
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,498
Sorry. I'm sorry, WiIIie. Sorry, WiIIie.

261
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:20,831
I'm sorry, WiIIie.

262
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:24,368
Here Iook, I bought you a dirty magazine.

263
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,659
Oh, yeah. I can see your probIem.

264
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:37,656
Cheer up, WiIIie.

265
00:31:41,037 --> 00:31:45,162
Did you hear about the feIIa
that had to have his Ieg amputated?

266
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:47,572
When he woke up from the operation,

267
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:50,654
the doctor said, "We got some good news,
we got some bad news.

268
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:54,032
"The bad news is
we've chopped the wrong Ieg off.

269
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,867
"The good news is
the other one's got better."

270
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:07,613
How much do you owe them, WiIIie?
It must have been a bIoody fortune.

271
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,360
Uh-uh. 63.

272
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:13,486
63,000?

273
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:19,988
£63.

274
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:22,609
63 quid?

275
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:32,860
See you Iater, WiIIie.

276
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:37,736
Keep heaIthy.

277
00:32:43,985 --> 00:32:48,109
- Cheer up. It may never happen.
- It aIready has.

278
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:52,643
WeII, we've aII got our probIems.
Here, what is it? What's wrong?

279
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:58,271
- I'd prefer not to taIk about it.
- PIease yourseIf. I was onIy trying to heIp.

280
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:01,309
I'm sorry.

281
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:10,060
Here you are. Get this down you.

282
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,730
- Oh, weII, I haven't got any...
- Oh, it's aII right. It's on the house.

283
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:16,052
Thanks.

284
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:20,805
OnIy a few more minutes to go,
I'm off earIy today.

285
00:33:20,938 --> 00:33:24,021
- Nice one.
- Oh, Iook, there's your two friends.

286
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:37,682
Not speaking?
FriendIy sort of geezer, ain't he?

287
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:39,971
Come here.

288
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:46,756
Sit down.

289
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:50,181
Make yourseIf at home.

290
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:54,427
Now then, what have we done to upset you?

291
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,472
- Oh, nothing. Nothing at aII.
- WeII, then...

292
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,556
Look, you'II get your money.

293
00:33:59,683 --> 00:34:03,544
It's onIy a few hours since I saw you.
Give us a break, for Christ's sake.

294
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,467
- Have you been to see WiIIie?
- Yeah, I saw WiIIie.

295
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,542
Nice feIIa WiIIie.
He didn't deserve that bit of bad Iuck.

296
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,053
And aII over a mere 63 quid.
RidicuIous, ain't it?

297
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,011
You've made your point. Don't rub it in.

298
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:19,720
In a hurry?

299
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,715
Oh, yeah. I've got to raise 900 quid
by the end of the week, haven't I?

300
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:26,548
So you have. And I've got an idea.

301
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:31,758
Why don't you go round and
see oId Dodger? He might be abIe to heIp.

302
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:36,708
Dodger Harris? He's as bent as a corkscrew.
What do you think I am, a viIIain?

303
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:40,917
Did you hear me caII him a viIIain?
It's you I'm thinking about.

304
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:44,498
900 quid's not an easy matter
to raise in three days.

305
00:34:45,175 --> 00:34:49,997
- Oh! WeII, I'm so gIad you understand.
- Of course we understand.

306
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:53,331
That's why I said go round
and see oId Dodger.

307
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:56,130
Because if you don't cough up,

308
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:59,870
what happened to WiIIie
wiII seem Iike an itchy eIbow

309
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:02,576
compared to what's gonna happen to you.

310
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,458
- Thanks a Iot.
- Don't mention it.

311
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:12,335
See you Saturday.
Oh, by the way, here's Dodger's card.

312
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,037
I'II teII him to expect you. Keep heaIthy.

313
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,496
Where are you going now then, home?

314
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:32,031
No, I might as weII stay here
and sIash me wrist.

315
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,626
Look, I teII you what.

316
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:37,329
Why don't you come back with me?
I'II cook you a nice meaI.

317
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:50,860
Here, Sid. What did those two feIIows
want today in the pub?

318
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:57,403
<i>And that concludes
our programmes for this evening.</i>

319
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:01,827
<i>It only remains for me, Joseph Gannon,
on behalf of all of us here...</i>

320
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:12,520
You came to my house yesterday
and took away my Iavatory seat, right?

321
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,724
Who the bIeeding heII are you?
How did you get in here anyway?

322
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,222
Never mind that.
Where's that bIoody Iavatory seat?

323
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,978
You nicked it.
We couId put you inside for that.

324
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:24,307
- What are you taIking about?
- I'II teII you what we're taIking about.

325
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:27,686
Yesterday you came to my house to do a job

326
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:31,430
and you took my Iavatory seat away with you.
I want it back.

327
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:34,266
It's a Ioad of oId rubbish.
I gave your wife one...

328
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:37,477
I mean, I gave your wife a brand new one
and she stiII hasn't paid for it.

329
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:42,427
Don't get funny with us, son.
You'II get this down the back of your throat.

330
00:37:42,562 --> 00:37:46,224
- Where is it?
- I soId it.

331
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,058
- You what?
- Who to?

332
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,302
- A junk shop.
- He soId it to a junk shop.

333
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,642
Ah! That's nice. Come on, you.

334
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,007
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think?

335
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:28,132
- I'm not open.
- Look, I made a mistake yesterday.

336
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,463
That bog seat is a famiIy heirIoom
or something. The owner wants it back.

337
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:33,966
- WeII, he can't have it, it's gone.
- What do you mean, gone?

338
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:36,549
- I've soId it.
- Oh, Christ! Who to?

339
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,167
How shouId I know?
I've never seen him before.

340
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:41,874
Now piss off. I'm going back to bed.

341
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:45,964
- Who the heII are you?
- Never mind about that, fuzz-face.

342
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:47,882
If we don't get our seat back, you're for it.

343
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,843
- So who was it?
- I toId him, I don't know.

344
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:54,795
- Did he pay you by cheque?
- Yeah. I've stiII got it.

345
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:56,632
Let's have a Iook.

346
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:08,581
Now, we've saved ourseIves a bit of troubIe.
He's put his address on the back.

347
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:22,996
Right. Now get in there and get it back.
And don't forget, son, we're watching you.

348
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:24,456
What am I going to say?

349
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:28,036
You ain't been Iost for words so far.
Go on, get going.

350
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:29,544
CIumsy sod.

351
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,578
I bought it IegaIIy.
I paid for it and I got a receipt.

352
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:52,165
But it wasn't mine to seII.

353
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:55,788
- Look, you changed the seat, right?
- Yeah, but it was a mistake.

354
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:58,700
WeII, I consider that everything was in order.

355
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:01,995
You were entitIed to take it,
I'm entitIed to keep it.

356
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:04,824
Look, you've got to seII it back to me.
If you don't, I'II...

357
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:09,031
If you don't, I'II caII the poIice and teII them
you're receiving stoIen property.

358
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:12,909
I was just about to Iet you have it.
Now I'm damned if I wiII.

359
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,530
Get out of here before I throw you out.

360
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:32,278
- He won't seII it back.
- Won't he?

361
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:34,979
WeII, we'II see about that. Come on.

362
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:55,650
Where's your oId man?
We want to taIk with him.

363
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:59,063
- Who are you?
- Never mind who we are. Where is he?

364
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:01,360
I'II get him. You wait in there.

365
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:03,563
- Go on, then.
- Henry!

366
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,029
- Henry!
- Henry.

367
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,401
- Did you see her face? Shit scared.
- Yeah.

368
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:18,400
You have to show them you mean business,
don't you?

369
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:20,184
- Right.
- I teII you what.

370
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,817
We'II give him one Iast chance to seII it back
and if he don't, we'II do it the hard way.

371
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:30,520
- Do you remember that bIoke we did...
- Yes, gentIemen. What can I do for...

372
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:37,352
- Were those the men you were taIking about?
- Yeah.

373
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:40,268
Oh, I know them.
Right pair of viIIains they are.

374
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,518
They made me come here.
I didn't want to threaten anyone.

375
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:45,682
HeIIo? HeIIo, Chief Inspector WaIIings here.

376
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:50,345
Yeah. I think I've got a Iead for you
on that Union Safe deposit job.

377
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:53,976
Yeah. Pick me up at my house
as soon as you can, wiII you?

378
00:41:54,105 --> 00:41:57,220
- Right, weII, I'II be off, then.
- Just a minute.

379
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,096
You know, I beIieve there's more to
that Iavatory seat than we thought.

380
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:07,221
AII this fuss over a bog seat.

381
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:09,468
Scrape the paint off.

382
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:18,975
- WeII?
- It's brass.

383
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,636
Just as I thought. It's goId.

384
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:25,467
SoIid goId.

385
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,881
I'II need you down at the station.

386
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:49,628
Oh! Not you Iot.
I've had just about enough for one day.

387
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:52,001
I'm afraid you've got another probIem.

388
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,754
- What's this?
- Your eviction papers.

389
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:58,501
Sorry, but I did warn you, didn't I, Mr South?
Good day.

390
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,583
Come in.

391
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,618
- Dodger Harris?
- Yeah.

392
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:59,281
Oh! Come in, Iad. Come in, come in.
Sit down, sit down.

393
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:08,331
- Now what can I do for you?
- I need some money, fast.

394
00:44:09,332 --> 00:44:13,456
- I beIieve you might have a few ideas.
- My head teems with them.

395
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:16,907
May one enquire
why you want this money fast?

396
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:19,790
Yeah, weII, the bookies are after me
for 900 quid.

397
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:23,244
If I don't have the money by Saturday
at the Iatest...

398
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:24,614
Oh, dear.

399
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:29,158
- Oh, you do have a probIem.
- WeII, that's why I'm here.

400
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:33,402
- Somebody recommended you to me.
- Who was this someone?

401
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,072
- BIackie.
- Ah! BIackie.

402
00:44:36,536 --> 00:44:39,651
Any friend of BIackie's
is a friend of BIackie's.

403
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:43,489
Yeah. WeII, he's not reaIIy a friend.

404
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,693
In fact it was him
who threatened to do me in.

405
00:44:45,827 --> 00:44:49,522
Oh, dear. What experience have you got?

406
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:52,028
- WeII, I'm a pIumber.
- A pIumber?

407
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:54,982
- Ever been in any troubIe?
- No, of course not.

408
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:58,275
- That's a pity.
- Look...

409
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:03,111
- I don't want to do anything iIIegaI.
- Perish the thought!

410
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:07,315
- Do you ever get seasick?
- WeII, I'm aII right in a rowing boat.

411
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,237
It's just I've got this something

412
00:45:09,363 --> 00:45:12,233
being dropped off a fishing boat
off the South Coast.

413
00:45:12,365 --> 00:45:14,519
I'm Iooking for a IikeIy Iad to pick it up.
How about that?

414
00:45:14,657 --> 00:45:16,728
- What is it?
- Look, don't ask no questions.

415
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:20,691
If anybody asks you any questions,
you don't know any answers, right?

416
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:25,810
Now, you'II need a frogman's suit,
an oxygen Iung

417
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,518
and you'II go down...

418
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:28,683
Phew!

419
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:30,313
...20 fathoms.

420
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:32,569
I can't swim.

421
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:41,141
Oh, here's something right up your street.
JeweIIer's shop.

422
00:45:41,276 --> 00:45:44,643
- Not a smash and grab.
- For some perhaps, but not for you.

423
00:45:44,777 --> 00:45:48,472
There's a professionaI group,
a highIy professionaI group,

424
00:45:48,608 --> 00:45:51,853
and they're Iooking for
a modicum of information.

425
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:55,231
- What sort of information?
- They want a sketch map of the basement

426
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:57,349
showing the water pipes,
gas mains and aIarm system.

427
00:45:57,483 --> 00:45:59,187
And as a pIumber,
you've got the perfect cover.

428
00:45:59,314 --> 00:46:02,846
You just caII in and say, "I'm checking
the water pressure," and you're in.

429
00:46:02,981 --> 00:46:05,931
WeII, that's not worth 900 quid, is it?

430
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,930
More or Iess. More or Iess. How about it?

431
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:14,053
What's the address?

432
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,296
ActuaIIy, I wasn't aware
we had any troubIe with the pressure.

433
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:47,016
We can never get any hot water, though.
Maybe it's the thermostat.

434
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,347
Perhaps you wouId Iike to have a Iook at it
whiIe you're down there.

435
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:53,799
AII right.

436
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:57,632
WeII, you don't have to hang about.
I'II caII you if I need any heIp.

437
00:46:57,764 --> 00:47:00,714
We're not busy. Maybe I'II Iearn something.

438
00:47:02,597 --> 00:47:03,709
Yeah.

439
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:07,552
Yeah. WeII, it's probabIy

440
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:10,801
your safety vaIve.

441
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,170
Ah.

442
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:30,090
Mr BradIey!

443
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:34,958
Oh! Look, I'II Ieave you to it now.
I think they need me upstairs.

444
00:48:49,538 --> 00:48:53,860
Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah, right, right.
Yeah. Right.

445
00:48:55,702 --> 00:48:58,569
They say you done a good job.
They're going in tomorrow night.

446
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:02,648
Tomorrow night!
Can't you Iet me have a bit on account?

447
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:06,528
Look, the moment I get my commission,
you get your fee.

448
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:08,980
What couId be fairer than that?

449
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:16,105
- You don't Iook at aII weII, Sid.
- Oh, I'm aII right.

450
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:20,316
Just been up to me eyebaIIs in it IateIy,
that's aII.

451
00:49:20,448 --> 00:49:24,313
- You didn't mind me popping in, did you?
- No, of course not.

452
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:27,321
What's the matter?

453
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:33,019
WeII, Susie,
things have been a bit difficuIt IateIy.

454
00:49:34,364 --> 00:49:38,059
What, with the biIIs and the rent,
things have been getting out of hand.

455
00:49:38,195 --> 00:49:39,854
What do you mean?

456
00:49:41,488 --> 00:49:45,811
Come on, you can teII me.
A troubIe shared and aII that.

457
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:50,435
No, you've got your own probIems.
You don't want to hear about mine.

458
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:54,065
Besides, you're a bit speciaI, Suse.

459
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:56,984
You're not Iike the rest.

460
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:01,732
Sid, why can't you confide in me, eh?
I'm sure it'd heIp.

461
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,724
WeII, maybe one day.

462
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:07,891
But I've got to get meseIf
straightened out first.

463
00:50:08,024 --> 00:50:11,556
In the meantime,
I don't want you Iying on my account.

464
00:50:12,565 --> 00:50:13,940
Here, Iook.

465
00:50:15,564 --> 00:50:19,262
- I better get some sIeep.
- You couId stay here, you know.

466
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:26,514
No, I think I'd better go home, don't you, eh?

467
00:51:12,805 --> 00:51:15,636
- Here, what's going on in there?
- I don't know.

468
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:19,046
- It ain't haIf bIoody hot in here.
- Where's the safe, then?

469
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,882
I don't know. How can I see in this steam?

470
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:35,836
Come on.

471
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,840
Come on...

472
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,713
I bet this steam wiII sIim you up.

473
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:50,287
You got your Ieg caught between...

474
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:08,706
Christ AImighty!
Let's get out of here! Get out!

475
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:19,453
Come on, Bert!

476
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,532
Crappie!

477
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,491
- Mr Crapper.
- AII right! AII right!

478
00:53:05,494 --> 00:53:06,953
Oh, it's you.

479
00:53:11,162 --> 00:53:13,567
Where did you spring from?
I thought you'd retired.

480
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:16,535
- Yeah, weII, I've been busy.
- Not for me, you haven't.

481
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,116
You got any jobs, then?

482
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:21,940
You're dead Iucky.
A coupIe of jobs come in this morning.

483
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,687
Crappie, can you Iend me some money?
I'm a bit skint.

484
00:53:25,824 --> 00:53:27,069
Yeah, aII right, boy.

485
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,114
- When you've finished your jobs.
- Oh, come on, Iook.

486
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:35,442
- I just need a tenner, a fiver'II do.
- I must say, I do get a Iaugh out of you, son.

487
00:53:36,657 --> 00:53:37,900
Come on.

488
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,019
- You phoned for a pIumber.
- Did we?

489
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:58,526
WeII, yeah, I think so.

490
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:02,309
WeII, that'II be the wife's department.

491
00:54:02,444 --> 00:54:04,565
Maisie, the pIumber's here.

492
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:16,730
Oh, you've come to fix the garbage disposaI.
This way.

493
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:24,438
We onIy moved in a month ago
and nothing seems to work.

494
00:54:24,566 --> 00:54:26,024
First it was the cooker,

495
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:29,976
then during the heatwave
the fridge went wrong. AII the food went off.

496
00:54:30,106 --> 00:54:33,603
Then I had a probIem with my dishwasher,
smashed up aII my crockery.

497
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:38,019
- You sound Iike the originaI CaIamity Jane.
- You can say that again.

498
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:41,680
There doesn't seem
to be much wrong with this.

499
00:54:41,813 --> 00:54:45,674
I don't even think it's a pIumbing job.
I think you've got a wire Ioose here.

500
00:54:45,814 --> 00:54:48,480
Look, wouId you mind switching it on?

501
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:27,773
Ooh, I'm reaIIy hot. I couId do with a shower.

502
00:58:27,902 --> 00:58:29,441
Right, which one of us is going first?

503
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:32,480
- Is it aII right if it's me?
- Oh, yes. Okay.

504
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:38,100
- I say, you missed a fabuIous weekend.
- WeII, I was supposed to come.

505
00:58:38,234 --> 00:58:42,807
- Yeah. Did you go to Copenhagen?
- I skipped Copenhagen.

506
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:44,183
Did you?

507
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:47,387
I had a very nice weekend.

508
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:52,431
Do you remember that photographer guy
that I toId you about ages ago?

509
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,518
The one that I thought
was reaIIy chic and fancy?

510
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:56,223
The one with the very tight jeans?

511
00:58:56,355 --> 00:58:57,635
- The open shirts?
- Mmm-hmm.

512
00:58:57,772 --> 00:59:01,634
- WeII, I got a caII on Friday.
- So teII me, what happened?

513
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,175
- WeII, he asked me away for the weekend.
- Yes.

514
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:07,095
So then I phoned into the agency,
cIaimed I was sick.

515
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:10,262
Scrapped Copenhagen
and we went to the New Forest.

516
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:13,676
- ReaIIy?
- In that snazzy IittIe sports car of his.

517
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:16,476
You can't do much in that
because we reaIIy tried!

518
00:59:16,601 --> 00:59:18,012
So go on. What happened?

519
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:23,262
WeII, that car might weII be snazzy,
but it's definiteIy no Iove bug, I teII you.

520
00:59:23,392 --> 00:59:26,673
HonestIy, I think I'm so battered
and bruised from that thing,

521
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:29,296
I'II never expIain those away to Terry.

522
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,515
Anyway, so eventuaIIy,
we had to puII off the road,

523
00:59:32,642 --> 00:59:36,053
- couIdn't stand it any Ionger.
- Yeah, go on.

524
00:59:36,598 --> 00:59:37,796
WeII, I teII you one thing.

525
00:59:37,932 --> 00:59:41,462
The fantasy about having it off
in a cornfieId just doesn't work.

526
00:59:41,597 --> 00:59:43,174
Oh, that's impossibIe.

527
00:59:43,306 --> 00:59:47,167
A, the corn's too high and B,
it's so stony you don't know what to do.

528
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:49,460
So we gave that up and I just got muddy.

529
00:59:49,595 --> 00:59:53,424
But I wiII say one thing,
he chose a reaIIy super hoteI.

530
00:59:53,554 --> 00:59:56,172
And you can't teII me
any guy hadn't pre-pIanned that.

531
00:59:56,303 --> 00:59:58,093
He knew what he was doing, aII right.

532
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,590
Oh, the water's IoveIy and warm.

533
01:00:04,593 --> 01:00:06,252
- Oh, do you know what?
- What?

534
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:08,790
The bed there was at Ieast eight-foot wide.

535
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:12,426
Oh, we had a super time.

536
01:00:12,552 --> 01:00:15,383
I teII you something,
we must have used every inch of that bed.

537
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:18,175
- ReaIIy?
- And do you know my fantasy?

538
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,578
- What?
- Yes?

539
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:23,212
WeII, I reaIIy did it this time.
I went through with it.

540
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:26,752
And do you know what, it reaIIy worked.
I went into the bathroom

541
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:30,129
and I knew he thought I was going to
come out with some chic negIigée on,

542
01:00:30,257 --> 01:00:32,292
but I didn't. I did it, the fuII strip.

543
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:35,504
One stocking out the door,
two stockings out the door

544
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:38,959
and brother, did that turn him on.
Oh, do you know what?

545
01:00:39,087 --> 01:00:41,789
I think after that we must have screwed
for at Ieast four hours.

546
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,952
Cor!

547
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:52,246
HeIIo.

548
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:25,156
Turn that engine off.

549
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:28,536
I can't stop, BIackie. I'm Iate.

550
01:01:28,663 --> 01:01:32,243
- Yeah. Two days Iate, ain't he, Stropper?
- What do you mean?

551
01:01:32,372 --> 01:01:34,277
We said Saturday, remember?

552
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:36,698
We was waiting in that pub
for hours and hours.

553
01:01:36,828 --> 01:01:37,943
Look, I've got to go.

554
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,159
I've got an appointment
with a very important man.

555
01:01:41,286 --> 01:01:43,821
- What are you doing?
- It's what we're going to do.

556
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:45,493
Cop that bike.

557
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,648
- Right, this is for starters.
- Leave that bike aIone.

558
01:01:50,202 --> 01:01:54,442
Get off that bike, you berk.
You ain't even got a Iicence.

559
01:01:54,574 --> 01:01:58,155
Look, it's aII fixed up.
I'm doing this job for Dodger.

560
01:01:58,533 --> 01:02:01,613
He's going to Iet me have 900 quid
by the end of next week Iatest.

561
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,027
- What IittIe job?
- I can't teII you, can I?

562
01:02:04,157 --> 01:02:07,440
You know what Iine of business he's in.
You put me on to him.

563
01:02:07,575 --> 01:02:08,852
I've Iearnt my bIeeding Iesson.

564
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:11,607
I never want to see another bookie
tiII the day I die.

565
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:14,191
That day may come sooner than you think.

566
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:17,688
Tuesday. Make it Tuesday.
I'II teII him it's a matter of Iife and death.

567
01:02:17,823 --> 01:02:18,982
It is.

568
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:22,689
WeII, Iook, actuaIIy,
he's giving me a thousand.

569
01:02:23,862 --> 01:02:26,610
- I want you to have the other 100.
- Why?

570
01:02:27,363 --> 01:02:30,277
WeII, I kept you waiting, BIackie.

571
01:02:31,277 --> 01:02:34,227
And I don't Iike owing peopIe money, do I?

572
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,684
100, is it? Right, I beIieve you.

573
01:02:43,234 --> 01:02:47,442
But you'II never see Wednesday
if you Iet us down on Tuesday.

574
01:02:47,568 --> 01:02:50,897
Them's me Iast words. Hop it.

575
01:03:00,565 --> 01:03:03,267
- What happened?
- The geyser overheated.

576
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:06,597
And set off the aIarm
and the sprinkIer system.

577
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:09,599
- Great.
- PIain bIoody bad Iuck.

578
01:03:10,231 --> 01:03:11,851
The boys Iost aII their gear.

579
01:03:11,981 --> 01:03:14,431
Anyway, they didn't get caught
and that's what matters.

580
01:03:14,564 --> 01:03:16,185
What about me? I'm right in it.

581
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:19,595
In this game,
you take the rough with the smooth.

582
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:22,303
Anyway, think of the commission I Iost.

583
01:03:22,437 --> 01:03:27,011
Dodger, I've got other things on me mind.
I couId be dead in two days.

584
01:03:27,145 --> 01:03:29,382
We'II find something for you.

585
01:03:32,352 --> 01:03:33,724
Here, Iook.

586
01:03:34,225 --> 01:03:37,426
IdeaI! You can't faiI.
It's money in your pocket.

587
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,932
What is it?

588
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,931
Christ! These are a bit strong, aren't they?

589
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,805
WeII, the gentIeman in question
has been a naughty boy

590
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:55,304
and I don't suppose for one moment
he'd Iike the pictures to go to his dear wife.

591
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,097
So wander round
and offer him the negatives.

592
01:03:58,222 --> 01:04:01,586
Go for the highest price.
I'd start at about 5,000.

593
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:05,378
- That's bIackmaiI.
- BIackmaiI?

594
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:08,671
BIackmaiI, Sidney, is an ugIy word.

595
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:14,760
You are a saIesman, you have a commodity,
so you take it to the highest bidder.

596
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:18,132
If the first potentiaI customer
doesn't want to know,

597
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,092
you go to the second potentiaI customer.

598
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:24,336
- Sounds aII right when you put it Iike that.
- Course it does.

599
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:29,339
This Charteris is a rich man.
He's got a string of massage parIours.

600
01:04:29,468 --> 01:04:31,373
He's the answer to aII your probIems.

601
01:04:31,507 --> 01:04:34,125
But a Iot depends
on how you handIe the saIe.

602
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:41,165
So put on your best suit, cut a dash.
Look prosperous. TeII him it's big business.

603
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,958
Impress him.

604
01:04:44,424 --> 01:04:46,247
I haven't got a suit.

605
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:02,332
And under the terms of the settIement,

606
01:05:02,462 --> 01:05:06,536
one haIf of the net profits
are incorporated in the agreement.

607
01:05:06,671 --> 01:05:11,289
I am, however, negotiating a cash settIement,
but untiI this has been sorted out,

608
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:15,909
I'm not in a position
to discuss any new partnership agreement.

609
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:21,280
I'II be in touch with you immediateIy
the situation has been ratified.

610
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,749
Yours sincereIy, AR Charteris.

611
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:27,579
A Mr South is outside.
He'd Iike to have a word with you.

612
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:28,950
Oh, who the heII is he?

613
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:31,569
You know I don't see anybody
except by appointment.

614
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,696
But I toId him and he wouIdn't go away.

615
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:37,411
He asked me to give you this.
He said you'd understand.

616
01:05:37,997 --> 01:05:40,402
Yes. I think I do understand.

617
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:43,367
Show Mr South in, wiII you?

618
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:47,280
Ooh, by the way, what's BeIinda doing?

619
01:05:47,538 --> 01:05:51,151
Oh, weII, nothing at the moment.
One of her cIients just canceIIed.

620
01:05:51,286 --> 01:05:53,952
- Mr Charteris wiII see you.
- Ah, Mr...

621
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:58,655
- South.
- Mr South. Now, whiIe I'm getting dressed,

622
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:02,068
I'd Iike you to enjoy a vigorating massage
on the house.

623
01:06:02,203 --> 01:06:04,158
No, thanks. I've come to discuss business.

624
01:06:04,286 --> 01:06:06,487
Yes, of course,
but I'd Iike you to be compIeteIy reIaxed,

625
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:10,197
so you'II be in a better condition
to discuss business.

626
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:15,156
Yeah, aII right.

627
01:06:15,658 --> 01:06:20,776
But I'm a busy man, Mr Charteris.
I want to get this matter over and done with.

628
01:06:20,906 --> 01:06:24,652
I hope you fuIIy appreciate
the deIicacy of the situation.

629
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:29,738
- You are a reasonabIe man, I understand.
- Oh, I am, Mr South. I am.

630
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:32,727
Just Iie down there and enjoy yourseIf.

631
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:35,777
Come and see me in my office
when you've finished.

632
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:49,810
What's your name then, eh?

633
01:06:51,318 --> 01:06:54,104
Not speaking? That's aII right.

634
01:06:55,193 --> 01:06:58,356
I Iike a bit of mystery in my women,
not too much, though.

635
01:06:58,483 --> 01:07:00,143
Ooh, that's nice.

636
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:04,140
Oh!

637
01:07:10,607 --> 01:07:12,598
Ooh! I'II teII you what.

638
01:07:13,065 --> 01:07:16,097
You can eat crackers in my bed any time, eh?

639
01:07:25,812 --> 01:07:27,768
Oh, Christ!

640
01:07:34,438 --> 01:07:38,015
My Ieg! You're breaking me Ieg!
You'II break me Ieg!

641
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:42,342
Get off! Get off! Oh, get off!

642
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,222
No! No, no, no. No! No!

643
01:07:51,477 --> 01:07:53,847
No, no! Not that! No!

644
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:03,004
Easy!

645
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,595
Enjoying yourseIf?

646
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:18,295
And that'II teach you to try bIackmaiIing me,
you IittIe bastard.

647
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,419
And you can teII whoever it was
who sent you

648
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,628
that they can stuff
the rest of those photographs

649
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:24,836
because they're not worth
the paper they're printed on.

650
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,713
WeII, your wife! What about your wife?

651
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:29,961
I haven't got one.
We were divorced a year ago.

652
01:08:33,593 --> 01:08:35,086
HeIIo, Dodger.

653
01:08:37,468 --> 01:08:42,208
Charteris was divorced a year ago.
Why don't you get your records straight?

654
01:08:42,343 --> 01:08:45,044
- I nearIy had me bIeeding neck broken.
- The story of my Iife, Sidney.

655
01:08:45,175 --> 01:08:47,047
I never couId get nothing straight.

656
01:08:47,175 --> 01:08:50,255
I'm not interested in your Iife, Dodger.
I'm at death's door.

657
01:08:50,382 --> 01:08:52,503
WeII, don't panic, Sidney. I mean, I'II...

658
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:54,209
OId Dodger
wiII puII something out of the hat.

659
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:57,421
- How do you think I've survived so far?
- That's a bIoody good question.

660
01:08:57,548 --> 01:09:00,794
Look, I've got something speciaI
for you, Sidney.

661
01:09:02,298 --> 01:09:04,999
A certain gentIeman,
whose name cannot be divuIged,

662
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,121
but who is not short
of a smaII fortune or two,

663
01:09:07,255 --> 01:09:10,666
is desirous of Iaying his hands
on a certain work of art.

664
01:09:10,795 --> 01:09:13,200
- Eh?
- Have you heard of Picasso?

665
01:09:13,336 --> 01:09:17,496
Now Iook,
I'm not having anything to do with the Mafia.

666
01:09:17,628 --> 01:09:22,664
Mafia! He's pig ignorant.
Picasso is one of the greatest painters ever.

667
01:09:22,794 --> 01:09:27,001
And one of his masterpieces is hanging on
the waII of a mansion not very far from here.

668
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:28,239
Go on.

669
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:31,411
I want you, dear Sidney,
to obtain it by fair means or fouI.

670
01:09:31,544 --> 01:09:36,247
And hang in its pIace this copy,
which I've had prepared at great expense.

671
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:39,163
Oh, you're not asking me
to pinch a painting?

672
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:43,449
I'm not asking you to pinch a painting.
I'm asking you to arrange a swapping.

673
01:09:43,584 --> 01:09:46,415
- And what happens when they find out?
- Find out?

674
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:49,987
They couIdn't teII a Picasso
from a giraffe's arse-o.

675
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:54,911
- How do I get into the pIace?
- PuII the oId Water Board routine again.

676
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:56,698
Say you've gone round
to check the water pressure

677
01:09:56,831 --> 01:09:58,786
and whiIe you're at it, suss the joint out.

678
01:09:58,914 --> 01:10:02,952
Then, having secreted this copy
somewhere about your person,

679
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:05,862
at the appropriate moment, swap it.

680
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,285
- Swap it?
- Swap it.

681
01:10:09,745 --> 01:10:12,068
And this time, nothing can go wrong.

682
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:14,951
OId Dodger gives you
his personaI guarantee.

683
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,446
After aII, it's onIy a swapping.

684
01:10:59,237 --> 01:11:02,483
What are you doing standing there
without a drink in your hand?

685
01:11:02,611 --> 01:11:05,978
Sex aIive, there's enough Iiquor
around here to sink a battIeship.

686
01:11:06,112 --> 01:11:09,062
Lucinda, honey! There.

687
01:11:09,194 --> 01:11:14,313
No one shaII ever say Loretta Proudfoot
Iacks one iota of Southern hospitaIity.

688
01:11:14,443 --> 01:11:17,807
Even though she is
6,000 miIes away from home.

689
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,353
Oh, you're Mrs Proudfoot?

690
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:22,978
Oh! I'm sorry, honey.
I thought you were a guest.

691
01:11:23,107 --> 01:11:26,971
- Oh, no, I'm a pIumber.
- A pIumber. Did I caII for a pIumber?

692
01:11:27,274 --> 01:11:30,270
WeII, the counciI sent me.
Your water pressure's aII over the pIace.

693
01:11:30,397 --> 01:11:34,226
Loretta, darIing.
You've been hoIding out on me.

694
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:36,396
Where have you been hiding this one?

695
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:39,189
This is Hubert,
one of my dearest friends.

696
01:11:39,314 --> 01:11:42,346
- Hubert, meet...
- Sid.

697
01:11:43,398 --> 01:11:45,933
Oh! What a IoveIy name.

698
01:11:46,355 --> 01:11:50,559
- He's a pIumber.
- A pIumber! How interesting.

699
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:54,383
WeII, you can shove your pIunger
round my S-bend any day.

700
01:11:55,771 --> 01:12:00,176
- I'II hit you over the bIeeding head with it.
- Ooh! Any time.

701
01:12:00,687 --> 01:12:04,216
He's so butch, dear.
I'II see you Iater, heart-face.

702
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:11,682
You must forgive Hubert.
He's not afraid to say exactIy how he feeIs.

703
01:12:11,892 --> 01:12:13,515
That's aII right. It don't bother me.

704
01:12:13,642 --> 01:12:16,888
Good. Because I beIieve
in everybody being themseIves.

705
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:20,962
My Iate husband, who was a psychiatrist,
aIways said

706
01:12:21,099 --> 01:12:26,052
the troubIe with the worId
was sexuaI frustration.

707
01:12:27,763 --> 01:12:28,843
Very true.

708
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:31,378
So every now and again,
I Iike to have a IittIe get-together

709
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,043
where aII my friends
can Iose aII their inhibitions.

710
01:12:35,179 --> 01:12:39,043
WeII, yeah.
You mean, sort of, Iet it aII hang out.

711
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:42,792
ExactIy. Oh, Robin, honey, this is Sid.

712
01:12:42,927 --> 01:12:47,335
My! Samantha's got a sparkIe
in her eye tonight, haven't you, honey?

713
01:12:47,468 --> 01:12:51,593
She's sparkIing at everybody.
I can't keep her away from the men.

714
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:54,540
And you know what I'm Iike, I get so jeaIous.

715
01:12:54,676 --> 01:12:58,717
I was in two minds about coming tonight,
but she insisted, didn't you, dear?

716
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:01,793
Oh, she couIdn't wait to Iose her inhibitions.

717
01:13:01,925 --> 01:13:04,792
The moment she stepped into the room
she took aII her cIothes off.

718
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:07,459
With a body Iike that,
how can you bIame her?

719
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:10,421
Hasn't she got the most beautifuI shape?

720
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:14,830
- Fantastic, yeah.
- TeII me,

721
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:18,544
- do you think I was right to bring her?
- Yeah.

722
01:13:18,881 --> 01:13:22,458
I know why you're saying that.
You fancy her yourseIf, don't you?

723
01:13:22,587 --> 01:13:23,962
Now, now, Robin,

724
01:13:24,088 --> 01:13:28,331
Sid is not a man to step in between
two peopIe who Iove each other.

725
01:13:28,796 --> 01:13:31,628
You reaIIy must try to stop being so jeaIous,

726
01:13:31,754 --> 01:13:35,700
and I mustn't keep you
from your duties for one moment Ionger.

727
01:14:12,288 --> 01:14:14,693
Enjoying yourseIf, honey? Fine.

728
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:18,742
By the way,
what actuaIIy is wrong with my water?

729
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:24,193
WeII, it's not running properIy.
It's throwing the whoIe area out of baIance.

730
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,528
Excuse me.

731
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,904
Excuse me!

732
01:14:41,659 --> 01:14:43,449
- You've got my pIunger.
- Your what?

733
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:46,111
WeII, it's stuck to your ar...
WeII, I'II have to have it back.

734
01:14:46,242 --> 01:14:47,649
Do you mind?

735
01:14:48,949 --> 01:14:51,236
WeII, I've got to get it back.

736
01:15:00,782 --> 01:15:06,314
Okay, everyone, it's time to go fishing.
Now, you aII know the ruIes.

737
01:15:06,447 --> 01:15:09,609
Each one of you
has to fish for his or her partner.

738
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:12,690
And once you've hooked them,
they're yours for the night.

739
01:15:12,822 --> 01:15:16,233
One, two, three, everyone into the water!

740
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:13,012
Hey, no! Oh, no, no! Look.

741
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:16,722
Look, I'm onIy the pIumber.
I'm onIy the pIumber!

742
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:19,386
I'm onIy the pIumber!

743
01:16:28,891 --> 01:16:33,181
Ah! My Picasso's in the water.
Somebody fish it out. The coIours'II run.

744
01:16:35,225 --> 01:16:39,678
You, you took it.
You're not a pIumber, you're a thief.

745
01:16:40,224 --> 01:16:43,091
The poIice. Somebody ring for the poIice!

746
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:47,381
- I'm not a thief, it beIongs to me.
- BeIongs to you! It's mine.

747
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:50,713
There's not another Iike it
in the whoIe wide worId.

748
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:54,506
Your bIeeding Picasso's hanging on the waII.
Turn around, have a Iook.

749
01:16:54,636 --> 01:16:57,206
WeII, what's that doing there, then?

750
01:16:58,179 --> 01:17:01,625
- WeII, it's not worth tuppence, it's a copy.
- A copy!

751
01:17:02,387 --> 01:17:05,054
I know what you were gonna do!

752
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:17,955
Samantha!

753
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:20,590
He's kiIIed her.

754
01:17:21,923 --> 01:17:23,583
He's done her in.

755
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:31,463
- Ah! You got it.
- No, I didn't get it.

756
01:17:31,589 --> 01:17:36,080
- WeII, why not?
- There was a party going on

757
01:17:36,214 --> 01:17:38,784
and one thing Ied to another
and I didn't do the swap.

758
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:41,918
Look, Dodger, I'm not interested
in any more of your IittIe schemes.

759
01:17:42,045 --> 01:17:45,459
As much as I need the money,
I don't fancy spending next Christmas inside.

760
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:48,336
Oh, weII, Sidney, remember the oId saying.

761
01:17:48,462 --> 01:17:52,326
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try, try again."

762
01:17:52,462 --> 01:17:54,867
I'm not trying anything eIse. That's finaI.

763
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,698
Oh, that's a shame, Sidney.
'Cause I've got a smasher here.

764
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:02,284
You couIdn't go wrong with this one.
Tower of London.

765
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,204
Dodger, stuff it.

766
01:18:35,538 --> 01:18:37,112
- Good morning.
- Morning.

767
01:18:37,247 --> 01:18:39,735
- Do you buy bikes?
- Yeah.

768
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:43,315
WeII, what about this mighty machine
out here, eh?

769
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:45,408
I'II have a Iook at it.

770
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,945
Done a Iot of miIeage, hasn't it?

771
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:07,902
It just goes to show how honest I am.
I couId have easiIy fixed the cIock.

772
01:19:08,033 --> 01:19:12,358
- The tyres are weII worn.
- Oh, come on. What's a coupIe of tyres?

773
01:19:12,491 --> 01:19:14,612
What do you want, part exchange?

774
01:19:14,741 --> 01:19:18,602
WeII, no. I've got to seII it actuaIIy.
I don't want to, but I've got no choice.

775
01:19:18,738 --> 01:19:20,315
Need money in a hurry, do you?

776
01:19:20,447 --> 01:19:23,065
No, no.
I know this geezer who's seIIing a sports car.

777
01:19:23,196 --> 01:19:24,525
ReaI bargain.

778
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:27,854
But unIess I give him the money today,
no go.

779
01:19:27,988 --> 01:19:30,274
Where's the registration book?

780
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:37,235
- Any hire purchase on it?
- Yeah, why?

781
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:40,771
- How many payments have you made?
- Two.

782
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,233
You can't seII it. It's not yours to seII.

783
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:49,184
WeII, it's my property. I bought it, didn't I?

01:19:49,316 --> 01:19:53,061
It's not your property
untiI you've made the Iast payment.

785
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:56,562
- Do you mean I can't seII it anywhere?
- It's not yours to seII.

786
01:19:56,690 --> 01:20:00,979
You try seIIing that bike to anybody eIse

787
01:20:04,064 --> 01:20:07,596
- Oh, you're not going away.

789
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:16,263
I suppose that's good news.
When do you Ieave?

790

20 DunhiIIs, pIease.

That's aII right.
We'II waIk down there with you.

797
01:21:43,548 --> 01:21:46,214
Keep you company, won't we, Stropper?

798
01:21:47,631 --> 01:21:50,036
You stiII don't trust me, do you, eh?

799
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:52,743
I'm not going to emigrate.
It's onIy 1,000 quid.

01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,498
WeII, that's aII right.

Yeah, weII, you don't have to
put yourseIves out.

803
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:03,951
You sound Iike
you don't want us with you, Sid.

804
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:06,837
You're not trying anything on, are you?

805
01:22:07,711 --> 01:22:09,868
Don't tear his cIothes.

806
01:22:10,003 --> 01:22:13,449
They'II be worth a few quid
when we get them off him.

807
01:22:16,126 --> 01:22:17,868
On second thoughts.

808
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:22,289
Come on, BIackie. The bank'II be cIosed.

809
01:22:22,418 --> 01:22:25,995
So what? You ain't got nothing in it.
I ain't thick.

810
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,498
What's in the bag?

811
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:33,486
WeII, it's me Iaundry.
I pass the Iaundry on the way to the bank.

812
01:22:33,623 --> 01:22:34,998
Open it up.

813
01:22:42,498 --> 01:22:44,204
You're dead right.

814
01:22:45,413 --> 01:22:47,239
You ain't emigrating.

815
01:22:47,372 --> 01:22:50,783
They don't take crippIes
in these foreign countries.

816
01:22:51,997 --> 01:22:55,112
Stropper, your moment has come.

817
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:03,615
- I never did you any harm.
- I didn't say you did. It's me job, innit?

818
01:23:07,785 --> 01:23:11,731
You never gave me a chance.
You didn't give me enough time.

819
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:15,197
You're breaking me bIeeding heart. Stropper!

820
01:23:18,698 --> 01:23:21,151
Mister, this is private business.

821
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:23,438
My apoIogies,
but I have to speak to Mr South.

822
01:23:23,573 --> 01:23:28,064
- So do we and we saw him first.

823
01:23:28,197 --> 01:23:31,481
- He won't be needing any. Push off!
- I'm not seIIing insurance.

824
01:23:31,615 --> 01:23:33,520
Here, don't I know you?

825
01:23:33,654 --> 01:23:37,979
I was at the poIice station when you
made a statement about that Iavatory seat.

826
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,861
- Oh, that's right, yeah. I remember.
- Lavatory seat?

827
01:23:40,987 --> 01:23:45,774
I'm pIeased to inform you, Mr South,
that you are due for a reward. £1,000.

For giving information
Ieading to the recovery of stoIen property.

Now if you'II just sign this receipt.

01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,230
Turn your back, Stropper.

831
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:05,396
My apoIogies for the interruption, gentIemen.
Good day.

833
01:24:14,275 --> 01:24:15,896
Mr RockefeIIer.

834
01:24:16,064 --> 01:24:20,886
- HeIIo, boy. I heard aII about your windfaII.
- Yeah, so did the bookies. Took the Iot.

835
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,894

836
01:24:23,022 --> 01:24:25,391
- Got anything?
- Nothing. Get out.

837
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:30,347
- I'm desperate. I'II do anything.
- Anything?

838
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,558
- Anything?
- Yeah.

839
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:41,801
I've got something to show you.

840
01:24:45,019 --> 01:24:46,217
What is it?

841
01:24:46,353 --> 01:24:48,888
It's a new mechanicaI pipe and drain cIeaner.

842
01:24:49,019 --> 01:24:51,590
- I'm starting a new service.
- Drains?

843
01:24:51,727 --> 01:24:52,839
- Yeah.
- Not with me, you're not.

844
01:24:52,975 --> 01:24:54,634
Here, hang about.

845
01:24:54,768 --> 01:24:57,434
I was thinking of putting you
in soIe charge of this.

846
01:24:57,558 --> 01:24:59,715
- OnIy because you can't get anyone eIse.
- Yeah.

847
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:01,178
No!

848
01:25:01,309 --> 01:25:03,927
Oh, Iook here.
Look, somebody's got to do it, haven't they?

849
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:07,304
It'II be a good rate of pay. PIenty of overtime.

850
01:25:09,682 --> 01:25:11,589
- AII right.

You get to Iearn how to handIe that machine,

852
01:25:15,264 --> 01:25:20,299
It does the work ten times faster.
Here, try it out on our drains here.

853
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:24,843
Get a bit of practice.

854
01:25:33,596 --> 01:25:36,546
- HeIIo, stranger.
