1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,499
Crunching leaves under footsteps

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,560
panic heavy breathing

3
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:39,940
Intense sounds

4
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,840
So how long were you
lost before I found you?

5
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:58,920
I don't know.

6
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,700
I wasn't really keeping track
of the time or anything.

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,919
But I just saw this really beautiful hill
and I wanted to climb it and see the view.

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,660
And then...

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,360
I got lost.

10
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,080
Not a good idea I guess.

11
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,060
- You guess?

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,900
That's good that I found you then.

13
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,140
Yeah, thanks again. I don't know what I
would have done if you hadn't found me.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,399
- I mean, a girl can die up

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,320
...if she gets lost.

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,680
No, I think if a bear came
I could handle myself.

17
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,520
- Yeah?

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,880
It's not the bears you need to worry about

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,060
Hey!

20
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,100
Where we going?

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
Is this the way to the trail?

22
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,600
- You sure?

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,720
- Yeah!

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,480
Are you ready?

25
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:18,380
- No!

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,700
I'm not going in there.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,620
- Oh, come on, I thought you

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,760
came out here for adventure?

29
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,019
- Wow, you are really
good at building a fire.

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,239
- Thank you.

31
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,440
What's wrong?

32
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,700
- Someone might see us.

33
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,900
- So?

34
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,100
- I don't know.

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,920
- Come on.

36
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,380
Hey!

37
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,960
Are you okay?

38
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,479
- I'm having a little trouble

39
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,620
finding my way back to the trail.

40
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,500
- Are you hiking by yourself?

41
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,800
- Yeah.

42
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,240
Oh my God, oh my.

43
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,660
Taylor!

44
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,440
Oh my God!

45
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,520
Oh my God, Taylor!

46
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,300
Taylor!

47
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Let me help you.

48
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Let me help you.

49
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,239
Please let me help.

50
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,200
please, please.

51
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Taylor!

52
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,000
Taylor stop!

53
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,700
Taylor!

54
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,860
Taylor.

55
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,319
Shit!

56
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,880
If I remember correctly,...

57
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm not the one who ditched my brother
to travel along with some strange girl.

58
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,719
- But... um... would you be
having such witty conversations.

59
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,320
By myself?

60
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,540
Debatable...

61
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,060
...but not impossible.

62
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,400
- OK.

63
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,520
- I guess it's fate.

64
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,620
Fate?

65
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,000
- Well...

66
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,180
- You don't think so?

67
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:35,960
No...

68
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,880
- But it's kind of romantic, though.

69
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,720
Finding a lost girl in the woods?

70
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,360
- No...

71
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,360
- How we met.

72
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,900
On a trail?

73
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,500
A lot of people meet that way.

74
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
- I wouldn't say a lot.

75
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,119
- You make it sound so morose.

76
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,400
Well... what if it is bad?

77
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,319
- Sure.

78
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
- but what if it is good?

79
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,180
- Anyway...

80
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,180
- ...you're stuck here with me now.

81
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,800
Ok, whatever.

82
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,319
I think it's you who is stuck with me.

83
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
- OK.
