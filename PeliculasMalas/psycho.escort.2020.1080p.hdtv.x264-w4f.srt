1
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,964
You can let me try.

2
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,873
What a great tie, Garrett.

3
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,341
Is that new, Garrett?

4
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,842
Do you mind if I get
the same one, Garrett?

5
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,444
Stop. You're awful.

6
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,445
I think Kyle spends more time in

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,113
the boss' office than his own.

8
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,350
Okay, okay. Trivia
at tuck's bay tonight, okay?

9
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,787
I hope to see everybody there.
Okay? Everybody.

10
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,322
- First round's on me, baby.
- Okay, top shelf.

11
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:58,991
What do you say, Russ?
Loosen' up a bit.

12
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,459
You're hopeless.

13
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,494
The human care bear.

14
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:05,308
Russell, you're going, right?

15
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,632
- Yeah. I wouldn't miss it.
- Okay, good.

16
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,000
Diane,
you wanna carpool with me?

17
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,835
No. I can't. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,870
- Aw.
- Work.

19
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,348
You should go tonight.

20
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,417
- I would if I could, but i...
- no.

21
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,985
Kyle has been in Garrett's ear
at every one

22
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,320
of these after-hours functions,

23
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,457
making his case for partner.

24
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,026
I wanna be named partner
because I deserve it,

25
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,661
not because I'm good
at useless trivia.

26
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,630
Yeah, well, if it came down
to useless trivia,

27
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,832
I'd be ceo by now.

28
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,867
Four wins in a row?

29
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,237
- See, you don't need my help.
- Maybe not.

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,539
I wouldn't mind the company.

31
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,976
And Betty steals my pretzels.

32
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,682
That promotion should be yours.
You do deserve it.

33
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,884
Don't let Kyle sweet talk it
out from under you.

34
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,588
Thanks, Russell.
Appreciate that.

35
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,165
And you get a chance to make a
good impression at the retreat.

36
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,396
That...

37
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,719
Jake, sweetie?

38
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,876
He's in his room.

39
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,410
Did you get my crab rangoon?

40
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,147
You didn't say
you wanted crab rangoon.

41
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,381
You're my sister,
you're supposed to know

42
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,416
my order by heart.

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,187
- Bottom of the bag.
- Bless you.

44
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,289
Hey, go easy on him.

45
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,631
Jake?

46
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,467
Honey, don't you think
that's a little loud?

47
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,871
Honey!

48
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,374
- What happened?
- Nothing.

49
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,744
Jake, you promised me.
No more fights, remember?

50
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,629
This happen before
or after school?

51
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,020
After.

52
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,289
So I won't be getting a message
from the principal?

53
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,058
No. The message is from coach.

54
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,566
I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to your game today.

55
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,335
It's fine. We lost anyways.

56
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,888
This is the third fight
this semester.

57
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,790
Is he still seeing
the school counselor?

58
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,626
Yeah. Twice a week.

59
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,228
You know,
I just was on the phone with her

60
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,468
and she was telling me
about all the wonderful progress

61
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,531
he was making.

62
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,966
You think
she was over-selling it?

63
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,970
He's got a black eye, Lori.

64
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,205
He's had a rough road.
It's gonna take some time.

65
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,940
Yeah.

66
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,544
I know.
I just wish I could do more.

67
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,025
What's that?

68
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,251
It's a invitation.

69
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,120
The firm is hosting
an employee retreat.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
A day of wine tasting
at Garrett's house.

71
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:20,292
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,394
I should really go.

73
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,697
But?

74
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,165
Well, it says

75
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,701
"spouses and significant others
encouraged."

76
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:33,049
I'd be the only one there
without a date.

77
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,874
And, you know,
I just really don't wanna deal

78
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,210
with all the sympathetic looks,
you know?

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,648
Yeah, sympathy is awful.

80
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,851
You know what I mean.

81
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,953
I mean, I already feel like
people walk on eggshells

82
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,055
whenever they're around me
because of...

83
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,394
You know,
I just would rather not go.

84
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,729
Why don't you ask
that cute coworker of yours out?

85
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:01,133
- You know, Mr. Trivia.
- Russell?

86
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,401
No.

87
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,336
Why not?

88
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,838
Because he'd get the wrong idea
for one.

89
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,008
Why can't it be the right idea?

90
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,944
Lori, I just, you know,
I just don't feel like dating

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,913
right now,
especially someone I work with.

92
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,516
It's just...

93
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,618
Di...

94
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,754
It's been two years.

95
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,758
Yeah, I'm just not ready.

96
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,332
I have an idea.

97
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,240
Now, don't say no right away.

98
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:58,301
The companionship collective?

99
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,726
It's like a dating service.

100
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,261
And they pair you up
with activity partners.

101
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,796
So you want me to rent a date?

102
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,432
You said yourself you don't want
anything serious.

103
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,669
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

104
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,970
Look, wouldn't I
just be better off

105
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,138
with, like, a dating app
or something?

106
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,006
These are professionals.

107
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,342
They hang on your arm,
they say all the right things

108
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,745
and then you say goodbye.
It's the perfect solution.

109
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,647
You get the benefit of a date
without all the baggage.

110
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,487
You can't keep avoiding
your coworkers.

111
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,589
They're gonna start
to take it personally.

112
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,532
So you're really gonna go,
right?

113
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,667
I don't know.

114
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,270
You need to stop hiding out
from life.

115
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,738
I'm not hiding.

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,441
Are you still taking
those sleeping pills?

117
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,443
No.

118
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:53,523
I worry about you.

119
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:57,048
You don't need to worry.
I'm fine. Really.

120
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,788
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

121
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:13,663
Diane?

122
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,687
Hi.

123
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,491
- If you'll follow me.
- Right. Yes.

124
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,626
- How are you today?
- Very well. How are you?

125
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,762
Very good.
Thank you.

126
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,975
- There are a lot of questions.
- We're very thorough.

127
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,934
Y-You know, I'm just looking
for a plus-one to a work event.

128
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,168
Well, we understand
the pressures

129
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,636
that come along
with social gatherings

130
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,538
and the value
of keeping up appearances.

131
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,808
We strive to provide you with
the best possible experience.

132
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,677
How did you hear
about our services?

133
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,445
My sister.

134
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,947
If you wouldn't mind making a
note of that in the bottom box.

135
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:44,316
All of this is confidential.

136
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,850
It won't leave my office.

137
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,619
Including my address?

138
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,854
Your companion will meet you
in a public location

139
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,624
and all correspondence
is monitored by our system.

140
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,726
Your safety is our priority.

141
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,299
You'll be taken through
a gallery of our staff.

142
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,834
There will be
a small bio included

143
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,970
that will list likes and skills.

144
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,371
Skills?

145
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,273
For events that require dancing

146
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,575
or horseback riding
or something specific.

147
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,381
So I get to pick my date
out of a catalogue?

148
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,416
Not quite,
you'll rank your choices

149
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,719
and then we'll have to take
a look at the schedule.

150
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,821
Shouldn't take
more than 15 minutes.

151
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,534
You are officially booked
for next Saturday at 1 P.M.

152
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,403
But the event's not until 2:00.

153
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,905
We encourage people to meet
their matches ahead of time

154
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,807
to establish a rapport.

155
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,176
Okay.

156
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,046
Thank you for choosing
the companionship collective.

157
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,148
Thanks.

158
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,754
You look pretty for your date.

159
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,690
It's not a date.

160
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:36,294
Okay, what do you think?
Pendant or pearls?

161
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,329
Pendant.

162
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Here.

163
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:44,514
Can I borrow these sometime?

164
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,572
- Just don't steal 'em.
- I won't.

165
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,941
I don't know.
Maybe this is a bad idea.

166
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,943
You always do that.

167
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,612
Doubt your good ideas.
Self-sabotaging behavior.

168
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,815
Please don't attempt
to psychoanalyze me, Lori.

169
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,550
Would you like to join me
on the couch?

170
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:02,320
How does that make you feel?

171
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,689
My ride's here. Gotta go.

172
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,325
Text me his picture
when you get there.

173
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,661
- Why?
- For safety purposes.

174
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,297
Goodbye, Lori.

175
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,866
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

176
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,212
Miles?

177
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,516
- Diane?
- Hi.

178
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,785
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

179
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,859
I, I don't know
what happens next.

180
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,894
How about coffee?

181
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,364
Of course.

182
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:56,307
I'm serious. I'm really excited
about a wine tasting.

183
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,477
My last date
was at a tractor pull,

184
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,381
and let's just say
I wore the wrong shoes.

185
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,899
I'm talking your ear off.
I'm sorry, it's...

186
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:14,492
No. I'm sorry. It's not you.
I'm just, a little...

187
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,594
Nervous?

188
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,532
Well, I've never done this
before.

189
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,501
- You know, hire a...
- a companion.

190
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,904
Not that there's anything wrong
with what you do. I...

191
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:29,040
I know, it's unorthodox.

192
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,043
But I promise you, it's much
more common than you think.

193
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,078
And you're in good company.

194
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,287
So how does this work exactly?

195
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,289
You set the parameters.

196
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,058
And so for the next four hours,
I am whoever you want me to be.

197
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,861
Friend, boyfriend, husband...

198
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,029
No. Nothing like that.

199
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,997
Um, no, I just need someone

200
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,766
by my side for the day,

201
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,335
you know,
to take the pressure off.

202
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,371
Well, there are a lot
of expectations put on people.

203
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,541
Sometimes it's easier
to just play the game.

204
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,747
I suppose we should
get our story straight.

205
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,883
- Our story?
- How we met.

206
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,384
First date.
In case anyone asks...

207
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,221
Yes, um...

208
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:20,992
Let's see,
we met through friends?

209
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,928
- I asked you out.
- They'd never believe that.

210
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,096
Why not?

211
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,232
That I wouldn't beat you to it.

212
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:36,641
Thank you. Well,
we should probably get going.

213
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:43,326
No photos.

214
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,817
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,587
That was
incredibly rude of me...

216
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,124
No. It's-it's fine. It's just my
job, it requires a low profile.

217
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,492
It's really hard
to be a convincing date

218
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,262
if you're all over social media.

219
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,364
Yes. Of course.

220
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:08,384
- You ready?
- I think so.

221
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,275
Don't worry.
No, we're in this together.

222
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,542
Okay.

223
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,679
Diane! Diane, hey!

224
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:18,049
- Hi, Betty.
- I'm so glad you came! Hi.

225
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,219
Hello, I'm Betty.
I work with Diane.

226
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,253
Miles.

227
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,454
Now I see why you've been

228
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,156
holding out on trivia night.

229
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,325
Yes, I have been
a little selfish

230
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,261
when it comes
to Diane's free time.

231
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,663
Do you need help?

232
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,997
Yes, please.

233
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,899
I need to take those
to the kitchen.

234
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,802
You don't mind if I borrow him
for a second, do you?

235
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,470
Not at all, please.

236
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,139
Okay. I'll be in the kitchen.

237
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,541
Yes. Okay, thank you.
Right this way.

238
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,721
- Yeah.
- This way?

239
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,112
- Right in here.
- Okay.

240
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,182
I promise, this is my,
one of my last act.

241
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,217
I won't have more than...

242
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,722
and he said this is all just
basically old...

243
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,294
Russell! Ha-ha.

244
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,096
Hey! You came.

245
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,566
Well, someone told me
I should make more of an effort

246
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,101
to network
outside of the office.

247
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,602
Smart someone.

248
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,638
Someone seems to think so.

249
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:16,419
Um, I'm glad you're here though.

250
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,677
I was feeling a little awkward
about flying solo.

251
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,379
- So there's...
- Russell!

252
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,247
Have you met Diane's boyfriend?

253
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,984
Miles.

254
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,518
Russell! Yeah, of course.

255
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,455
I recall Diane
mentioning you once or twice.

256
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,125
Can't say the same.

257
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:40,609
Well, we were just about
to go mingle.

258
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,967
It was nice meeting you.

259
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,003
Nice meeting you.

260
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,407
Wow. Go, Diane.

261
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,283
Yeah, the first beauty pageants,
men, they got the tiaras,

262
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,386
women, women got a...

263
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,920
But it was,
it was full of diamonds.

264
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,956
It was,
it was precious gemstones...

265
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,793
- Hello.
- Hi.

266
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,061
This is quite the spread
you have here.

267
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,296
It looks delicious.

268
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,732
And your home is so lovely.
Truly, it's beautiful.

269
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:48,933
Well, thank you very much.

270
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,202
But all the credit
goes to my wife.

271
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,075
- I'm glad you're here, Diane.
- I wouldn't miss it.

272
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,710
I guess you've heard
that Mark Henderson is retiring

273
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,345
at the end of the year.

274
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,680
We're looking
to promote from within.

275
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,649
Garrett!

276
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,285
Have you tried the Merlot?
It is not to be missed.

277
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,753
Actually, I'm gonna wait

278
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,855
until all the guests arrive
before sampling.

279
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,357
In that case,
I would suggest you hold off.

280
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,826
Why is that?

281
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,027
Well, you wanna start
with something lighter.

282
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,595
Like the chenin blanc.

283
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,731
The sugars of the Merlot
will linger on your palate.

284
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:25,036
- And you are?
- Miles. My date.

285
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,773
Looks like
Diane brought a ringer.

286
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,008
The man knows his wine.

287
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,844
My grandfather
owned a small vineyard.

288
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,279
I grew up around it.

289
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,515
Well, in that case,
I'm looking forward

290
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,983
to hearing your take
on our offerings.

291
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,019
- Absolutely. I'd be happy to.
- Garrett Jones.

292
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,888
It's nice to finally put a face
with the name.

293
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,656
Diane speaks very highly of you.

294
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,492
She does?

295
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,393
I spotted my wife
in that corner.

296
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,429
Let me introduce you.

297
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,464
Grace.

298
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,934
Spending that time in the temple
made me realize

299
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,871
that money's not the only wealth
in the world.

300
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,540
And that's when I knew I had
to get out of acquisitions.

301
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,743
Altruistic. Quite a story.

302
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,179
It's interesting.

303
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,182
Sorry, this is, this is Jake.

304
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,917
- I should probably check in.
- Jake?

305
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,952
Her son.

306
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,421
I'm aware. I was only worried
something was wrong.

307
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,525
No, no, it's nothing like that.
Um, excuse me.

308
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,792
Would you like
another glass of wine?

309
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,828
Yes, please.

310
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,444
Hey, thanks, man.

311
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,468
So how'd you do it?

312
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,805
Defrost the ice queen.

313
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,708
You seem so threatened by her.

314
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,147
She's the one
who needs to be worried.

315
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,151
I don't think
that belongs to you.

316
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,656
Yeah, okay.

317
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,347
You don't think
it's a little bit odd

318
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,738
we hadn't heard a thing
about a boyfriend?

319
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,641
She doesn't have
to tell US everything.

320
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:14,378
Whoof! But that miles
is a absolute dream.

321
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,082
- Whoof.
- Easy.

322
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,650
You should be happy for her.

323
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,987
After everything
she's gone through...

324
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,489
I can't imagine
losing my husband that young.

325
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,598
You're right.

326
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,367
I know I'm right.
I'm always right.

327
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:40,649
Right, but you won't let anybody
forget it.

328
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,007
- Right.
- Well, you were amazing.

329
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,477
- My coworkers loved you.
- They were really nice.

330
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,945
I can't believe
you didn't tell me

331
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,147
that your grandfather
owned a vineyard.

332
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,316
He didn't.

333
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,220
I was playing the part.

334
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,957
Right. Of course.

335
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,296
Um, well, thank you.

336
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,398
It was honestly my pleasure.

337
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,403
Do I tip you or...

338
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:14,683
No, no, but the company's

339
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,041
gonna send along a feedback form
in a few days.

340
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,243
Good reviews go a long way
in booking jobs.

341
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,279
Yes. Absolutely.

342
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:23,692
Um, well,

343
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,750
please consider this
a thank you, then.

344
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,897
Bye, Diane! Bye, miles!

345
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,755
So nice to meet you.

346
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,556
You, too, Betty.

347
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,025
- Bye, Betty.
- Bye.

348
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,361
- Get home safe. Okay.
- I-I will.

349
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,863
My coworkers
are gonna be so upset

350
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,898
to find out
that we've broken up.

351
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,435
Let 'em down easy.

352
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,272
Goodnight.

353
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:12,941
Hey.

354
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,532
How was it?

355
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,634
It was good.

356
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,636
Was he nice?

357
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,571
- Very. Yeah.
- Cute?

358
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,707
Lori.

359
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,343
That's a yes.

360
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:29,413
- Hate to say I told you so.
- You love to say that.

361
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,683
Well, seems like
the fake date was a success.

362
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,687
I guess so.

363
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,758
It makes me happy to see you
getting out there, di.

364
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,007
Wouldn't it be nice to meet
someone you could do

365
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,430
things with,
someone you really care about?

366
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,232
Okay, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

367
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,700
It was one date.

368
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,436
Well, you went out,
you had a good time.

369
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,672
The world didn't end.

370
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,475
- You're so right.
- I know. I'm a genius.

371
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,219
So...

372
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,188
How did you two meet?

373
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,492
Miles.

374
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,794
Um, through my sister.

375
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,432
Been seein' each other long?

376
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,903
Okay, why the sudden interest
in my love life?

377
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,305
Well, I'm just making
polite conversation.

378
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,408
Okay.

379
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:33,355
Okay. You know what?

380
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,913
I'm a little surprised
he never came up before.

381
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:41,018
Well... hi.

382
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,187
- Hi, you have a minute?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

383
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,823
I'm hosting a small dinner party
at my house tonight.

384
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,758
- Are you free?
- This evening? Yes.

385
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,027
- Absolutely.
- Wonderful.

386
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,396
And, feel free to invite miles.

387
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,064
It's a social gathering.

388
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
Um, you know,
I'm actually not sure

389
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,536
if he is available tonight,
but...

390
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,706
It's a shame.

391
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,348
Told you he really likes miles.

392
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,521
<i>Good morning.
Companionship collective.</i>

393
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,723
Yes, hi,
I was wondering if miles

394
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,725
has any availability
for this evening.

395
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,361
- I know it's short notice.
- <i>-I believe so.</i>

396
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,931
Great! Wonderful.

397
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,233
<i>Please hold
while I check his availability.</i>

398
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,268
Yes. Yes.

399
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:39,477
Betty asked me
to give this to you.

400
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:43,647
You going
to the partners' dinner tonight?

401
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,683
I am.

402
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,452
Guess I'll see you there.

403
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:52,267
<i>Ms. Cooper?</i>

404
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,358
Hello? Yes, I'm here.

405
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,560
<i>I'm sorry. He's booked.</i>

406
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,928
<i>Would you like to schedule
with someone else</i>

407
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,964
<i>for this evening?</i>

408
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,335
No, no. That's okay. Thank you.

409
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,225
Miles?

410
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,961
- Hey.
- Hey.

411
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,197
- I thought that was you.
- Small world.

412
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,299
- How are you?
- Good.

413
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,767
What are you doing here?

414
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,003
Do you have a kid that goes
to this school?

415
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,805
I volunteer for the school's
big brother program.

416
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:44,375
- Really?
- How are you?

417
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,110
Has your boss come to his senses
and promoted you yet?

418
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,113
Not yet. Um...

419
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,448
No, but he is actually hosting
a dinner tonight

420
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,285
with all of the partners,
and he invited me, so...

421
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,153
Well,
that sounds like a good sign.

422
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,855
Yeah.

423
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,190
You know,
it's, it's funny I ran into you.

424
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,793
Um, I actually tried calling
the company

425
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,161
to see if you were available
tonight,

426
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,964
but they said
you were booked, so...

427
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,134
Yeah, that fell through.

428
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,037
- Really?
- Yeah. I just got the text.

429
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,773
It happens more often
than you think, honestly.

430
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,342
You know, people get cold feet
or their plans change.

431
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,911
So you're free?

432
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,347
Seems so.

433
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,982
Would you wanna go with me?

434
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,318
I-I mean, I don't mean
to put you on the spot,

435
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,720
and please don't feel obligated
to, to say yes...

436
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,056
Diane, I'd love to.

437
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:34,403
You would?

438
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,026
Yeah.

439
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,128
Well, great, great, um...

440
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,264
Here, actually,
let me just, call...

441
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,100
No, no, no. Well,
we, we can do it off the books.

442
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,438
Isn't that breaking the rules?

443
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,740
Well, technically.

444
00:26:52,423 --> 00:26:54,423
I didn't mean to suggest

445
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,013
that you would be doing it
for free, you know?

446
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,683
I'm not, no. I'll be getting
a meal out of it.

447
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,954
That's very cute.

448
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,023
Okay, looks like
I'll have just enough time

449
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,091
to go home and change.

450
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,726
Yeah, great. Me, too.

451
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,027
If you don't mind,
can I get your number

452
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,796
just in case I'm delayed...

453
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,832
Yeah, of course.

454
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,579
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

455
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,069
- How was practice?
- Good.

456
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,472
- This must be the infamous Jake.
- Yeah.

457
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,440
Hey, I'm miles,
I'm a friend of your mom's.

458
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,075
Hi.

459
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,978
Okay, well,
we are going to get going.

460
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,013
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Yeah.

461
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,314
- Okay?
- Okay.

462
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,549
- How was practice, sweetie?
- Good.

463
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,652
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

464
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,501
Second date.

465
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,458
This guy must have
really made an impression.

466
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,493
It's not a date.

467
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,063
Then why are you wearing
your favorite perfume?

468
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,865
Because
it's my favorite perfume.

469
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,001
I thought the whole point
of hiring somebody

470
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,370
was to avoid
romantic entanglements.

471
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,138
It was.

472
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,541
You seem entangled.

473
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,510
Look, all of my coworkers think
that we're already involved.

474
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,713
Plus, my boss has made it clear

475
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,281
that he expects
to see him there tonight.

476
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,451
So I'm just keeping up
appearances.

477
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,786
If you say so.

478
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,355
Well, goodnight, Dr. Lori.

479
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,458
Have fun on your not-date.

480
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,416
I'm-I'm so sorry.

481
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,151
- Did I, did I scare you?
- No.

482
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,553
Yes.

483
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,088
Sorry. That was my fault.

484
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,924
I wasn't paying attention.

485
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
You look beautiful.

486
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:25,507
Thank you.

487
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,998
You ready? We can take
a minute if you like.

488
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,033
No. No, no, no. I'm fine.

489
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,517
Okay, we'll...

490
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,307
We need to look convincing,
right?

491
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:38,942
Right.

492
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,079
- That's a lovely bracelet.
- Thank you.

493
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,148
It was a gift.

494
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:07,104
And he told me something
that will forever stay with me.

495
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:14,322
To know others is wisdom.

496
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,780
To know oneself
is enlightenment.

497
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:22,164
I think we're gonna
go to the bar.

498
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,188
It was nice meeting you.

499
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,293
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

500
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,195
Keep track of all the lies.

501
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,230
I prefer to think of them
as characters.

502
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,301
Do women ask you to be
a lot of different things?

503
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,536
Usually doctors, lawyers.

504
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:42,539
And if they wanna tick off
mom and dad at Thanksgiving,

505
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,575
I'm in a band.

506
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,481
Do you ever lose yourself
in all of this?

507
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,684
Sometimes.

508
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:56,420
But not with you.

509
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,455
With you
I feel like I can be myself.

510
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:03,594
I'm glad.

511
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,197
Excuse me, everyone.

512
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:11,034
If you'll join me at the table,
dinner is served.

513
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,338
But right now I need you
to be someone else again.

514
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:19,009
Okay, so I admit,

515
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:22,045
I spent most of the game
in the sand trap.

516
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:24,147
Sir, that course is notorious.

517
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:26,228
Have you ever played
claremont Greens?

518
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,418
Them Greens is smooth
as pool tables.

519
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:30,454
Ooh. I have not.

520
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,956
I'll set up a tee time. Yeah?

521
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,893
- How about this weekend?
- That's a wonderful idea.

522
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,061
Diane, do you play?

523
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:42,766
Um, no. But, well,
I take my son to mini golf.

524
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,404
Diane has a mean short game.

525
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,640
Well, what about you, miles?
Do you play?

526
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,109
Do I play?
Yeah, a little.

527
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,946
What's your handicap?

528
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,381
Ten.

529
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,449
"A little," the man says.

530
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,786
Looks like I found my partner.

531
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,965
I feel like we've met before.

532
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,737
We have. The wine tasting.

533
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:22,272
Before.

534
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,508
I don't think so.

535
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:28,078
You're sure?

536
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,213
I just have one of those faces.

537
00:32:31,795 --> 00:32:33,795
Yeah.

538
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,819
Yeah. That must be it.

539
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,307
Do you need a ride home?

540
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,876
No. No.

541
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:02,179
Honestly, you've done
so much for me already.

542
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,014
It's my pleasure, really.

543
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,150
Lovely party. Lovely.

544
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,252
Goodnight.

545
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:13,357
On second thought,
that'd be great.

546
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:17,461
- Thank you.
- Well, I'm right over here.

547
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,364
Listen, if you're up for it,
I'd love to show you something.

548
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,399
It's one of my favorite places
in the city.

549
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,316
Thanks again for jumping in
on such short notice.

550
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,486
- You really helped me out.
- It was my pleasure.

551
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,621
I like spending time with you.

552
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Can I ask you something?

553
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:52,774
Why do you do this?

554
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,332
I mean, work for
the companionship collective.

555
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:05,909
You know what, I'm sorry,
it's none of my business.

556
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,944
No, it's alright.

557
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:11,982
I lost my wife.

558
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:21,224
And I never got to say goodbye.

559
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:24,061
Truth is, I, I don't know
that I'll ever got over it.

560
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,096
But doing this
just helps me realize

561
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,231
why I should put myself
out there.

562
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,503
You know, I understand.

563
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,975
My husband, Robert,

564
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:41,511
he, he died...

565
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,482
A little over two years ago.

566
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,919
It was all
so very unexpected and...

567
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,494
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's just...

568
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,296
It's my bracelet,

569
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,265
it's pinched me.

570
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:14,478
I feel like we're the same
in certain ways.

571
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:20,684
I know what it's like to have an
idea of what your life will be,

572
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,786
only to have it disappear.

573
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
I keep trying to move on.

574
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:28,892
I keep trying
to put myself out there,

575
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,994
but...

576
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,165
I don't know,
just doesn't seem right.

577
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:44,508
I know Jennifer would want me
to be happy.

578
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:48,912
So I try to start there.

579
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,954
I should probably get you home.

580
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,292
Yeah. You know what,
it's late. I...

581
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:33,434
I always walk a date
to the door.

582
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,859
But this is a fake date,
remember?

583
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,395
Well, fake or not, my mother
raised me to be a gentleman.

584
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,064
You know, for the record,

585
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,867
you don't really have to go
to the golf course this weekend.

586
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:46,614
Is your handicap really a ten?

587
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,672
No, no. It's an eight.

588
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,675
But I just didn't wanna
show anyone up.

589
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,679
Well...

590
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,795
Goodnight, Diane.

591
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,932
Goodnight.

592
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,030
You're gonna see him again?

593
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,569
Um...
Um, I mean, I don't know.

594
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:56,606
I don't really have
a, a work function this month.

595
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,008
I don't think so.

596
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,909
You really like him, don't you?

597
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:02,646
No, I don't. I-I mean...

598
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:06,361
I don't know.

599
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,184
It's okay to have feelings.

600
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,988
It's just, you know,
you did hire him.

601
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:15,058
I don't want you to get hurt.

602
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,397
No, I know.

603
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,967
I think it's great that
you're opening up like this.

604
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,436
You know, I think it's a sign.

605
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,705
A sign for what?

606
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,907
That you're ready
to start dating.

607
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,355
I heard you crushed it
at the partner dinner.

608
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,024
- From who?
- -You know...

609
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,492
I don't reveal my sources.

610
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,594
- Come on.
- Okay.

611
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,629
I overheard Garrett
talking to Betty.

612
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,310
Garrett?

613
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,000
What did he say?

614
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,669
He said you crushed it.

615
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,438
God, I hope so.

616
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,540
Let me tell you,
if I got this promotion,

617
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,642
it would change everything.

618
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,811
You know, Jake and I
are just getting by right now.

619
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,680
It would mean more money,
more flexibility...

620
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:47,050
- You're a shoe-in.
- You think so?

621
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:49,152
No one works as hard as you.

622
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:55,024
And, your boyfriend
seemed to be a hit.

623
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,861
Garrett would not shut up
about his golfing prowess.

624
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,901
You know,
he's not really my boyfriend.

625
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,971
What, too soon for labels?

626
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:11,274
No, I mean, we're not together.

627
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:16,124
Well, have you ever heard
of this place called

628
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,314
the companionship collective?

629
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,016
Ew! The rent-a-date place?

630
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,819
You make it sound so seedy.

631
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:26,334
No, I just,
I just didn't wanna go

632
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,925
to this wine tasting alone,
you know?

633
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,427
And now everyone thinks
that we're together

634
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:33,463
and I just don't wanna
correct anyone.

635
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:36,978
Please don't,
don't say anything.

636
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,002
No. My lips are sealed.

637
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,671
Thanks, Russell.

638
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,043
Diane?

639
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:51,848
You know, next time
you could just ask me.

640
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,961
Diane, update me
on the barkley account.

641
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:08,631
It's right on schedule.

642
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,567
Rumor is, the higher-ups
are getting antsy, sir.

643
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,869
Seems they wanted
their final audit weeks ago.

644
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,171
E-Excuse me.
Rumors from where?

645
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
If Diane is feeling
overwhelmed, sir,

646
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:23,246
I can always take the ball
and run.

647
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,048
This is
an important account, Diane.

648
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,749
You sure you have everything
well in hand?

649
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:29,219
Yes, I've spoken
to the executive director.

650
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,020
And it's not just the audit,
they also want

651
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,689
additional analysis
on market growth.

652
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,525
But still, I'd rather not leave
them hanging too long.

653
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,027
They won't be.
I've got it under control.

654
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:47,570
Okay. Russell,
what's happening with pg&n?

655
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,108
Yeah,
they, um, have been looking

656
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,444
to improve their absorption cost
for the next fiscal year,

657
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,012
and, the numbers
are actually looking like

658
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,114
they're gonna line up.

659
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,393
You don't need to worry.
I've got it under control.

660
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,795
- He has a lot of nerve.
- It's fine.

661
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:15,265
He knows you're more talented,
so he tries to undermine.

662
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,833
Well, he can try,

663
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:18,935
but I'm determined
to not let him get to me.

664
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,821
- Hi.
- Hi.

665
00:42:39,335 --> 00:42:41,335
It's a bad time?

666
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,728
Um, no, no.
I-I just wasn't expecting...

667
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,230
Sorry, let me try this again.

668
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:49,732
- Hi.
- Hi.

669
00:42:49,812 --> 00:42:51,812
So I was cleaning out my car
the other day

670
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,871
and found this.

671
00:42:57,142 --> 00:43:00,209
I can't believe I left this.

672
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:02,478
Y-You know, you didn't have
to drive all this way...

673
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:04,914
No, I know
how much it means to you.

674
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,650
Thank you.

675
00:43:12,468 --> 00:43:14,468
I'm sorry.

676
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,593
So my allergies are acting up.

677
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,295
Yeah, I know what you mean,
I get anywhere near a cat

678
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:20,964
and my eyes
just turn bright red.

679
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:24,968
Um, can I trouble you
for a glass of water?

680
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:27,270
Yeah, of course.
Please, come in.

681
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:30,006
Thank you.

682
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:37,325
I played a little in college.

683
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:40,383
- Until I threw my shoulder out.
- Really?

684
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:42,218
I had a bunch
of minor league offers, too.

685
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,519
- Wow.
- Yeah.

686
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:45,555
- From who?
- A bunch of clubs.

687
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,694
Thank you,
I was telling Jake here

688
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,630
that I went to college
on a baseball scholarship.

689
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:56,499
Yeah. He offered to show me
some pitches. Can he, mom?

690
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:58,668
Yeah. It's no trouble. Really.

691
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:03,217
- Sure.
- Yes! Come on.

692
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,241
I've got an extra glove
in the garage.

693
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,216
Or I can follow through.

694
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,271
Good catch.

695
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:54,590
I think I've read
this same page three times.

696
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:57,760
It's lost all meaning.
Alright. We need a break.

697
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:59,262
My eyes are fine.

698
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,397
Well, it's almost noon.
Let's grab lunch.

699
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,166
You know, i-I'd really
rather stay and finish.

700
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:04,467
- Come on.
- It's okay.

701
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,568
My treat.

702
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,770
Diane, honey!

703
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,972
These just came for you.

704
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:12,241
- My.
- And here's a card.

705
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:18,281
I think you've found a keeper.

706
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,316
Gotta hold on to that.

707
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:26,723
From miles? Your fake date?

708
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:28,769
He stopped by last night
to drop something off.

709
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:30,560
It's nothing.

710
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:32,895
You went on one date, and
he's showing up at your home?

711
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,997
We went out twice.

712
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,568
I guess I didn't realize
it had become real.

713
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:41,838
It's not.

714
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,619
You don't think
it's strange that he'd reach out

715
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,877
to you after you hired him
to go to one event?

716
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:49,712
He didn't reach out to me.

717
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:52,315
I ran into him at Jake's school.

718
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,951
He's part of the, um,
big brother program there.

719
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:58,821
And you believe that?

720
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:00,256
Well, why wouldn't
I believe him?

721
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:01,791
Because he lies for a living!

722
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:04,594
Russell, that's not fair.

723
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,696
What?

724
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,566
Nothing.

725
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,436
Well, you obviously wanna say
something.

726
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,343
I just want you to be careful.

727
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:23,713
- Don't worry. I will be.
- Okay.

728
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,455
Miles?

729
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,891
- Hi. Diane, hey.
- Hi. Hi.

730
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:37,760
What are you doing here?
Are you...

731
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,996
You have
a big brother event today?

732
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,798
No.

733
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,700
Actually, Jake asked me
to come watch his practice.

734
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,803
I hope that's okay.

735
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:50,606
I should have asked you first.

736
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,008
- I wasn't thinking...
- mom! Mom!

737
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:54,088
I struck out three guys
with my slider.

738
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:55,745
- You did?
- Yeah. Did you see?

739
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,780
- Honey, that's amazing.
- You're a natural, buddy.

740
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,616
- You think?
- Yeah, yeah.

741
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,051
Yeah.

742
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,420
Well, I think this calls
for a celebration?

743
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:05,855
- You want some hot dog?
- Yes!

744
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,290
- Yes?
- Can you come?

745
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,624
Um, you know, honey, I'm sure

746
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,059
miles has things he has to do.

747
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,594
Miss out on the celebration?

748
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:13,663
No. Yeah,
I can absolutely come. Yeah.

749
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,598
Yes!

750
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,733
- All right, um, sure. Yeah. No.
- Sure.

751
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,969
That still works.

752
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,772
- It's amazing, sweetie.
- Yeah.

753
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:27,121
I used to do like Sauerkraut.

754
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:29,445
- Sauerkraut. Relish.
- I didn't know...

755
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,415
- I like both...
- Mustard, ketchup, a hot dog.

756
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,617
- Yeah.
- Mustard, ketchup and a hot dog.

757
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,555
- Yeah.
- And a bun, obviously.

758
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,658
It's the office,
I-I gotta take this.

759
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,994
- All right, we'll order.
- It'll just take a minute.

760
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,897
- It's on me. What do you want?
- Whatever you get.

761
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:50,466
- You got it.
- Hello?

762
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,301
<i>Forrestor, Carlisle and Hobbes.</i>

763
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:53,936
Hi, Betty. Um, yes.

764
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,505
I just got a message
saying it was urgent.

765
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,541
Is, Garrett trying to reach me?

766
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,343
<i>Mr. Garrett
already left for the day.</i>

767
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:04,146
<i>It was Kyle.
I'll put you through.</i>

768
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:08,284
Diane, thanks for getting back
to me so quickly.

769
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,518
<i>What's this about?</i>

770
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,887
You know, for the longest time

771
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,855
I-I had trouble placing him.

772
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,825
- Excuse me?
- -<i> Miles.</i>

773
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,895
<i>My sister-in-law, she brought
him to a wedding last summer.</i>

774
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,832
Although, he introduced himself
as Benjamin.

775
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:26,168
- I think you're mistaken.
- No. No.

776
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:29,205
She was very open about using
the companionship collective.

777
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,208
<i>She didn't feel the need to
fool anyone with half-truths.</i>

778
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,310
I wasn't trying to fool anyone.

779
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,545
But you did.

780
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,381
I'm sure Garrett will be
very interested to hear

781
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,183
you've been
actively deceiving him.

782
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,753
Kyle, please don't say anything.

783
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:46,722
You're asking me to lie, Diane?

784
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,525
No, I'm asking you
to be the better person.

785
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,130
I don't believe
that's in my best interest.

786
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:55,665
<i>Wait, Kyle...</i>

787
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:59,201
I do enjoy her company.

788
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:01,237
I hope you like spicy mustard.

789
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:05,552
Is everything okay?

790
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,076
That was Kyle.

791
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,578
Hey, buddy, can you go
grab US come napkins?

792
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,614
Yeah.

793
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:15,229
He knows who you are.

794
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,552
He's planning to use it
against me.

795
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:17,753
- He threatened you?
- Well...

796
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,122
He's gonna go to my boss.

797
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:22,258
I'll lose everything
I worked so hard for.

798
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,394
- Hey, it'll be okay.
- How can you say that?

799
00:49:27,944 --> 00:49:29,944
I'm sorry,
I have to go deal with this...

800
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:30,866
- Let me help.
- No. Really.

801
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,969
There's nothing you can do.

802
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:35,838
Sweetie, let's go.

803
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:52,254
- Don't forget to wash up. Okay?
- I won't.

804
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,727
Hey, mom, thanks for inviting
miles for my practice today.

805
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,829
He really helped my pitch.

806
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,165
- You didn't invite him?
- No.

807
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,672
Morning.

808
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,043
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey.

809
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,045
Um, is Garrett in?

810
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,715
Yeah, in his office.
He was looking for you earlier.

811
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,385
Okay. Thanks.

812
00:50:58,334 --> 00:51:00,334
Good luck.

813
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,358
Sir.

814
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,494
You wanted to see me?

815
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,731
Yeah. Come on in. Have a seat.

816
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:15,137
So I've been hoping to have
a little chat, you and I.

817
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,740
Have you given much thought
to your future?

818
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,545
- My future?
- Here at the company.

819
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,514
- Did you talk to Kyle?
- No.

820
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,684
I thought
I would speak to you first.

821
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,253
I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

822
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:34,890
and I think you would be
an ideal candidate for partner.

823
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,926
Partner?

824
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:43,599
I have been very impressed
with your work around here.

825
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:46,869
You've become invaluable
in a very short time

826
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:49,038
and I think
that you've earned it.

827
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:50,873
Thank you very much.

828
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:52,908
I-I don't even know what to say.

829
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:55,111
Well, thank you is a good start.

830
00:51:57,726 --> 00:51:59,726
- Thank you again.
- All right.

831
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,150
Now get out of here
and do some work.

832
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:03,252
Yes.

833
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,963
Miles, hi.

834
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:16,232
<i>Hey.
Just calling to check in.</i>

835
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,934
You were just pretty upset
yesterday when you left.

836
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,603
I-Is everything okay?

837
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,905
Yes. Thank you.

838
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,407
I-I appreciate that.

839
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:28,944
Actually, I got the promotion.

840
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,713
<i>I guess
Kyle didn't say anything.</i>

841
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,082
That's great, Diane.

842
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:35,151
We should celebrate.

843
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:36,986
Um, you know, a-actually,

844
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:38,654
I don't think
that's a good idea.

845
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:40,055
<i>I think we owe it to ourselves</i>

846
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,158
<i>to see where this could go,
right?</i>

847
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,495
Take a chance with me, Diane.

848
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:51,634
Tsk. Okay. When?

849
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:55,271
You get lunch at 12:00, right?
Meet me at the park.

850
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:57,606
- Front entrance?
- <i>-I'll see you there.</i>

851
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:05,481
Hey.

852
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,024
Gotta make this quick, buddy.
I have a date.

853
00:53:17,173 --> 00:53:19,173
- Was that miles?
- Yeah, it was.

854
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:21,357
I was talking with Betty.
Her son's a grade above Jake.

855
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:25,134
She said miles isn't a part
of the big brother program.

856
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:27,603
- I don't understand.
- He's not being honest with you.

857
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,438
I'm sure
there's an innocent explanation.

858
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,839
I'll ask him when I see him.

859
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,142
I know it's not my place
to say anything,

860
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:34,643
but I think you should stay away
from this guy.

861
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,146
You're right.
It isn't your place.

862
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:49,191
So I'm just a little confused.

863
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:53,128
Betty told me that you aren't
part of the big brother program

864
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:55,564
at school,
she said that there's no miles.

865
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,467
I have to tell you something,
and it's...

866
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:03,973
I don't know how you're gonna
take this, but,

867
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,709
the agency insists
we use false names.

868
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,547
False names?

869
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,951
So you're not a miles
or a Benjamin.

870
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:17,386
No.

871
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,088
That's why Betty was confused

872
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,823
because she didn't know
your real name.

873
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,391
I'm sorry for the deception.

874
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,560
The, but the agency
just has really strict policies

875
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,329
on what we share with clients.

876
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:30,199
Clients?

877
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:35,004
I thought
we were becoming friends. I...

878
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,442
Are you still
just playing a part with me?

879
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:42,478
No. Not anymore.

880
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,718
I-I'm sorry. I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

881
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,654
No, I should have, I should have
told you on our second date.

882
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:55,324
That-that's when I knew there
was something real between US.

883
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:58,360
I'm Peter. Peter dwyer.

884
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:05,034
You see, it's my real name.

885
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,141
Please stay.

886
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,219
What are you looking for?

887
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:27,089
Ideally, a fourth for golf.

888
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,411
Gotcha.

889
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:55,529
I guess
that when it comes to dating,

890
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:58,354
I'm a little out of practice.

891
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,990
Well, you went through
a traumatic event.

892
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,059
It takes time.

893
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,799
It must have been very hard.

894
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,970
It was.

895
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,575
It still is. I...

896
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:34,556
You know, I don't even sleep in
the same bedroom since he died.

897
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:40,362
I sleep in the guest bedroom.

898
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:46,502
I haven't told anyone that.

899
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,840
I'm glad you trust me.

900
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,619
My wife...

901
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:07,790
She had been working late
all week.

902
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,825
It was a big project.

903
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:13,495
She loved her job.

904
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,680
She should have called me,
but she didn't.

905
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:23,372
And she wrapped her car
around a tree going 50.

906
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,810
She died instantly.

907
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:37,364
I know that we got off
to a rocky start,

908
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:39,588
but I want you to know that
I've been more real with you

909
00:57:39,612 --> 00:57:43,158
than anyone since my wife died.

910
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:46,094
And I've been wanting to share
myself with you for a while now.

911
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:53,502
Thank you for hearing me.

912
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:59,074
I like being with you.
You make me happy.

913
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:02,744
And I just haven't had that
for a long time.

914
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:11,186
- Russell, what...
- he's not who you think he is.

915
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:13,255
- Who?
- Your companion.

916
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,791
It's all been one big lie.
His name isn't even miles.

917
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,726
When I tried to hire him,
they told me his name was Greg.

918
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:20,562
- When you tried to hire him?
- I was worried about you.

919
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:23,098
That gives you no right
to insert yourself like this.

920
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:27,536
And his name isn't even Greg
or miles.

921
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,671
It's Peter dwyer, actually.

922
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:34,076
- He told you?
- Yes.

923
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,945
It's agency policy
to use fake names.

924
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:39,248
Okay, but he let you think

925
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,350
he was a completely different
person for weeks.

926
00:58:41,452 --> 00:58:44,052
- And you're just okay with that?
- Well, at first, of course not.

927
00:58:44,076 --> 00:58:46,889
But now that he's told me
the truth...

928
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:50,292
If he's lying about his name,
what else is he lying about?

929
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:21,423
Hey, mom?

930
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:25,694
Can I, um, talk to you
about dad?

931
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:34,036
Of course, honey. What is it?

932
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,405
Um, so we have, like,

933
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,609
this presentation at-at school

934
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:44,112
and, we, like, have to

935
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:47,649
talk about someone
that we look up to.

936
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,718
And I wanna talk about dad.

937
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:54,723
Honey, I think
that's really lovely.

938
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:59,761
- When is it due?
- Not until next week.

939
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:05,801
But when you're ready,
we can talk about it, okay?

940
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:15,344
That's your school bus.

941
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:18,580
- You got everything?
- Yeah.

942
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,415
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

943
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:21,783
Have a good day, sweetie.

944
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,885
- Bye.
- Bye.

945
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:28,216
- Hello?
- -<i> Hey!</i>

946
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:32,754
I had a really great time
the other day.

947
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:37,159
I'm really glad that I was able
to open up to you like that.

948
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:41,029
I just haven't been able
to do that with anyone else.

949
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:44,900
And I was hoping that you would
let me take you out again.

950
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:49,571
I don't,
I don't know, miles. I...

951
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:53,875
Did I do something?

952
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:56,178
No, no. I just, I...

953
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,060
The timing's wrong.

954
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:02,884
What does that mean?

955
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,754
I think you of all people
would understand.

956
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:07,823
Come on, please, just...

957
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,860
Don't give up on this.

958
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:16,431
Look, I, I thought I was ready,
but I'm-I'm just, I'm not.

959
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:18,133
<i>- Diane...</i>
- I'm sorry.

960
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,334
<i>Just let me...</i>

961
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:20,635
Lis...

962
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,671
God!

963
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,063
Knock, knock.

964
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,668
It's an apology.

965
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:55,837
I had no right
to talk about your love life.

966
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,141
But?

967
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:02,310
No but. I'm sorry.

968
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,382
Thank you.

969
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:13,722
You know, just so you know,
I ended it.

970
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:17,259
Really?

971
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,561
What kind of relationship
starts on a lie?

972
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,870
My grandparents
lied to each other for years.

973
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:34,142
- Like your tie.
- Thank you.

974
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,244
That's the truth.

975
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:50,692
Hey.

976
01:03:50,872 --> 01:03:52,872
Miles.

977
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:55,330
What are you doing here?

978
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:58,033
You're not answering
my phone calls.

979
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:00,202
Right. I thought
I made myself clear.

980
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:01,670
I thought you felt the same way
as me.

981
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:05,373
Look, so did I, but I...
I'm sorry. It's just...

982
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,708
Hey, come on.
We'll just, we'll go inside.

983
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:07,776
- We'll talk about this.
- No, please.

984
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:09,644
Just... I can't.

985
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:11,213
So what,
you're just gonna end it?

986
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:12,614
Because I thought
we were being honest

987
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,916
with each other,
I was connecting with Jake...

988
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:17,052
Hey! Leave Jake out of this.

989
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:18,587
- Okay?
- No, I'm sorry. Hey.

990
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,056
Listen,
I told you everything about me.

991
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:22,557
No, I actually don't know
who you are.

992
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:24,626
- What else do you want from me?
- Miles, stop.

993
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,127
- Miles, stop.
- Diane!

994
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:27,929
Stop!

995
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:29,965
Is everything okay?

996
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:38,273
What was that?

997
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:41,042
Let's just go inside, Lori.

998
01:04:55,325 --> 01:05:00,128
Okay, it doesn't look
like he took anything, so...

999
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:01,763
Do you really think
he was inside?

1000
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:03,465
I don't know, but I never leave

1001
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
that front door open.

1002
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:08,615
- Could it have been Jake?
- No, no.

1003
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:11,239
He's spending the night
at a friend's house.

1004
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,642
How much do you know
about this guy, anyway?

1005
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,277
Well, at this point,
I have no idea.

1006
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:17,579
All right.

1007
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,881
Let's find out exactly
who we're dealing with.

1008
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,454
Let's see who you really are,
Peter dwyer.

1009
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,527
That's apparently a common name.

1010
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,476
He said his wife's name
was Jennifer

1011
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,567
and that she died
in a-a car accident.

1012
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:43,638
Bingo. Okay.

1013
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:47,175
"Couple involved in car
accident. Husband survives.

1014
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,512
Suspicious circumstances
surrounding the accident."

1015
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:54,683
He-he said
she was driving home alone.

1016
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:56,351
Do you want me
to stay here tonight?

1017
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:58,219
No, no. I'm-I'm okay.

1018
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:00,188
I don't think
you should be alone tonight.

1019
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:02,223
Let's go to dinner.

1020
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,259
Okay.

1021
01:06:14,382 --> 01:06:16,382
What are the police doing here?

1022
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:19,107
They're asking questions
about Kyle.

1023
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:22,188
Is he okay?

1024
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,412
He's been missing
for a few days.

1025
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:26,848
His girlfriend filed
a police report this morning.

1026
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:42,709
He came to my house yesterday.

1027
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,165
What?

1028
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:45,667
When I told him I didn't wanna
see him anymore,

1029
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,202
he didn't take it well.

1030
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,237
Diane.

1031
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,540
He was there when Kyle called.

1032
01:06:54,578 --> 01:06:56,745
He knew Kyle threatened me.

1033
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,681
Do you really think he's capable
of hurting someone?

1034
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:01,716
No.

1035
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:04,152
I-I don't know.

1036
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,567
Everything I thought
I knew about this person

1037
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:09,891
turned out to be a lie.
I mean...

1038
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:11,693
Who did I let into my life?

1039
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:14,062
Maybe it's time we take this
to the police.

1040
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:16,231
And say what, the man I hired

1041
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:18,166
to be someone else
turned out to be someone else?

1042
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:20,268
If you think he possibly
had anything to do

1043
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:22,570
with Kyle's disappearance,
we have to, don't we?

1044
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:28,176
I'm gonna be late.
I have to pick up Jake.

1045
01:07:43,994 --> 01:07:47,262
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

1046
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:49,731
Your mom asked me
to come pick you up today.

1047
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:51,232
Um, she didn't mention it.

1048
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:53,334
It probably slipped her mind.

1049
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,150
Doesn't sound like her.

1050
01:07:57,174 --> 01:08:00,975
Well, you know
how busy she's been.

1051
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:03,278
You hungry?
You wanna get some hot dogs?

1052
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:06,948
- Come on.
- All right.

1053
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:08,983
All right.

1054
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,656
I think it'd be good if they put
cheese in the hot dog...

1055
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:39,080
Got that fly ball.

1056
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:41,994
- Betty, hey.
- Hey.

1057
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:44,619
Hey, h-have you seen Jake?
Is he still here? Wh...

1058
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:47,055
No. He already left.

1059
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:49,691
- With who?
- With miles.

1060
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,661
You didn't know?

1061
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:56,231
I-I'm sorry, Betty. I-I...

1062
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:59,701
Diane!

1063
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:04,339
Come on.

1064
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:05,940
Of course,
I spoke to the police.

1065
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,642
They told me to just stay home

1066
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:09,077
and wait for them to contact me,

1067
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:11,179
but I don't know
how I'm supposed to stand...

1068
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:15,583
- <i>Diane?</i>
- Let me call you back.

1069
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:17,685
<i>Why? Wait.</i>

1070
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:24,871
Jake.

1071
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,195
Sweetie.

1072
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:29,264
- Sorry, it slipped.
- God.

1073
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:30,832
You're here.

1074
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,001
- Yeah?
- Honey.

1075
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:35,503
What were you thinking
taking a ride from miles?

1076
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:38,173
He said that you told him
to pick me up.

1077
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,675
What's the matter?
I thought you liked him.

1078
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,810
Honey,
that has nothing to do with it.

1079
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:45,313
Why are you freaking out
about this?

1080
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:47,815
Honey, I need you to promise me

1081
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:49,684
that you will never go anywhere
with anyone

1082
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:50,985
unless I give you permission.

1083
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,087
- Okay?
- Okay.

1084
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:57,192
- I mean it.
- Okay.

1085
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:02,430
Sorry, sweetie.
I'm just worried about you.

1086
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:08,069
Did miles say anything to you?

1087
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:10,104
Like what?

1088
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:13,608
I don't know.
Anything strange?

1089
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:15,543
You're the only one
being strange right now, mom.

1090
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,579
Miles is really cool.

1091
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:29,557
Yes. I am very relieved.
Thank you, officer.

1092
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,596
- Danny's here.
- Have everything you need?

1093
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:36,397
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Pajamas? Toothbrush?

1094
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:39,067
- Mom, I gotta go.
- Listen, just...

1095
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:40,568
I know things have been hard.

1096
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:42,770
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

1097
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:43,972
- Okay?
- Okay.

1098
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:46,040
Whenever you need.

1099
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:48,142
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

1100
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,647
- All right.
- Okay.

1101
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:55,450
- Bye, sweetie.
- Okay, bye.

1102
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,125
Hey, Jake.

1103
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:33,254
Lori.

1104
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,023
Yes, he's fine.

1105
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:37,692
He's fine. My god.

1106
01:11:37,972 --> 01:11:39,972
What about a restraining order?

1107
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,229
I've already filed a complaint

1108
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:42,697
with the police.

1109
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:43,798
I mean, aside from picking

1110
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:44,866
my son up from school,

1111
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,868
he hasn't really done anything.

1112
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:49,103
He lied about who he is.

1113
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:51,439
He threatened you.

1114
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,975
He lied about how his wife died.

1115
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:57,490
Yeah, but we don't have
any evidence.

1116
01:11:57,514 --> 01:12:01,616
He's dangerous.
It's escalating behavior.

1117
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,519
At the very least, call
the companionship collective.

1118
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:07,166
Lodge a complaint.

1119
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:09,190
Let them know
what's been going on.

1120
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,561
You're right.

1121
01:12:23,284 --> 01:12:25,284
Hello?

1122
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:28,376
Hi, yes.
This is Diane Cooper.

1123
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:33,047
Um, I've been seeing
one of your companions, miles,

1124
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:36,184
and, I need to speak
to your supervisor

1125
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:38,219
about him right away.

1126
01:12:44,005 --> 01:12:46,005
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay,

1127
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,929
especially with Jake being gone?

1128
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:51,032
- No, really, I'm fine.
- I can cancel my study group.

1129
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:54,035
- They'll understand.
- Absolutely not.

1130
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,670
I'll see you at brunch tomorrow.
Okay?

1131
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,705
Okay.

1132
01:12:58,853 --> 01:13:00,853
Goodnight, sis.

1133
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,877
Goodnight.

1134
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:23,291
Robert?

1135
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:26,027
I'm right here.

1136
01:14:49,664 --> 01:14:51,664
I dreamt you went away.

1137
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,688
I would never leave you.

1138
01:15:02,977 --> 01:15:04,977
No, no, we don't have
to fight it any longer.

1139
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,567
What are you doing here?

1140
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:09,303
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1141
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:12,106
I know you've been scared
of moving on.

1142
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:14,208
That's why
we couldn't be together.

1143
01:15:20,628 --> 01:15:22,628
I gave you a fresh start,
you don't have

1144
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:24,118
to be trapped by the past
anymore, Diane.

1145
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:25,686
- Please, just let me go. Please.
- It's me.

1146
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:28,189
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1147
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,994
It's okay. It's okay.

1148
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,462
You did all this for me?

1149
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,797
For US.

1150
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:40,635
Not just that. You...
God. Kyle...

1151
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:45,106
He threatened you.

1152
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:48,309
So you took care of it for me.

1153
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:50,411
I did.

1154
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:59,921
Okay.

1155
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,390
Okay.

1156
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,559
Okay.

1157
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:07,028
You're right.

1158
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:11,365
I thought
I wasn't ready to move on,

1159
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:13,401
but I...

1160
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:17,038
You deserve some honesty.

1161
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:22,944
Okay.

1162
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,285
So here it is.

1163
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,394
Sometimes I hate him...

1164
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:44,565
My husband...

1165
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,303
For leaving me behind.

1166
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:56,911
He said it was forever,
and here I am, alone.

1167
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:59,213
You're not alone.
You're not.

1168
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,459
Did you feel that way
with your wife?

1169
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:14,929
No.

1170
01:17:15,242 --> 01:17:17,242
Okay.

1171
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:19,367
I guess you're a better person
than I am.

1172
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,974
You really loved her.

1173
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,510
I did.

1174
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,415
Did she even appreciate you?

1175
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,724
Did she even know
how lucky she was

1176
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,861
to have you
and all of your devotion?

1177
01:17:50,845 --> 01:17:52,845
Did she lie to you, Peter?

1178
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,869
Don't call me that.

1179
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:58,773
Did she break promises
with you, Peter?

1180
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:02,643
She said she loved me...

1181
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:06,247
But she was betraying me.

1182
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:09,383
And when I found out,
I had to do something about it.

1183
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:12,965
So you confronted her.

1184
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:15,990
Didn't even deny it.

1185
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:20,394
I told her we could work through
it, but she just... laughed.

1186
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:24,265
She was gonna walk out on me,
on our life.

1187
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:30,738
I couldn't let that happen.

1188
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,043
I understand.

1189
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:45,519
We let all these people in
just so they can disappoint US.

1190
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,230
I know why you did it...

1191
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:59,033
Why you killed her.

1192
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,068
I had to.

1193
01:19:06,876 --> 01:19:08,876
It will be different with US.

1194
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,585
Yes, it will.

1195
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,920
Wait, wait.

1196
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,890
Let me just freshen up.

1197
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,360
I just, I want this moment
to be perfect.

1198
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:39,707
Why don't you find
something for US to listen to?

1199
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:42,409
Of course.

1200
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,628
Is everything okay in there?

1201
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:36,297
Um, yeah.

1202
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,233
You know, I just remembered

1203
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:42,203
that my, um, sister's
coming over for breakfast today

1204
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:43,537
and I...

1205
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:46,307
I...

1206
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,710
Can't wait to meet her.

1207
01:20:52,982 --> 01:20:57,918
I just don't want her
to interrupt US.

1208
01:20:58,054 --> 01:21:00,254
We need to start building trust
again, Diane.

1209
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:03,157
Can we do that?

1210
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,160
Of course.

1211
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,466
I'm so glad
you've come into my life.

1212
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,873
Everything is wonderful now
since I've met you.

1213
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,920
Stop! Get off me, get off me!

1214
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:41,362
- I thought you loved me!
- Get off me, you psychopath!

1215
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:53,407
- Lori!
- What?

1216
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:55,142
- What happened?
- I-I... miles.

1217
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:56,644
He-he broke in last night.
I-I just...

1218
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:58,312
I-I just knocked him out, I...

1219
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:00,447
- Call 9-1-1.
- Okay.

1220
01:22:02,696 --> 01:22:04,696
I'm gonna go check.

1221
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,186
Okay, Lori, wait.
