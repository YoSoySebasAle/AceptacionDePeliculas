this is what we can sell with our

32
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,012
new development in Australia.

33
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:52,094
Sun, beaches, lifeguards, pretty girls.

34
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:55,754
Mullet Beach has everything that we need.

35
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:58,652
I really think we should
move on this, Father.

36
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,196
- Do you know what this is, Son?

37
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:02,060
- Mud.

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,935
- Right, do you know what

39
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,835
you can make with it?

40
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:05,907
- [Bobby] A mess?

41
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,369
- Bricks, mud bricks.

42
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:09,202
- [Bobby] Bricks?

43
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,918
- One day, we could build a whole resort

44
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:13,867
out of mud, organic natural materials,

45
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:16,108
like an extension of the earth.

46
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:16,941
- Yes, sure.

47
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:18,528
Now Australia and Mullet Beach,

48
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:19,361
I really think that we--

49
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,393
- I think you'd better leave, Bobby.

50
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,576
Mike looks a little bit tired.

51
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:25,243
I'll look after him.

52
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:27,933
- Yes, sure, okay.

53
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,272
I'll get back to you
later on this, Father,

54
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,451
when you're done playing

55
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,372

(whimsical music)

57
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:41,155
- Time for a little drinky.

58
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,160
Feeling any younger?

59
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,061
- All the time.

60
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,520
- I know a lot of fun things that we

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,020

- Bobby.

69
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:38,204
Have you seen your father?

70
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:40,471
- [Bobby] Yes, he seems
a little preoccupied.

71
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,503
- I know.

72
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:45,184
There's no way we can let
him address this crowd.

73
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,630
God knows what he'd say,

74
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,969
you'll have to do it.

75
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,367
And by the way, have you told your father

76
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,945
you're going to Australia?

77
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:52,112
- No, not yet.

78
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:55,588
- I'll take care of your father.

79
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:56,505
Mr. McCain,

80
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:58,842
let's sit down,

81
00:04:58,842 --> 00:04:59,913
you look tired.

82
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,080
- Whatever you say.

83
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,365
- I hope you're keeping up
Mr. McCain's medication.

84
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:06,910
- Religiously, Richard, religiously.

85
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,903
- Ever think of the sun, Richard?

86
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,288
- You mean Bobby, Mr. McCain?

87
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:11,123
- No, not my son,

88
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:13,363
the sun, up there.

89
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,657
You ever think about it?

90
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:16,740
- Uh, no, can't say I do.

91
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,746
- A lot of energy up there, Richard.

92
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:22,329
All the energy we'll ever need.

93
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,162
- Excuse me, please.

94
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,525
If there's any shit off those greenies,

95
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,192
you know what to do.

96
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,818
Welcome, distinguished guests,

97
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:41,833
ladies and gentlemen, to the opening of

98
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,503
McCain World Resort here in Los Angeles.

99
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:48,139
(audience applause)

100
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,307
Now as you can see, the award-winning

101
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,291
McCain architects are in tune with

102
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,134
today's requirements.

103
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:57,115
(group laughs)
(heckling)

104
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,793
McCain architects have blended the

105
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,515
oblique lines of this resort into

106
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:02,900
the surrounding habitat.

107
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
- Yeah, who'd you bribe?

108
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,484
- I would now like you all to

109
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:10,615
join me and put your hands together

110
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:12,435
for the son of the developer of this

111
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:15,602
magnificent complex, Mr. Bobby McCain.

112
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:20,348
(audience applause)

113
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,311
- Go back home.

114
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,248
- I'd like to welcome you
all, ladies and gentlemen,

115
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,116
on behalf of my father to the latest

116
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:29,739
McCain's World resort.

117
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,929
We at McCain's believe
that developments like

118
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:34,407
this one are an asset to the community.

119
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:36,194
- Yeah, and wreck them.

120
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:37,868
- There are those who disagree with

121
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:38,852
what we do,

122
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:39,940
- [Man] Hey, back off, buddy.

123
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,381
- But we feel that it is our duty

124
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:45,160
to realize the world's
potential beauty spots.

125
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,054
That's why we're about to break ground

126
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:49,570
on two new resorts, one
at North Beach, Hawaii,

127
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,159
and the other one in Australia.

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,552
So I'd like you all to
take out your checkbooks,

129
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:57,427
and let's invest in the future.

130
00:06:57,427 --> 00:07:00,265
(audience applause)

131
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:02,603
To you all, I would like to say

132
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:05,186
aloha, and good day, thank you.

133
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:08,986
(applause)

134
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,485
(group chatting)

135
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,006
- Your speech was good,

136
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:16,527
I didn't think you had it in you.

137
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:17,360
- There's of me that

138
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,474
you don't know about.

139
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:21,412
- Like being an exchange
lifeguard, for instance?

140
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:22,581
- I can pull it off,

141
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,474
have you arranged everything, the trials?

142
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:25,688
- It's done, Bobby, you'll win.

143
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:26,521
- Good.

144
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,152
- You will be the exchange lifeguard

145
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:29,608
on that plane to Australia,

146
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,524
even if you can't swim a stroke.

147
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:32,382
- I can swim.

148
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:33,865
- I heard.

149
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,100
- Excuse me, I'm going to

150
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,609
go check on my father.

151
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:40,341
- Stop annoying him, we need him.

152
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,174
- For now.

153
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:43,724
That little jerk bugs me.

154
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:46,235
You taking care of the old man?

155
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:48,838
- Don't you worry about big Mike McCain.

156
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:49,671
- Energy!

157
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,862
- Little Donna has got him

158
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:53,735
right where she wants him.

159
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,313
- He keeps acting this crazy,

160
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:56,721
we'll get control of the company before

161
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,662
those pills of yours finish him off.

162
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:00,465
(giggling)

163
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:03,298
(whimsical music)

164
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,157
(air whooshing)

165
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:17,858
- Father,

166
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,936
- Bobby, take a look at this.

167
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:22,268
If we incorporated a few wind generators

168
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,589
on the Australian site,
we could save up to--

169
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,323
- That's what I want to talk to you about.

170
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:29,165
- Good, wind could be the whole key.

171
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,248
- No, not wind, Australia.

172
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:32,831
- Australia, great place,

173
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,638
can't wait to get back there.

174
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,559
- I think I should go instead of you.

175
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,231
I can lock up the Mullet Beach deal while

176
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,394
you stay here and play with your mud and

177
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,082
your wind, or work with them, and stuff.

178
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,098
I know how much you like Australia,

179
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:45,931
- Good idea.

180
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,458
- But I really feel that I can, what?

181
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,264
- Good idea, you go to Australia,

182
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,163
it's just what you need, a trip down under

183
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,513
will do you good.

184
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:55,185
- It's not a vacation.

185
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:56,553
- I realize you'll be working,

186
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:58,288
but Australia's a funny place.

187
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,109
It changes people, and I figure,

188
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,750
you need a change.

189
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,278
- What, there's nothing wrong with me.

190
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,976
- I know that,

191
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,992
I love those people, love 'em so much,

192
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:09,428
I married one.

193
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,567
- Not that we ever hear from her.

194
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,216
- Hey kid, don't go blaming your mother,

195
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,116
it was my fault that we broke up.

196
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:16,841
I figure if I had stayed in Australia,

197
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,179
your mother and I might still be together.

198
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,096
But, that's the way the wind blows.

199
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,743
- [Announcer] Good day,

200
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:29,493
Australia, Flight 115
now ready for boarding,

201
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,850
- Time for your candy, Mike.

202
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,668
- Oh, thank you.

203
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:37,065
You know, I think Bobby
going is a great idea,

204
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:40,481
but I don't like this
pretend lifeguard business.

205
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,296
If the people at Mullet Beach figure out

206
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:43,487
they're being had?

207
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:44,406
- Don't worry, they're just a

208
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:45,646
bunch of dumb hicks.

209
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:46,845
- I don't think so.

210
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:49,677
- Mike, it is a legitimate
business tactic.

211
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:51,576
You used to do the same thing yourself.

212
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,690
Remember the time on our riviera deal?

213
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,099
You pretended to be a movie star.

214
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,057
- I don't do that anymore,

215
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,560
that was a long time ago.

216
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,773
- Now your contacts are
Al and Clint Eastman.

217
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,178
- Contacts, Al and Clint Eastman.

218
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:02,011
- From Red Beach.

219
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:02,874
- From Red Beach.

220
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,506
- Now, the Mullet Beach Surf Club

221
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,391
don't know your real name, to them you're

222
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,270
Bobby Carter, okay?

223
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,603
- Don't know my real
name, I am Bobby Carter.

224
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:10,436
Bobby Carter.

225
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,269
- They don't know who you are,

226
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:12,222
so try and keep it that way,

227
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:13,444
and if you have any problems, call me,

228
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:14,346
and do try and call your mother,

229
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,622
I know she'd love to hear from you.

230
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:17,770
- And did you pack my
teddy bear to protect me?

231
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,520
- No, I packed these.

232
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:21,414
- Rubbers?

233
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,707
- Yes, if you're going to lay anything,

234
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:24,557
lay rubber first.

235
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,853
- I want the community to work with us.

236
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:28,270
- They will, they will,

237
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,461
leave it to me.

238
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,816
Leave it to Bobby.

239
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:31,649
- Goodbye.

240
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:35,582
- Good luck.

241
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:36,655
- Thank you very much.

242
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:38,520
Keep an eye on the old man, will you?

243
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,990
- Oh, we will, we will.

244
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,803
- Here's a little Aussie good luck charm.

245
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:43,886
- Oh, thanks.

246
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,085
- Oh, and me and the little lady

247
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,827
want you to have this.

248
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,798
For protection, here,

249
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,381
here's another one.

250
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,445
- Thanks.

251
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,141
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,

252
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,503
goodbye Helen, thank you very much.

253
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:01,466
Goodbye father.

254
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:02,605
- Bye bye, Bobby.

255
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:03,688
- Bye, Bobby.

256
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,008
(clapping)

257
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,255
- [Announcer] All right
boys, and the final

258
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,826
check this afternoon for the beach race,

259
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:11,775
the exchange lifeguard field race final,

260
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:13,547
kindly sponsored by our

261
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,784
Prince Slop of Slappers Cancer Council,

262
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:19,479
the competitors are
competing for these trophies.

263
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,772
They have been donated by our friends

264
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:23,855
at the Red Beach council.

265
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:28,922
- I don't get it, Clint.

266
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,781
Why am I dressing up as a shark?

267
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:31,994
- So that all the victims in the

268
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,738
beltways will think that
you're a real shark,

269
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:35,575
and they'll swim in.

270
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,867
- Why?

271
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,060
- So that they'll get disqualified.

272
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,855
Well, except the chap from Mullet Beach,

273
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:43,565
he wouldn't know a shark if he met one.

274
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:44,398
- What?

275
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:46,011
- And of course, the winners of this will

276
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,398
spend three months at Malibu as an

277
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:49,339
exchange lifeguard at Malibu,

278
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:51,224
and let's hear it now for our finalists

279
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,638
here this afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

280
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,833
(scattered applause)

281
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,955
- Look, Tim, Tim,

282
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:58,459
just act like a shark.

283
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,688
That way, Mullet Beach will win,

284
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:02,501
even though they're the worst team.

285
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,177
- Oh, we want Mullet Beach to win?

286
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:05,427
- That's right.

287
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:07,891
- Uh, why?

288
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:09,858
- Tim, Tim.

289
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,836
Just act like a shark,

290
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:13,900
that's all you have to do.

291
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,438
I've got to be in the race, remember?

292
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:17,271
Just act like a shark.

293
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:24,465
- And of course, the Red Beach team

294
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:26,352
with my nephew Clint Eastman,

295
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:28,666
being the champion of
last year's challenge,

296
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,714
where are you, Clint?

297
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:31,031
(scattered applause)

298
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:32,434
Hey, it doesn't matter, he'll be here

299
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:33,389
for the start.

300
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,472
(splash)

301
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:48,093
And of course, we have Rusty Mullet

302
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:50,023
from Milton Beach.

303
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:52,658
Rusty Milton from Mullet,
I beg your pardon.

304
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:54,767
I beg your pardon, slip
of the tongue there.

305
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:57,381
Let's have a round of applause for them.

306
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:59,824
All right, that's more like.

307
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:02,074
(mumbling)

308
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,871
I'd like you to take now to the beautiful

309
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:16,849
pride of the owner there,

310
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:18,414
the Mullet Beach Surf Club club

311
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:19,829
and here are some of the competitors,

312
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,468
Hammerhead Hogan from the Gulf Coast,

313
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,134
and Butch Parson from Lyle Beach,

314
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,010
who will be up there to relieve him,

315
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,843
go boys!

316
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:28,426
(upbeat music)

317
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,846
- C'mon Kylie, go!

318
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:41,596
(crowd cheering)

319
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,998
- And the Red Beach team
way, way, way out in front,

320
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,831
by five or six meters.

321
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,999
- [Man] Shark!

322
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,029
It's a shark, everybody!

323
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,917
(splashing)

324
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,252
Swim, there's a shark!

325
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,375
- What's this, the victims are coming in,

326
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,661
that's got to be a disqualification,

327
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:40,007
the victims are coming
in, there's gotta be.

328
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:42,340
(splashing)

329
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:48,624
- [Man] Shark!

330
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,957
(splashing)

331
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:08,566
- Shark!

332
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,651
- What's that?

333
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:14,739
That's a shark, look!

334
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:17,143
(splashing)

335
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:20,917
(crowd reacting in surprise)

336
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,584
(siren wailing)

337
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,256
(Al yelling)

338
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:38,211
(splashing)

339
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,806
(cheering)

340
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,067
- [Al] The only ones
that can win the race!

341
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:56,817
(crowd cheering)

342
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:06,109
- Okay, ladies and gentleman,

343
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:08,290
put your hands together for our own

344
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,364
Mullet Beach champ, Mr. Rusty Milton!

345
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:13,367
(crowd cheering)

346
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,534
(cheerful rock music)

347
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,494
- Congratulations, Mick.

348
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:30,559
Who would have thought old Rusty

349
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,594
had it in him, eh?

350
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:33,320
- Strange world, isn't it?

351
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,208
- But it's not gonna make any difference,

352
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,966
you and your club are past chance.

353
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,560
Rusty might have dragged the group to

354
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,130
the states, but you're
still a very distant last

355
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,016
in the championships.

356
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:44,428
In fact, one more result like that,

357
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:45,775
and you're out of the

358
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,410
Certified Surfing Association for good.

359
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,861
That would be a pity.

360
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:55,010
- Is this you or your
uncle speaking, Clint?

361
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,215
- You're wasting your time, Mick.

362
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,048
- You had your chance.

363
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,002
Watch your back.

364
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:05,324
- Watch my back, will you?

365
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:21,741
(radio chatter)

366
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,491
(crowd chatting)

367
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,642
- Mullet Beach?

368
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:27,475
- [Driver] Mullet?

369
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:28,438
- Mullet Beach, yeah.

370
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,124
- [Driver] Mullet, yeah, sure, sure.

371
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:30,957
- Do you know where it is?

372
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:32,003
- Yeah, yeah.

373
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:33,304
First time in Australia, mate?

374
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:34,518
- Yeah, why?

375
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:35,751
- Fine, no, no worries,

376
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:38,040
no worries, Mullet Beach, here we come.

377
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,290
Please, hop in.

378
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,079
- I think we're here.

379
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:09,177
Yeah.

380
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:10,184
- Oh, right.

381
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,271
- I told you mate, it's off the coast, eh?

382
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,354
- How much do I owe you?

383
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,296
- On the meter.

384
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,774
- Six hundred and twenty-three bucks?

385
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:22,904
- All right, we'll make
it an even 850, eh?

386
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:24,114
- Excuse me?

387
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, bridge toll.

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,452
Besides, I thought you guys were

389
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,745
supposed to be big tippers?

390
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:32,271
- Oh, you sure 850's enough?

391
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:33,542
- Eh?

392
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,090
- Look, I'll tell you what,

393
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,163
how about this?

394
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:37,638
I'm a bit of a gambling man.

395
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:38,662
- Oh, yeah?

396
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:40,328
- Look, one of yours, okay?

397
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,425
What do you say we flip this coin,

398
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:44,216
and we go for double or nothing?

399
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:45,401
Tails, I don't pay anything,

400
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:49,686
and heads, I'll pay
you 17 hundred dollars.

401
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,922
Come on, American.

402
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,064
- American?
- Yeah.

403
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:54,987
- You're on.

404
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:57,877
- All right, that's my kind of guy.

405
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:58,710
Ready?

406
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,588
- Yeah.

407
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:03,236
- Ooh, ouch, looks like tails, it's me.

408
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,111
I'm sorry, man.

409
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,628
But thanks for the ride,
I really appreciate it.

410
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:09,083
It's a nice country you got here.

411
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,916
Have a nice trip back.

412
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:16,826
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

413
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,961
Memo: my father reckons they're the

414
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:27,394
greatest people in the world,

415
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:28,753
so far I've found Australians to be

416
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:32,920
nothing but a bunch of
cheap incompetent hustlers.

417
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,678
(engine roaring)

418
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:51,681
(snoring)

419
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,931
(clanking)

420
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:07,644
Good day.

421
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:10,525
- What can I do for you, mate?

422
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,078
- I'm Bobby Carter,

423
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,995
the exchange lifeguard?

424
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,879
Looks like you were expecting me.

425
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:21,796
- Mick, sorry you missed the party.

426
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:24,839
Follow me.

427
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:31,091
(cheerful instrumental rock music)

428
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:54,152
(gasps)

429
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,069
- Watch it.

430
00:20:59,222 --> 00:21:00,472
- Mullets, Max,

431
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:03,508
this is Bobby.

432
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,244
Tishi.

433
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:07,825
- Tishi.
- Bobby.

434
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:08,658
- Kylie.

435
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:11,517
- Hi.

436
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:13,548
- [Mick] Terry over there on the camera.

437
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:14,506
- [Bobby] Terry.

438
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,993
- How are you, mate?

439
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:17,743
- [Bobby] Good, good.

440
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:22,399
Where's the tower?

441
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:23,732
- [Mick] What's that?

442
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:26,164
- You know, the thing
the lifeguards sit on,

443
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:28,549
I mean the lifeguard station.

444
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:29,752
- We don't need them.

445
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,352
When the sharks attack,
we can tell where they are

446
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:33,142
just by the screams.

447
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:34,902
See, look over there.

448
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,219
Couple of white pointers.

449
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,204
- Keep it clean, Mick.

450
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:42,621
You're giving Bobby the wrong impression.

451
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:54,873
(crowd cheering)

452
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,439
- [Bobby] Beautiful beach you've got here.

453
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,423
- [Mick] Wait till you see your room.

454
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:19,344
- [Bobby] Oh, no thanks.

455
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:20,404
I'll stay at a hotel.

456
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:21,897
- [Mick] Nah, that'll cost you money.

457
00:22:21,897 --> 00:22:23,533
I've never known a life
saver to have any money,

458
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,159
especially an American one.

459
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,909
- [Bobby] Oh, right, right, yeah.

460
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:35,321
(ominous music)

461
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,321
- This is much better than a hotel.

462
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,422
You don't get accommodations
like this every day.

463
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:42,839
The world famous Mullet Cave.

464
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:50,425
So what do you reckon?

465
00:22:57,982 --> 00:22:59,026
Listen, mate.

466
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:02,276
I'm going out later on, you wanna come?

467
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,072
- Uh, no, thanks.

468
00:23:05,072 --> 00:23:06,615
I think I'll just stay here

469
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:09,294
and try and get some sleep.

470
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:11,683
You know, cab lag and all of that?

471
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,766
- Sure, sure, no problem.

472
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,066
(squeaking)

473
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,704
- I feel like I'm in a '60s time warp,

474
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,962
this place is a dump.

475
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,495
Our reports about the
Mullet Beach Lifesaving Club

476
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:37,933
were accurate.

477
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,174
How these bunch of nerds
ever survived at all

478
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:41,074
is beyond me.

479
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:42,394
McCain's bulldozing this clubhouse

480
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:44,530
will be a community service.

481
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,173
As far as Mullet Beach goes,

482
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,756
well, this place is a paradise.

483
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:52,364
The company is gonna make a killing.

484
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,900
- [Mick] Who you talking to, Bobby?

485
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,733
- [Man] Quick, tell him to put

486
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,566
his clothes on.

487
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,678
- [Mick] Where is she, mate?

488
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:57,511
- Who?

489
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:58,570
- [Mick] Come on, bring her out.

490
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,605
- Oh, I was just talking to myself.

491
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,079
- You bastard, you've cleaned the cave.

492
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,263
This place was a bloody tradition.

493
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:06,156
Told you the Yank was gay.

494
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:08,530
- No, it's okay, the
place needed a good tug.

495
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,405
You can do my car later.

496
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,047
- You find any money laying around?

497
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:13,704
- No, but I did find enough bikini bottoms

498
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,074
to start a boutique.

499
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:16,740
- Here we go, I think this
was a trophy of yours,

500
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,573
isn't it, Max?

501
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,589
(laughing)

502
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,830
Tough bit of training, you ready?

503
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,186
- Yeah, sure.

504
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:24,554
- Boat training.

505
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:27,620
- Great, with or without trunks?

506
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,754
- Trunks?

507
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:31,019
Oh yeah, good one.

508
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,269
(laughing)

509
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,882
- Hey, hey, pal!

510
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,275
Hey, that's the second time

511
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:49,833
you tried to run me off the road.

512
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,728
- Love the swimmers.

513
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:54,040
You must be the Yank.

514
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,790
- Yeah, Bobby Carter.

515
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:58,322
- McCarter?

516
00:24:58,322 --> 00:24:59,364
- No, Carter.

517
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,018
Just Carter.

518
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,283
- Yeah, well you should

519
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:06,283
watch where you're walking,
Bobby Carter, right?

520
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:15,613
- Don't worry mate,

521
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,016
guys always forget their names when

522
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,349
they're talking to Charlene.

523
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:23,198
(thud)

524
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:28,024
- Look.

525
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:31,024
(suspenseful music)

526
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:40,859
(clunking)
(splash)

527
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:47,519
- Where's the Yank?

528
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,269
Anyone seen the Yank?

529
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,245
(coughing)

530
00:26:22,552 --> 00:26:25,076
- Doesn't look like much a of a lifeguard.

531
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,022
(coughing)

532
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:28,605
- Tell me about it.

533
00:26:34,171 --> 00:26:35,439
- What's the story?

534
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,555
- Mate, it was just a bit of routine

535
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,934
boat training, you know how it is.

536
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:42,934
- Routine Mullet Beach boat capsize,

537
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:46,747
no story there.

538
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:49,289
- Yeah, except for there was a shark.

539
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:50,559
- Shark?

540
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,877
What sort of a shark?

541
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,516
- Oh mate, it's hard to tell, you know.

542
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:55,573
Close up, it could have been a hammerhead.

543
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,573
- Did you see the shark?

544
00:26:58,475 --> 00:26:59,987
- It was a great white.

545
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:01,686
- [Reporter] And how would you know that?

546
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,391
- Well, I'm an LA lifeguard.

547
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,166
- Oh really, how big was it?

548
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,193
- Oh, four feet.
- Eight meters.

549
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,026
See,

550
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,140
it's hard to tell, you know.

551
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,682
But I sort of just hit him, you know?

552
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:14,250
Whacked him on the nose a couple of times.

553
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,112
- Yeah, he hit him,

554
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:17,021
and there was two of them, they came.

555
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,319
- Yeah, a couple of them there, yeah.

556
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,163
- You came at them, and you,

557
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:20,191
- Sure, a couple almost.

558
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,701
- Punched him in the, it was amazing.

559
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:23,379
- I'd say hairy snappers, you want a peek?

560
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:24,212
Hairy snappers.

561
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:27,545
- Sharp teeth, yeah, pointy sharp teeth.

562
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:29,833

587

He's bought up half the land around here,

588
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,733

642
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:31,016
Did you have a party like
this last Sunday, too?

643
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,150
- Yeah, a bit wilder.

644
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,810
Hey, you wanna swap?

645
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,806
- Yeah, okay.

646
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:36,769
- Karen, this is Bobby,

647
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,602
Bobby, Karen.

648
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:38,555
- Hi Bobby, I'm Karen.

649
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:39,528
I do TV, the Big Wheel,

650
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:40,945
have you seen it?

651
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,461
You're the first American I've ever met,

652
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:48,533
have you been to Hollywood,

653
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:52,200
do you know Steven
Spielberg's phone number?

654
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:00,229
- 'Scuse me buddy, you've got my girl.

655
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:01,062
- Oh, sorry.

656
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:02,395
- Thanks, Karen.

657
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:12,711
- Julie, excuse me, Julie?

658
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,724
I think we started off on the wrong foot,

659
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,341
and I just wanted to let you know that

660
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,421
I'm not here to teach anybody anything,

661
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,946
I'm here to learn, really.

662
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:24,113
Listen, can I get you a cup of coffee?

663
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,338
(giggling)

664
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:45,786

665
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:50,599
Are you ready?

666
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:53,712
Oh, I think I'm out of coffee.

667
00:32:53,712 --> 00:32:56,295
Let's take a walk on the beach.

668
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:02,907
- Got him a beauty.

669
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:05,157
(giggling)

670
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,186
- It looks like the club's going to

671
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:11,574
have to close at the end of summer.

672
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,676
- Why?

673
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:14,466
- It's Red Beach, they wanna combine

674
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:16,875
the two clubs, sort of like a surfing

675
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,458
corporate takeover.

676
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,440
They'll get our funds and better members.

677
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,007
- How are you involved?

678
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:25,424
- I own the club.

679
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:27,710
- You do?

680
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,094
- My parents bought it

681
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:30,716
when they retired.

682
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:33,668
It was just a beach house.

683
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:35,447
They've gone now, and I lease it

684
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:36,864
to the surf club.

685
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:41,391
- The club house is right on the beach.

686
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:44,141
The land must be worth a fortune.

687
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,100
- Yeah, I supposed so.

688
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,483
Al Eastman's always making me

689
00:33:49,483 --> 00:33:50,971
offers I can't refuse.

690
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:51,989
- But you do.

691
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,874
- Sure, the guy's a creep.

692
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:55,227
Besides, I reckon he's in it

693
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:57,310
with this McCain bastard.

694
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:01,646
- Maybe McCain is not so bad.

695
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:04,559
Maybe it's--

696
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,660
- Bullshit.

697
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,357
Bullshit, the guy comes here,
tries to take our land--

698
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:10,495
- All right, all right,
all right, I'm sorry,

699
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,495
I'm sorry, you're right.

700
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:17,952
I just don't want this place to change.

701
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:19,724
- But you could make

702
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,391
an absolute fortune.

703
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,927
- You don't get it, do you?

704
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:29,817
I don't care about the money.

705
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,317
I care about this.

706
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:36,862
(somber music)

707
00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:43,183
I'm sorry, what do you care about?

708
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:44,016
Family?

709
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:46,609
Tell me about you.

710
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,274
- Well, my dad's a bit sick back

711
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:59,673
in LA, and my mom, she
lives here in Brisbane.

712
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:01,774
She and my dad married when

713
00:35:01,774 --> 00:35:04,089
she was really young,
and they were separated

714
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:06,294
when I was really young.

715
00:35:06,294 --> 00:35:09,294
And I don't remember much about her.

716
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:13,120
- Are you gonna try and get in touch?

717
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,474
- I don't know, I haven't seen her

718
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:15,974
in about 18 years.

719
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:20,256
- So you're half an Aussie.

720
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,067
- Yeah, I suppose I am.

721
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,527
- I suppose that is why you're half okay.

722
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:35,090
- You think I'm okay?

723
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,673
- Yeah, but don't wet yourself.

724
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:51,922
(rustling)
(giggling)

725
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:03,946
(background moaning)
(thumping)

726
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:19,128
- Julie Thomas.

727
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,257
One hard-headed lady.

728
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:24,738
Arrogant, self-righteous,

729
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:26,071
hates Americans.

730
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,607
I think I'm in love.

731
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:34,885
(urgent music)
(dog barking)

732
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:49,353
- You sure can run.

733
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:52,935
- Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.

734
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:54,523
- Now listen, Bobby,

735
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:55,356
one thing.

736
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:57,814
- What?

737
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:00,018
- If you really want to
look like a lifesaver?

738
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,065
- Yeah?

739
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:03,243
- We gotta get you a
new pair of those, mate.

740
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:04,462
(laughs)

741
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:06,126
- What's wrong with these?

742
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,876
What, these, come on.

743
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:17,235
(dog barking)
(farting)

744
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:23,128
- Look at this, Mr. Surf Hero.

745
00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:26,461
- Oh, hey, you're a good-looking fellow.

746
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,331
- Morning, Bobby.

747
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:34,071
- Good morning, Kylie.

748
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,404
It's not what it seems.

749
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:40,709
(farting)

750
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,251
- Good day, Bobby.

751
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:43,818
- Morning, Tishi.

752
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:45,600
It's definitely not what it seems,

753
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,479
I slept on the couch.

754
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:48,312
- Sure.

755
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:53,545
(ominous music)

756
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,558
(growling)

757
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,611
- What is it, boy?

758
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:17,778
(barking)

759
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,644
- You!

760
00:38:23,644 --> 00:38:24,477
(barking)

761
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:26,310
- [Mick] Get him, now!

762
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,079
- [Clint] Get that bastard off me!

763
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,647
Get him off.

764
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,174
Get the bastard off me.

765
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:40,208
(growling)

766
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,527
Hey, just a joke.

767
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,860
I'm sorry, okay?

768
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,183
- How's the bike?

769
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:49,524
- I can flush the tank,
but if I'd started it...

770
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:51,245
(growling)

771
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,369
- Just call the bastard away.

772
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,314
- Killer, you know what to do.

773
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:56,997
(farting)
(splashing)

774
00:38:56,997 --> 00:39:00,010
(barking)
(screaming)

775
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,473
(whimsical music)

776
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,640
(barking)

777
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,994
- Have a nice day, Asswipe.

778
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,288
- Yuck, Captain Marvel'd be embarrassed

779
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:31,455
to wear these.

780
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:36,781
Mullet Beach green.

781
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:38,966
- Try 'em on.

782
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,196
- Oh, look a bit tight for
the wedding tackle, hm?

783
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:52,371
- You're in the hands

784
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:54,288
of a professional, now.

785
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,288
- That should do it.

786
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:06,959
You going to the
demonstration against McCain

787
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:07,891
this afternoon?

788
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:09,000
- That bastard.

789
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,119
I'd forgotten all about it,

790
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,309
thanks for reminding me.

791
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,831
- Good, we'll see you there.

792
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:14,382
Come too, if you like.

793
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:16,605
We'll need all the help we can get.

794
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:17,803
- Thanks.

795
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:20,553
(cheerful music)

796
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:29,581
This coastline is just sensational.

797
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:34,239
- Don't worry, we won't
let McCain bastards

798
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,489
take it off us.

799
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,941
- You'd have to be crazy.

800
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:39,774
- Yeah.

801
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:50,838
- Well, well, well, look who's

802
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:53,546
come to check out the meeting.

803
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:56,154
(sniffing)

804
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:59,990
Jeez, Clint, you ought
to take a bath, mate.

805
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,103
You smell like dog piss.

806
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:05,155
- [Man] Are here now to say a few words.

807
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:06,500
- Want you to woof him,

808
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,578
I told you to woof him in the car,

809
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,411
just woof him.

810
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:09,931
- Developers are paying big bucks

811
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,234
to our own council to get these

812
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:13,124
building applications through.

813
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:14,535
Now, are we just gonna
sit back, and let these

814
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:15,368
foreign consortiums ruin our

815
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:16,226
- Sarah.

816
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:18,249
- Public parks and beaches?

817
00:41:18,249 --> 00:41:19,650
Well, are we?

818
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,300
- [Group In Unison] No, no way.

819
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,424
- I don't think we'll have any trouble

820
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:23,906
with this bunch of boofheads.

821
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:24,942
Which one's the Yank?

822
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:26,504
- That's him.

823
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:27,873
- Oh.

824
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:30,185
- So what are we going to do about it?

825
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:31,971
- Al Eastman, nice to meet you.

826
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:33,827
- You better count your fingers, mate.

827
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,044
- I'll see you in the title, Dooley,

828
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:36,626
say hello to your mother for me.

829
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:37,991
What's going on, McCain?

830
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:40,565
Gray said you'd be in touch.

831
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:41,982
- I've been busy.

832
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:44,572
- Well I can't talk to you here,

833
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,245
my office in the boat
shed across the road,

834
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:48,932
but I wanna talk to you, now.

835
00:41:48,932 --> 00:41:51,162
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carter.

836
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:52,464
Very nice.

837
00:41:52,464 --> 00:41:54,566
- So what about our American friend,

838
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:57,619
Mr. Bobby Carter, exchange lifeguard.

839
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,601
Yeah, I'm talking to you, mate.

840
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,156
What would you do about it?

841
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:04,489
- Uh, we have the same problems at home,

842
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:07,230
I don't know what to say.

843
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,410
- Oh, thanks mate,

844
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,351
that was a big help.

845
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:11,384
- All right, well,

846
00:42:11,384 --> 00:42:13,305
get off your butts, organize.

847
00:42:13,305 --> 00:42:16,079
- So where do you stand, for or against?

848
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,625
- It's not my town,

849
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,292
if you wanna keep it, you do it.

850
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:34,967
- I thought we were working
on this deal together.

851
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:36,397
What's the idea of going down there

852
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:38,514
and stirring up all this trouble?

853
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,874
- I had to say something.

854
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,224
- Well, they're a bunch
of boofheads anyway.

855
00:42:42,224 --> 00:42:44,258
Is that girl gonna sell the clubhouse yet?

856
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:47,089
- I've tried everything,
and she's staying put.

857
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:48,900
She's not interested in the money.

858
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,132
- Stupid bitch.

859
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:51,422
- Hey watch it, pal.

860
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:53,720
- We struck a nerve.

861
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,886
We sampling a few of the local delicacies,

862
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:56,949
are we?

863
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,571
She's a very attractive girl.

864
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:02,606
- She's not gonna sell, and that's it.

865
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:04,338
I'm reporting to Gray that I

866
00:43:04,338 --> 00:43:07,297
think we should consider
canceling the whole thing.

867
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,145
- Now you wait a minute, Bobby.

868
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:11,026
I've sunk a lot of money into this.

869
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:12,768
You've been down here for five minutes,

870
00:43:12,768 --> 00:43:15,394
and already you're making
negative decisions.

871
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:18,688
Now you give this girl time
and she'll sell, right?

872
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:19,605
- Negative?

873
00:43:20,996 --> 00:43:23,812
And my friends call me Bobby.

874
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:27,386
You two better call me Mr. McCain.

875
00:43:27,386 --> 00:43:31,721
- We two better call
you Mr. Carter, right?

876
00:43:31,721 --> 00:43:34,638
Otherwise Julie will
be disappointed in you,

877
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:35,471
won't she?

878
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:40,294
- She's not gonna sell.

879
00:43:58,129 --> 00:44:00,275
- You lot are bloody hopeless.

880
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:03,714
There's zone championships
are starting in a week.

881
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:06,066
We might as well pack it in now.

882
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:08,280
- So what's new, we always lose anyway.

883
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,113
- Yeah.

884
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,346
- Well, why do we bother?

885
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:11,785
- Because we must.

886
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,579
- That's right, if you don't,

887
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:15,163
you'll lose the club.

888
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:16,753
I mean, that's what you said, right?

889
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:17,586
- Yeah.

890
00:44:17,586 --> 00:44:19,042
- You lose everything?

891
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,607
- That's if those developers don't

892
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,690
get it first.

893
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:27,863
- Well, I have a confession to make.

894
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:29,683
- Jason!

895
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:30,516
Jason!

896
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:33,908
- There's a kid caught
in the rip, come on.

897
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:34,849
(dramatic music)

898
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:36,336
- All right, Terry, Tishi, get the reel.

899
00:44:36,336 --> 00:44:38,753
Julie, look after the mother.

900
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:44,055
- It'll be all right.

901
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,305
- [Kylie] Down.

902
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:49,295
- You've got the bell?

903
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:51,878
That's all right, I'll take it.

904
00:46:00,848 --> 00:46:03,015
(sobbing)

905
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:05,449
- Pull him over.

906
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:08,657
- [Tishi] Cough it up.

907
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:16,548
Come on, you're okay.

908
00:46:16,548 --> 00:46:18,861
- [Terry] Yeah, he's gonna be all right.

909
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:20,444
- [Tishi] Good boy.

910
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:33,874
- Fellas.

911
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:36,778
What's this, mate?

912
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:38,046
Christmas shopping list?

913
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,644
- I saw you out there yesterday,

914
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:41,335
I know you can do it.

915
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:43,168
- When it's important.

916
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:46,862
- If you wanna save this club,

917
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:48,445
it's important now.

918
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,243
- So what's this?

919
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:53,283
- [Bobby] It's a training program.

920
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:54,116
(scoffs)

921
00:46:54,116 --> 00:46:55,158
- [Mick] Fifty pushups?

922
00:46:55,158 --> 00:46:56,473
- And that's just to start.

923
00:46:56,473 --> 00:46:57,830
Look, I'll never be as good a lifeguard

924
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:58,829
as you guys.

925
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:01,243
But the one thing I can
do is, I can organize.

926
00:47:01,243 --> 00:47:04,180
I can organize people
into getting things done.

927
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,631
Now, do you wanna keep this place?

928
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:07,464
Do you?

929
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:08,763
- Yeah.

930
00:47:08,763 --> 00:47:11,528
We just don't go for all
the parades and shit.

931
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:12,679
- Well you're gonna have to,

932
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:14,515
if you want to survive.

933
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:16,990
That's why I made this program.

934
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,732
I just believe that if
we all work together,

935
00:47:18,732 --> 00:47:20,109
that we'll give those titles a run

936
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:22,270
for their money.

937
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,272
- Hey man, there's a
five kilometer beach run.

938
00:47:25,272 --> 00:47:26,108
- Yeah.

939
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,691
- What's in it for you, Carter?

940
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,679
- Let's just say that I owe you one.

941
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:38,482
- All righty, let's give it a burl.

942
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,505
(cheering)

943
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:41,169
- Now I have some good
news, I have some good news.

944
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:42,732
Charlene has offered to help us.

945
00:47:42,732 --> 00:47:43,955
- [Max] Yo, Charlene.

946
00:47:43,955 --> 00:47:45,236
(lightning crashing)

947
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:46,421
- [Tishi] Can somebody
explain to me why this

948
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:49,004
good news sounds like bad news?

949
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:52,709
(cheerful music)

950
00:48:07,507 --> 00:48:08,825
- Go!

951
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:10,189
Go!

952
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:12,772
Oh come on, you're just racing.

953
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:14,580
Pull!

954
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:18,812
Row!

955
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,645
Okay, row.

956
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:24,877
Four, three, two, that's it!

957
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,239
Four, three, two, switch legs.

958
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:35,982
Come on, don't quit, four, three, two,

959
00:48:35,982 --> 00:48:36,899
pick it up!

960
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:43,492
Come on, pick it up!

961
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:56,521
Make the boat slide.

962
00:49:20,772 --> 00:49:22,605
Put your back into it.

963
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,357
Move it, what are you two,

964
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:34,255
men or mice?

965
00:49:34,255 --> 00:49:36,005
- Meece, girl meeces.

966
00:49:39,381 --> 00:49:40,218
(smack)

967
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:42,470
(groans)

968
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,970
Cute, now 10 more.

969
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:51,913
Now for the big test, number one group,

970
00:49:51,913 --> 00:49:53,609
here, through water.

971
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:56,276
(blows whistle)

972
00:50:09,947 --> 00:50:11,364
Through, through!

973
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:14,763
Remember the timing.

974
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:17,528
- [Bobby] Well?

975
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:19,451
- I don't believe it.

976
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:21,838
A week ago I thought we
didn't have a chance,

977
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,114
but I was wrong about you, Bobby.

978
00:50:25,114 --> 00:50:26,382
- Thanks.

979
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:28,639
Well, we've only got one problem now.

980
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:29,472
- What?

981
00:50:29,472 --> 00:50:32,635
- Me, I'm nowhere near
as good as you guys.

982
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:35,707
- You're just as good
as Rusty was, better.

983
00:50:35,707 --> 00:50:37,402
- [Bobby] Thanks.

984
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,861
- [Charlene] Okay, Mullets,
that's getting better.

985
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:41,278
Through, through.

986
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:44,098
Come on, through.

987
00:50:44,098 --> 00:50:47,455
- Julie, there's something
I have to tell you.

988
00:50:47,455 --> 00:50:50,075
- That's it, okay you two,

989
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:51,809
swim training begins now,

990
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:53,551
two laps fro the skinnies to the cliffs.

991
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,384
Go.

992
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:56,209
Go.

993
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:02,615
(whistling)

994
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:05,315
- I don't think so, Donna.

995
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:06,392
- Aw, come on, baby,

996
00:51:06,392 --> 00:51:07,327
it's good for you.

997
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:08,508
- No, thank you.

998
00:51:08,508 --> 00:51:10,792
- Honey, honey, the
doctor said you should.

999
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,978
- I hate quack doctors.

1000
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:14,894
- Honey, what are you doing?

1001
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:15,753
- Packing.

1002
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:16,820
- Oh, where are we going?

1003
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,252
- We're not going anywhere, I'm going.

1004
00:51:19,252 --> 00:51:20,093
- You?

1005
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:21,409
Where?

1006
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:22,409
- Australia.

1007
00:51:26,313 --> 00:51:29,169
- I've never seen him
act like this before.

1008
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,344
- Well, maybe we can
use it to our advantage.

1009
00:51:31,344 --> 00:51:32,177
- How?

1010
00:51:32,177 --> 00:51:33,438
- I'll call a general meeting.

1011
00:51:33,438 --> 00:51:35,389
We'll say he's flipped out,

1012
00:51:35,389 --> 00:51:36,972
gone bananas.

1013
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:37,848
- So?

1014
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:39,137
- You get a letter from the doctor

1015
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,518
who gave you the pills.

1016
00:51:40,518 --> 00:51:41,390
(giggling)

1017
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,223
- That's it.

1018
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:45,046
Big Mike McCain has
finally lost his marbles.

1019
00:51:45,046 --> 00:51:47,801
His son's off, womanizing in Australia.

1020
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:51,608
So it's up to his senior vice president,

1021
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,769
- Richard Gray.

1022
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:54,604
And Mrs. McCain.

1023
00:51:54,604 --> 00:51:56,437
- Oh, and Mrs. McCain.

1024
00:51:57,652 --> 00:52:00,443
To take over the running of the company,

1025
00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:02,731
the board will buy it.

1026
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:04,634
- What about Mullet Beach?

1027
00:52:04,634 --> 00:52:06,202
- I'll tell Eastman to turn up the heat,

1028
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,343
whether Bobby likes it or not.

1029
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:09,527
Donna?

1030
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,002
- Oh, Richard.

1031
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,002
- I think we've done it.

1032
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:18,210
- Richard, I think this
calls for a celebration.

1033
00:52:19,087 --> 00:52:21,004
- Oh, I'll second that.

1034
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:24,423
You know, I've got this feeling

1035
00:52:24,423 --> 00:52:26,802
this is gonna be a
highly productive merger.

1036
00:52:26,802 --> 00:52:28,014
- Oh, Richard, Richard.

1037
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:30,807
(laughing)

1038
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:33,092
- So, that's about the size of it.

1039
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:36,284
Our founder and managing director is

1040
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:41,054
sadly unable to function
competently in his position.

1041
00:52:41,054 --> 00:52:43,137
(crying)

1042
00:52:44,547 --> 00:52:45,916
- Therefore, with the blessing of

1043
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,736
Mr. McCain's wife,

1044
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:50,854
and power of attorney,
it is my melancholy duty

1045
00:52:50,854 --> 00:52:54,354
to assume control of McCain World Resorts.

1046
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,247
Now, Mrs. McCain and I
feel it would be the best

1047
00:52:57,247 --> 00:52:59,080
thing, the only thing,

1048
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,790
to carry out Big Mike's plans as if he

1049
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,309
were still here with us.

1050
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:07,244
(chatting in agreement)

1051
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:10,072
Now you've all seen the
computer projection.

1052
00:53:10,072 --> 00:53:12,464
Oh, that coastline is
some of the prettiest

1053
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:15,132
on earth, and the easiest to develop.

1054
00:53:15,132 --> 00:53:18,230
Flat land, not much forestation,

1055
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:22,397
and it's a steal, as long as
we make the decision today.

1056
00:53:24,491 --> 00:53:26,113
Those hillbilly Aussies won't know it

1057
00:53:26,113 --> 00:53:27,780
until it's too late!

1058
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:32,947
Carried unanimously, good.

1059
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:35,132
Big Mike would be proud of you.

1060
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:36,882
- [Bob] One thing worries me.

1061
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:38,620
- [Richard] And what's that, Bob?

1062
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,340
- Our people in Australia, that soft cock

1063
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,121
Eastman and his son, can they handle this?

1064
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:45,719
- Probably not, but
don't you worry about it.

1065
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:47,760
We have somebody down there as well,

1066
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,877
and he is keeping an eye on Bobby McCain,

1067
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:51,410
and Mullet Beach.

1068
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,827
- Does Bobby know?

1069
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:55,397
- No, Bob, our man is in disguise.

1070
00:53:55,397 --> 00:53:59,147
- [Mick] Left right,
left right, left, right,

1071
00:54:01,076 --> 00:54:03,326
left, left foot, left foot!

1072
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:11,994
- Right wheel.

1073
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,047
- Left, left foot, left foot.

1074
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,479
(Scottish bagpipe music)

1075
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:23,479
- Killer, you want some?

1076
00:54:24,535 --> 00:54:28,788
- [Mick] Left foot, left
foot, left foot, left, left!

1077
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:29,777
Left foot.

1078
00:54:29,777 --> 00:54:32,027
- And step two three, halt.

1079
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:35,551
Mullet Beach crew, you have two more days

1080
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:37,590
until the zone championships.

1081
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,225
As a team, you're
beginning to work together.

1082
00:54:40,225 --> 00:54:42,893
The improvement is beyond expectation.

1083
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,382
However, let's not rest on our laurels.

1084
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,472
Training for the afternoon will be

1085
00:54:48,472 --> 00:54:51,472
what the hell, have the
day off, you've earned it.

1086
00:54:51,472 --> 00:54:52,305
- Oh!

1087
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:53,138
Thank God.

1088
00:54:53,138 --> 00:54:57,305
(thudding)
(groaning)

1089
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,029
(splash)

1090
00:55:14,029 --> 00:55:16,612
(serene music)

1091
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:23,259
(splashing)

1092
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:53,155
(laughing)

1093
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:21,461
- Come on, Killer,

1094
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:24,853
hurry up, or we'll miss the party.

1095
00:58:24,853 --> 00:58:27,520
(ominous music)

1096
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:32,871
(barking)

1097
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:41,352
(barking)

1098
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,942
What is it, mate?

1099
00:58:42,942 --> 00:58:44,862
(sniffing)

1100
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:46,059
Petrol.

1101
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:48,226
(barking)

1102
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:54,371
(clanging)
(barking)

1103
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,728
- Here you go, guys, marshmallows.

1104
00:59:01,728 --> 00:59:03,671
- Oh yeah, did you remember the forks?

1105
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:04,605
- Oh, get out of here,

1106
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:06,705
use a dirty stick like everyone else.

1107
00:59:06,705 --> 00:59:08,538
Hey mate, not the thongs, jeez.

1108
00:59:08,538 --> 00:59:11,046
- Instead of prawns, it's a little piece.

1109
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:13,296
- That's not a joke, buddy.

1110
00:59:14,974 --> 00:59:16,609
Yeah, go and laugh.

1111
00:59:16,609 --> 00:59:18,663
- I've got to hand to to you, mate.

1112
00:59:18,663 --> 00:59:21,440
You surprise me, you're really fitting in.

1113
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,160
- Well, thank you very much.

1114
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,531
You're a great bunch of guys.

1115
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:26,921
- Yeah, 'cause people around here

1116
00:59:26,921 --> 00:59:28,647
can be a bit funny when
it comes to foreigners

1117
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:29,858
- Oh, you've had some problems?

1118
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,187
- No, I said foreigners.

1119
00:59:31,187 --> 00:59:33,556
- Excuse me everybody, it's only

1120
00:59:33,556 --> 00:59:36,306
two days until the championships.

1121
00:59:37,564 --> 00:59:39,593
Mick would like to say something.

1122
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:41,243
(laughs)

1123
00:59:41,243 --> 00:59:43,764
- Even though there's
still two days to go,

1124
00:59:43,764 --> 00:59:46,626
I reckon for the first time,

1125
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:48,511
we're in with a chance.

1126
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:50,871
(clapping)
(cheering)

1127
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:53,727
Even though I wanna kill
you two slave drivers,

1128
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,144
I would like to propose a toast to Bobby,

1129
00:59:58,089 --> 00:59:59,834
and to Charlene.

1130
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:01,113
- [Bobby] Yeah, Charlene.

1131
01:00:01,113 --> 01:00:02,232
(cheering)

1132
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,283
(ominous music)

1133
01:00:04,283 --> 01:00:05,477
- You bastard!

1134
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,769
You two-faced lying bastard!

1135
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:10,059
- Terry you idiot, what's
this dickhead doing here?

1136
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:11,878
- [Terry] I caught him
trying to torch the club.

1137
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:12,711
- [Julie] What?

1138
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:13,892
- Don't worry, Killer and I

1139
01:00:13,892 --> 01:00:16,360
convinced him it wasn't such a good idea.

1140
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,238
- Well what's that got to do with Bobby?

1141
01:00:18,238 --> 01:00:20,230
- Plenty, he's in it with them.

1142
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:22,155
You wanna tell them, Carter?

1143
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:23,675
Or should I say Mr. McCain!

1144
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:26,081
- Hey, hey, hey, Terry, you drunk or what?

1145
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:26,914
- Ask him!

1146
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,567
- He's in it, all right,

1147
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:30,479
he's the bloody big boss's kid.

1148
01:00:30,479 --> 01:00:32,364
- Shut up, pencil neck.

1149
01:00:32,364 --> 01:00:33,197
Bobby?

1150
01:00:35,891 --> 01:00:37,274
- [Tishi] Well?

1151
01:00:37,274 --> 01:00:39,078
- My name's Bobby McCain.

1152
01:00:39,078 --> 01:00:39,911
(ominous music)

1153
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:40,744
- What?

1154
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:41,911
- I tried to tell you, I really did,

1155
01:00:41,911 --> 01:00:44,227
I tried to tell you a couple of times.

1156
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:47,015
- I found this in his stuff.

1157
01:00:47,015 --> 01:00:48,327
Have a listen.

1158
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:49,852
- [Bobby On Recording] So
far, I find Australians

1159
01:00:49,852 --> 01:00:53,009
to be nothing but a bunch of
cheap incompetent hustlers.

1160
01:00:53,009 --> 01:00:53,940
(tape screeching)

1161
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,265
How these bunch of nerds ever survived

1162
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:56,331
at all is beyond me.

1163
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:57,937
McCain's bulldozing this clubhouse will be

1164
01:00:57,937 --> 01:00:59,179
a community service.

1165
01:00:59,179 --> 01:01:00,538
- There's more.

1166
01:01:00,538 --> 01:01:02,819
- [Bobby On Recording] Julie Thomas,

1167
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:04,569
one hard-headed lady.

1168
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:07,494
Arrogant, self-righteous.

1169
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:08,710
(smack)

1170
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,855
Hates Americans.

1171
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:12,272
- We trusted you.

1172
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,786
- Go on, thump the prick.

1173
01:01:14,786 --> 01:01:15,619
- Shut up.

1174
01:01:18,623 --> 01:01:19,498
- Mick.

1175
01:01:19,498 --> 01:01:20,986
- [Terry] You're friggin' a spy.

1176
01:01:20,986 --> 01:01:22,316
- I tried to stop that development,

1177
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:23,516
you gotta believe me.

1178
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:26,719
- A Yankee land developer spy!

1179
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:28,171
(barking)

1180
01:01:28,171 --> 01:01:29,742
(thud)

1181
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:30,575
- Terry!

1182
01:01:30,575 --> 01:01:34,742
(hissing)
(screams)

1183
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:37,385
Hey, hey, hey!

1184
01:01:37,385 --> 01:01:38,585
Terry, Terry, Terry!

1185
01:01:38,585 --> 01:01:39,630
Watch it, mate, watch it.

1186
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,636
(crash)

1187
01:01:40,636 --> 01:01:41,469
(groaning)

1188
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:42,306
- Give it a break!

1189
01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:43,896
Terry, give it a break!

1190
01:01:43,896 --> 01:01:44,928
- Let go of me!

1191
01:01:44,928 --> 01:01:46,689
(barking)

1192
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:47,606
- Oh, shit.

1193
01:01:53,978 --> 01:01:56,775
- So the whole thing was a setup.

1194
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:57,991
- Yeah.

1195
01:01:57,991 --> 01:01:59,178
- Well, at least that explains how

1196
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:00,855
Rusty won the trip to Malibu.

1197
01:02:00,855 --> 01:02:03,010
- Yeah, never could figure that.

1198
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,987
- Listen, I don't want
that development to happen,

1199
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,362
you gotta believe me.

1200
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:07,251
- I believe you?

1201
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:08,084
- All those things I said

1202
01:02:08,084 --> 01:02:09,467
on the tape recorder
when I first got here.

1203
01:02:09,467 --> 01:02:10,300
- Sure.

1204
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,401
- I tried talking to Eastman--

1205
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:14,651
- Listen, Bobby, will you just shut up?

1206
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:16,792
You know,

1207
01:02:18,478 --> 01:02:19,728
you won't be able to stay here

1208
01:02:19,728 --> 01:02:21,395
at the club anymore.

1209
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,149
(peaceful music)

1210
01:02:30,149 --> 01:02:32,899
(engine revving)

1211
01:02:48,175 --> 01:02:49,617
Hey, Mrs. B.

1212
01:02:49,617 --> 01:02:51,435
This is Bobby McCain,

1213
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,167
the fellow I called you about.

1214
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:55,540
- McCain, McCain, another one.

1215
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,673
Bloody McCains all over the shop.

1216
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,123
- What is she talking about?

1217
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:01,524
- Don't worry mate, she's
stark raving bonkers.

1218
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:03,455
Aren't you, Mrs. B?

1219
01:03:03,455 --> 01:03:05,100
- No guests after eight PM,

1220
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,901
no animals, breakfast is
served at seven sharp.

1221
01:03:07,901 --> 01:03:09,558
- [Mick] Did you get my dog dry cleaned?

1222
01:03:09,558 --> 01:03:10,391
- Yup.

1223
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,525
She's also deaf as a post.

1224
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:15,157
- I heard that, I heard that.

1225
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:16,548
What did he say?

1226
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:20,319
- He's just a son of a
bitch with no friends.

1227
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,152
She'll look after you.

1228
01:03:23,182 --> 01:03:24,388
- Thanks.

1229
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,569
- Got McCains coming
out of the bloody walls.

1230
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,175
- Excuse me?

1231
01:03:28,175 --> 01:03:30,541
It's 11:35, you must know.

1232
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,374
- Thank you, does that phone work?

1233
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:36,834
- Yeah.

1234
01:03:36,834 --> 01:03:38,717
It'll be 20 dollars in advance.

1235
01:03:38,717 --> 01:03:39,798
- For the phone?

1236
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:42,538
- Yeah, room 2D, down the hall.

1237
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:44,621
- Oh, okay, for the room.

1238
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:47,874
Here.

1239
01:03:47,874 --> 01:03:49,822
- Bloody McCains.

1240
01:03:49,822 --> 01:03:50,822
- Thank you!

1241
01:03:56,736 --> 01:03:57,766
Operator, yes.

1242
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,194
I'd like to place a collect call

1243
01:03:59,194 --> 01:04:01,196
to the United States to Mr. Mike McCain

1244
01:04:01,196 --> 01:04:03,204
from Bobby, area code 310,

1245
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:07,408
three, four, one, four, five, three, four.

1246
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:08,241
- Hi.

1247
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:11,743
- [Bobby] Father.

1248
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:16,075
- Eastman's got no right, I never gave

1249
01:04:16,075 --> 01:04:17,548
the go-ahead!

1250
01:04:17,548 --> 01:04:19,673
- Well somebody did!

1251
01:04:19,673 --> 01:04:20,923
- Richard Gray.

1252
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:23,853
Well, it doesn't matter.

1253
01:04:23,853 --> 01:04:25,634
I'm here now, we'll do things right.

1254
01:04:25,634 --> 01:04:29,588
- Listen, McCain is a
dirty word at Mullet Beach.

1255
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:31,822
Believe me, they don't want a high rise.

1256
01:04:31,822 --> 01:04:36,141
- I don't blame them, I
wouldn't want one either.

1257
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:38,558
- So what are you doing here?

1258
01:04:39,632 --> 01:04:41,407
- I've been designing the right kind of

1259
01:04:41,407 --> 01:04:43,446
resort for Mullet Beach.

1260
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,600
Here, take a look at this.

1261
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,100
Take a look at it.

1262
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,249
Low rise, okay, no more than two stories.

1263
01:04:51,249 --> 01:04:54,429
Mud brick, solar and wind power

1264
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:55,911
set back from the beach, they won't even

1265
01:04:55,911 --> 01:04:57,382
know it's there.

1266
01:04:57,382 --> 01:05:00,382
- This is good, this is really good.

1267
01:05:01,674 --> 01:05:03,519
And I thought you were,

1268
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:04,674
- Nuts?

1269
01:05:04,674 --> 01:05:05,507
- Well.

1270
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:07,453
- That's okay, I was acting a

1271
01:05:07,453 --> 01:05:09,086
little loopy there for a while,

1272
01:05:09,086 --> 01:05:11,814
I think it was those stupid pills.

1273
01:05:11,814 --> 01:05:13,334
Been feeling a lot better, though,

1274
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:14,678
since I left LA.

1275
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:16,653
- It must be Australia.

1276
01:05:16,653 --> 01:05:18,434
- It must be.

1277
01:05:18,434 --> 01:05:19,996
- I'll tell you something, kid.

1278
01:05:19,996 --> 01:05:22,392
There's a lot of hungry sharks out there.

1279
01:05:22,392 --> 01:05:23,475
- Where, at the beach?

1280
01:05:23,475 --> 01:05:25,659
- No, driving taxi cabs.

1281
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:27,909
(laughing)

1282
01:05:29,963 --> 01:05:31,630
- You gonna see Mom?

1283
01:05:33,872 --> 01:05:35,476
- I don't think so.

1284
01:05:35,476 --> 01:05:38,197
It's been a long time, Bobby.

1285
01:05:38,197 --> 01:05:40,975
I'm sure she's married
some Aussie cattle man,

1286
01:05:40,975 --> 01:05:43,725
or newspaper owner, or something.

1287
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,137
- Dad?

1288
01:05:46,137 --> 01:05:47,594
- Why don't you go and find her,

1289
01:05:47,594 --> 01:05:50,344
my hands are tied up, right here.

1290
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:54,160
- They're not gonna buy it.

1291
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,577
- Leave it to me.

1292
01:05:56,717 --> 01:06:00,050
Hey, I hear you found yourself an angel.

1293
01:06:01,573 --> 01:06:03,027
- Found and lost.

1294
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:05,610
(somber music)

1295
01:06:12,608 --> 01:06:14,241
Julie, wait, please.

1296
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:15,673
- Oh, let's not do this, Bobby.

1297
01:06:15,673 --> 01:06:16,965
I don't wanna talk, okay?

1298
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:19,429
- Please, from the first time

1299
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:21,055
that I saw you, Julie.

1300
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,175
- What, you knew I was a sucker?

1301
01:06:22,175 --> 01:06:23,008
- No.

1302
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,397
Look, I know you're angry with me,

1303
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:27,431
and I know I deserve it.

1304
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:29,751
But at least give me
the chance to explain.

1305
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:31,062
- No, I won't.

1306
01:06:31,062 --> 01:06:32,118
Don't you remember?

1307
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:34,573
I'm arrogant, hard-headed,
and self-righteous,

1308
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,156
get out of my life.

1309
01:06:40,949 --> 01:06:42,532
- Will you shut up!

1310
01:06:43,516 --> 01:06:45,266
- Shut up, everybody!

1311
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:48,275
- Thank you.

1312
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:49,545
Now there's a bloke here that's got

1313
01:06:49,545 --> 01:06:50,658
something to say to us.

1314
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:51,959
He reckons he's got something interesting

1315
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:53,635
to say about the McCains' development,

1316
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,804
so here he is, what was your name, mate?

1317
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:57,293
- Mike McCain.

1318
01:06:57,293 --> 01:06:59,123
- [Terry] What's he doing here?

1319
01:06:59,123 --> 01:07:01,974
(group heckling)

1320
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:03,951
- Well the last time I was in Australia,

1321
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:06,055
I was told that you always gave a guy

1322
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,727
a, how do you put it?

1323
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:08,684
A fair go?

1324
01:07:08,684 --> 01:07:10,434
(group heckling)

1325
01:07:10,434 --> 01:07:12,842
Yeah, a fair go, that's all I ask for.

1326
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:13,925
Is a fair go.

1327
01:07:15,588 --> 01:07:17,270
- All right, shut up everybody,

1328
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,270
and give the bloke a go.

1329
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,708
- Look, I don't blame you for not

1330
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,541
wanting a high rise building slapped in

1331
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:25,107
the middle of your best beach.

1332
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,583
I think that's a dumb idea,

1333
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:28,119
I don't want that.

1334
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:30,369
What I want for us is this.

1335
01:07:31,225 --> 01:07:33,055
- [Terry] Hey, we don't
need any resort, mate.

1336
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:34,533
- This is not a resort, this is a

1337
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:36,549
community-owned project.

1338
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:37,572
(group heckling)

1339
01:07:37,572 --> 01:07:38,930
Look, I don't mean to get personal,

1340
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,686
but do you have a job?

1341
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:41,519
- No.

1342
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:43,946
No.

1343
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:47,961
- Does anybody else here not have a job?

1344
01:07:47,961 --> 01:07:50,979
Come on people, I did the research myself.

1345
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:55,146
Twenty-eight percent
unemployment on this coastline.

1346
01:07:56,098 --> 01:07:58,719
What you need is an
environmentally-friendly

1347
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:01,173
eco-center, powered by natural resources.

1348
01:08:01,173 --> 01:08:02,845
(group grumbling)

1349
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:03,871
Look, look, look.

1350
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,610
We can't for you, if you don't want it,

1351
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:07,321
we won't do it.

1352
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:09,477
But give it a chance,
look for for yourself.

1353
01:08:09,477 --> 01:08:10,543
You decide.

1354
01:08:10,543 --> 01:08:13,210
(group arguing)

1355
01:08:25,861 --> 01:08:26,694
(slam)

1356
01:08:26,694 --> 01:08:28,406
- [Donna] Well?

1357
01:08:28,406 --> 01:08:30,641
- Your husband is at Mullet Beach!

1358
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:32,218
- [Donna] And?

1359
01:08:32,218 --> 01:08:35,321
- Eastman says he's stirring up trouble.

1360
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:37,521
He's talking about a cooperative venture.

1361
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:38,567
- A what?

1362
01:08:38,567 --> 01:08:40,653
- Big Mike has told the people of

1363
01:08:40,653 --> 01:08:42,364
Mullet Beach that he'll give them back

1364
01:08:42,364 --> 01:08:44,078
all their land, if they
go into partnership

1365
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,221
with McCain's.

1366
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,502
- You're kidding.

1367
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,806
- He wants to build some
kind of resort commune.

1368
01:08:49,806 --> 01:08:52,878
- Didn't anyone tell
him, communism is dead?

1369
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,391
- Well don't you worry about it, baby.

1370
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:56,766
Because he can't do it.

1371
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,607
Big Mike doesn't know it yet,

1372
01:08:58,607 --> 01:09:01,454
but he does not run McCain's anymore.

1373
01:09:01,454 --> 01:09:02,896
- Richard?

1374
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:04,531
It's time you and I did something to

1375
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:07,031
finish this, once and for all.

1376
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,630
- Mr. Eastman, I've heard a lot about you.

1377
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,894
- And me about you.

1378
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:22,864
- And this must be your
nephew, Clint Eastwood.

1379
01:09:22,864 --> 01:09:24,415
- It's Eastman.

1380
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:26,001
- Of course.

1381
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:29,026
My kid's just about the same age as you.

1382
01:09:29,026 --> 01:09:30,695
- Yeah, we've met.

1383
01:09:30,695 --> 01:09:32,541
- That was very unusual speech

1384
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:34,658
you gave this morning, Mr. McCain.

1385
01:09:34,658 --> 01:09:36,647
- You heard it, good.

1386
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:38,198
Then you can appreciate the purpose

1387
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:39,309
of my visit.

1388
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:41,843
I want the deeds to all
the Mullet Beach properties

1389
01:09:41,843 --> 01:09:44,633
you purchased on behalf of McCain's.

1390
01:09:44,633 --> 01:09:46,069
We're giving them back.

1391
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:47,525
- No can do.

1392
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:49,267
- What's the problem, they're in the bank?

1393
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:51,142
- No, they're right here in the safe.

1394
01:09:51,142 --> 01:09:52,787
But my boss told me to leave them

1395
01:09:52,787 --> 01:09:53,944
where they are.

1396
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:55,611
- Al, I'm your boss.

1397
01:09:56,604 --> 01:09:58,632
- I'm afraid not, you were relieved

1398
01:09:58,632 --> 01:10:00,254
of command yesterday.

1399
01:10:00,254 --> 01:10:01,784
Richard Gray is now the general manager

1400
01:10:01,784 --> 01:10:02,784
of McCain's.

1401
01:10:04,356 --> 01:10:06,189
They reckon you're a few shrimp short

1402
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:07,772
of the full barbie.

1403
01:10:10,009 --> 01:10:11,922
- So you won't give me the deeds, then?

1404
01:10:11,922 --> 01:10:13,545
- Clint and I are the only ones

1405
01:10:13,545 --> 01:10:16,029
who know the combination, Mr. McCain.

1406
01:10:16,029 --> 01:10:19,158
And I'm afraid they're
no longer your property.

1407
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:22,730
So if you don't mind, we have work to do.

1408
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,563
- Good day, gentlemen.

1409
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:31,258
(creak)

1410
01:10:31,258 --> 01:10:33,256
- Mick, have you seen Bobby anywhere?

1411
01:10:33,256 --> 01:10:34,834
- Have you tried skinnies?

1412
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:36,527
- Mick, I've been up and down the coast,

1413
01:10:36,527 --> 01:10:38,208
we've got to find him.

1414
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:39,274
- Mrs. B's?

1415
01:10:39,274 --> 01:10:40,370
- I've been there, Mick.

1416
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:41,609
His bags are gone.

1417
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:43,777
- Look, he figures everybody hate him,

1418
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:45,682
he's probably going back to the States.

1419
01:10:45,682 --> 01:10:48,849
- Mick, please, I wanna see him again.

1420
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,001
- All right, there is one place

1421
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:53,001
he could be.

1422
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:56,265
(huffs)

1423
01:10:58,544 --> 01:11:02,544
(optimistic instrumental music)

1424
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:12,665
Where are you off to?

1425
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:14,150
Trying to skip out on the team

1426
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,067
before the titles, huh?

1427
01:11:16,912 --> 01:11:18,383
- Bobby, I don't want you to go back

1428
01:11:18,383 --> 01:11:19,550
to the States.

1429
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,637
- We need you, mate.

1430
01:11:24,268 --> 01:11:25,985
Let me put it this way,

1431
01:11:25,985 --> 01:11:27,496
either you come with us now,

1432
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:30,740
or I'll let Killer here
rearrange your features.

1433
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:33,133
(barking)

1434
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:35,667
- Unless we can get a hold of those deeds,

1435
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,102
McCain's will force Julie here to sell up

1436
01:11:38,102 --> 01:11:40,647
and push ahead with the old development.

1437
01:11:40,647 --> 01:11:42,698
- But it's your company,
why don't you stop them?

1438
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,487
- I've been squeezed out, son.

1439
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:46,759
They say I'm not sane.

1440
01:11:46,759 --> 01:11:47,833
- Gray?

1441
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:50,000
- Yeah, and my good wife is in there

1442
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,583
somewhere, as well.

1443
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:53,994
- [Julie] So what do we do?

1444
01:11:53,994 --> 01:11:56,326
- Stall them, I'll get the company back.

1445
01:11:56,326 --> 01:11:59,803
If we can just get our
hand on those deeds.

1446
01:11:59,803 --> 01:12:02,675
(suspenseful music)

1447
01:12:02,675 --> 01:12:04,741
- Bobcat to Mullet Beach,
we've got ourselves

1448
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:06,158
a right dickhead.

1449
01:12:58,054 --> 01:12:59,647
- Take the car, it's not mine,

1450
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,980
it's my uncle's.

1451
01:13:01,815 --> 01:13:03,468
- We don't want the car.

1452
01:13:03,468 --> 01:13:07,021
- You, I'll get you for this, you prick.

1453
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:08,611
- And me too, I hope.

1454
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:10,382
- Oh, Christ, the daily double,

1455
01:13:10,382 --> 01:13:11,708
piss off, Yank.

1456
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,103
- Did you say Yank?

1457
01:13:13,103 --> 01:13:15,270
(screams)

1458
01:13:18,342 --> 01:13:21,405
- You bastards, you'll pay for this.

1459
01:13:21,405 --> 01:13:22,461
- He's right, you know,

1460
01:13:22,461 --> 01:13:23,409
he can identify us.

1461
01:13:23,409 --> 01:13:24,672
- You bet I can, you're gonna

1462
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:25,773
rot in jail.

1463
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:28,669
- Oh, jail, I don't wanna rot in jail,

1464
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:29,540
do you?

1465
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:30,852
- Certainly not.

1466
01:13:30,852 --> 01:13:33,342
- I guess we'll have
to do him in after all.

1467
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,220
- What?

1468
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,329
You mean?

1469
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:38,045
- Unless, unless he tells us

1470
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:39,960
what we wanna know.

1471
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,894
- What are you talking about?

1472
01:13:41,894 --> 01:13:44,234
- The safe in your uncle's office.

1473
01:13:44,234 --> 01:13:47,651
- All we want are the numbers to open it.

1474
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:50,557
(spits)

1475
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:52,212
- Oh, man.

1476
01:13:52,212 --> 01:13:54,615
(laughs)

1477
01:13:54,615 --> 01:13:58,365
- If that's the way you
wanna play it, Kylie.

1478
01:13:59,991 --> 01:14:01,970
- What's this, dog food?

1479
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,424
You gonna make me eat it?

1480
01:14:03,424 --> 01:14:05,051
Man, I'd eat dog shit before

1481
01:14:05,051 --> 01:14:06,718
I told you anything.

1482
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,499
What are you doing?

1483
01:14:18,989 --> 01:14:21,004
(gasping)

1484
01:14:21,004 --> 01:14:21,837
- Oh, man.

1485
01:14:22,774 --> 01:14:23,607
Oh.

1486
01:14:25,281 --> 01:14:27,110
- Right, rub it in.

1487
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:28,127
- You rub it in.

1488
01:14:28,127 --> 01:14:30,294
- Uh uh, don't look at me.

1489
01:14:33,893 --> 01:14:36,702
(squishing)
(groans)

1490
01:14:36,702 --> 01:14:37,929
- Oh god, don't look,

1491
01:14:37,929 --> 01:14:39,372
I think he's enjoying it.

1492
01:14:39,372 --> 01:14:42,455
- For the last time, the combination.

1493
01:14:43,423 --> 01:14:45,444
- Frig you, all of you.

1494
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:47,527
(crying)

1495
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:50,168
- It's time.

1496
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,090
- Dinner time.

1497
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,394
(barking)

1498
01:14:54,394 --> 01:14:56,013
Killer.

1499
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:57,535
(growling)

1500
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,868
(screaming)

1501
01:15:04,729 --> 01:15:07,340
(laughing)

1502
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,403
- He still back here.

1503
01:15:09,403 --> 01:15:11,894
Okay, where should we hide the deeds?

1504
01:15:11,894 --> 01:15:14,012
- Oh, right in here.

1505
01:15:14,012 --> 01:15:15,699
(chuckling)

1506
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:17,025
- Is it gonna be all right in there?

1507
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:18,418
- Oh yeah, sure, no worries.

1508
01:15:18,418 --> 01:15:19,251
- Sure.

1509
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:23,023
- Taxi, taxi, Mullet Beach!

1510
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:26,356
- Mullet Beach, you've gotta be kidding.

1511
01:15:27,232 --> 01:15:28,732
- What's he doing?

1512
01:15:31,003 --> 01:15:32,416
- Ah, don't worry about him,

1513
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:33,604
we'll get the sea plane,

1514
01:15:33,604 --> 01:15:35,187
it will be quicker.

1515
01:15:43,437 --> 01:15:44,676
- Mr. Eastman.

1516
01:15:44,676 --> 01:15:46,092
- Mrs. McCain.

1517
01:15:46,092 --> 01:15:47,732
- Where's McCain?

1518
01:15:47,732 --> 01:15:49,115
- Oh, the big one's gone to ground,

1519
01:15:49,115 --> 01:15:50,906
and the little one's down the beach.

1520
01:15:50,906 --> 01:15:53,036
You see, we have these
surf lifesaving titles.

1521
01:15:53,036 --> 01:15:54,370
- Is everything under control?

1522
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,466
- No worries, he tried to get the

1523
01:15:55,466 --> 01:15:57,099
deeds off me, but I told him to,

1524
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:58,534
disappear.

1525
01:15:58,534 --> 01:16:00,030
- Are the deeds safe?

1526
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:02,818
- No worries, we're set like jellies.

1527
01:16:02,818 --> 01:16:04,108
- We're set like what?

1528
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:05,445
- We're set like,

1529
01:16:05,445 --> 01:16:07,447
ah, doesn't matter, it's an expression.

1530
01:16:07,447 --> 01:16:09,196
- Have you purchased the clubhouse yet?

1531
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:10,434
- Ah, there's the problem.

1532
01:16:10,434 --> 01:16:12,348
You see, the lady who
owns it won't sell it.

1533
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:14,286
- And what are you doing about it?

1534
01:16:14,286 --> 01:16:15,421
- Well like I was saying before,

1535
01:16:15,421 --> 01:16:17,032
we have this surf lifesaving competition,

1536
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:18,299
teams from all over the country

1537
01:16:18,299 --> 01:16:19,206
will be here.

1538
01:16:19,206 --> 01:16:20,843
- I'm sure it's great, but what does

1539
01:16:20,843 --> 01:16:22,223
it have to do with the clubhouse?

1540
01:16:22,223 --> 01:16:24,011
- Mullet Beach will lose
like they do every year,

1541
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:25,480
and then the association
will throw them out.

1542
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,486
- So?

1543
01:16:26,486 --> 01:16:27,653
- So that means that there will be

1544
01:16:27,653 --> 01:16:29,373
no more funds, which means no more money

1545
01:16:29,373 --> 01:16:30,206
for the clubhouse,

1546
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:31,230
no more money for Miss Julie Thomas,

1547
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,071
she can't pay her mortgage,

1548
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:34,196
she'll have to sell, no risk.

1549
01:16:34,196 --> 01:16:35,671
- There better not be.

1550
01:16:35,671 --> 01:16:36,957
- Would you like to watch Mullet Beach

1551
01:16:36,957 --> 01:16:38,285
go down the dunny?

1552
01:16:38,285 --> 01:16:40,398
- Go down the what?

1553
01:16:40,398 --> 01:16:42,148
- It's an expression.

- Sorry, I'm out.

1559
01:17:00,096 --> 01:17:01,094

1561

- Yeah, last.

Max Foisen.

1588
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:00,241

- You said they'd come last, you idiot!

1593
01:18:40,656 --> 01:18:42,967
- And they will, we still got tomorrow.

1594
01:18:42,967 --> 01:18:45,127
- Hey, if they do as well today,

1595
01:18:45,127 --> 01:18:46,865
they'll win the damn thing!

1596
01:18:46,865 --> 01:18:48,070
I don't like this.

1597
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:49,373
I don't like this at all.

1598
01:18:49,373 --> 01:18:50,558
- You do realize, we're going to

1599
01:18:50,558 --> 01:18:52,044
get the title deeds to her property,

1600
01:18:52,044 --> 01:18:53,312
and that way we can piss the bitch off

1601
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:56,335
out of the clubhouse, keep
smiling, keep smiling.

1602
01:18:56,335 --> 01:18:58,088
- Fourth and tenth, they've got a punt.

1603
01:18:58,088 --> 01:18:58,921
- What?

1604
01:18:59,796 --> 01:19:01,796
- That is an expression.

1605
01:19:05,285 --> 01:19:06,224
- [Julie] Hi.

1606
01:19:06,224 --> 01:19:07,235
- [Bobby] Who's this?

1607
01:19:07,235 --> 01:19:08,985
- Bobby, I've got a surprise for you.

1608
01:19:08,985 --> 01:19:11,651
Anne Marie, your mother.

1609
01:19:11,651 --> 01:19:12,484
- Bobby.

1610
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:16,151
Hi, welcome home.

1611
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:22,157
- I don't believe it.

1612
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,505
- Go on, you really do--

1613
01:19:23,505 --> 01:19:24,338
- Thanks.

1614
01:19:24,338 --> 01:19:25,819
- [Anne Marie] Look wonderful, oh.

1615
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:28,118
- He would have never
have done it by himself.

1616
01:19:28,118 --> 01:19:30,285
- I'm so happy to see you.

1617
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,608
- Eastman, I am worried about the deeds,

1618
01:19:33,608 --> 01:19:35,094
go get the deeds.

1619
01:19:35,094 --> 01:19:36,473
- No worries, Clint and I are

1620
01:19:36,473 --> 01:19:37,848
the only ones who know the combination

1621
01:19:37,848 --> 01:19:38,848
of the safe.

1622
01:19:46,646 --> 01:19:47,579
- Eastman.

1623
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:48,484
- Clinton!

1624
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:49,948
- You idiot!

1625
01:19:49,948 --> 01:19:51,694
- I'll kill him!

1626
01:19:51,694 --> 01:19:54,285
- Three cheers for Mullet Beach, guys.

1627
01:19:54,285 --> 01:19:55,897
- Hip hooray.

1628
01:19:55,897 --> 01:19:58,837
- We haven't saved the club yet.

1629
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:01,614
- So, long time, Anne Marie.

1630
01:20:01,614 --> 01:20:03,458
- You're looking good, Mike.

1631
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,345
- Bull, I look terrible.

1632
01:20:05,345 --> 01:20:07,381
If I'd stayed in LA one more week,

1633
01:20:07,381 --> 01:20:08,982
I'd be dead by now.

1634
01:20:08,982 --> 01:20:10,616
- You should have never gone back there

1635
01:20:10,616 --> 01:20:11,921
in the first place.

1636
01:20:11,921 --> 01:20:13,534
- Haven't changed, have you?

1637
01:20:13,534 --> 01:20:15,211
Still tell me what's good for me.

1638
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:17,283
- And you're still not listening?

1639
01:20:17,283 --> 01:20:18,223
- You two taking up where

1640
01:20:18,223 --> 01:20:19,056
you left off?

1641
01:20:19,056 --> 01:20:21,369
- Yeah, me being a jerk again.

1642
01:20:21,369 --> 01:20:22,452
Sorry, Annie.

1643
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:25,165
What?

1644
01:20:25,165 --> 01:20:27,426
- Oh, I just haven't been called Annie

1645
01:20:27,426 --> 01:20:28,676
in a long time.

1646
01:20:36,701 --> 01:20:38,038
Shouldn't you go and talk

1647
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:39,727
to your wife?

1648
01:20:39,727 --> 01:20:41,036
- The little darling's been trying

1649
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,786
to poison me, she and her friend.

1650
01:20:44,937 --> 01:20:45,770
It's over.

1651
01:20:48,186 --> 01:20:51,553
I hope the two of them
live happily ever after.

1652
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:55,611
- So did they take over
the business, I mean?

1653
01:20:55,611 --> 01:20:57,665
- Nah, we've got them, haven't we, Son?

1654
01:20:57,665 --> 01:20:59,805
- Well, if you can hold on to those deeds

1655
01:20:59,805 --> 01:21:01,118
until you can sort things out in LA.

1656
01:21:01,118 --> 01:21:03,543
- Yeah, and prove that I'm not a psycho.

1657
01:21:03,543 --> 01:21:05,710
- That may not be so easy.

1658
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,169
- You know, I might just go over and see

1659
01:21:09,169 --> 01:21:11,428
if I can find anything out.

1660
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:12,261
Excuse me.

1661
01:21:16,313 --> 01:21:18,288
- You did a good job, Mike.

1662
01:21:18,288 --> 01:21:19,465
I like him.

1663
01:21:19,465 --> 01:21:21,419
- Chalk it up to genes.

1664
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:23,601
On his mother's side.

1665
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:24,934
- Hello Richard,

1666
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:26,943
hi Mommy.

1667
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,890
- Two mothers in the same bar,

1668
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,703
pretty confusing, aye?

1669
01:21:31,703 --> 01:21:32,715
- Oh, not really,

1670
01:21:32,715 --> 01:21:34,483
only one of them is a real mother.

1671
01:21:34,483 --> 01:21:35,943
- What do you want, junior?

1672
01:21:35,943 --> 01:21:37,676
- Oh, just wanted to know

1673
01:21:37,676 --> 01:21:39,128
how it went with the deeds.

1674
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:40,206
- We'll get them.

1675
01:21:40,206 --> 01:21:41,361
- Sure you will.

1676
01:21:41,361 --> 01:21:42,844
- Bobby, your father's no longer in

1677
01:21:42,844 --> 01:21:44,480
control of the company,
now he can pass out

1678
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,200
all the deeds he wants to,
it doesn't mean a thing.

1679
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,311
- Poor Mikey is gaga.

1680
01:21:49,311 --> 01:21:50,675
- There's nothing wrong with him,

1681
01:21:50,675 --> 01:21:51,790
you can see that.

1682
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:52,749
- Now, maybe.

1683
01:21:52,749 --> 01:21:55,177
But you saw how he was acting in LA,

1684
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:57,225
crazy as a loon.

1685
01:21:57,225 --> 01:21:58,614
- He was fine.

1686
01:21:58,614 --> 01:22:00,943
- He was nuts, staring at the sun,

1687
01:22:00,943 --> 01:22:04,015
playing in the mud, I drove him nuts.

1688
01:22:04,015 --> 01:22:04,848
- Donna.

1689
01:22:04,848 --> 01:22:05,961
- Oh, what the hell?

1690
01:22:05,961 --> 01:22:08,078
Who's gonna believe Bobby boy?

1691
01:22:08,078 --> 01:22:10,402
Big Mike McCain's son and heir?

1692
01:22:10,402 --> 01:22:13,924
I kept him drugged out
of his brains with these.

1693
01:22:13,924 --> 01:22:15,815
He was crazy, all right.

1694
01:22:15,815 --> 01:22:16,862
- That's enough.

1695
01:22:16,862 --> 01:22:17,751
(giggling)

1696
01:22:17,751 --> 01:22:19,330
And no point in telling anyone,

1697
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:20,842
the pills leave no trace.

1698
01:22:20,842 --> 01:22:24,009
No one will ever believe you, come on.

1699
01:22:25,913 --> 01:22:28,374
- You know, there's
never been anyone else.

1700
01:22:28,374 --> 01:22:29,330
- No?

1701
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:32,509
Three wives, several constant companions,

1702
01:22:32,509 --> 01:22:33,981
not to mention girlfriends.

1703
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:35,554
- Are you keeping score?

1704
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:38,206
- That would be a full-time occupation.

1705
01:22:38,206 --> 01:22:40,669
And looking at the lovely Donna,

1706
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:42,842
I don't really think I could be bothered.

1707
01:22:42,842 --> 01:22:43,925
- Me neither.

1708
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,769
- Aren't you supposed to be mad?

1709
01:22:51,769 --> 01:22:53,120
- Totally crazy.

1710
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,884
(laughs)

1711
01:22:54,884 --> 01:22:55,850
(woman screaming)

1712
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:57,017
- What's that?

1713
01:22:58,058 --> 01:23:00,725
(ominous music)

1714
01:23:02,776 --> 01:23:04,859
(groans)

1715
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,510
(groaning)

1716
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,528
- Oh my god, Kylie, are you okay?

1717
01:23:16,528 --> 01:23:19,229
- [Bobby] I've got her feet.

1718
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:20,062
Easy.

1719
01:23:23,808 --> 01:23:25,022
You're all right.

1720
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:27,685
- Some crazy guy in roller blades.

1721
01:23:27,685 --> 01:23:28,628
- He took the deeds.

1722
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,253
- Gray.

1723
01:23:30,253 --> 01:23:34,578
- Don't worry, everything's under control.

1724
01:23:34,578 --> 01:23:36,258
(laughing)

1725
01:23:36,258 --> 01:23:37,692
- We've got the deeds.

1726
01:23:37,692 --> 01:23:39,164
(shrieking)

1727
01:23:39,164 --> 01:23:40,483
We've got Big Mike.

1728
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:42,733
- And I've got Big Richard.

1729
01:23:44,195 --> 01:23:45,508
- [Announcer] Welcome again, folks,

1730
01:23:45,508 --> 01:23:47,141
to the North Coast championships,

1731
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:48,777
and what a splendid day,

1732
01:23:48,777 --> 01:23:50,408
and a special hi to Mrs--

1733
01:23:50,408 --> 01:23:51,769
- It's only a slight concussion,

1734
01:23:51,769 --> 01:23:53,298
she's gonna be okay, but that leaves us

1735
01:23:53,298 --> 01:23:55,328
without a suite for the boat race.

1736
01:23:55,328 --> 01:23:56,607
- [Tishi] What about Bobby?

1737
01:23:56,607 --> 01:23:58,361
- Nah, it's too close to the iron man,

1738
01:23:58,361 --> 01:24:00,528
we might have to pull out.

1739
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:02,282
Unless?

1740
01:24:03,969 --> 01:24:05,219
- No way, Jose.

1741
01:24:06,366 --> 01:24:08,354
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to announce

1742
01:24:08,354 --> 01:24:10,366
the finals of the surf boat race,

1743
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:13,330
sponsored by Skyland
Drive Ins at click clack

1744
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:14,497
from the back.

1745
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:17,417
I'd like the competitors to please stand

1746
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:19,024
by their clubs.

1747
01:24:19,024 --> 01:24:20,197
- Okay.

1748
01:24:20,197 --> 01:24:21,640
- How's your head?

1749
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,010
- Oh, I'm all right.

1750
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:24,306
- Ladies and gentleman, I'd just like

1751
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:25,686
to announce that Johnny
Jake from Woodbaum,

1752
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,472
his wife has just given
birth to Joshua John,

1753
01:24:27,472 --> 01:24:29,614
just last night, a big round of applause

1754
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:32,447
for Johnny Jake and his wife Anna,

1755
01:24:33,923 --> 01:24:35,923
are you right, Reg, Reg?

1756
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:39,825
(pistol fires)

1757
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:40,978
(suspenseful music)

1758
01:24:40,978 --> 01:24:42,012
What a beautiful day, Christmas day

1759
01:24:42,012 --> 01:24:42,864
on the beach, folks.

1760
01:24:42,864 --> 01:24:44,537
While our lifeguards are fighting for the

1761
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:46,753
biggest range, and his part of the world,

1762
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,112
the snow keeps falling down.

1763
01:24:48,112 --> 01:24:49,559
Now, for the rest of this course,

1764
01:24:49,559 --> 01:24:51,519
for the moment, are you ready, lads?

1765
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,070
In first place, Red Beach,

1766
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:55,054
85 points and leading by a

1767
01:24:55,054 --> 01:24:56,879
(crowd cheering)

1768
01:24:56,879 --> 01:24:58,312
- Go guys!

1769
01:24:58,312 --> 01:25:00,485
- [Al] Let's hear it for the fans.

1770
01:25:00,485 --> 01:25:01,935
(clacking)

1771
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:04,552
Next, the dark horse with
83 points, Bar Beach,

1772
01:25:04,552 --> 01:25:06,635
next, with 80 points are,

1773
01:25:08,023 --> 01:25:09,958
who should have been disqualified,

1774
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:11,208
with 75 points,

1775
01:25:24,609 --> 01:25:26,942
(splashing)

1776
01:25:45,827 --> 01:25:48,577
(crowd cheering)

1777
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,621
- [Man] Keep it straight!

1778
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:02,038
Clint, you idiot!

1779
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:19,538
(cheering)
(screaming)

1780
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:26,714
- Go.

1781
01:26:29,734 --> 01:26:33,901
(cheering)
(bells ringing)

1782
01:26:49,949 --> 01:26:52,361
- Bobby McCain, the great surf hero.

1783
01:26:52,361 --> 01:26:54,318
It's not gonna work, you know.

1784
01:26:54,318 --> 01:26:55,838
We've got the deeds back,

1785
01:26:55,838 --> 01:26:57,122
won't be hard to convince the board

1786
01:26:57,122 --> 01:26:58,618
your father's still mad.

1787
01:26:58,618 --> 01:27:00,623
- You may as well forget it, Bobby.

1788
01:27:00,623 --> 01:27:02,058
- Listen, Bobby boy,

1789
01:27:02,058 --> 01:27:04,043
Donna and I play for keeps.

1790
01:27:04,043 --> 01:27:06,070
You're way in over your head.

1791
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:08,535
- Do you always talk in cliches?

1792
01:27:08,535 --> 01:27:10,116
- Well, unlike you I'm not here

1793
01:27:10,116 --> 01:27:11,629
under false pretenses.

1794
01:27:11,629 --> 01:27:13,238
- They know how I am.

1795
01:27:13,238 --> 01:27:16,238
And I know exactly what you two are.

1796
01:27:17,581 --> 01:27:18,414
Dad!

1797
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:23,120
- Hello, Richard.

1798
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,194
And how's my faithful little wife?

1799
01:27:26,194 --> 01:27:28,233
Pumping me full of those ugly little pills

1800
01:27:28,233 --> 01:27:29,841
wasn't very nice, darling.

1801
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:32,134
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1802
01:27:32,134 --> 01:27:33,080
- Really?

1803
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,925
When I got Bobby this little toy,

1804
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:37,588
I thought it might come in handy some day.

1805
01:27:37,588 --> 01:27:38,887
- [Bobby] It did.

1806
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:40,354
- [Donna on Recording] I kept him drugged

1807
01:27:40,354 --> 01:27:41,725
out of his brain with these.

1808
01:27:41,725 --> 01:27:43,410
He was crazy, all right.

1809
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:44,866
(laughs)

1810
01:27:44,866 --> 01:27:46,412
- I want both your resignations

1811
01:27:46,412 --> 01:27:48,630
from the board of my company, immediately.

1812
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,547
My lawyer is drawing up the papers.

1813
01:27:52,896 --> 01:27:53,729
(thud)

1814
01:27:53,729 --> 01:27:55,729
(crash)

1815
01:27:59,384 --> 01:28:02,075
And I suggest you return the deeds.

1816
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:03,964
This is virtually a confession

1817
01:28:03,964 --> 01:28:05,881
to an attempted murder.

1818
01:28:07,058 --> 01:28:08,923
- I can walk.

1819
01:28:08,923 --> 01:28:09,756
- Bye!

1820
01:28:14,793 --> 01:28:16,942
(pistol fires)
(crowd cheering)

1821
01:28:16,942 --> 01:28:20,025
(suspenseful music)

1822
01:28:21,646 --> 01:28:23,779
- With my nephew, Clint Eastman,

1823
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:25,131
way out in front, let's hear it

1824
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:27,029
for my nephew, give it right here,

1825
01:28:27,029 --> 01:28:29,403
I got fifty to one on him, go Clint, go!

1826
01:28:29,403 --> 01:28:30,687
Go, Clint go!

1827
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:33,020
(splashing)

1828
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,193
- Go, go!

1829
01:28:47,025 --> 01:28:48,081
- Come on, Bobby!

1830
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:49,166
- Come on, Bobby!

1831
01:28:49,166 --> 01:28:50,131
Bobby!

1832
01:28:50,131 --> 01:28:51,131
- Bobby, go!

1833
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:06,816
- All right, he's way ahead now!

1834
01:29:08,365 --> 01:29:11,115
(crowd cheering)

1835
01:29:24,146 --> 01:29:26,313
- [Al] It's Clint Eastman!

1836
01:29:33,048 --> 01:29:35,381
(splashing)

1837
01:29:47,434 --> 01:29:48,934
- We're gonna win!

1838
01:29:50,275 --> 01:29:51,525
Go, baby, yeah!

1839
01:30:00,816 --> 01:30:02,066
- Bobby, Bobby!

1840
01:30:21,755 --> 01:30:23,922
- Go, yeah, we're winning!

1841
01:30:32,269 --> 01:30:33,352
- No, get up!

1842
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:35,930
- Get him!

1843
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,680
(crowd cheering)

1844
01:31:00,618 --> 01:31:01,451
- No!

1845
01:31:03,909 --> 01:31:05,909
- Let's get out of here.

1846
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:09,145
(cheering)

1847
01:31:18,021 --> 01:31:19,369
- I'm sorry, Uncle Alfie.

1848
01:31:19,369 --> 01:31:20,953
(thud)

1849
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:23,036
- And it's Al, you idiot.

1850
01:31:24,084 --> 01:31:26,834
(group cheering)

1851
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:31,969
(gasping)

1852
01:31:31,969 --> 01:31:33,646
(screaming)

1853
01:31:33,646 --> 01:31:35,522
(splash)

1854
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:37,257
- Distinguished guests,

1855
01:31:37,257 --> 01:31:39,012
ladies and gentlemen,

1856
01:31:39,012 --> 01:31:42,082
(bird squawks)

1857
01:31:42,082 --> 01:31:44,961
ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce

1858
01:31:44,961 --> 01:31:49,091
the winners of the Surf
Lifesaving Club Title,

1859
01:31:49,091 --> 01:31:50,348
- Mullet Beach!

1860
01:31:50,348 --> 01:31:52,589
(crowd cheering)

1861
01:31:52,589 --> 01:31:55,021
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the Mullet Beach captain,

1862
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:56,249
Mick Dooley!

1863
01:31:56,249 --> 01:31:57,082
- Come on,

1864
01:31:57,082 --> 01:31:58,062
- Come on, lady.

1865
01:31:58,062 --> 01:31:58,950
(thud)

1866
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:01,439
- Oh, sorry, Mr. Eastman.

1867
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:02,439
- Thank you.

1868
01:32:03,386 --> 01:32:04,859
Thanks very much, I'd like to thank

1869
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:07,437
our supporters, and of course,

1870
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:09,965
the club members, thank you club members.

1871
01:32:09,965 --> 01:32:11,892
(cheering)
(applause)

1872
01:32:11,892 --> 01:32:14,069
Al Eastman, you're a wonderful man.

1873
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:15,061
- Get up, get up.

1874
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:17,460
You're pathetic, just get away.

1875
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,163
Now I think you should all know,

1876
01:32:19,163 --> 01:32:20,860
this could never have been possible

1877
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:24,225
without the help of one man, Bobby McCain.

1878
01:32:24,225 --> 01:32:25,616
Bobby, up here.

1879
01:32:25,616 --> 01:32:29,783
(crowd cheering)
(applause)

1880
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:35,621
- Well I'd like to take all the credit

1881
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:38,060
for it, but I can't, it
was a team effort, huh?

1882
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,349
Let's give another hand
for the Mullets, yeah!

1883
01:32:40,349 --> 01:32:42,311
(applauding)
(cheering)

1884
01:32:42,311 --> 01:32:45,321
- (whoops) Mullets!

1885
01:32:45,321 --> 01:32:47,217
- I know you're all waiting to

1886
01:32:47,217 --> 01:32:49,665
hear about the tourist development,

1887
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:51,656
and I'm pleased to announce that it will

1888
01:32:51,656 --> 01:32:52,906
be going ahead,

1889
01:32:53,838 --> 01:32:55,921
but not as first planned.

1890
01:32:57,175 --> 01:33:00,309
The community has passed
my father's designs

1891
01:33:00,309 --> 01:33:04,858
for an environmentally-friendly
cooperative development.

1892
01:33:04,858 --> 01:33:07,049
We can't stop progress,

1893
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:11,516
but we sure can plan the
impact for our futures.

1894
01:33:11,516 --> 01:33:15,701
(crowd cheering)
(applause)

1895
01:33:15,701 --> 01:33:17,678
- This is crazy, I can't believe you!

1896
01:33:17,678 --> 01:33:20,197
- [Richard] No, you are
an idiot, Al Eastman!

1897
01:33:20,197 --> 01:33:24,197
(thud)
(groans)

1898
01:33:28,951 --> 01:33:30,300
- Thank you.

1899
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,669
- Sorry excuse for an American!

1900
01:33:32,669 --> 01:33:33,619
- Don't hit me!

1901
01:33:33,619 --> 01:33:35,673
- You're disgusting, and I hate you!

1902
01:33:35,673 --> 01:33:37,590
I hate you, I hate you!

1903
01:33:39,707 --> 01:33:41,428
(booing)

1904
01:33:41,428 --> 01:33:42,686
- Give her a real one.

1905
01:33:42,686 --> 01:33:44,316
- Hey, come on you two.

1906
01:33:44,316 --> 01:33:45,149
Come on.

01:33:46,737 --> 01:33:49,487
