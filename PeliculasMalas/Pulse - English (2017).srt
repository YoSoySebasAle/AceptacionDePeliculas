00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,594
(inhales deeply)

4
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:14,645
Um, hello.

5
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,765
I'm all fine.

6
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:19,578
Okay, Oliver, how are you
feeling now?

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,079
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- You good?

8
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,247
- Yeah.
- Doing well?

9
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:25,175
I need you to tell me your
full name and date of birth.

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,428
Oliver Joseph Delaney,
30th of first, 1997.

11
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:31,203
You always have to have
all these catheters

12
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,663
and enemas and...

13
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,095
- All that stuff.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,597
I'm just gonna
give you a bit of this.

15
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,481
[Olly] Okay.

16
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:40,599
[Nurse] Just gonna
settle you a bit.

17
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,756
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,268
Should I be counting?

19
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:44,111
[Nurse] Not yet, no.

20
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:46,196
But I will let you know.
- Okay, sorry.

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,906
[Woman] What have you
had for your first outing

22
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,096
morning tea?

23
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:51,223
[Woman] Sugar?

24
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:58,439
A smarties cookie, a strawberry
milkshake, and a picnic.

25
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,285
[Woman] A picnic,
a smarties cookie

26
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:02,621
and a strawberry milkshake,
oh, that's a good look.

27
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,256
I'm just going to give you
some oxygen.

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,865
I just want you to breathe
normally, okay?

29
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,369
I tried to sit up today
but that hurt a lot and

30
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:15,706
I've got a little
button around here

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,250
that injects morphine into me.

32
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:21,482
[Woman] Yeah, so if it hurts
a lot, you can give yourself.

33
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:22,566
So I'm attaching your drip

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,500
for you, Oliver and I'm
gonna start that drip now,

35
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,739
so you should feel it
soon, so if you wanna start

36
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:31,650
your count from 10, I
reckon now is a good time.

37
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,265
Okay, yeah, um.

38
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:35,309
10.

39
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,330
Nine.

40
00:01:36,354 --> 00:01:37,394
Eight.

41
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:38,845
Seven.

42
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:39,824
Six.

43
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:43,525
(ambient electronic music)

44
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:53,202
(muffled speaking)

45
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,366

46
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:02,127
(muffled speaking)

47
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:09,468
Woo, woo, woo!
(chuckles)

48
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,180
(laughing)

49
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,643
(muffled speaking)

50
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,857
[Britney] Oh my gosh.

51
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,347
[Olly] Oh my gosh.
(laughing)

52
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,215
[Nat] How about I
just throw it at you all

53
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,475
and you all open your mouths?

54
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:39,977
Don't, my makeup!
(muffled laughing)

55
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:43,293
Do it to the boys, do it to the
boys.

("The Prelude To" by Lawrence
English)

57
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:52,564
Did you just get kicked in the
dick?

58
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:53,407
(Luke laughs)

59
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,400
Did you just get kicked in the
dick?

60
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:58,350
(muffled speaking)

61
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:04,523
Vagina, vag bash, that's a
vag bash, that's a hate crime.

62
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,862

63

(electronic beeping)

64
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,081
Just when I thought
you were tired.

65
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:25,957
(lips smacking)
- Mm, very tired.

66
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:27,397
Oh, hi, darling.

67
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,441
- 'Morning.
- How are you?

68
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:30,828
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

69
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:31,996
You've got a big
pimple on your back.

70
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,923
(chuckles) Yeah.

71
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:34,424
Is that from drinking
too much alcohol?

72
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,092
(Olly laughs)
It does, it makes it

73
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,969
so where you get pimples
in that whole area--

74
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:39,493
Okay, okay!

75
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,411
All right.

76
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:42,349
How you feeling?

77
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,475
[Olly] Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,676
- You alright?
- Yeah.

79
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,685
[Mum] Good night?

80
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,334
Yeah, it was great.

81
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,377
Big night?

82
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,538
[Mum] It looks like it.

83
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,684
[Mark] Do you want some
breakfast, man?

84
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,902
[Mum] You should have
something to eat, sweetheart.

85
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,854
I'm fine, I'm just gonna,
I'm just feeling a bit sick--

86
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:58,698
Why don't you take your
vitamins and have some water

87
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:01,451
and have something to eat
and you'll feel a bit better.

88
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,383
[Olly] I just woke up.

89
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:05,686
I know you just woke up.

90
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,699
Hey darl, there's this article
in here

91
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:11,900
about transplants coming to
Australia that Mark found.

92
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,539
You don't want to read it?

93
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:16,396
- No, I'm-
- It's just--

94
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,115
Mum, I'm okay, please.

95
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:20,720
- Have a read, man.
- You should read because,

96
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:24,182
yeah, it's quite, I would've
thrown it out and he just--

97
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:26,050
[Olly] Her boyfriend is
actually like a man-child.

98
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:27,102
Aw that's unfortunate.

99
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,554
Yeah, it's really gross,
it's like where the fuck

100
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:31,564
do you find them, like the--
- Hey, Luke, buddy!

101
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:32,983
- How you doing, man?
- Oh, hey, Olly.

102
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,058
Didn't see you there.

103
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:36,174
- Hey.
- Hey, catch, mate.

104
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,988
(chuckles) How you been, man,
did you go to Gabby's party

105
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:39,564
on the weekend?
- Yeah, what did you do?

106
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,199
Yeah, Sonny and I, we, uh,
there he is,

107
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:43,067
we were hanging out at the
Macca's car park, hanging out
with

108
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:45,570
these older girls.
- (chuckles) Fuck, man.

109
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:46,404
(chuckles) All right,
we gonna catch up soon.

110
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:47,238
All right mate?
- Yeah.

111
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:50,188
[Brandon] All right,

112
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:54,359
(Luke mumbles)
(Olly laughs)

113
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:58,772
(laughs)

114
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:00,532
- Hey!
- Hey!

115
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,587
- How ya going?
- Good, thanks.

116
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:03,722
- You all right?
- Yeah (laughs).

117
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,557
What are you up to?
(Nat mumbles)

118
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,206
[Olly] What are you doing?

119
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,211
Uh, I think we're just
gonna go to the movies.

120
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:16,882
Oh, okay,
are you guys like dating?

121
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,508
[Luke] Mm.

122
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:19,195
Yeah.

123
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,572
(Luke and Nat giggling)

124
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,053
Kinda.

125
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,513
That's awesome.

126
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:24,609
- Thanks, man.
- That's really,

127
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:25,891
really cool, guys.

128
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,121
Well.
- Yeah, well.

129
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:29,113
See ya.

130
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,637
[Nat] See you.

131
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,450
- See ya babe.
- See ya babe.

132
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,608
Aw.
(Olly laughs)

133
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:36,120
- See ya.
- See ya, bro.

134
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,444
(Olly chuckles)

135
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,715
Make sure you
use protection, guys.

136
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:39,457
[Luke] Go away.

137
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:43,492
- Be safe!
- [Luke] Go away.

138
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:45,653
[Nat] Ow!

139
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:50,477
[Luke] Really?
(Olly chuckles)

140
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:54,085
(gentle electronic music)

141
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,680
[Mum] Darling.

142
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,181
- Hey.
- How are you?

143
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,661
[Olly] Yeah, good,
how are you?

144
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,611
Yes, good, busy day,
how was school?

145
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,000
It was fine (sighs heavily).

146
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:25,617
Have you been waiting long?

147
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:28,578
What?

148
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,198
(laughs)

149
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,187
Were there many
people before you?

150
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:35,188
[Olly] Yeah.

151
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:38,255
Always running late,
it's really annoying.

152
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:39,526
Like someone else I know.

153
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,093
Mmm.
(Oliver chuckles)

154
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,804
(sighs) You okay?

155
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:47,264
Yeah, I'm fine.

156
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,101
Don't.
- Why?

157
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:52,863
Why can't I touch this?
- Stop it.

158
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:53,864
Seriously.

159
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:57,023
Can I just listen to my
music if that's cool?

160
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:58,002
Is it cool if I just
listen to my music?

161
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,630
Darling, you need
to speak more clearly.

162
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,547
(chuckles) You are so--

163
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,697
Do you learn it at school?

164
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:04,732
Enunciation?

165
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,325
- Clearly no.
- Sorry.

166
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:08,785
(Olly scoffs)

167
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:09,829
No, okay.

168
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:14,874
(sighs) I love it here.

169
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,669
(both chuckle)

170
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,067
- Oliver Delaney?
- Yes!

171
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:23,133
[Woman] You can go through.

172
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:32,559
If you can see here, your
right hip is severely damaged.

173
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:35,164
It's really a miracle
you can walk at all.

174
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,647
I'm not sure how you manage it,

175
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,210
but if you keep walking this
same way,

176
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,170
it will deteriorate to the
point where you'll need

177
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:43,028
a hip replacement.

178
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:45,082
How long before that
needs to happen?

179
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,720
Depends how he walks, his
bones are already compromised

180
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:51,369
because of the osteoporosis.

181
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:52,620
Maybe 10 years.

182
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,768
I would recommend getting
him into surgery now though

183
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,021
to release and lengthen
some of the ligaments

184
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,605
to help improve his walk.

185
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,767
Ah (chuckles) if you wanna
get him into surgery now,

186
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,694
why not do the hip
replacement now?

187
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,605
No point in replacing tires
if they're not worn out yet.

188
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:10,346
How do you know
if they're worn out?

189
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,725
Uh, you won't be
able to walk anymore.

190
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,782
You won't be able to put
weight on your right leg.

191
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,689
Plus, you'd feel it.

192
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:21,983
The pain, I mean.

193
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:26,382
And you're saying
this ligament operation

194
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:27,258
will prevent that?

195
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:29,866
[Doctor] Yes, hopefully.

196
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,888
How long will he
be in hospital for?

197
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:33,798
[Doctor] Two to three weeks,
but then in a wheelchair

198
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:35,800
for about three
months after that,

199
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,750
depending on how
quick he recovers.

200
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:45,340
Well, he usually recovers
pretty quickly, so.

201
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:47,802
Don't you?

202
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:51,972
Mm-hmm.

203
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,892
How do you feel?

204
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:57,811
I'm fine, can we just go?

205
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,846
Sorry about that, darling.

206
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:03,316
Why, did you do it,
did you fuck up my hip?

207
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:04,462
Was it you all along?

208
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,664
No, I haven't done anything,
I haven't done anything

209
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:08,655
about your rehab.

210
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,259
What are you talking
about, you took me here?

211
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,260
You do heaps--

212
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:14,786
We haven't done anything
for about a month.

213
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,099
(sighs heavily) And I've
been so busy and I'm just--

214
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:18,342
It's not your fault,
none of this shit

215
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,678
makes a fucking difference,
we'll just have the operation

216
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:21,854
and it'll sort it out, okay?

217
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:25,755
We don't, fucking rehab shit,
like me like doing squats

218
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,351
doesn't do diddly-squat, okay?

219
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,029
So like, fucking hell,
it's fine Mum, seriously.

220
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:32,044
Let's just go.

221
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:34,784
So what you're saying is
squats don't do diddly-squat?

222
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,286
That's exactly what I
just said, that's verbatim.

223
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,935
(chuckles)

224
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:42,032
Seriously Mum, it's fine,
it's not your fault.

225
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:43,773
It's life.

226
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:46,003
Okay, well, look, you go
in hospital on Monday, right?

227
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,004
[Olly] Yeah.

228
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:50,363
So it's Saturday
night, I think we'll have

229
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:54,450
all your friends over and
we'll have a big party.

230
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:57,996
Yeah?

231
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,050
- I can't believe I said that.
- Can we have alcohol?

232
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:02,061
(chuckles)
Can I have alcohol?

233
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:04,294
You can have two drinks.

234
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:07,483
Two drink, can people bring
alcohol?

235
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:10,227
Fuck, just don't tell me
about it, don't tell me.

236
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:11,904
(laughs) I won't tell
you, my lips are sealed.

237
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:12,863
I won't tell you a thing.

238
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,073
Okay?
- Thank you.

239
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:17,056
- All right, love you.
- Thank you, Mum.

240
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:18,808
Oh, I hate that place.

241
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,038
(laughs) I love it,
it's my favourite place.

242
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:22,329
It's my Disneyland.

243
00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:26,691
(music blaring)
(friends laughing)

244
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:34,135
- Olly!
- What?

245
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,262
Mum, I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine!

246
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:38,889
- Come and have water!
- I don't need any water!

247
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:39,913
Yes you do!

248
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:45,376
(laughs)

249
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,931
Why aren't you guys
dancing, it's a party.

250
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:50,289
(Nat mumbles)
All right.

251
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,924
Well, hello.

252
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,259
- Hey.
- Hi!

253
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:54,280
Ow!

254
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:57,241
Oh my God, just in
time, the party's so good!

255
00:11:57,265 --> 00:12:00,119
The party's so good, isn't
it guys, it's the best party.

256
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:01,779
It's better than last week.

257
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:03,781
- You're fucked!
- No, I'm not.

258
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:04,782
I'm having fun.

259
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:05,897
Who's that?

260
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:08,294
Is that your dad?

261
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:09,318
No.

262
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,420
It's my mum's boyfriend.

263
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:14,906
[Britney] He's a fucking babe.

264
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,794
Come dance with me,
come dance with me, babe.

265
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:17,961
Come dance with me!

266
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,096
- You have fun.
- Come dance with me!

267
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,913
No, oh my God, get off me!

268
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:26,084
(music blaring)
(students laughing)

269
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:55,071
Excuse me, I'm really
sorry, please, sorry.

270
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:02,578
(Olly breathing heavily)

271
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:16,968
(door knocking)

272
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:17,688
I'm coming!

273
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,031
[Mum] Olly, darling, you okay?

274
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:21,013
- Go away!
- I'm coming in.

275
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:24,194
No, go away, what the
fuck, get out, what the--

276
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,529
It's all right,
it's all right.

277
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:28,953
[Olly] Ow, what the fuck
are you doing, go away!

278
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,856
Get outta here!

279
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:31,669
I'm just--

280
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:33,870
[Olly] No, fuck,
please go away.

281
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:34,964
- It's okay.
- Please go.

282
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,131
It's okay, it's okay.

283
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:37,374
- Go away!
- Don't hit me.

284
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,052
It's all right, I just--
- Please go away!

285
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:42,159
Please go away.

286
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:43,973
I'm not going away, Olly.

287
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,288
[Olly] Fuck.

288
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,217
All right, darling,
I'm going to going away.

289
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:48,143
Go away!
Don't--

290
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,542
- Get away.
- Okay.

291
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:50,835
Hit me, fine.

292
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:57,227
[Mum] What happened,
did you get a bit drunk?

293
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:59,563
What do you think happened,
what do you think happened?

294
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:00,564
[Mum] Why'd you do that?

295
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:02,575
Why'd I pee myself,
'cause I felt like it.

296
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,068
I really wanted to pee myself.
- Why'd you drink so much?

297
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:08,978
Fuck off, you fucking
hypocrite.

298
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,374
Why?
- You fucking hypocrite.

299
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:13,168
- Why am I a hypocrite?
- Pot kettle black shit.

300
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,602
Fuck you, get out, get
out, get out, get out!

301
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:19,583
Get the fuck out, get
the fuck out right now!

302
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:20,990
(Mum chuckles)

303
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,344
- Now!
- All right, darling.

304
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:23,929
I'm gonna go get
some new pants--

305
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:25,514
[Olly] Don't get me new pants!

306
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:27,424
A glass of water
and a can of Coke--

307
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:28,309
[Olly] There's
water right here!

308
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,417
And you're going
to calm the fuck down!

309
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,543
- Ooh.
- Okay?

310
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,099
And furthermore, all of
your friends are going home.

311
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,267
[Olly] They're not going home!

312
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,436
It's one o'clock in the
morning, they're going home!

313
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,428
This is my house,
the party is over!

314
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,608
If you sent them home,
I'm actually, listen to me.

315
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:45,743
I'm gonna fucking kill
you if you send them home.

316
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:46,660
If you actually send them
home I'm not even joking.

317
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,204
You're not leaving, if you send
them home,

318
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,614
I'm actually gonna kill
you, you promise me

319
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,457
you're not gonna send them home.

320
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:52,374
[Mum] Okay,
here's what we don't do.

321
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:56,067
We don't threaten
to kill each other.

322
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:59,403
Fucking bitch.

323
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,072
That's what you are.

324
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:06,244
Fuck!

325
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,988
Ow.

326
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,060
It's not that bad.

327
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,136
[Olly] How would you
know, can you please stop?

328
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,305
Oh, fine, okay, look,
I've gotta go back to work,

329
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:17,546
so I'm gonna see you later.

330
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,111
- Mm-hmm.
- Drink lots of water, okay?

331
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,594
(lips smacking)

332
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Bye.

333
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:28,174
[Olly] Bye.

334
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:36,565
(breathing heavily)

335
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:42,154
(metal rattling)

336
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:50,412
(Olly grunting)

337
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,678
[Nurse] Are we ready,
one, two, three.

338
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:55,868
Ow!

339
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:59,349
[Nurse] Okay, shh, shh,
shh, there's people sleeping.

340
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:03,592
[Olly] Can you do it just
a little bit, can you please

341
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:05,823
just do it a little
bit gentler, please?

342
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:06,523
Almost done.

343
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:09,139
Okay, just go over this side.

344
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:13,385
(giggling)

345
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:14,498
- Hey man.
- (chuckles) Hey.

346
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:16,605
- Hey babe.
- Hi.

347
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,190
We got you these.

348
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:20,693
Everyone drew on them.

349
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,561
I drew a really, I can't--

350
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:24,655
You drew a rhubarb.

351
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,543
(laughs)
- [Olly] A rhubarb?

352
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,377
I thought it was appropriate.

353
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:29,212
'Cause, yeah,
'cause you're sweet.

354
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:30,430
- Are rhubarbs sweet?
- And I'm pretty sure

355
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:35,574
it says that rhubarbs are the
most intelligent vegetable.

356
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:37,854
Cool, why are
they big fat undies?

357
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,389
'Cause you've
got a big fat bum.

358
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:42,715
[Olly] (laughs)
But why undies anyway?

359
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,228
'Cause you're not wearing
any underwear (chuckles).

360
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:49,087
Oh, cool, so now I've got
my undies for my fat ass.

361
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:51,223
Yeah, how you feeling?

362
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,202
I'm good.

363
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:53,328
- You feeling, yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:55,664
- How's your leg?
- How's that, boop.

365
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:56,582
(chuckles)

366
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,856
(laughing)

367
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,317
Thanks so much for this, guys.

368
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,485
Fat baby.
(laughing)

369
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,381
[Olly] Fat baby?

370
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:06,488
- I do.
- Fat baby?

371
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:07,384
(laughing)
What?

372
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:08,585
It's what Gemma said.

373
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,262
[Olly] Fat baby, can I see?

374
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,180
- You had to be there.
- I was at Gemma's.

375
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:14,204
[Olly] Can I see?

376
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:16,248
Jo just drew a fat baby.

377
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:17,427
[Olly] Can I see?

378
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:19,396
He's always
doing shit like that.

379
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,087
- Jo is like--
- Oh my God.

380
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:26,091
[Luke] (chuckles)
See I told you.

381
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:29,906
Um, I drew you guys something.

382
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,242
- That looks so real.
- I know, he's really--

383
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:34,099
Present!

384
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:35,134
Oh wow.

385
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:36,780
Present!

386
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:37,853
Oh my gosh.

387
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:38,749
Oh wow.

388
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:39,708
Present!

389
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:40,732
Holy crap!

390
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,754
- That's crazy.
- Got nothing else to do.

391
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:45,756
- Did you draw these?
- Yeah.

392
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,114
[Nat] Babe, they're awesome.

393
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:50,135
Wow.

394
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:51,316
Far out, man.

395
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:53,452
- You're so good.
- Thanks.

396
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,224
Hey, sorry to be a bitch,
but we're gonna be late

397
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:57,581
for the movie.

398
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,468
[Luke] Oh shit.

399
00:17:58,492 --> 00:17:59,750
What movie?

400
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:01,293
We're gonna see-

401
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,148
Knife Wars.
- Knife Wars (chuckles).

402
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,809
I got some DVDs and stuff
if you guys wanted to--

403
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,384
It's not out on DVD.
(laughing)

404
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,407
Um, some of the other,
like, um, who's meeting,

405
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:15,340
Jo and I think Gabby's
gonna be there too.

406
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:16,745
- And Gemma.
- Gemma.

407
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:18,321
- Fucking Gemma.
- Fucking Gemma.

408
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,513
(friends laughing)
Oh yeah.

409
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:22,584
- Bye.
- See you babe.

410
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:25,253
I love you (lips smacking)
I'll come see you soon.

411
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:26,254
[Olly] Okay.

412
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:27,653
Boop.

413
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:29,165
See you babe.
- See you, man.

414
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:30,531
[Olly] See ya.

415
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:44,211
("A Prelude To" by
Lawrence English)

416
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,176
(keys clicking)

417
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:10,382
[Reporter] Finally, after
months of government approvals,

418
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:12,676
the controversial full-body
transplants

419
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,303
are making their way to
Australia, with trials

420
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,972
to start in the coming weeks.

421
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:19,474
Pioneered in Germany, the
transplants are for people

422
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,226
suffering from a terminal
illness

423
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,553
or with an untreatable
disability,

424
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:26,211
a chance at a whole new life.

425
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:30,425
Ow.

426
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:36,263
(metal rattling)

427
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,484
(grunts)

428
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:53,606
Ow.

429
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:13,759
(breathes heavily)

430
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:14,794
Ow.

431
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:22,434
(body thuds)
Ow.

432
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:24,561
(groans)

433
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:34,321
(breathes heavily)

434
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:39,034
Okay, give me your arm.

435
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:40,318
- Ready?
- Okay.

436
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,913
On three, so one, two, three.

437
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,749
[Mum] Hi darling.

438
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:48,461
Hey.

439
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:52,464
How you feeling?

440
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:53,665
Yeah, I'm fine.

441
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,333
- Mmm?
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,480
[Mum] Mark's got
you some more DVDs.

443
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:58,156
Oh.

444
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,657
Hopefully you don't have 'em.

445
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,409
[Olly] Thanks, thanks so much.

446
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,601
[Mum] Have you eaten,
sweetheart?

447
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:05,580
Yep.

448
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:08,458
[Mum] Oh, did you (chuckles)
how was it?

449
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:09,848
Hospital food.

450
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,350
(groans) Yuck (chuckles).

451
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:13,830
What have you guys been up to?

452
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:16,332
Oh, we just had a work,
a dinner thing for my work,

453
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:19,658
so it was a bit (laughs).

454
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:22,861
You been drinking?

455
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:27,082
I had a couple little
wines, dinner, so nothing--

456
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:33,505
I was actually just about
to go to bed guys, actually.

457
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,017
I'm sorry, guys--
- I'm not drunk.

458
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,760
I didn't say you were drunk,
I just said

459
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:42,097
I was about to go to bed, so.

460
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:43,515
Is that cool?

461
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,883
I'm tired.

462
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:47,519
But I haven't
seen you in ages.

463
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:48,873
I haven't gone anywhere.

464
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:50,834
Yeah, but darl, I thought
we could spend the night

465
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:54,025
together and watch
one of those DVDS.

466
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Lovey.

467
00:21:57,072 --> 00:22:00,991
Look, I'm fine, I'm
just, I'm just really tired

468
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:03,410
and I just want to go to bed.

469
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
What?

470
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:09,583
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:10,603
Why are you apologizing, you
haven't done anything wrong.

472
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:11,813
I'm sorry, it's been
a really fucking hard

473
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:14,524
couple of weeks, and I know
it's been hard for you too.

474
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:17,549
I can't imagine, I (sighs
heavily).

475
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,061
I haven't been around--
- Can you just fucking stop?

476
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:21,739
Okay, I'm sorry, this is
the reason why I don't wanna

477
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:23,908
fucking see you 'cause
you fucking do this shit.

478
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:27,161
I just said I'm fine, I'm tired,
I'm really fucking shitty.

479
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,761
I'm grumpy,
please just go, okay?

480
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:31,908
It's not you, it's got
nothing to do with you.

481
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:33,398
So please just go.

482
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:38,089
Can you give us a
minute alone, please?

483
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:39,821
Thanks, darl.
- Yeah.

484
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:45,952
I'm just tired.

485
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:49,539
I'm really fucking tired.

486
00:22:57,215 --> 00:22:58,506
I don't know.

487
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,793
(sighs heavily)

488
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:05,555
Fucking hell,
it's just been shit.

489
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,684
I know, darl, I know,
but it's nearly finished.

490
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:14,522
I've just been,

491
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,123
I've been reading up about,
you know that article

492
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:24,157
and those body
transplants and just,

493
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:30,872
oh, I've just been
thinking and just

494
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:35,418
that would just be fucking,

495
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:38,997
I dunno.

496
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:44,135
Oh, fucking hell.

497
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,930
Is that something
you wanna do?

498
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:52,894
Is that like, what?

499
00:23:54,272 --> 00:23:56,180
Is that even possible?

500
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:58,661
I mean I don't know,
I could look into it.

501
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:01,111
I don't know, do you want me to?

502
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:05,533
Yeah.

503
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:09,786
Thanks, Mum.
- Don't worry.

504
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,196
- I love you.
- I love you.

505
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:16,000
(ambient electronic music)

506
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:21,506
Just straighten up your
torso too, if you can.

507
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,841
Yeah, good.

508
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:24,278
[Olly] Can you help
me get this off, Mum?

509
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:25,593
[Mum] Sure.

510
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:26,280
[Olly] Sorry.

511
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:28,471
[Mum] No, that's okay.

512
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:34,602
I didn't even know they
did those in Australia.

513
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:38,701
Yeah, they um, yeah, no,
they've just started doing trials

514
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:42,130
here, but they've been doing
them in like, the States

515
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,206
and Europe and stuff
for years like,

516
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,543
I mean it's been done before,
it's not dodgy or anything.

517
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:50,967
So you're gonna have
like a completely new body?

518
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:52,328
Yeah (chuckles).

519
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:54,350
How am I gonna recognise you?

520
00:24:54,374 --> 00:24:57,575
You're not,
but I'll tell you it's me.

521
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,889
I'll be like, it's me,
and you'll be like, "Who?"

522
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,579
And I'll be like, me!

523
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,559
And then we'll just
repeat that for eternity.

524
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,653
Aw, sweet,
that's gonna be fun.

525
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:06,751
(laughs)

526
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:09,178
It's gonna be so weird, man.

527
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:10,658
- Yeah.
- That's great.

528
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:11,682
Thanks.

529
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:17,186
What are you thinking?

530
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,813
Oh, um, no, just,

531
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:23,985
(chuckles) it's just wow.

532
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:25,737
Fuck.

533
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:26,772
Yeah. I, um,

534
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,094
there's actually something
else I want to talk

535
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:31,754
to you guys about as well.
(chuckles)

536
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:35,663
- There's more?
- Yeah (chuckles).

537
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:39,667
Um, so with the transplants
as well and stuff,

538
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:45,048
(chuckles) they, um, they
have these cases where...

539
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:53,097
(chuckles) I don't know,
I'm sorry guys, basically,

540
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:56,100
it's just that like, what I'm
thinking,

541
00:25:56,135 --> 00:25:58,280
I'm thinking of doing, I'm
not even sure I can do it,

542
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:02,649
but like, I think maybe I
might have my new body like...

543
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:07,145
be a woman.

544
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:10,657
(chuckles)

545
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:22,627
- Oh my God.
- (chuckles) Yeah.

546
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,716
Um.

547
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,814
Are you, do you think
you're a transvestite?

548
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:34,889
No, it's not that, I just,

549
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:38,788
I've just been reading it, I
just thought like, that might

550
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:41,323
be good, I don't know, it's
fucking stupid, I'm sorry.

551
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:45,775
That's fucking cool, that's
really cool!

552
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,276
Very, very cool.

553
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:54,002
- I'm sorry, guys.
- Why are you apologizing?

554
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:55,026
Look at me.

555
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,745
We love you so much.

556
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:04,168
Thanks (sighs).

557
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:07,349
No, no, I mean, you know,
I can look into it if that's,

558
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,340
I mean, if that would...

559
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,681
Yeah, I'll look into it.

560
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:19,392
(sighs heavily)

561
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,439
Yeah?

562
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:27,483
[Mum] (sighs) Yeah, darling.

563
00:27:27,527 --> 00:27:28,504
I'm sorry, Mum.

564
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:32,655
No, don't be sorry,
it's fine, I love you.

565
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:38,736
[Nat] Do you like girls
or do you like guys?

566
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:40,997
(chuckles)

567
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:43,408
Um...

568
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,081
(chuckles) Guys I guess,
I don't know.

569
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:54,488
I always thought you liked
me, well, that's a shame.

570
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:55,970
You're so vain.

571
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:56,899
(laughs)

572
00:27:56,923 --> 00:28:00,266
I wanna do it,
I want the operation.

573
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,930
Please.

574
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:14,697
(sobs)

575
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,910
Okay.

576
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:22,247
Okay, okay.

577
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,918
(sighs)

578
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:27,930
Okay.

579
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:31,422
(ambient electronic music)

580
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,724
(muffled speaking)

581
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:43,894
I love you.

582
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:58,908
(electronic beeping)

583
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:01,911
(breathing heavily)

584
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,882
[Olly] It didn't work?

585
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:18,219
It worked.

586
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,931
Do you wanna have a look?

587
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:44,954
(sighs)

588
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:52,147
[Olly] I love you.

589
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:53,212
I love you.

590
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:56,874
You're beautiful.

591
00:29:56,884 --> 00:30:00,302
(melodic electronic music)

592
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,392
(door knocking)

593
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,486
(muffled speaking)

594
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:53,207
(door knocking)

595
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,250
Come in.

596
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:57,671
Hi guys.

597
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:00,464
(laughs)

598
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:01,643
Sorry, I'm sorry.

599
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:04,051
No, no, it's okay (giggles).

600
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,095
Come in.

601
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:07,991
Come in!

602
00:32:08,015 --> 00:32:10,265
(laughs)
Come on.

603
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,454
Can I show you guys some
of the stuff I can do?

604
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:13,330
[Nat] Yeah (laughs).

605
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:16,271
I prepared this
one earlier, right.

606
00:32:16,315 --> 00:32:18,682
Look at this, look at my boobs.

607
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:20,109
These babies.

608
00:32:20,152 --> 00:32:20,796
[Nat] Are they real?

609
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,487
[Olly] Yeah, feel 'em.

610
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:24,591
You wanna feel?
- No.

611
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:28,158
[Olly] (laughs) You sure,
are you feeling left out

612
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:33,163
'cause you don't have bosoms?
(laughs)

613
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,017
(Nat chuckles)

614
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,167
(Luke groans)

615
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:41,130
Oh, sorry, couldn't
help myself (chuckles).

616
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,757
This is weird.

617
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:45,445
[Luke] Very fucking weird.

618
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:47,656
[Nat] So what are
people gonna call you?

619
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,033
[Olly] Uh, I was thinking
Olivia.

620
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:53,194
I was thinking, I know
it's similar but at least

621
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:56,039
if you guys stuff up,
you're not gonna, you know,

622
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:58,708
it's not gonna be too weird,
Olly, Olivia.

623
00:32:58,732 --> 00:32:59,835
Sounds like a nickname, right?

624
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:01,044
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

625
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:05,039
But do you think that anyone,
you know, is gonna know or?

626
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:07,717
No, babe (chuckles) you
don't look like Olly at all.

627
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:11,201
(laughs) That was the
idea but, yeah, that means

628
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:13,745
please, call me her or she or.

629
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,385
[Luke] Yep, sweet.

630
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:18,553
- Babe.
- Let's do it.

631
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:19,721
I'm happy with babe.

632
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:20,555
That'd be weird.
(Olly laughs)

633
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,080
I can call you babe.
- Okay, okay.

634
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:26,403
You gotta be
really careful, Olly.

635
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:28,229
There's a lot of
dickheads out there.

636
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:30,554
People could freak out, man.

637
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,642
Yeah, okay, um.

638
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:40,355
Olly, really, like (clears
throat) people can be assholes.

639
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,419
No, totally, yeah, no, I
get it, I actually get it,

640
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:46,361
like, I really do,
it's awesome, um.

641
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:50,607
I know it's pretty weird, guys
(chuckles).

642
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:51,586
[Nat] It's cool.

643
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,754
- It's cool.
- Yeah.

644
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:54,422
It is pretty cool, right?

645
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:57,706
But are you happy?
- You like my boobs?

646
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,086
(Nat and Olly laugh)

647
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:04,213
Awkward turtle.

648
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:06,267
How weird is it having boobs?

649
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,695
It's pretty good,
they weigh shit though.

650
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,552
(laughs)
Back pain.

651
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:13,274
Joking, it's fine, they're not
that big.

652
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:17,768
What the fuck, isn't that
for like sheep or some shit?

653
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:21,471
(chuckles) Yeah, but like
they do it on humans too.

654
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,233
Like in the States and in
Europe.

655
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:28,465
Do you not watch the news?

656
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,466
- No.
- Yeah.

657
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,760
So he's just in like
some random's body now?

658
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:34,638
Yeah, like you know if
someone gave an organ?

659
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:37,287
Well, someone gave
their whole body.

660
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:40,123
Fuck, that's gross.

661
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:41,375
Britney, don't.

662
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:43,585
It's gross.

663
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:47,308
- Please don't tell anyone.
- Okay.

664
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:48,309
Please don't tell a soul.

665
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,466
No, I get it.

666
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:51,301
Seriously.

667
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:52,336
I get it!

668
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,817
And please be
nice to him tonight.

669
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:58,725
He's so fragile at the moment.

670
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,227
I'm always nice.

671
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:07,328
(chuckles) Stop touching
my hair (chuckles).

672
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:10,487
Why the fuck are you a girl?

673
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:14,157
I don't know, I just
wanted to be, I guess.

674
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:15,345
I wanted to be a fucking
princess.

675
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:16,805
It doesn't mean I become one.

676
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:18,027
Brit.

677
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:20,809
Sorry, it's just so fucking
weird, you're like hot now!

678
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,874
(laughs)

679
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:26,253
Spoke too soon.

680
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:29,464
("Set Free" by Grrl Pal)

681
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:41,351
[Nat] Yeah, it'll explode.
(laughs)

682
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:44,721
- And then, like.
- I thought you had

683
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:46,876
to like lick the top.
- Yeah, lick the top.

684
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Mix it up.

685
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:50,171
[Britney] Like slowly.

686
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:52,373
And then like from
the balls at the bottom,

687
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:54,865
all the way up to the top.

688
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,367
- Aw, do you do that?
- Yeah.

689
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:59,213
- I don't touch the balls.
- I read it in Cleo.

690
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:00,348
I've never tried it so.
- You should try it!

691
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:01,724
You haven't done that.
No!

692
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:04,853
- You have done a BJ!
- Have you done it to Luke?

693
00:36:04,877 --> 00:36:05,728
- Shut up!
- Have you?

694
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:07,243
Shut up.

695
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:08,254
Britney.

696
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,298
(laughs)

697
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:13,895
Is that what happens when
they come in your face?

698
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,230
Yeah, pretty much, well, you'd
be really good at wanking

699
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,971
a guy off then.

700
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:19,389
(girls talk at once)

701
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:20,743
But I couldn't really wank.

00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,493
- He's not gonna find out.
- What are you talking about?

882
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:54,496
How long do you think you
can keep this a secret, Olly?

883
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,748
I'm not gonna not love
my life because I'm afraid

884
00:48:56,772 --> 00:48:59,659
that someone might find out,
like I'm sorry but look,

885
00:48:59,683 --> 00:49:02,003
even if that happens, then
I'll just deal with it then.

886
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:03,360
[Luke] Whatever.

887
00:49:05,364 --> 00:49:08,426
[Olly] You don't have to
look at me, I'm not a cripple.

888
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,003
[Luke] It's just fucking
stupid.

889
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:13,287
(Olly chuckles)

890
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,164
[Olly] Why are you so angry at
them?

891
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:18,458
Are you jealous it wasn't you?

892
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,632
It's just fucked.

893
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:49,031
Do people know?

894
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:50,066
Yeah.

895
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:52,137
How?

896
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:53,410
I don't know.

897
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:00,395
- Did Britney tell someone?
- Olly, Olly, it's okay.

898
00:50:00,419 --> 00:50:01,730
No, Britney wouldn't have
told--

899
00:50:01,754 --> 00:50:03,503
[Brandon] Hey faggot!

900
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:05,558
- Are you fucking serious?
- Get the fuck outta my way.

901
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:07,415
What the fuck, Brandon?

902
00:50:07,426 --> 00:50:09,729
Your little faggot friend
raped me the other night.

903
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:11,230
Go fuck yourself, Brandon!

904
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:13,066
Sex under false pretenses,
that's rape!

905
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,265
Oh, grow a fucking dick!

906
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:19,260
Yeah, I can have him reported.

907
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:19,956
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

908
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,957
Olly, I can have you reported.

909
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:23,084
What are you gonna do,
you gonna bash a girl?

910
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:24,410
That is no fucking girl!

911
00:50:24,434 --> 00:50:26,079
Fucking touch him, I
will fucking kill you.

912
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:27,839
Nat, get the fuck outta my
way.

913
00:50:27,863 --> 00:50:31,084
I'm being a gentleman about
this, get the fuck outta my way!

914
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:32,677
All right, I'm bored
with this conversation.

915
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:36,244
Get the fuck outta my way.
- Fuck off, Brandon!

916
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:39,164
You think this is funny, Olly?

917
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:46,858
I gotta live with this for
the rest of my fucking life!

918
00:50:46,882 --> 00:50:48,090
[Student] Man.

919
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:52,219
I have to live with this for
the rest of my fucking life!

920
00:50:59,135 --> 00:51:01,113
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

921
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:02,114
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

922
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:02,949
You sure?

923
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:06,191
It's gonna be okay, I promise
you.

924
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,130
Promise you it's gonna be okay.

925
00:51:09,154 --> 00:51:10,237
Okay.

926
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,633
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt
you.

927
00:51:11,657 --> 00:51:12,781
[Olly] Okay.

928
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:15,116
Okay, you're all right.

929
00:51:18,413 --> 00:51:20,747
I love you.
- I love you too.

930
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:29,589
It's just me.

931
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:32,801
Sorry.

932
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:33,813
How you doing?

933
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:35,262
Um, I'm good.

934
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:40,225
Cool, just thought I'd
double-check.

935
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,269
Thanks.

936
00:51:45,274 --> 00:51:48,275
I, um, I didn't mean to tell
them.

937
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:53,697
It just kinda came up in
training.

938
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:56,449
Yeah, I'm sorry.

939
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:03,164
You told Brandon?

940
00:52:04,793 --> 00:52:05,793
Yeah.

941
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:10,298
Okay.

942
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:15,343
All right, well, if they
give you any more shit,

943
00:52:15,378 --> 00:52:19,306
just tell me and I'll talk to
them.

944
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:20,390
Okay, thanks.

945
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:23,643
All right, see ya.

946
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:24,687
Bye.

947
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,371
I don't know what the fuck's
going on,

948
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:34,362
like why would he do that?

949
00:52:34,397 --> 00:52:37,376
He must seriously fucking
hate me right now.

950
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,234
Babe, why do you care so much?

951
00:52:40,245 --> 00:52:43,905
What do you, he's my best
friend.

952
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:46,207
It doesn't sound like it.

953
00:52:47,753 --> 00:52:49,388
Oh, baby, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean it like that.

954
00:52:49,412 --> 00:52:52,400
I just mean like telling
Brandon, that's fucked.

955
00:52:52,424 --> 00:52:53,559
If he's your friend, he
should be your fucking friend.

956
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,227
If he's being a dickhead,
he's not worth your time.

957
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:58,011
You should just not see him
anymore.

958
00:52:58,055 --> 00:53:01,973
(chuckles) How can I
not just not see him?

959
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,911
(laughs) What are you saying?

960
00:53:03,935 --> 00:53:05,038
Just don't see him.

961
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:06,405
But he's my best friend, babe.

962
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:09,022
Oh my god, you're so stupid.

963
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:13,401
You're choosing to be treated
like shit.

964
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,269
(Britney scoffs)

965
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,238
I'm in love with him.

966
00:53:22,445 --> 00:53:24,423
When the fuck did that happen?

967
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:26,831
Since always, like forever.

968
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:29,451
Fuck.

969
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:32,420
Fucking god.

970
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:34,776
You can't tell anyone,
okay, especially not Nat.

971
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,883
Babe, I'm not retarded.

972
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:40,865
[Olly] So what do you
think I should do then?

973
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,931
Fuck me, I don't know then.

974
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:45,536
It's just like, I don't
know, I feel like I'm being

975
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,447
such a shit friend right
now, it's like I don't care

976
00:53:48,471 --> 00:53:50,416
if he's happy, like I
actually don't give a shit.

977
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,901
Like be unhappy, but be with
me, that's like seriously like,

978
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:58,591
it's fucked, it's just not
being a good friend, you know?

979
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:00,459
And it's like I'm lying to him.

980
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:02,534
You should tell him.

981
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:03,930
[Olly] Tell him what?

982
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,320
All this shit.

983
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:10,992
Tell him the truth, tell him
that you're in love with him.

984
00:54:11,002 --> 00:54:13,305
(chuckles) What good would
that do?

985
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:15,399
If he knew, he might
stop being such a dick.

986
00:54:15,423 --> 00:54:18,820
Well, it's Luke, he'd
probably freak the fuck out.

987
00:54:18,844 --> 00:54:20,426
Or he'd fuck you.

988
00:54:22,505 --> 00:54:25,890
Yeah, don't look at me like
that.

989
00:54:25,934 --> 00:54:27,453
That just wouldn't happen,
okay?

990
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:30,478
Babe, you're a hot bitch, why
not?

991
00:54:30,513 --> 00:54:32,959
(chuckles) For starters, he's
with Nat!

992
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:35,024
He's a guy, you're hot.

993
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,114
I guarantee you he wants to
fuck you, it's just biology

994
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:43,669
and, look, if he likes you more
than her,

995
00:54:43,693 --> 00:54:45,910
it's not your fault (chuckles).

996
00:54:45,954 --> 00:54:48,507
It's Luke, it's fucking
gross how much he loves you.

997
00:54:48,531 --> 00:54:50,851
Like fuck, he could be in
love with you too right now

998
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,521
but he can't do anything
about it because he's stuck

999
00:54:53,545 --> 00:54:58,539
with Nat so instead, he's just
just treating you like shit.

1000
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,676
It's fucked but it might be the
case.

1001
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:07,473
You've gotta stop letting
guys treat you like shit.

1002
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,351
You call the shots.

1003
00:55:12,388 --> 00:55:13,396
Try this on.

- Hey man.
- Hey.

1015
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:53,519
You didn't ask me if you
could have anyone over.

1016
00:55:53,563 --> 00:55:55,429
I didn't know I had to.

1017
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,522
You do.

1018
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:03,841
Don't be too late, all right?

1019
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:04,865
Why?

1020
00:56:04,908 --> 00:56:06,427
Because it's a school night.

1021
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:08,776
I won't be here for long.

1022
00:56:08,787 --> 00:56:09,787
Good.

1023
00:56:18,129 --> 00:56:21,089
[Luke] Your mum's intense.

1024
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,966
Yeah, she hasn't changed at
all.

1025
00:56:25,128 --> 00:56:26,794
Can I get you anything?

1026
00:56:26,805 --> 00:56:30,389
It's fine, what'd
you want to talk about?

1027
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:36,772
Uh...

1028
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:46,981
You know that Brandon shit.

1029
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:48,449
Yes.

1030
00:56:48,484 --> 00:56:51,702
I just wanna say I'm
sorry about all that.

1031
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:53,788
I didn't, you know,

1032
00:56:53,823 --> 00:56:57,583
mean to fuck everything
up and you're right

1033
00:56:58,503 --> 00:57:00,995
and should've listened to you.

1034
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:04,235
Should know better and
thanks for looking after me

1035
00:57:04,259 --> 00:57:08,052
and stuff, like it was
really awesome what you did.

1036
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:09,096
It's fine.

1037
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:18,729
I just wanting to start
being honest with myself.

1038
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:28,614
So the whole Brandon thing and
like this,

1039
00:57:30,526 --> 00:57:31,526
all of this...

1040
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:37,707
Is because of you.

1041
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:52,138
I'm in love with you, Luke.

1042
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:14,160
(inhales deeply)

1043
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:21,376
Hey.

1044
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:25,546
Don't touch me (scoffs).

1045
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:28,966
That's fucked, you're
my best friend, Olly.

1046
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:35,256
Okay, um.

1047
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:38,236
And what did you
think I was going to say

1048
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,061
when you told me this?

1049
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,607
How did you think it was going
to go out?

1050
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:53,157
(chuckles) All right, I'm gonna
go.

1051
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,798
- Yes.
- Hey babe.

1052
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:20,278

01:13:43,831 --> 01:13:45,423
I didn't mean to.

1234
01:13:46,592 --> 01:13:47,592
I'm sorry.

1235
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,640
I fucked up.

1236
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:05,609
I don't know, I don't know.

1237
01:14:08,856 --> 01:14:12,116
I don't know what to do with
you, Olly.

1238
01:14:16,998 --> 01:14:19,999
- Do you want me to move out?
- Oh god.

1239
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:22,679
What, and what, go where, with
what money?

1240
01:14:22,703 --> 01:14:26,172
I mean you can't even
look after yourself.

1241
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:30,593
I'm sorry.

1242
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:36,223
Go to bed.

Mum, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

I'm sorry.

1245

Oh, stop it, Olly,
it's pathetic.

1246

Fuck you.

01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:53,877
Excuse me?

I said I'm fucking sorry,
okay?

1249
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,704
Fuck you, if I'm like this,

1250
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:00,851
it's because of
fucking you anyway.

1251
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,219
Why the fuck am I apologizing?

1252
01:15:02,243 --> 01:15:05,503
Oh, take some fucking
responsibility!

1253
01:15:09,383 --> 01:15:10,861

any fucking idea

down the fucking street,

1257

1258

1259
01:15:24,932 --> 01:15:26,190
Fuck you, okay?

1260
01:15:27,768 --> 01:15:29,922
Maybe if you weren't such a
fucking slut,

1261
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:31,915
I wouldn't be so
fucked up right now.

1262
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:33,759
And maybe you would have
fucked out Dad away.

1263

Fuck you, Olly!

1264
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:39,119
I left your father for you!

1265
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:43,207
Because he wasn't
good enough for you!

1266
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:47,586

done in my life for you!

1267
01:15:49,123 --> 01:15:53,050
Get out, get out,
get out of my room!

1268
01:15:53,094 --> 01:15:56,720

Okay.

It's nice to see you, it's
nice to hear your voice.
