00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,000
What feeling?

1024
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,375
That I don't need anything else.

1025
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:43,666
[Alana] <i>A fountain?</i>

1026
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,416
- A tomato sauce fountain?
- That's my idea.

1027
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,625
We'd put a fountain
in every point of sale,

1028
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:52,083
such as malls, supermarkets,
and so on.

1029
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:53,583
[chuckles]

1030
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:54,666
I'm sorry.

1031
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,666
But no. No, right?

1032
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:01,000
We're not rejecting any ideas
at this point.

1033
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:04,583
I really like Teto's idea better.

1034
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,291
[Alana] Show them the Trancoso mascot.

1035
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,333
The Trancoso mascot

1036
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:14,875
is a character that represents
a happy premium tomato.

1037
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,750
Yes. He's well-traveled, sophisticated,
speaks many languages...

1038
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,392
- [Igor] He's premium.
- [Alana] Premium.

1039
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:23,708
I also thought we could create
shareable content

1040
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:26,208
to increase social media engagement.

1041
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,750
Perfect. That's the goal, Teto.

1042
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:31,416
We want people to promote
the brand spontaneously.

1043
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:34,541
- Exactly.
- But I like the fountain idea.

1044
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:37,041
It speaks to an adult market as well.

1045
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:41,791
Okay. So, if we like both ideas,

1046
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:44,708
let's put both Igor and Teto on it.

1047
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:49,958
Hi. How are you? Could I wait in here?

1048
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,708
I'm meeting someone who works here. Teto.

1049
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:55,041
- It's raining.
- I couldn't help overhearing.

1050
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,958
- Are you meeting Teto?
- Yeah.

1051
00:56:57,041 --> 00:57:00,208
I'll take you to him. Come on in.
Let her go through, please.

1052
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,875
- Is she clear? Great.
- Thanks.

1053
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:05,333
- What's your name?
- Paula.

1054
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,791
- Is it company business?
- No.

1055
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:13,958
- I'm a friend of his.
- Teto's famous "lady friends"!

1056
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:15,208
- What?
- What?

1057
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,051
- What do you mean, "famous"?
- No, I said...

1058
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:19,083
No! It's just what people say.

1059
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,708
He looks so well-behaved,

1060
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:24,541
- but those are the worst ones, right?
- I don't get it.

1061
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,125
I'm kidding, silly!

1062
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:32,416
- It will be interes... What is it?
- Duck! Duck!

1063
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,083
- [Paula] Thank you.
- Paula's in there with Alana, bro!

1064
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,666
Shit will hit the fan.

1065
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,375
Is everything okay?

1066
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,625
- It's just that...
- Well, Alana. That...

1067
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,833
That girl that just came in...

1068
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,666
I can't really deal with her right now.

1069
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:53,625
Right.

1070
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:00,041
- I shouldn't do this...
- [Igor] Hm-mm.

1071
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:01,833
...but I will help you.

1072
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,750
There's an emergency exit over there.

1073
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,250
Go, go, go...

1074
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,375
- Get down!
- Get down!

1075
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,333
Sorry.

1076
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,000
[Alana] Go. Turn right.

1077
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:18,500
I'll be right there. Wait for me.

1078
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,458
Do what you have to do.
I think I'll go home.

1079
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,041
Your friend is going to think I'm crazy!

1080
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:30,083
- This Paula's a crazy stalker.
- I see.

1081
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:31,833
Paula! That Alana is crazy!

1082
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,541
- She's out to get me!
- Why, Teto?

1083
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,708
She doesn't want me to get the job.

1084
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,666
She's protecting the president's son.
That's why.

1085
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:45,833
Look at me.

1086
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,291
Come here.

1087
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:51,291
Do you trust me?

1088
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:00,208
- You owe me one.
- [car alarm chirps]

1089
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:04,458
Now you have to take me to dinner
at a nice restaurant.

1090
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,125
Well, Alana...

1091
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:09,416
Well what? Are you scared of me?

1092
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:12,708
Well... instead of taking you
to a restaurant,

1093
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:17,166
- I could cook at home for you.
- Get out of here!

1094
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,250
You cook too?

1095
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,250
Hm-mm.

1096
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,666
- I'm in.
- Really?

1097
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,500
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

1098
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:34,416
- Do you need help?
- No, that's okay.

1099

you are so cute. Did you know that?

Is this how you seduce girls?

1114

- What?
- With this shyness.

Morning. Nice to meet you.

1199
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:37,500
I'm Alana. You don't know me,
but I've been hired to work for you.

1200

Here in the building?

No.

Not here. At the company.

You slept with Alana?

1204

- How was that?
- Well...

1205
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:51,083
It was good,
but I think I still need some pointers.

1206
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,041
- That's cheating.
- Getting pointers?

1207

- No, screwing our boss!
- Come on, Teto!

1208

What have you always said?

1209
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:01,041
- "Is it my fault this girl likes me?"
- No, that's different.

1210
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,708
What you did is much worse.
You know it is.

01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,791
- That's my problem!
- Harassing you?

1525
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:28,916
Who's harassing you?

1526
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,250
Come on, man. It's amazing, isn't it?
The guy with the upper hand's never wrong.

1527
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:35,875
I've told you a few times.

1528
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:37,666
- I like you.
- Victor!

1529
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:41,000
I gave you a few chances, right?
Why can't you give me one now

1530
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:42,166
- as well?
- Let me go!

1531
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,708
I recommended you for the residency.

1532
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,916
- Let go of me!
- [Raissa] What are you doing?

1533
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,458
Take your hands off her!

1534
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:50,541
You know too well
Paula is the best person for the job.

1535
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:54,208
And everyone knows what you're up to.
If you hurt her chances,

1536
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:56,583
- they'll know why.
- You have it all wrong.

1537
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:59,416
I was just telling Paula
she got the residency.

1538
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:05,208
Thank you, professor.

1539
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,916
But I no longer want it.

1540
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,583
You've ruined that hospital for me.

1541
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,750
[Katia] Paula, are you okay?

1542
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
[woman] Teto?

1543
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:21,333
Teto?

1544
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:23,041
Paula?

1545
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,875
[slowly] No, Teto.

1546
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:27,416
Let's go.

1547
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:35,458
If you ever need a talent development
consultant

1548
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:38,458
or recruiter, just give me a call.

1549
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:41,083
I'll give one to you, Mr. Teodoro.

1550
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:43,041
Call.
[in English] Call.

1551
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,583
[in Portuguese] Call.

1552
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:45,791
Good night.

1553
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:47,083
[all] Good night.

1554
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,166
[Alana] Good night.

1555
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,833
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i> [laughs]

1556
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,083
- Did you have a good time?
<i>- </i>I loved it!

1557
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:56,166
Great! But don't go thinking
you're rid of me.

1558
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,458
Shall we go to your place?

1559
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:59,625
- No...
- Right. Your dad's there.

1560
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:02,750
I have an idea.

1561
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,833
[upbeat music plays]

1562
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:15,041
[Teodoro] Tomato sauce runs in the veins
of the Trancoso family.

1563
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:20,041
Generation after generation,
we've perfected our techniques

1564
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:24,041
to create this premium tomato.

1565
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,500
Now I'm going to show you a preview

1566
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:31,166
of the campaign my son, Teto,
has been working on.

1567
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:34,958
It's a campaign for our new tomato sauce

1568
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:38,375
which brings together tradition,
innovation,

1569
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:41,041
and, most importantly, love.

1570
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:47,041
Teto!

1571
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:51,375
Please, everyone, follow me
into the other room.

1572
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:03,375
For God's sake.

1573
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,416
[door slams]

1574
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,791
[shouting in background]

1575
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:14,791
What happened?

1576
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:18,916
You were high yesterday,
so I brought you back to your house.

1577
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:21,541
But don't worry.

1578
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,666
I didn't take advantage of you.

1579
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,333
Excuse me.

1580
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:32,583
What's it, Dad?

1581
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,958
Can you explain to me what's going on?

1582
01:26:35,041 --> 01:26:38,000
Since I got here,
I've seen you with three different girls,

1583
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:40,083
- not to mention Igor!
- Calm down.

1584
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:43,166
And what the hell is the doorman
doing in my bed?!

1585
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,791
[snoring]

1586
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:48,708
I don't know.
It's nothing like what you're thinking.

1587
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:50,458
It's much worse, Teto!

1588
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,750
Back home, I knew you were irresponsible,
but I'd hoped you'd matured!

1589
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,333
You're mistaken!

1590
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,125
I have changed.

1591
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,583
Unfortunately,
that's very hard to believe.

1592
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:13,916
- What's up?
- Can I crash here?

1593
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,333
- What?
- I can't stay at my dad's anymore.

1594
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:18,750
I don't want anything from him.

1595
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,875
If you don't, fine, but I want my car.

1596
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,666
Okay, you can stay,
but you'll have to help with everything.

1597
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,500
Cleaning, cooking,
and taking care of the baby. Got it?

1598
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,958
[instrumental music plays]

1599
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,458
Paula!

1600
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:24,375
Paula!

1601
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:27,750
- Stop. I want to talk to you.
- No, Teto.

1602
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:33,500
Paula, please.

1603
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:34,583
Excuse me, man.

1604
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:38,375
You have to listen to me.
Please just hear me out.

1605
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:42,291
Why should I, if all you've told me
since the day we met were lies?

1606
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,625
I lied because I didn't know who I was.

1607
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,583
Paula, when you're rich,
people lie to you.

1608
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:52,958
You can't distinguish real friends
from those after your money.

1609
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:55,916
Right. You have to lie
so that people tell you the truth?

1610
01:28:56,791 --> 01:29:00,625
It's simple. If you want good friends,
be a good friend.

1611
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:04,166
You want people to think
you're a good guy, be one,

1612
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,041
- but you weren't!
- Well, you see,

1613
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,916
I didn't know what I wanted. And now I do.

1614
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:11,750
I want the two of us, together.

1615
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:17,791
I'm going away.

1616
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:23,041
I signed up for a physician volunteer
program in the Amazon.

1617
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,166
I'll be there for a while.

1618
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:27,791
Really?

1619
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:29,791
Really.

1620
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:36,458
Congratulations.

1621
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:38,666
Thanks.

1622
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,500
Good luck.

1623
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:42,666
It'll be cool.

1624
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:56,291
Teodoro, I think this was the best group
of trainees we've ever had.

1625
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,166
- And Teto was the best candidate.
- Teto?

1626
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:01,541
He's proactive. He's smart.

1627
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:05,791
He'll make a difference here.
He's my pick for the job.

1628
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,375
[exhales]

1629
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,250
Célio, I've always respected you.

1630
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:17,666
So respect me and tell me the truth.

1631
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,208
I don't need ass-kissers.

1632
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:22,750
But I'm telling you the truth.
Your son was excellent.

1633
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:28,041
Although there was another boy
who was just as good.

1634
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:30,333
Better. Go ahead and say it.

1635
01:30:30,416 --> 01:30:34,291
The whole concept for the campaign,
for example, was his.

1636
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:37,041
We should hire them both.

1637
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:41,000
No, Célio. We are only hiring one person.
You pick the best one.

1638
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:42,875
The best one, Célio.

1639
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:48,750
[Monique] Let's go!

1640
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:51,666
Get up! Come on!

1641
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:54,041
- No!
- Come on. Let's go!

1642
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,625
Today's your day. Come on.

1643
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:08,333
CONGRATULATIONS, TRAINEES!

1644
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,500
Hi, cutie pie.

1645
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:11,375
Where are the keys to my car?

1646
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:17,416
[whispering] Champ! Champ! Champ!

1647
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:31,458
Hello. I'm so sorry, sir,
but I need you to move to another seat.

1648
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:32,708
What?

1649
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:36,875
Yes, please. This seat is reserved
for the company president.

1650
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:40,416
Alana, you two
haven't been formally introduced.

1651
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,833
Teodoro Trancoso.

1652
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:43,333
- No.
- [Célio] Alana

1653
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:46,000
was our coach for this trainee program.

1654
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:48,958
- No... But he isn't...
- Shall we start the ceremony?

1655
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Sure.

1656
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:02,416
Good evening.

1657
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:04,416
[audience] Good evening.

1658
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,958
I'd like to thank
the illustrious presence...

1659
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:11,333
of Mr. Teodoro...

1660
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:15,500
and to congratulate
this group of trainees.

1661
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:24,375
Before handing out the certificates,
I'm going to call Mr. Célio,

1662
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:25,958
and he will announce

1663
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:29,250
which one of you was selected
to be a junior executive.

1664
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:31,250
Célio, please.

1665
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:33,125
Junior executive?

1666
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:40,041
We have several outstanding candidates
in this class,

1667
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:42,083
but unfortunately, only one position.

1668
01:32:43,666 --> 01:32:45,250
And the job goes to...

1669
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,875
Teto.

1670
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:50,125
[Alana yelps excitedly]

1671
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:55,416
Come on up!

1672
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,083
[applause continues]

1673
01:33:01,041 --> 01:33:02,541
What's wrong? Go.

1674
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:05,333
That's not me.

1675
01:33:06,208 --> 01:33:08,125
It's you. Go on.

1676
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:13,291
[Célio] Here he comes!

1677
01:33:15,458 --> 01:33:17,916
- What's going on?
- Later.

1678
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Igor?

1679
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:23,083
What's going on here, Célio?

1680
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,291
I'd like to thank you all
for this opportunity.

1681
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,208
But I can't take the job...

1682
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,875
because I'm not Teto.

1683
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:39,166
Teto, come over here!

1684
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:43,125
That is Teto.

1685
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:47,041
[dramatic music playing]

1686
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,166
- And who gets the job?
- Nobody.

1687
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:55,166
Exactly.

1688
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:00,000
This job should never have been offered.

1689
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:03,375
It was taken from someone
who deserves it more than I do.

1690
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,791
I'm up here to apologize to you,
Monique.

1691
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:11,625
And to all of you
for the situation I've created.

1692
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:14,208
I'm sorry.

1693
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,375
[Monique] Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:44,458
[Alana and Monique] Teto.

1695
01:34:44,541 --> 01:34:46,000
That Teto.

1696
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:48,041
Leaving without talking to me?

1697
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:51,000
Was it this stupid little plan of yours

1698
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,916
- that cost me my job?
- I didn't know.

1699
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,291
I didn't mean to take anybody's job.

1700
01:34:55,375 --> 01:34:58,791
I didn't know you'd like me...
Or rather, Teto.

1701
01:34:59,333 --> 01:35:00,666
I couldn't care less about Teto.

1702
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:03,666
I've spent my entire life taking shit,

1703
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:07,458
being interrupted and underestimated
by guys like Teto.

1704
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:11,750
I was much more interested
in the sensitive,

1705
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:13,041

than in a stupid status of an heir.

1708
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:21,333
So you're not upset
I'm the caretaker's son?

1709
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:24,583
- The son of whom?
- I don't have a cent to my name.

1710
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:27,958
- I live with my parents...
- Just shut up before I change my mind.

1711
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:30,333
It was a bet. We lost, and Igor won.

1712
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:33,666
Only because everyone
thought he was the boss's son!

1713
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,500
[Monique] So he doesn't deserve the car.

1714
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:36,958
Wait! I agree with you.

1715
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:40,208
- I don't want the car.
- No, wait.

1716
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:43,750
Calm down. Don't do anything rash.
Of course you want the car.

1717
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:45,333
- What is it?
- Here, Teto.

1718
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:47,541
No returns. A bet is a bet. You know.

1719
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:50,541
Fine, but I want my car. Give me the key.

1720
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:52,000
- Fine. I don't need it.
- No.

1721
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:54,416
This car is worth at least $60,000.

1722
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,625
- He wants it. He won the bet.
- Take it.

1723
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:58,166
- [Alana] No.
- [Monique] Thanks.

1724
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:01,250
Guys, how about if everyone
keeps the car?

1725
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:04,875
You mean sell it and share the money?

1726
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:05,958
Among yourselves?

1727
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:08,291
No, not share it. Invest it.

1728
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:10,708
Invest in what, for God's sake?

1729
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:12,916
Something that will get us somewhere.

1730

1731
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,708
[all] Surprise!

1732
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:32,625
CHEERS, TETO!

1733
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:36,541
Happy birthday, big boy.
I've always believed in you, son.

1734
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:38,333
Me too!

1735
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:41,208
In both of you!

1736
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
- [Igor] Happy birthday, partner.
- Thanks, guys.

1737
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:45,666
But you didn't have to, really.

1738
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,500
I agree, but what could I do?

1739
01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:50,208
- The community insisted.
- Right. What could you do?

Hi.

1745
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,166
It's been quite a while.

1746
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:11,291
Right?

1747
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:13,583
How are you?

1748
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:16,291
I'm fine. And you?

1749
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:18,333
I had to come here. I was curious.

1750
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,875
I was in Roraima
when I heard about your project.

1751
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:23,958
- I was very curious.
- Want a tour?

1752
01:37:25,041 --> 01:37:26,625
- Yeah.
- Shall we go?

1753
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:29,166
- Yeah. Excuse me.
- After you.

1754
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:32,625
- Your dad?
- Yeah. He's one of my clients.

1755
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:34,083
Our clients, actually.

1756
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:37,958
The company is co-owned by Monique,
myself, and Igor, who's in college.

1757
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:40,666
And his wife, Alana, works for us.

1758
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,541
- Hi.
- Hi! Paula, right?

1759
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:45,666
Yes. One of the "famous" ones.

1761
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,708

- Excuse me.

- Okay.
- See ya.

I'm impressed.

Paula, I'd like to thank you.

I wouldn't be who I am today
if I hadn't met you.

Look how pretty.

1775
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:26,958
- It's beautiful! Yeah!
- Isn't it?

1776
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:28,041
It's ours.

Sorry! Sorry!
