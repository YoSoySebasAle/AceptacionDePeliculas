1
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:24,528
Hey!

2
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,613
- Hi!
- Hello.

3
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,815
Uh, Sara Hamilton?

4
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,550
Yeah. That'd be me.

5
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:00,851
Yeah,
well, this package...

6
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,054
...is for you.

7
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:05,222
Finally!

8
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,458
I almost gave up waiting for it.

9
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Well, it's all yours,

10
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:11,461
if I can just get you
to sign right there.

11
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,964
You're a godsend.

12
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:15,731
If you hadn't turned up today,
it would have been too late.

13
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,635
I knew that.

14
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:20,737
Why do you think I'm here now?

15
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,072
There you go.

16
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,841
- Thank you, and enjoy...
- Thank you.

17
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:24,908
...whatever was so important.

18
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,176
I will. Thank you.

19
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:27,211
Thank you.

20
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:43,193
Humanity has had
the oddest habit

21
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,895
of turning a blind eye

22
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:46,630
to anything
that makes it uneasy.

23
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:50,868
In 1634, Galileo was declared

24
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,970
a heretic for daring to suggest

25
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:55,772
that it was, in fact, the Earth
that revolved around the Sun

26
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:58,075
and not the other way round.

27
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:00,110
And even though
this was one of the most

28
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:02,813
strongly supported facts
ever disclosed,

29
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:06,617
that assertion cost him
not only his reputation,

30
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:09,086
but it also cut him off
from society

31
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:11,288
right up until the day he died.

32
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,523
For centuries,

33
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,258
thousands upon thousands
of people

34
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,160
have experienced UFO sightings

35
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:21,231
and various forms of encounters
with extraterrestrials.

36
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,234
Even over 3,000 years ago,

37
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:27,237
the Mayans depicted
some of these occurrences

38
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,306
in their wall carvings.

39
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:30,741
But, of course,

40
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:32,175
it wasn't until
the advent of photography

41
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,278
towards the end
of the 19th century

42
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,314
that we were able
to actually record proof.

43
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:39,816
Physical proof
of these sightings.

44
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,922
But that was never
gonna be enough.

45
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:48,592
What with our ingrained
mockery and dupery,

46
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:50,894
which gave way
to incessant suspicion

47
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:53,130
and dogma,

48
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:55,365
which, of course, cast such
an enormous shadow of doubt

49
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,301
all over this proof.

50
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,837
At least for those...

51
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,307
<i>- who chose to turn...</i>
- Hello?

52
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,809
<i>- ...a blind eye.</i>
<i>-  Hi, Sara.</i>

53
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,310
- <i>It's just your mom calling.</i>
- Hi, Mom.

54
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:08,745
- How are you?
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

55
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:11,081
Listen, the reason
I'm calling is...

56
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,951
I wondered if you may be free
to come over for lunch tomorrow?

57
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,386
Oh, are you serious?

58
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,922
You know I can't.
I'm going away, you know that.

59
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,057
<i> Sorry, love.</i>

60
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,292
Yes, you did tell me.

61
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:24,861
I don't know why, I was certain
that was next week.

62
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:26,396
Oh, no, Mom. It's this weekend.

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,266
<i> Couldn't</i>
<i>someone else from the office</i>

64
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:31,668
at least go with you
to keep you company?

65
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,370
Mom, can we not do this again?

66
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:35,939
You know, this not work-related.
This is for my book.

67
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:37,608
I know, Sara.

68
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,910
<i> Mom,</i>
<i>are you hearing yourself?</i>

69
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:42,079
We're not in the 20s
anymore, okay?

70
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,914
Women can travel
around the world by themselves.

71
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,749
You really need
to accept that already.

72
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:46,917
<i> You watch</i>
<i>your tone, young lady!</i>

73
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,319
This is your mother
you're talking to.

74
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,854
And you make it sound
like I was around

75
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,122
when dinosaurs ruled the earth.

76
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:56,426
You are so like your father.

77
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,065
Mom, please tell me
you're not drinking again.

78
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,133
'Course not!

79
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,403
Anyway...

80
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:09,139
I wasn't gonna bring this up.

81
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,310
But I was speaking to your aunt,

82
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:15,412
and she said she read
all kinds of weird stories

83
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:17,381
<i>about that place
you're so intent on visiting.</i>

84
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,216
Oh, Mom, please.

85
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:21,251
<i> Well, you do</i>
<i>whatever you think you should!</i>

86
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:23,920
<i>I can least expect
a call from you</i>

87
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,689
<i>as soon as you get there,
though, right?</i>

88
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:26,768
No, Mom.

89
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:27,846
There's no signal in the forest,

90
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,924
and I'm pretty sure
there's no Wi-Fi, either.

91
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:29,893
Okay?

92
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:33,463
You know what?
I'll... I'll call you

93
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,332
as soon as I get home
on Monday, okay?

94
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:36,400
All right. Okay.

95
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:40,470
But please promise me
you'll be careful with the car.

96
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:41,872
Oh, yes, Mom.

97
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:43,173
Okay? I'll talk to you soon.

98
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:44,341
All right. Bye. I love you.

99
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:49,346
<i> Look.</i>

100
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,683
<i>"And four living creatures</i>

101
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:55,952
<i>emerged from the center
of the image.</i>

102
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,154
<i>When the creatures moved,</i>

103
00:07:57,156 --> 00:08:00,123
<i>the wheels rolled
along with them.</i>

104
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,993
<i>And when the creatures floated
above the land,</i>

105
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:05,362
the wheels also floated.

106
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:07,864
Because the spirit
of those creatures

107
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,499
<i>was in the wheels."</i>

108
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,770
Ezekiel, chapter one.

109
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:17,941
So, as the prophet predicted,

110
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:19,876
humanity found itself facing

111
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,446
one of its greatest challenges
to date.

112
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:25,248
Having to acknowledge
the existence of civilization

113
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,917
from other parts of the galaxy.

114
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,252
We can only hope that this time,

115
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,488
unlike what happened
with Galileo,

116
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,224
we won't have to wait
all of 300 years

117
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:36,126
to authenticate the veracity

118
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:39,863
of the unmitigated proof
we will be providing today.

119
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,915
That must be it.

120
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,471
Excuse me.

121
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:57,307
Um, um, I'm headed
to the military barracks.

122
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:58,475
Is this the right way?

123
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,853
You'd think God

124
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:28,170
might at least do something
about our appearance,

125
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,874
and that... damn foul smell

126
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,509
when our souls
finally abandon us, right?

127
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,512
It's definitely not one
of his stronger points.

128
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:38,248
Twenty years on the force,

129
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,518
and the smell doesn't get
any kinder on the senses.

130
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,153
I don't know
how you do put up with it.

131
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,421
No different
to a deer or a boar.

132
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:45,455
You say so.

133
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:52,662
I just about
had enough of it, Joe.

134
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:55,665
This has got to be the only
nature reserve in the world

135
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,468
where the damn bears
choose not to hibernate.

136
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,870
What can I say...

137
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,404
The unpredictable mysteries
of nature.

138
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:02,789
Yeah, well, a fucking truce
over the winter

139
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,173
would be doing everyone
a favor, now, wouldn't it?

140
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:06,243
Sure, but like I already said,

141
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:08,245
the temperature affects
their behavior.

142
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:09,913
And besides,
people know all well and good

143
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:10,947
the danger
they're putting themselves in

144
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,482
by coming out here.

145
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:14,351
There are warning signs
at every entrance.

146
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,853
Not to mention
the permit you need

147
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,354
before you're even allowed
to step foot in this place.

148
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:20,023
Yeah, fucking waste of time,
if you ask me.

149
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,525
I don't why you all get off
on that red tape bullshit.

150
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,233
Well...

151
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:32,102
Looks like you've got your work
cut out for you.

152
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:34,604
You'd best get on with it.

153
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,207
Yeah, I best had.

154
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:39,509
Um...

155
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,078
You'll have to excuse me.

156
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:46,983
Call me or come find me
whenever you want.

157
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,718
<i> Mi casa su casa,</i>
and all of that.

158
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,953
Yeah, right.

159
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:56,693
Moron! How many times
I've got to tell you?

160
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:57,928
No taking photos around me.

161
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,562
Get the fuck outta here, now!

162
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:00,997
It's okay, boss. It's okay.

163
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:02,265
Jesus Christ!

164
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:11,167
Oh, my god

165
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:13,003
Oh, my god.

166
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,673
You're Joe, right?

167
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,508
Uh, yeah.

168
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,677
You must be the journalist?

169
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,545
Yeah. Something tells me
you knew that

170
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,414
before you scared
the hell out of me, Ranger.

171
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,319
"Sara Hamilton."

172
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:31,354
- Yup, that'd be me.
- Good.

173
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,356
Well, it's great to see
you've brought your permit

174
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:34,524
and turned up on time.

175
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:36,159
I wish everyone else
would take a leaf

176
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,394
out of your book.

177
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,628
Yeah, well,
I had no other choice.

178
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,497
Some guy on the phone
gave me strict instructions.

179
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:42,332
Otherwise, there was no way
I was getting in here.

180
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:43,600
Yeah.

181
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:46,336
Uh, that guy on the phone
might have been me.

182
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:50,239
Well, you can't be too careful,
you know?

183
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:51,641
Uh, sometimes people
are too smart

184
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:53,076
for their own good,

185
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:54,510
and they only realize
once it's too late.

186
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:57,514
Yeah, I got you.

187
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,382
We need to know
when people are gonna be here,

188
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:02,218
so we can be around
to keep watch over you.

189
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,254
Contrary to what
most people believe,

190
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,856
the biggest obstacle
isn't getting in here.

191
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,192
It's getting out...

192
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:11,694
alive.

193
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:13,363
Yeah. The bears?

194
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,764
Exactly.

195
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,800
Yeah. I saw the commotion
on the river bank.

196
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:21,337
Well, I hope
the man upstairs

197
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,206
doesn't give us any problems.

198
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,076
I think we'll be okay.

199
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,845
But we're gonna start
inside, so...

200
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,280
you don't have anything
to worry about.

201
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:32,348
Great!

202
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,716
What do you say
we do this already?

203
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:34,851
I'll follow you.

204
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,556
So, what do you think
of this so far?

205
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,525
It's amazing.

206
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,127
Can't wait to get inside.

207
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,466
Something tells me you're not
gonna be disappointed.

208
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:20,296
Humans need something
to hold onto, you know?

209
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:21,364
And when it's something
you can't

210
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:22,499
quite get your head round...

211
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,868
...you take your own ignorance
as the truth.

212
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:29,906
Well, that's a lovely
philosophy, Joe.

213
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:31,741
But there must have been
documented cases

214
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:34,244
of sightings and contact
before what happened.

215
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:35,562
Well, sure.

216
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:36,879
But there's no actual proof
of anything

217
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:38,348
from the moment
the barracks were built

218
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,250
until they were abandoned.

219
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:41,584
Official records, you mean?

220
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,186
Well, yeah.

221
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,854
I couldn't tell you
about anything off the record.

222
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:49,325
Although, I guess
I gotta warn you,

223
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,761
strange things still happen here
now and again.

224
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:01,538
Shit.

225
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:04,541
What's going on?

226
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:05,742
Okay, just keep quiet.

227
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:07,610
What?

228
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,345
Oh, my god.

229
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:18,254
Okay, Sara just do exactly
as I say.

230
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:19,422
- Okay?
- Okay.

231
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:22,759
Now, on three,

232
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:24,994
I want you to run out
of the forest as fast as you can

233
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:26,229
towards the barracks,

234
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,297
as if your life depended on it.

235
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,982
Wait. What about you?

236
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:30,666
No, don't ask questions now,
for god's sake, Sara.

237
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:32,535
Okay? Just run.

238
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,337
And no matter what you hear,

239
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,773
don't look back. You hear me?

240
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:39,542
- No looking back.
- Okay. Okay.

241
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:41,844
One...

242
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:44,380
Two...

243
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:47,817
Three. Run, Sara! Run!

244
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,522
Fuck. Fuck, fuck!

245
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,295
Help!

246
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,267
Help!

247
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,406
Come on!

248
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,574
Come out here!

249
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:12,875
You don't get the balls, do you?

250
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:18,248
Couldn't you have picked
a better time?

251
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,916
Can't you see we've got guests?

252
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,753
Come on! Come out here!

253
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:27,257
Where the hell are you?

254
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,691
You still haven't learned
who makes the fucking rules

255
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:29,792
around here, have you?

256
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:43,573
Oh, god. Oh, god.

257
00:17:58,323 --> 00:17:59,389
Shit.

258
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:18,841
Oh, my god!

259
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:21,711
You're a

260
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,046
- fucking savage bastard!
- Joe! Joe!

261
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:24,380
- Joe! Watch out, watch out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

262
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:26,082
Jesus, what the fuck...

263
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:27,450
Jesus, Ed!

264
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:28,518
What?

265
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:32,455
You know him?

266
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,924
Yeah, of course, I do.
Everybody does. It's Ed.

267
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:36,492
Didn't I mention him earlier?

268
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,428
No. No, you didn't.

269
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,131
Oh. Well, he's as weird
as they come, but...

270
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,866
his heart is in the right place,
isn't it, buddy?

271
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,872
- Jesus, Joe!
- Yeah.

272
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,075
I caught it on the iron rails
on the fence.

273
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,010
We need to get you
to a hospital!

274
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,111
It's nothing.

275
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,749
What...

276
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:00,850
Yeah, all right.
Whatever you say.

277
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:02,368
Where's he going?

278
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:03,885
Uh, he's got
a first aid kit in his hut.

279
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,955
He's gonna stitch it up for me.
Come on!

280
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:08,024
You're joking, right?

281
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:09,392
No.

282
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:10,793
It's not the first time, either.

283
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,362
These sort of things happen
all the time.

284
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,031
Come on!

285
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,499
He lives down there?

286
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,867
No, of course not.

287
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:19,469
He lives in a caravan
in the forest,

288
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,571
on the other side
of the barracks.

289
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:23,439
But if we go this way,

290
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:24,574
we avoid having to deal

291
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:26,576
with that friend
of ours outside again.

292
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:27,877
Yeah.

293
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:30,146
And we're just gonna
go down there, just like that?

294
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,949
Come on.

295
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,951
It'll be more fun this way.

296
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:36,452
Yeah.

297
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,567
You could say Ed's
the real keeper of this castle.

298
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:55,171
He scares prying eyes away.

299
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,973
Even the damn bears
are scared of him.

300
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:01,611
But... What is he?
Mute or something?

301
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:04,147
Uh, not exactly.

302
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,615
He's just...

303
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,683
...not the most talkative
of people.

304
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:08,918
But he's quite the erudite.

305
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,086
You'll see.

306
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:19,095
Here's where
the officer's rooms were.

307
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,831
And at the far end,

308
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,666
Command and Captaincy offices.

309
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,712
And why was there a nursery?

310
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,582
Oh.

311
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,650
Some of the higher officers
lived here with their families.

312
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:46,022
There were stories

313
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:48,724
about how women became
more fertile in this forest.

314
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:51,961
It was a pretty productive time
for some of them.

315
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:53,196
Yeah.

316
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:58,768
Come on.

317
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,002
You're gonna like this.

318
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:30,800
Ah, leave it out,
will you?

319
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:32,034
Let me show her.

320
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:33,669
Come on.

321
00:21:39,043 --> 00:21:40,510
What's his problem now?

322
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:41,577
Ah, nothing.

323
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,113
He's just
over meticulous is all.

324
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:46,549
See?

325
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:48,518
This was how they got
to the higher floors.

326
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,723
Up there was the library,

327
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:54,957
the living room,
and the bedrooms

328
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,592
for the noncommissioned
officers.

329
00:21:57,762 --> 00:21:59,161
And down there?

330
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,296
Hell.

331
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,733
That actually
wouldn't surprise me.

332
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,270
Yeah, well,
the gateway at least.

333
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,338
Dr. Marshall's
molecular biology lab

334
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,607
and the weapons tunnel
were on the lower floors.

335
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,176
And...

336
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:16,712
if you stick your head in there
for a few seconds,

337
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:19,115
you can still hear the screams
of the long-lost souls

338
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,550
who were trapped down there.

339
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,620
You're making fun of me,
aren't you?

340
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,356
You be the judge.

341
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:40,770
Oh, my god, Joe.

342
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:41,871
What the hell is that?

343
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,608
I told you weird things
still happen around here.

344
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:50,296
Dude, what's really down there?

345
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:51,980
'Cause if you're not making
this up, I'm leaving right now.

346
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:55,785
Yeah, right, we're coming.
Keep your hat on.

347
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:59,855
He wants us to get a move on,
but pay no attention.

348
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:02,959
Well, true or not,

349
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,827
it's probably not the best idea

350
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:07,229
to be walking around here
on your own.

351
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,765
But I will put you
out of your misery,

352
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,634
and I will tell you what it is.

353
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:13,269
Yeah, something
that makes sense, please.

354
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,271
I'm serious!

355
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:18,774
And by the way,

356
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,776
do you really understand
everything that he says?

357
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:22,645
Um...

358
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:25,281
How do I explain this?

359
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:26,349
Let me break it down.

360
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:29,118
Have you ever had a dog?

361
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,253
Yeah, when I was a kid.

362
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:32,321
Chewie.

363
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,656
He was part
of the family.

364
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,791
Okay.
And even though Chewie,

365
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:37,226
all he ever did was bark,

366
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:39,762
you still understood
everything he said, right?

367
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:40,930
Yeah.

368
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:42,064
Exactly!

369
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,633
Well, imagine if you've had

370
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:46,168
a chance to share
a couple of beers with him.

371
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,237
I'm sure
your canine communication skills

372
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,772
would have reached
all new levels.

373
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:52,341
Well, I never thought
about it like that.

374
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,378
That's what I was trying
to say earlier.

375
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,514
More often than not,

376
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:59,649
the truth is actually a lot
less complicated than it seems.

377
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:00,750
You see,

378
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:02,218
that's what I was
getting at earlier

379
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,819
when we talked
about all those rumors

380
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:05,154
that were flying around.

381
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:06,222
Yeah. And...

382
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:07,890
What about those cries
we just heard?

383
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:09,425
Exactly.

384
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,127
What about those cries?

385
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,864
That's just the sound
of the north wind blowing

386
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:17,299
through the ventilation ducts
on the lower levels.

387
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:19,135
Well, that scared
the shit out of me.

388
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:23,773
Imagination can be
a man's worst friend.

389
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:26,008
Isn't that right, Ed?

390
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:37,186
Time to visit
the underworld, then?

391
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:39,088
Uh, not yet.

392
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,191
This is an exit
that leads directly outside.

393
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:47,997
<i> The Tetis Region</i>
<i>was one of the hot spots</i>

394
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,000
<i>where various UFO activity
was witnessed,</i>

395
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:54,470
<i>following the Cosmic Call
as a result of the power burst</i>

396
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:58,808
<i>caused by the Hiroshima
and Nagasaki bombs.</i>

397
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,879
<i>One of the most bizarre
UFO occurrences ever recorded</i>

398
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:06,716
<i>took place right here.</i>

399
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:09,952
<i>On October 15th, 1946,</i>

400
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:12,855
a manned alien ship crashed

401
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:16,192
in the rocky mountain range
you can see behind me.

402
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:18,427
The military swiftly moved in,

403
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,064
a 25-kilometer radius
extending from the crash site

404
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:24,767
was declared
off-limits to civilians.

405
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,071
It was impossible to gain access
to this forest

406
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:31,941
for the four decades

407
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:34,810
that the now abandoned
military reserve was operating.

408
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:37,546
But, on that October evening,

409
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:40,950
before the military even arrived
on the scene,

410
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:45,387
a local witnessed the event,
and he took a photograph.

411
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,261
That photograph
was published in the media,

412
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:54,330
which caused
the government to launch

413
00:25:54,332 --> 00:26:00,002
a relentless campaign rejecting
and debunking the proof.

414
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:03,005
Now, in the photograph
taken by the civilian,

415
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:06,342
we can see the image
of the flying saucer

416
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:11,213
and two human-shaped figures
lying on the ground

417
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,915
whose body measurements

418
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:16,218
deviate considerably
from the human norm.

419
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:18,554
The official version

420
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:21,490
attributed the event
to a military jet,

421
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:26,095
which crashed during training,
caused by rotational energy.

422
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:30,466
Accordingly, society mourned
the death of these two pilots,

423
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:32,067
whose charred cadavers

424
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:35,070
were said to have been retrieved
near the fuselage.

425
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:36,839
Hmm.

426
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:43,212
So, what became
of this third figure?

427
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:49,385
When they wake up
after the winter lethargy,

428
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:51,020
they have one hell
of an appetite

429
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:53,355
and are seriously
sexually active.

430
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:55,224
It's their mating season,
so they turn aggressive

431
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:57,193
because of how few
females there are.

432
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:00,429
And why are there
so few females?

433
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,999
I guess we'll have to ask
the man upstairs.

434
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:07,587
The thing is, they think

435
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:09,572
they're the fucking kings
of the jungle, you know?

436
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:11,273
No respect for us humans.

437
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:25,087
Sara?

438
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:28,958
Come over to me. It's okay.

439
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,262
Come over here.

440
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:36,665
Ed?

441
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:39,301
Your friend's back.

442
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:44,607
Okay, okay.

443
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,141
Follow, Ed, okay?

444
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,476
It's gonna be okay, I swear.

445
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:48,544
Okay.

446
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:50,579
Go, Sara, go!

447
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,055
You heard the boss complaining,
didn't you, you bastard?

448
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:02,558
Huh?

449
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,260
Well, you're gonna be in trouble
if he finds out.

450
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,030
You're done for, you hear me?

451
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:09,231
You're done for!

452
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:19,909
You think he's gonna be okay?

453
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:50,706
Oh, my...

454
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,007
Oh, my god, Joe.

455
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:53,175
I thought you
weren't coming back.

456
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:54,243
I'm okay. Don't worry.

457
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:56,478
Okay.

458
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,579
Now this...

459
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:59,381
this they do
show little respect to.

460
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:02,384
I think it's run off home.

461
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:05,654
Ed!

462
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,523
You can get your sewing kit
out now, buddy.

463
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:14,496
Where are you going now?

464
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:16,532
Jesus, Ed.

465
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:18,117
Leave it!

466
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:19,701
Ed, I know what you're like,
and you'll both get hurt.

467
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:22,404
Hey!

468
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:25,407
Okay, do it your way, yeah?

469
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:28,210
Same as always!

470
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:29,678
Yeah, you can do
all the explaining later, huh?

471
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:35,985
- Is he going to kill it?
- No.

472
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:39,221
Well, at least I hope not.

473
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:42,124
He's gonna teach it a lesson
in his own particular way.

474
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:43,258
Shouldn't you go with him?

475
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:45,627
Well...

476
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,163
Oh. No hurry.

477
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:52,735
Do you want me
to help you with...

478
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:54,103
Mmm, no.

479
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,471
It's okay. Thanks.

480
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,274
Um, I can probably do
a brushing up

481
00:29:59,276 --> 00:30:01,176
of my sewing skills
after last time.

482
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:12,354
Joe, can I take... a look?

483
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:14,356
Yeah, yeah, of course.

484
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:16,742
While the cat's away.

485
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:19,127
I mean, Ed doesn't really like
people meddling with his stuff.

486
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:31,473
You said, Dr. Marshal
was in charge of the lab, right?

487
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:33,609
Yep, he was.

488
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:35,244
And...

489
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:39,081
...he was Ed's dad.

490
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:41,683
He was what now?

491
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:44,486
Yeah. You heard me.

492
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:46,688
Ed was born and bred
in these here woods.

493
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,124
He's oblivious to the world
outside the forest.

494
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:50,192
Hence, his...

495
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:53,461
...kindred relationship
with the wildlife.

496
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,637
Everyone just assumed
he disappeared

497
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,639
in the explosion that...

498
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:04,706
...killed his parents

499
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,542
and destroyed
the military barracks.

500
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:09,244
But he was hiding in the woods,

501
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:10,612
and grew up
living like a caveman.

502
00:31:11,615 --> 00:31:13,382
But what about his family?

503
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:16,652
Didn't he have
uncles or grandparents?

504
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:19,221
Someone?

505
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:21,356
Yeah.

506
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:22,858
I guess there must've
been someone,

507
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:26,462
but this was
the only world he knew.

508
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,407
That's the embroidery done.

509
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:49,418
Yeah.

510
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,819
I guess he just
didn't wanna leave

511
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,288
his memories behind, you know?

512
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,592
And he probably felt
it was his responsibility

513
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:58,127
to carry on his dad's work.

514
00:31:58,662 --> 00:31:59,795
Can I take a look?

515
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,632
You're a reporter
with a scientific bent, too?

516
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:05,934
Yeah, of course.

517
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,571
No secrets here.

518
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:11,206
At least until
Ed gets back anyway.

519
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,550
Uh...

520
00:32:21,552 --> 00:32:23,919
Stay here and don't worry.
I'll be right back.

521
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:25,921
Ed?

522
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:29,258
Ed?

523
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,559
Where the hell
are you, buddy?

524
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,908
Hello?

525
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,710
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

526
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:23,445
What the fuck is that?

527
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:24,880
Joe!

528
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:26,982
Joe!

529
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:40,696
Joe!

530
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:53,275
Joe!

531
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,682
Show, motherfuck!

532
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:43,325
<i> Sara?</i>

533
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:45,794
<i>Sara?</i>

534
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,066
Sara?

535
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,507
Sara, wake up. Come on!

536
00:34:58,509 --> 00:34:59,641
Sara, can you hear me?

537
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:03,512
Have some water. It'll help.

538
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:10,786
Oh!

539
00:35:10,788 --> 00:35:12,721
Thank you.

540
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:13,955
I couldn't find you anywhere.

541
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:16,742
What?

542
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:18,593
Uh, I walked past here
like ten minutes ago

543
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:19,661
and you weren't here.

544
00:35:19,663 --> 00:35:21,863
I don't know where you were.

545
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,498
What I'm saying is,

546
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,434
I think we've just experienced
an encounter...

547
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:28,603
- of the fourth fucking kind.
- Fuck.

548
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:29,771
Do you know
what that means?

549
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,773
An abduction!

550
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:33,408
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

551
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,743
Whoa. Whoa.

552
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:37,112
- What is it?
- Oh, my god. I don't know.

553
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:38,580
Oh, that hurts!

554
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:41,717
- Oh!
- Joe.

555
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,352
What the fuck is this?

556
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:45,420
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my... Oh, my god.

557
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:47,389
Oh, my...

558
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:48,523
I'm gonna try again.

559
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:53,061
Zenith to Base, do you copy?

560
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,366
Zenith to Base, do you copy?

561
00:35:58,001 --> 00:35:59,067
Fuck!

562
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,837
Fuck! Fucking technology!

563
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,672
I've tried, like, 20 times
and nothing. It's fried.

564
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,075
What happened to Ed?

565
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:09,378
I don't know.

566
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:11,012
I lost track of him
after the gunshots.

567
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:12,647
I can't remember anything else.

568
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:13,882
I woke up back over there.

569
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:16,518
And, Sara...

570
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:19,588
there's a mark on my ankle, too.

571
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,593
You too!

572
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,997
We've got to get out of here,
we're way too exposed.

573
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:30,132
- Okay.
- Okay.

574
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,474
Okay.

575
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:41,076
- I know somewhere safer.
- Okay.

576
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:43,812
Wait! Wait, wait.

577
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:45,147
Where's my camera?

578
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:46,214
Where's my camera?

579
00:36:46,216 --> 00:36:47,749
I got it, I got it, I got it.

580
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:51,953
Hey.

581
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:56,491
We've gotta go back
to the barracks.

582
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:57,526
Okay.

583
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,146
It's okay.

584
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:53,081
Come on.

585
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:57,486
Okay.

586
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:58,520
Just rest here.

587
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,523
Okay.

588
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,129
Okay.

589
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:11,199
Just try and relax,
and wait for me here, okay?

590
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,267
Joe.

591
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:13,502
I'm gonna go check it out first.

592
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,736
Please, please be careful,
please?

593
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,706
Hey.

594
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:19,708
It's okay.

595
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,809
Yeah?

596
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:22,043
I'll be literally two minutes.

597
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:35,090
Fuck.

598
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:38,026
The fuck have you done to me?

599
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:47,269
Must have dropped it.

600
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:00,215
Hello?

601
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:02,784
Hello?

602
00:39:07,724 --> 00:39:09,190
Shit.

603
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:12,827
Fuck.

604
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:21,903
<i> All right,</i>
<i>here we are again.</i>

605
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:23,338
<i> I know. On the way.</i>

606
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,774
<i> I hate these bumps.</i>

607
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:27,809
I hate that there's bumps
in the middle of the road.

608
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:30,078
Some people like you
will slow down.

609
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
- I always slow down.
- Yeah, I know.

610
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:34,249
I just think
that we take things for granted.

611
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:35,584
You know, it's as if

612
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:36,885
people think
they're gonna live forever,

613
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:38,219
but that's not the case.

614
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:39,788
- What?
- I mean, things can end

615
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,855
at any moment.

616
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:42,507
And take us, for example.

617
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,158
I mean, there's a purpose
for why we're in this car.

618
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,694
Yeah, of course,
there's a reason.

619
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:47,362
We went
to the same school together.

620
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:49,364
Oh, stop being a shithead, Will.

621
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:52,100
I mean, I read about this
in one of those self-help books,

622
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:55,036
and it says that it's nothing
but a simple countdown.

623
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:56,705
You read way too much.

624
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:01,710
Every day wasted
is like a slap in the face

625
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:03,645
- to your dreams.
- What...

626
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:05,313
<i> Hello?</i>

627
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,048
What's going on?

628
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,850
It is, and while
there's no predicting it,

629
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:11,853
our time here can run out
when least expected.

630
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:13,388
Bullshit, woman!

631
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,223
What do you mean "bullshit"?

632
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:16,858
Do you know
where my dreams start and end?

633
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,926
Where?

634
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:20,512
On the sofa.

635
00:40:20,513 --> 00:40:23,097
Watching a game of football
and sipping an ice-cold beer.

636
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,634
- Hm.
- And I can tell right now,

637
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:27,669
that's something
I'll never be late for.

638
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:29,104
Ah, you're hopeless.

639
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,041
<i> Hello... Hello?</i>

640
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:34,843
- What's that?
<i>-  Can anybody hear me?</i>

641
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:37,145
Oh, fuck! Again.

642
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:38,747
<i> ...encounter</i>
<i>near the old barracks.</i>

643
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:39,881
<i>Help me!</i>

644
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,284
<i> Someone just help me,</i>
<i>please!</i>

645
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:46,121
<i>Help!</i>

646
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:47,455
- <i>Joe!</i>
- Looks like those damned bears

647
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:49,257
have gone too far this time.

648
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:50,992
Well, they don't seem
too concerned about it.

649
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:52,193
They have the department.

650
00:40:53,263 --> 00:40:54,329
Well, if it's up to me,

651
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:57,666
I'd sort that shit out
right away.

652
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,834
Base, this is 03,
do you read me?

653
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:05,273
We have a possible code 86
out by the old barracks.

654
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:07,075
Repeat. Possible code 86.

655
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:08,376
How shall we proceed? Over.

656
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,680
You know what?
Let's just head over there.

657
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:13,848
That's good. Yeah.

658
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,684
I'll enjoy catching
that cuddly toy.

659
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,820
And when I do,

660
00:41:18,822 --> 00:41:20,388
I'll blow its brains out.

661
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,795
Base, this is 03,
awaiting instructions.

662
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:27,929
Do you read me?

663
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:31,266
<i> Affirmative 03.</i>

664
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,301
<i>Old barracks
and surrounding area,</i>

665
00:41:33,303 --> 00:41:34,703
<i>off-limits.</i>

666
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:36,705
<i>Please proceed
with your normal route.</i>

667
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:37,772
<i>Over and out.</i>

668
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:44,112
Copy that, base.
Standing down.

669
00:41:44,114 --> 00:41:45,931
What?

670
00:41:45,932 --> 00:41:47,749
We will proceed
with the normal route.

671
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,853
You know, like I said, it's like
they don't give a shit.

672
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,256
Well, I...

673
00:41:55,258 --> 00:41:57,058
I don't... I don't know
if we should continue.

674
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,743
What?

675
00:41:58,744 --> 00:42:00,427
If we don't go, they'll just
turn up when it's too late.

676
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,030
Like they always do.

677
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:05,934
Hey, you know
I'm always careful.

678
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:29,858
Joe! Joe!

679
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

680
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:32,611
- Don't leave me alone.
- It's okay.

681
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:33,862
- Don't leave me alone.
- It's okay. It's okay.

682
00:42:33,864 --> 00:42:35,530
You're okay. Yeah?

683
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:39,334
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to find something, but...

684
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:41,035
Let's go. Come on.
You can come with me.

685
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:43,404
It's okay.

686
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:47,308
It tried
to attack me, Joe.

687
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,010
Where are we going?

688
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:52,313
Into hell, Sara.

689
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:54,115
This time, for real.

690
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:55,984
Are you sure
we're safer in there?

691
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:58,186
I think so.

692
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:29,217
That son of a bitch
is back.

693
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:32,020
Come on, quickly.

694
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:45,567
Can you manage?

695
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,268
Yeah. Yeah.

696
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,603
But I don't know
where I'm going.

697
00:43:53,476 --> 00:43:54,609
- Shit. Shit!
- What?

698
00:43:54,611 --> 00:43:55,643
Joe!

699
00:43:56,913 --> 00:43:57,979
Joe!

700
00:43:57,981 --> 00:43:59,080
- Motherfucker. I'm...
- Joe!

701
00:43:59,082 --> 00:44:00,281
Joe...

702
00:44:00,283 --> 00:44:01,983
Joe! What the fuck is going on?

703
00:44:04,254 --> 00:44:05,887
Joe! Please!

704
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:19,367
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

705
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:20,568
It's me. It's okay.

706
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,470
Hey...

707
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:24,339
Hey, don't worry.
We're gonna be okay. Yeah?

708
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:25,406
Okay.

709
00:44:25,408 --> 00:44:26,507
Oh!

710
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:29,244
We're gonna keep going.
Come on.

711
00:45:17,994 --> 00:45:19,560
I don't know about this, Joe.

712
00:45:19,562 --> 00:45:21,396
Sara, come on. Trust me.

713
00:45:21,398 --> 00:45:22,463
It's gonna be okay.

714
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,383
That was not
a fucking bear, Joe.

715
00:45:47,624 --> 00:45:48,756
No.

716
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:50,558
That was not a fucking bear.

717
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:52,493
Come on.

718
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:56,297
Do you hear those cries?

719
00:45:57,033 --> 00:45:58,566
Yeah.

720
00:45:58,568 --> 00:46:00,668
I think they're coming
from over there.

721
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,603
Yeah. Well, that's the direction
we're headed in.

722
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:04,238
- Okay.
- The north tunnel runs directly

723
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,506
to the vehicle entrance.

724
00:46:48,818 --> 00:46:50,685
Hey. Over there.

725
00:46:51,354 --> 00:46:52,770
Where?

726
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,187
Behind those bushes.
Don't you see it?

727
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:58,026
Will, I don't see anything.

728
00:46:58,028 --> 00:46:59,494
Don't worry, Sam.

729
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:02,230
Leave me to deal with this.
All right?

730
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:04,332
I bet that son of a bitch
is about to catch that girl.

731
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:08,569
Will, I think we should call
for backup.

732
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:10,738
How the fuck are we gonna call
for backup now?

733
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,839
Huh?

734
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:14,208
That's the last thing
we can do...

735
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,676
You brought me here, right?

736
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:17,211
- I know, but...
- Yeah. Well, let me finish

737
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:19,163
what we started, then.

738
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:21,114
Will, this is crazy.
We should call for backup.

739
00:48:06,362 --> 00:48:07,395
This is all wrong.

740
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:18,906
Base, this is 03.
Do you read me?

741
00:48:22,412 --> 00:48:24,745
Base, this is 03.
Do you read me?

742
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:30,818
Requesting backup for a code 86.

743
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,386
<i> Receiving you, 03.</i>

744
00:48:32,388 --> 00:48:33,821
<i>Stay in the vehicle.</i>

745
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:36,224
<i>You should have proceeded
with your normal route.</i>

746
00:48:36,226 --> 00:48:38,259
<i>We're sending backup. Over.</i>

747
00:48:57,313 --> 00:48:58,679
Hey.

748
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:00,648
Where are you? Huh?

749
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,316
I know you're there.

750
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:03,618
You wanna piece of me,
don't you?

751
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,685
Huh?

752
00:49:05,688 --> 00:49:07,555
Come on!

753
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:09,323
Son of a bitch!
I know you're there.

754
00:49:09,592 --> 00:49:10,691
Hey!

755
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:13,361
What? Where the fuck
are you? Huh?

756
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:15,429
Come on. Come on!

757
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:17,598
I know you're there. Help!

758
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,800
Fuck! What the fuck is that?

759
00:49:19,802 --> 00:49:21,669
You wanna piece of me,
don't you? Eh?

760
00:49:32,382 --> 00:49:33,565
Ahh!

761
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,217
Oh, my god.

762
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:40,755
Will!

763
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,243
Are you okay?

764
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:05,313
Yeah.

765
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:06,681
Yeah. I'm sorry.

766
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:08,032
What's wrong with me?

767
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:09,382
Hey, don't worry.
It's probably just nerves.

768
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,755
I'm sorry, Sara,
but we've gotta keep moving.

769
00:50:14,757 --> 00:50:15,990
I know.

770
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:17,758
I know. I'm okay. Let's go.

771
00:50:35,545 --> 00:50:36,811
Joe.

772
00:50:36,813 --> 00:50:38,312
That's Ed?

773
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:39,814
No.

774
00:50:39,816 --> 00:50:41,616
- Oh, my...
- It can't be.

775
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,201
I knew...

776
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:44,785
I knew there was something wrong
with him when I saw him.

777
00:50:44,787 --> 00:50:46,337
I knew it.

778
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,888
There's no way, Sara.
There has to be an explanation.

779
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:50,057
Then why aren't you shouting
and running over to him?

780
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:52,460
Because I can't be
so sure now, either.

781
00:50:52,462 --> 00:50:54,362
Men are so clueless sometimes.

782
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:04,005
That's the fucking thing
that attacked me, Joe.

783
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:06,741
- Oh, my god!
- Run, Sara. Run!

784
00:51:06,743 --> 00:51:09,510
Oh, my god, Joe!
What the fuck was that?

785
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:18,919
No!

786
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:27,428
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

787
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,664
Whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

788
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,699
- Sorry, I can't help...
- It's okay. It's okay.

789
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:33,534
Hey. It's okay.

790
00:51:34,537 --> 00:51:35,803
Hey.

791
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:37,338
It's okay.

792
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,506
We're safe. We're safe.

793
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:40,841
You can.

794
00:51:40,843 --> 00:51:42,009
You can.

795
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:43,911
We're gonna be okay, yeah?

796
00:51:43,913 --> 00:51:45,913
I'm gonna get us out of here.

797
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:48,783
We're gonna get out of here.

798
00:51:48,785 --> 00:51:49,850
Yeah?

799
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:50,918
Yeah.

800
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,666
What?

801
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:29,984
Will!

802
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:16,964
God!

803
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,477
<i> And the images</i>
<i>we're about to see</i>

804
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:32,046
<i>will prove,
without a shadow of doubt,</i>

805
00:54:32,048 --> 00:54:34,899
<i>the types of experiments</i>

806
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,751
<i>the depraved Doctor Marshall
and his wife performed down here</i>

807
00:54:37,753 --> 00:54:41,255
<i>in the depths
of the military base.</i>

808
00:54:41,257 --> 00:54:43,791
<i>Although, I'm sure you're
probably asking yourselves,</i>

809
00:54:43,793 --> 00:54:47,761
<i>"What happened
to that sole alien survivor?"</i>

810
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:50,798
<i>With not a shred
of physical proof</i>

811
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,234
<i>suggesting the fact
that it even existed.</i>

812
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:56,837
<i>Maybe it was simply
just destroyed</i>

813
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:00,241
<i>in the explosion
that killed the doctor,</i>

814
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:01,876
<i>and virtually,
every one of the soldiers</i>

815
00:55:01,878 --> 00:55:03,861
<i>housed at the barracks.</i>

816
00:55:03,862 --> 00:55:05,845
- Fucking psychopath.
<i>- Maybe it was. Yes.</i>

817
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:08,649
<i>Just as, maybe,
on the afternoon</i>

818
00:55:08,651 --> 00:55:11,051
<i>of April 30th, 1946,</i>

819
00:55:11,053 --> 00:55:15,589
<i>Magda Goebbels convinced
Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun</i>

820
00:55:15,591 --> 00:55:18,759
<i>to fake their deaths and flee
to South America.</i>

821
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:22,663
<i>At this point, it's up to you</i>

822
00:55:22,665 --> 00:55:25,633
<i>what to believe and what not to.</i>

823
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,936
<i>Each to their own.</i>

824
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,587
What the fuck
is all this shit, Joe?

825
00:55:46,589 --> 00:55:48,589
Sara.

826
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:50,891
Sara, come on. Come on.
I think it's gone.

827
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,031
What... Can anybody explain
any of this, Joe?

828
00:55:57,033 --> 00:55:58,299
How the hell
am I supposed to know

829
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:00,000
what goes on down there, Sara?
Come on, Come on.

830
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:01,268
- Hey, look, it's just... Hey.
- No, I can't.

831
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,803
- Take my hand. Take my hand.
- No, I can't.

832
00:56:02,805 --> 00:56:04,972
- Hey. Yeah, you can. You can.
- No, I can't.

833
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:06,774
It's gonna be okay. Yeah?

834
00:56:06,776 --> 00:56:08,108
It's gonna be okay.

835
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:10,277
Come on.

836
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:14,148
On three, we move.

837
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,182
Okay?

838
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,023
One.

839
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:25,993
Two.

840
00:56:29,165 --> 00:56:31,065
Three. Go! Go!

841
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:32,666
Run!

842
00:56:40,376 --> 00:56:43,110
Joe! What are you doing?

843
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:45,312
I'm sorry, Sara.

844
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:46,413
I'm sorry.

845
00:56:46,415 --> 00:56:48,182
You can't leave me here!

846
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:51,385
I'll come back for you.

847
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:53,220
I promise I'll come back.

848
00:56:53,222 --> 00:56:54,421
Whatever happens, just...

849
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,191
just know I'm sorry.

850
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:05,332
Ed? It's dead!
You hear me?

851
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:08,385
- Joe!
- I'm gonna finish it

852
00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:09,902
- for good this time.
- Joe, are you okay?

853
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:16,470
Oh, my god.
What have they done to you?

854
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:31,418
What have they done to you?

855
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,957
No. No.

856
00:58:36,959 --> 00:58:39,293
No! No! No!

857
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:42,229
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

858
00:59:23,506 --> 00:59:25,506
Oh.

859
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:27,574
Get out of the way,
you good-for-nothing half-wit.

860
00:59:29,178 --> 00:59:31,145
Oh, my pretty.

861
00:59:32,815 --> 00:59:34,148
Hold her for me, son.

862
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:41,855
Oh, shut up, whore!

863
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:42,923
You wet yourself?

864
00:59:44,593 --> 00:59:46,443
I'm sick and tired

865
00:59:46,444 --> 00:59:48,294
of these damned hysterical girls
you keep bringing in, Ed.

866
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:49,797
Eh!

867
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,832
Eh, stop your squealing
like a little pig!

868
00:59:52,468 --> 00:59:53,801
Now...

869
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:56,403
Looking good.

870
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:14,488
Goddamnit.

871
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:17,090
Oh.

872
01:00:17,092 --> 01:00:19,326
This is gonna boost
your fertility

873
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:20,527
and make a real woman
out of you.

874
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:24,965
Ed, that's... Ah!

875
01:00:26,368 --> 01:00:28,836
You're gonna enjoy this.

876
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:31,505
Just like I did
when I was about your age.

877
01:00:33,576 --> 01:00:35,609
You can let her go now.

878
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:37,244
And let him know!

879
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:43,617
Now, that's more like it.

880
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:45,385
Teamwork and coordination.

881
01:00:45,387 --> 01:00:47,921
Your daddy would be proud.
Help me up.

882
01:00:47,923 --> 01:00:49,389
That's it.

883
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:51,391
Now, uh...

884
01:00:51,393 --> 01:00:54,027
You stay here
and watch over them.

885
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:57,431
And don't you be
touching yourself.

886
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:58,932
Then come and help me.

887
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:00,267
I'm gonna check
on the other two.

888
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:05,966
Joe... Joe.

889
01:02:05,968 --> 01:02:07,134
Joe!

890
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:08,468
Joe!

891
01:02:48,277 --> 01:02:50,043
Thank you.

892
01:03:00,055 --> 01:03:01,321
So...

893
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:03,490
You must be Sara.

894
01:03:07,363 --> 01:03:09,062
Yeah... Yeah.

895
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:11,365
You're the...

896
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:15,102
That's right.

897
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:16,370
I'm Mrs. Marshall.

898
01:03:16,372 --> 01:03:17,604
Ed's mom.

899
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:22,342
Anything I can help you
with there?

900
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:24,745
Uh...

901
01:03:26,815 --> 01:03:28,482
Uh, mm...

902
01:03:28,484 --> 01:03:30,017
Maybe, I... I...

903
01:03:31,253 --> 01:03:34,087
Have you seen the ranger? Joe?

904
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:37,824
Well, um...

905
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:40,227
I don't, I don't know
how to explain this

906
01:03:40,229 --> 01:03:41,328
to you, but, um...

907
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:44,297
We were outside,

908
01:03:45,334 --> 01:03:47,200
and... and a bear attacked us.

909
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:51,538
Hm. There are no bears
in my garden, little lady.

910
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,173
I would have thought you would
have been smart enough

911
01:03:53,175 --> 01:03:54,608
to figure that one out by now.

912
01:03:55,844 --> 01:03:57,344
I...

913
01:03:57,346 --> 01:03:59,312
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

914
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:03,116
Joe!

915
01:04:03,118 --> 01:04:04,317
Joe!

916
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:25,772
Ah, fuck.

917
01:04:42,224 --> 01:04:43,657
What the fuck is...

918
01:04:46,295 --> 01:04:47,327
Huh...

919
01:04:55,871 --> 01:04:58,638
This is coming along
very nicely, dear.

920
01:05:01,143 --> 01:05:04,244
Oh, it's a little girl.

921
01:05:04,246 --> 01:05:05,579
Just like its mama.

922
01:05:06,715 --> 01:05:08,748
What the fuck
are you doing to me?

923
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:13,253
Now, now, Sara.

924
01:05:13,255 --> 01:05:14,621
Don't be ungrateful.

925
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:18,525
Honestly, didn't they teach you
any manners at school?

926
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:25,765
Let me go,
you fucking psychopath!

927
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,167
Motherfucker...

928
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:36,676
We have spent
the last three decades

929
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:40,213
trying to successfully breed
a hybrid female.

930
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:41,715
And at last,

931
01:05:41,717 --> 01:05:44,651
it looks like we found
the right formula.

932
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:49,389
If only the doctor could be here
to witness it.

933
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,725
He'd be so proud
that we'll be bringing

934
01:05:51,727 --> 01:05:53,627
two little girls into the world.

935
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:57,898
That's not happening.

936
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:03,436
Crazy bitch.

937
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:07,707
Hope you burn in hell.

938
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:10,810
Joe!

939
01:06:11,313 --> 01:06:12,546
Joe!

940
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:14,447
Sara, run.
Run and don't look back!

941
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:16,816
Where the hell are you?

942
01:06:16,818 --> 01:06:18,385
Get out
of this hellhole, please.

943
01:06:18,387 --> 01:06:20,287
Sorry, Sara. Please forgive me.

944
01:06:20,289 --> 01:06:22,189
I'm not leaving
without you, Joe!

945
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:24,191
Sara, do not come in here.

946
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,849
What the fuck is going on?

947
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,699
Completing what God started.

948
01:06:35,837 --> 01:06:38,238
Son of a bitch! You can speak.

949
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,207
We can all speak here, sweetie.

950
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:09,869
I'm sorry, Sara.

951
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:14,841
You're a hybrid.

952
01:07:18,313 --> 01:07:20,313
Just like your daughter.

953
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:30,490
We are family now, Sara.

954
01:07:30,492 --> 01:07:31,791
Just accept it!

955
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:34,060
No!

956
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:47,474
<i>If my findings are right,</i>

957
01:07:47,476 --> 01:07:49,876
<i>Dr. Marshall had three sons.</i>

958
01:07:49,878 --> 01:07:53,580
<i>Two of which we have seen
running around the lab as kids.</i>

959
01:07:53,582 --> 01:07:55,515
<i>The chubby one</i>

960
01:07:55,516 --> 01:07:57,449
<i>and the one with the mark
on his face.</i>

961
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:00,487
<i>While the identity
of the third child is...</i>

962
01:08:00,489 --> 01:08:02,055
<i>unknown,</i>

963
01:08:02,056 --> 01:08:03,622
<i>it would seem safe to assume
that if--</i>

964
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,759
<i>Help! Help! Help!</i>

965
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:07,494
<i>Okay. All right.
All right. Okay.</i>

966
01:08:07,496 --> 01:08:08,628
<i>All right. Are you okay...</i>

967
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,014
<i>All right. Calm down.</i>

968
01:08:11,015 --> 01:08:13,399
<i>Look. Look. You can go to my car
but I have to get to work.</i>

969
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:14,567
<i>I gotta keep my camera...</i>

970
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:16,503
<i>Okay.</i>

971
01:08:16,505 --> 01:08:19,806
It's okay. I'll be right there.
All right.

972
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:21,508
Okay.

973
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:22,909
We'll get you somewhere...

974
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,611
...somewhere safe.

975
01:08:24,613 --> 01:08:26,313
Some warm food.

976
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,065
Look, I told you
it's gonna be okay, okay?

977
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:46,099
Yeah.

978
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:49,002
So, uh...

979
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:51,438
Did you see the first episode
of the documentary, then?

980
01:08:52,908 --> 01:08:54,341
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

981
01:08:55,711 --> 01:08:56,876
What did you make of it?

982
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:01,081
Great.

983
01:09:01,483 --> 01:09:02,549
Yeah.

984
01:09:04,152 --> 01:09:08,054
Good. 'Cause I've loved playing
with cameras ever since.

985
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:12,158
<i>Ever since I can remember.</i>

986
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:17,630
Any day now, I see.

987
01:09:23,805 --> 01:09:24,871
You think?

988
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,140
Yeah! Yeah!

989
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:30,377
Yeah, it's a...

990
01:09:30,378 --> 01:09:32,712
It's amazing how fast they,
they grow nowadays.

991
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:35,382
Well, you'll find out.

992
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,820
Oh, let me guess. Um...

993
01:09:40,822 --> 01:09:44,124
He told you that
you had been abducted, right?

994
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:46,192
By aliens, no?

995
01:09:47,596 --> 01:09:50,397
Yeah! Of course, he did!

996
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,533
Yeah, 'cause, man, he's
one fucking nasty piece of work,

997
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,601
that fucking guy.

998
01:09:54,603 --> 01:09:55,802
He's a...

999
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:57,737
...a fucking goddamn hybrid!

1000
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,607
Yeah. Yeah.

1001
01:10:00,609 --> 01:10:02,542
Now, with mother fucking helping

1002
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:04,944
on... on...
on boosting fertility.

1003
01:10:04,946 --> 01:10:06,446
Ooh!

1004
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:09,416
He has his way with everything

1005
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:12,952
and anything that wanders out
into our little, whoo...

1006
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:14,788
neck of the woods.

1007
01:10:17,025 --> 01:10:19,592
I mean, just think about it.

1008
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:24,230
If we actually manage
to engender a, a female hybrid.

1009
01:10:24,232 --> 01:10:25,799
Oh, god!

1010
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:28,435
I shudder to think what's next.

1011
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:30,103
A new species, Mama says.

1012
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,005
Yeah. Yeah.

1013
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:33,940
"'Cause that was
your father's dream!

1014
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:36,176
Yeah, that was
your father's dream."

1015
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:37,777
Yeah, but that's
the fucking problem, you see?

1016
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:39,612
That's the fucking problem!

1017
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:41,748
Everybody is so fucking
wrapped up

1018
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,184
in their own
fucking dreams, right?

1019
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:46,019
And I'm telling you,
you have to be careful,

1020
01:10:46,021 --> 01:10:47,787
you have to... you have to...

1021
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:50,190
you need to be careful
with what you wish for.

1022
01:10:50,192 --> 01:10:51,958
Because if it comes true,

1023
01:10:51,959 --> 01:10:53,725
and then you find out that it's
not what you actually wanted,

1024
01:10:53,728 --> 01:10:55,061
and then, you're fucked.

1025
01:10:55,063 --> 01:10:56,729
Then you're fucked.
That's it. It's over.

1026
01:10:56,731 --> 01:10:58,598
And then, then what? Huh?

1027
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,116
Then what? Then...

1028
01:11:00,117 --> 01:11:01,633
There's no turning back.
That's it. That's it.

1029
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:02,802
End of the story.

1030
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:06,573
I mean, fucking goddamn hybrid!

1031
01:11:06,575 --> 01:11:08,675
Can you, can you imagine that?

1032
01:11:08,677 --> 01:11:11,144
Oh, god. They'd be worse
than fucking humans, man.

1033
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:13,480
And the humans
are fucking bad enough as it is.

1034
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:15,582
Don't you think?

1035
01:11:15,584 --> 01:11:17,150
Huh?

1036
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:20,487
I mean,

1037
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,689
how can anybody,
in their right mind,

1038
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:24,023
think that the fucking
extraterrestrials

1039
01:11:24,025 --> 01:11:25,525
even wanna fucking come back?

1040
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:27,026
Do they really think
they're that fucking stupid?

1041
01:11:27,762 --> 01:11:29,128
Huh?

1042
01:11:31,332 --> 01:11:33,533
And what the fuck would they
be interested in discovering

1043
01:11:33,535 --> 01:11:36,636
out here in our little piece
of shit corner of the galaxy,

1044
01:11:36,638 --> 01:11:38,538
populated by nothing, but a...

1045
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,173
worthless,

1046
01:11:41,142 --> 01:11:42,308
miserable,

1047
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:43,576
selfish,

1048
01:11:43,578 --> 01:11:45,778
fucking pathetic species?

1049
01:11:50,785 --> 01:11:51,918
Did you see what I'm saying?

1050
01:11:54,089 --> 01:11:56,189
Did you see what I'm saying?

1051
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,258
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1052
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,692
You get it, don't you?

1053
01:12:02,264 --> 01:12:05,098
"Thou shalt not steal.

1054
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,033
Thou shalt not...

1055
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:10,637
bear false witness against
thy neighbor. Thou shalt not...

1056
01:12:10,639 --> 01:12:12,772
covet thy neighbor's wife."

1057
01:12:12,774 --> 01:12:16,276
Not their ass, their dwelling,
nor their ox.

1058
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:18,578
"Thou shalt not kill."
What is that?

1059
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,779
"Thou shalt..."

1060
01:12:19,781 --> 01:12:21,114
"Thou shalt not kill."

1061
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:23,116
What the fuck?

1062
01:12:24,753 --> 01:12:26,920
Yeah. Oh, god.

1063
01:12:26,922 --> 01:12:29,255
Yeah. You must have been out
to fucking lunch

1064
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:32,091
the day you left your fucking
underlings in charge,

1065
01:12:32,093 --> 01:12:33,893
to come up with us.

1066
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:35,795
To create us fucking
human beings.

1067
01:12:35,797 --> 01:12:37,597
And they used all
the fucking shit

1068
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:39,165
that they could find
around up there.

1069
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,733
And it's fucking in us.

1070
01:12:40,735 --> 01:12:42,335
It's fucking in us.

1071
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:49,175
Oh, god. Ah, fucking humans.

1072
01:12:49,177 --> 01:12:51,744
Oh, they are the fucking worst.

1073
01:12:51,746 --> 01:12:53,046
The fucking worst.

1074
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:56,916
Okay.

1075
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,386
All of it, it's just...

1076
01:13:00,388 --> 01:13:02,021
a matter of time now.

1077
01:13:05,293 --> 01:13:07,660
Oh, just a silly
little fucking waiting game.

1078
01:13:13,902 --> 01:13:15,168
I'm sorry I didn't...

1079
01:13:16,137 --> 01:13:17,737
I didn't mean to yell.

1080
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:22,942
It's okay.

1081
01:13:22,944 --> 01:13:24,744
We're the good ones, okay?

1082
01:13:25,146 --> 01:13:26,279
All right?

1083
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:28,247
It's gonna be okay.

1084
01:13:29,351 --> 01:13:30,817
We're gonna get you home.

1085
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:31,951
Okay?

1086
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,720
All right? So, don't worry.

1087
01:13:33,722 --> 01:13:35,989
All right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

1088
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:37,323
All right. Yeah.

1089
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,436
Hey, be more careful! Jesus...

1090
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:54,040
Christ!

1091
01:14:00,682 --> 01:14:03,316
No trace of Sam, sir.

1092
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:05,852
Then he's probably taking her
back to his lair.

1093
01:14:07,255 --> 01:14:08,388
Help!

1094
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:10,823
Help!

1095
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:19,065
What the fuck?

1096
01:14:25,907 --> 01:14:28,107
Hey, calm down. Calm down.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1097
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:29,709
Hey.

1098
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:31,444
All right.
What's eating you, little lady?

1099
01:14:31,446 --> 01:14:32,912
Those fucking bears?

1100
01:14:32,914 --> 01:14:34,113
No. Please.

1101
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:36,249
- Please. Please.
- Don't worry. You're safe.

1102
01:14:36,251 --> 01:14:37,450
Look at me.

1103
01:14:37,452 --> 01:14:38,918
You're safe now.

1104
01:14:41,156 --> 01:14:42,922
Put her in the car.

1105
01:14:42,924 --> 01:14:44,824
And you give her something
to calm her down.

1106
01:14:44,826 --> 01:14:46,459
Now.

1107
01:14:51,966 --> 01:14:53,966
What the hell is going on here?

1108
01:14:53,968 --> 01:14:56,369
You still not finished
with that documentary, or what?

1109
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:58,471
Yeah.

1110
01:14:58,473 --> 01:15:00,940
Uh, no. I'm working on a sequel,
so, um...

1111
01:15:00,942 --> 01:15:03,142
I guess, no. Um...

1112
01:15:03,144 --> 01:15:06,079
But, I, I don't know
what happened, Inspector.

1113
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:07,814
I... I saw her over
on the other side,

1114
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:10,049
and, you know, she was running
away from the barracks.

1115
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:11,951
So what the hell happened
to her?

1116
01:15:11,953 --> 01:15:14,754
I don't know. I think
she's a little crazy, Inspector.

1117
01:15:14,756 --> 01:15:16,255
She was going on and on

1118
01:15:16,257 --> 01:15:17,757
about... about an abduction

1119
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:19,759
and a woman
in a white nurse's uniform.

1120
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:21,294
She's too Cuckoo.

1121
01:15:21,296 --> 01:15:22,862
Did you not see Joe up there?

1122
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,233
Speaking of the devil,
there he is!

1123
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:29,135
Can you wait for me
in the car, asswipe?

1124
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:32,789
Yeah, well, I can't wait to hear

1125
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:34,140
what kinda cockamamie
bullshit stories--

1126
01:15:34,142 --> 01:15:35,742
Get the fuck out of here!

1127
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:46,853
- I'm really sorry.
- You're sorry?

1128
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:50,957
What the fuck
happened here, Joe?

1129
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,760
I mean, can somebody,
please, tell me

1130
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:55,194
what the hell is going on?

1131
01:15:56,331 --> 01:15:58,364
I've got an agent
mauled to death.

1132
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:01,100
Oh, and then some girl turns up,

1133
01:16:01,102 --> 01:16:03,569
making absolutely no sense,
whatsoever.

1134
01:16:03,571 --> 01:16:06,773
And going on
about some abduction.

1135
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:08,941
It didn't occur to you
to call me?

1136
01:16:08,943 --> 01:16:11,577
Am I the only sane one
on this fucking planet, or what?

1137
01:16:11,579 --> 01:16:13,312
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Yeah. You already said that.

1138
01:16:14,382 --> 01:16:16,182
The guy's just got
a little too...

1139
01:16:17,418 --> 01:16:18,518
Oh, Jesus.

1140
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:24,323
Well, it looks like you got
your work cut out for you.

1141
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:25,558
You'd better get on with it.

1142
01:16:26,828 --> 01:16:28,227
Yeah. I best had.

1143
01:16:30,832 --> 01:16:32,131
You'll have to excuse me.

1144
01:16:37,405 --> 01:16:39,438
Come find me
whenever you want.

1145
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,808
<i>Mi casa su casa and all that.</i>

1146
01:16:43,077 --> 01:16:44,177
Asshole!

1147
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:54,587
Hey.
