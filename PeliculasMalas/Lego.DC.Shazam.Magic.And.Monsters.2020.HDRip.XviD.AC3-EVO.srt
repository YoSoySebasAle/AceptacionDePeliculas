2
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:46,363
Come on, come on,
they're gaining on us.

3
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:47,730
I'll lose 'em.

4
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:53,036
Yeah, that's right.

5
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,304
- Look out!
- Ahhh!

6
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:59,876
Oh, gee. Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

7
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,312
Huh?

8
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:08,517
Stop.
That tickles.

9
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,466
Oh, wow!

10
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:26,468
Still getting used
to that strength thing.

11
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:28,771
- Everybody okay?
- Huh?

12
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:32,042
Good. Now hand me
those weapons.

13
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,542
Where are my manners?

14
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,577
Please hand me those weapons.

15
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,347
Can't believe
I forgot the "please."

16
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:38,814
Wow.

17
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:42,818
Okay, I hope you learned
your lesson.

18
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:45,255
Crime doesn't pay.

19
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:46,856
<i>Adios.</i>

20
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,428
Who is that guy?
A new superhero?

21
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:54,097
Yeah, a super polite hero.

22
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:59,768
Come on.

23
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:02,038
Are you ready
to do this deal?

24
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:03,139
As long as you don't get

25
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,242
cold flippers
like last time, Penguin.

26
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:08,811
Hah, cold flippers.

27
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:15,151
Ahem!

28
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,853
What? Who was that?

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,821
Up here.

30
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,390
I didn't wanna be rude
and interrupt

31
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:22,524
but, well,
then I did because,

32
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,526
you know, criminal activity.

33
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:25,828
Get him, boys.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,068
I've had enough of being
tickled today, thank you.

35
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,803
Now, how about everyone
comes along quietly?

36
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:37,840
Hah, not likely, Red.

37
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,978
Lasers don't hurt me,
so you think that chains will?

38
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:45,614
Come on, guys, I was trying
not to prejudge you.

39
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:50,887
So... quietly then?

40
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:56,393
Mitzi. Mitzi girl.

41
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:03,366
Is there a problem, miss?

42
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,869
Mitzi, she's stuck
in the tree.

43
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,004
Don't worry, I'll get her.

44
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,374
Come on, little kitten.

45
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,708
Whoa!

46
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,676
Ho-ho! Look at you.

47
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:17,447
Wow, how did you get up here?

48
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:20,283
Oh.

49
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,185
Come here. Here you go.

50
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:24,421
Try to keep her
on a leash from now on.

51
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,456
Not only is it practical,

52
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:27,957
it's the law.

53
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:31,061
So long.

54
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:35,198
Wow, that's the nicest
superhero ever.

55
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,009
Okay, no one around, so...

56
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:47,310
Shazam!

57
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,819
Best day ever!

58
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,258
Well, well, well,

59
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,661
little boy Batson
has finally returned.

60
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,198
Oh, hey, Terrance,
Corey, Brian.

61
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:09,265
How are you guys today?

62
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,834
Great. In fact,
better than great.

63
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,602
I don't know where
you went off to today,

64
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,705
but you missed out on a
nice couple from Metropolis

65
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:19,242
looking for a well-behaved
little boy.

66
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:22,345
And since you were gone,
they picked me.

67
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,917
I'm really happy
for you, Terrance.

68
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:31,321
Oh, I bet you are, Billy,
you're always selfless

69
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:35,492
and that's why you'll always
end up alone.

70
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,630
Later, little Billy.

71
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:44,367
Better luck next time.

72
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,701
Come on, guys.

73
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,604
Did I say "best"?

74
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,705
I meant worst day ever.

75
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,444
Take a look at these.
"Lightning guy stops robbery."

76
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,379
"Big cheese foils Falcone."

77
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:58,680
"Hero saves dog in tree."

78
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:00,183
He saved a dog from a tree?

79
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,352
I mean, even Superman
doesn't do that.

80
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,654
I'm sure Superman would
save a dog from a tree

81
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,257
if he ever saw one.

82
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:10,560
Maybe if we were paying
attention instead of talking,

83
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,495
we'd know, wouldn't we, Kent?

84
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,795
Sorry, Mr. White.

85
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:15,899
I don't want sorry,
I want answers.

86
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,400
Who is he?
Where is he from?

87
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,203
What's his name?
I mean, look at that profile.

88
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,305
His chin looks like
it was made of marble.

89
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,341
That's it. We'll call him
"Captain Marble."

90
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,876
Already taken, Chief.

91
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:29,711
Is it? It doesn't matter.
Point is, what does he want?

92
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,014
Why is he so polite?

93
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,949
This is the story
of the century.

94
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:36,286
And I want a <i>Daily Planet</i>
exclusive yesterday.

95
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,256
Well, what are you all
standing around for?

96
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:41,690
Go, go!

97
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,226
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

98
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,295
- No, it's okay...
- This is...

99
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,963
Yeesh.

100
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,398
- Kent.
- Yeah, I was just

101
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:50,333
about to go out
and get you that interview,

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,501
Mr. White.

103
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,969
Ah, don't worry
about that, son,

104
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,104
superheroes have never
been your strong suit.

105
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:56,639
Well, I don't know about that.

106
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,341
I have another assignment
for you.

107
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,010
Something important,
something meaningful,

108
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,146
something that
only you can do.

109
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:05,448
I won't let you down,
Mr. White. What is it?

110
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,750
I need 1,000 words about the
Metropolis Farmer's Market by tomorrow.

111
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,719
They have this amazing
fertilizer exhibit

112
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,121
and if there's one person
that knows

113
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:14,224
how to write about manure,
it's you, Kent.

114
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,725
Sure thing, Mr. White.

115
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,642
Like, is this radish organic?

116
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,344
Absolutely, grew it myself.

117
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,213
Well, how can
I be sure, dude?

118
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,780
Well, uh...

119
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,619
So good.

120
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:44,287
Organic.

121
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:45,321
Told you.

122
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,758
Dang juicer.

123
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:52,495
I can't seem
to get this down.

124
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:55,999
Oh. Thanks, stranger.

125
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,572
Gather all the food
for the master,

126
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,440
he must be appeased.

127
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:21,024
Master will be pleased.

128
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,493
I mean, I was a farmer.

129
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:26,795
So, of course I guess I should
report on the farmer's market.

130
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,731
And, by golly,
I'm gonna give Mr. White

131
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:31,768
the best article on perennial
produce he's ever seen.

132
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,569
Help! Monsters!

133
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:34,537
Someone's in trouble.

134
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:38,141
Looks like Clark Kent

135
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,044
isn't the only one with
an assignment today.

136
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,322
Huh? Grr.

137
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,489
Don't you know?

138
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,626
Stealing is never part
of a healthy diet.

139
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,069
Puny Kryptonian.

140
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,204
Well, then.

141
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,609
All right, what do you have?

142
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,179
Sister Eye!

143
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,914
No.

144
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,848
Oh, well, how about...

145
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,684
Cousin Eye?

146
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:25,421
Trouble alert.

147
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:28,291
Uh, excuse me. Did... Did...
I didn't hear what you said.

148
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:29,892
- Did you say something?
- I gotta go.

149
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,327
Uh, Mr. Wayne, I didn't...

150
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,796
I didn't even get to tell you
about Grandpa Eye.

151
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,278
- Uh-oh.
- Need a hand?

152
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,216
That'd be super.

153
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,352
Take care of these guys,
I've got a train to catch.

154
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:36,726
Oh, come on, you have
to do better than that.

155
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,362
By the authority
of the Green Lantern Corps,

156
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,097
I command you to surrender.

157
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,932
Bah! The mighty Oom

158
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,368
doesn't answer to
your puny Lantern Corps.

159
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,181
Huh?

160
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,618
Oh, no, the bridge is out.

161
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,957
Hey, look, it's Superman.

162
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,525
Save us, Superman.

163
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:12,295
Oh!

164
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:20,470
Huh?

165
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,523
Next stop, Metropolis Central.

166
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,061
Yes, Superman.

167
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,968
Just because you're evil

168
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,435
doesn't mean
your breath should be.

169
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:54,604
Go brush your teeth.

170
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,341
You're the Dummy,
right?

171
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,376
Yeesh, way to set
the bar low.

172
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,423
Ha-hah! Too slow, Dummy.

173
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,097
I got this.

174
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,033
Huh?

175
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,437
Uh, like, thanks, man.

176
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:31,541
- How did you...
- Speed of Mercury, isn't it cool?

177
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,642
Oh, hey, one sec.

178
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,911
No, wait, who are you?

179
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:40,750
Okay, yeah, that's good.

180
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,819
I'm sure this thing has
a weight limit, so...

181
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,022
I've got it.

182
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,422
Strength of Hercules.

183
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,292
I could do this all day,
but who has the time?

184
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,327
- Pardon me.
- Huh?

185
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,195
I think you misplaced these.

186
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,399
Well, that takes care of that.

187
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,268
Hi. I'm...

188
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,804
By the arm hairs of Atlas,

189
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:03,040
are you okay?

190
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,807
You know Atlas?
That's so cool.

191
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,144
I've got the stamina of Atlas,
isn't that rad?

192
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,746
I barely even felt
getting hit.

193
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,748
But I bet he will.

194
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,225
Thanks.

195
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,393
Don't mention it.

196
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:27,797
- There's only room for one bat person around here.
- Huh?

197
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,098
Don't you think?

198
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,176
The master
must be satisfied.

199
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,611
But not today.

200
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,879
Retreat!

201
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,400
We have to go after them.

202
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:09,906
Later.

203
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:12,308
Right now, we have to stop
that building from collapsing.

204
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,949
I don't know if sunbathing on
the roof was such a great idea.

205
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,017
Whoa!

206
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,417
<i>All right, everybody,</i>

207
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:22,685
<i>now shake your body.</i>

208
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,787
<i>Loosen those limbs.</i>

209
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:27,223
This is fun.

210
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,666
<i>Come on, you can do it.</i>

211
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,434
<i>It should feel like
you're climbing</i>

212
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:41,004
<i>up the side of
a mountain. Yeah!</i>

213
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:47,309
Your turn, Flash.

214
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm on it.

215
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,091
You're safe here, ma'am.

216
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:02,358
Gotta run.

217
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,963
Wow.

218
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,977
I'm here to offer
some support.

219
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,182
<i>And jump, two, three.</i>

220
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,317
<i>Two, three, four.</i>

221
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,401
- <i>And one.</i>
- Wow, what a workout.

222
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,872
What in
the blue blazes?

223
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,340
I think you can let go now.

224
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,709
Oh. Uh, heh, right.

225
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:56,746
Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe it,

226
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,415
Flash, you just ran up
those bricks like "zoom."

227
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,383
And Wonder Woman
with the lasso,

228
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,186
you were all...

229
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,287
And Superman,
with the heat vision,

230
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,858
you secured the base
with a "pssh."

231
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,358
Batman swung in

232
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,627
and caught that guy
while Green Lantern

233
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,930
was putting the wall
back together.

234
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,033
You guys are incredible!

235
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,936
It is such an amazing
pleasure to meet you.

236
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,372
You have been my hero
since I was just a kid.

237
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,608
Oop, sorry.

238
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,276
Since you were a kid?

239
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,677
By my observations,

240
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,914
you're approximately
the same age as Superman.

241
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:34,283
Same age? Oh, no, uh...
I just meant that

242
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,920
watching you makes me
feel like a kid.

243
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,320
Hmm.

244
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,456
Anyway, what a thrill
to meet you guys,

245
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,858
I hope I didn't get in the way.

246
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:44,727
Not at all.
In fact, we're grateful.

247
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:46,096
Mister...

248
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,998
Oh, uh, sorry.

249
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,331
I'm Shazam.

250
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,766
Uh... Shaz-what now?

251
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,667
Well, Shaz-bot.

252
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,602
- Shazam.
- Excuse me.

253
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,573
Shazam, it was pretty courageous
of you to leap into danger like that.

254
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,442
I know, that's one
of my powers too.

255
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,978
Courage of Achilles.

256
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,346
I used it just the other day
to eat some anchovies.

257
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,051
How can we be sure
you're one of the good guys?

258
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:09,318
Totally understandable.

259
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,719
But even if I wasn't,

260
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,721
a great philosopher
once said,

261
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,524
"Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer."

262
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:18,360
So, really what
do you have to lose?

263
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:20,396
Yep, I know quotes.

264
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:21,998
Wisdom of Solomon.

265
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,833
Sweet, am I right?

266
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,802
Why does he keep mentioning
Solomon, Atlas and the others?

267
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,939
- Well, I...
- His powers obviously derive

268
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,407
from each of the ancient heroes
he's described,

269
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,442
that makes up
the name "Shazam."

270
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,844
S for the wisdom of Solomon.

271
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,579
H for the strength of Hercules.

272
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:38,347
A for the stamina of Atlas.

273
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,783
Another A for
the courage of Achilles.

274
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:43,686
And M for
the speed of Mercury.

275
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,223
That means that
Z must stand for...

276
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,591
The power of Zeus.

277
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,061
Still haven't figure out
what that is myself.

278
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:52,561
Well, whoever you are,

279
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,164
we really appreciate
your help.

280
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:57,466
My pleasure. I mean,
helping the Justice League,

281
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,567
so awesome!

282
00:16:58,634 --> 00:16:59,802
You should tag along.

283
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,637
Come to the Hall of Justice,

284
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:02,838
see where the magic happens.

285
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:05,041
- I don't think...
- Seriously?

286
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,508
The Hall of Justice?

287
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:09,045
Like, <i>the</i> Hall of Justice?

288
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,881
Oh, man, I... I...

289
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,020
Be cool.

290
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:18,088
This is the greatest thing

291
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,155
that's ever happened to you

292
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,789
but just... be cool.

293
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,525
I mean, I guess so.

294
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,394
I don't have
anything going on,

295
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,830
so, uh, yeah, whatever.

296
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,902
It's not our fault.

297
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,203
Jeepers is right.

298
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,371
We would've had your food

299
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,571
but the Justice League
showed up

300
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,207
and ruined everything.

301
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:38,474
Enough!

302
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,609
I'm tired of excuses.

303
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,611
What I need is food.

304
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:44,513
And if you can't get it,

305
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,083
then I, Mr. Mind,

306
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,019
will find others who can.

307
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,158
<i>Yes.</i>

308
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:58,228
<i>So powerful, so hungry.</i>

309
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:00,496
<i>So hungry.</i>

310
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:04,466
Yes, food,
I need more food.

311
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:11,174
Excuse me. Sivana,
how goes our small experiment?

312
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,080
It's done.

313
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:19,815
This magically infused chemical
should do what you wanted.

314
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:23,585
Now, can you stop
mind-controlling me and let me go?

315
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,388
Hmm, nope.

316
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,523
Now jump like a kangaroo.

317
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:31,294
Mind control is the best.

318
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:35,999
<i>Eat. Eat. Hunger.</i>

319
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,335
Food.
Bring me more food.

320
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:41,737
I must have more before
the Justice League arrives.

321
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,406
The Justice League?

322
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,641
Here? But how?

323
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,244
Call it intuition.

324
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:57,786
And over here, we have
our trouble alert system.

325
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,788
If there's a problem
anywhere in the world,

326
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:01,291
we'll know about it.

327
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:04,827
This is incredible!

328
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,898
I...
I think I might cry.

329
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,601
Hall of Justice branded tissue?

330
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,904
Can I keep this?

331
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,906
Highly unsanitary.

332
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,142
Totally going
in my scrapbook.

333
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:22,479
You guys, I really can't
thank you enough for the tour.

334
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,914
You all mean so much to me.

335
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:28,717
The Justice League has always
been a beacon of hope.

336
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:31,087
In the darkest of times,
I've always said,

337
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,089
"What would
the Justice League do?"

338
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:34,224
I mean...

339
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,691
It depends on your roster,

340
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,826
that Plastic Man
is kind of different,

341
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:39,528
but, uh, that doesn't matter.

342
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,098
You guys have
helped me a lot.

343
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,968
I might need one
of those hankies, Batman.

344
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:48,238
Well, I better get going.

345
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:51,774
I hope we do some superhero-ing
stuff together soon.

346
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:53,575
No, wait.

347
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,247
I call
a Justice League meeting.

348
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:58,982
Is a meeting necessary?

349
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,816
We should be out
finding these monsters.

350
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:01,784
I have their location

351
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:02,818
via the Bat-Tracer, and...

352
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:04,487
You know the rules, Batman.

353
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:06,089
If one of us
calls a meeting...

354
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:08,992
Then we all must attend.

355
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,227
Should I go or...

356
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,996
No, stay right there.

357
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:15,031
Krypto will keep you company.

358
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:20,636
It's an ultrasonic whistle.

359
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,638
One sec.

360
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:25,108
A super-dog.

361
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:27,810
Ah, hi, Krypto.
Aren't you cute?

362
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:30,013
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

363
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,780
I think we should let him join.

364
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:34,284
The League?
But we just met him.

365
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,188
Not everyone is as reluctant to
join the League as you were, Batman.

366
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:39,889
I like him.
And not just because

367
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,558
he has a lightning bolt
on his chest,

368
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:42,992
though that doesn't hurt.

369
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,294
I'm with Flash,

370
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,496
there's something
so innocent about him.

371
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:47,629
You can't catch me.

372
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,033
You can't catch me.

373
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:53,236
Or juvenile.

374
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:54,437
I saw we take a vote.

375
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,738
All in favor,
raise your hand.

376
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,277
Shazam,
we have an offer for you.

377
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,711
An offer?

378
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,914
We'd like to invite you
to become a member of...

379
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:06,416
the Justice League.

380
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,518
What? Is this for real?

381
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:11,187
I... I... This isn't some
hidden camera show, is it?

382
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:13,189
There are 24 cameras
in this room,

383
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:16,226
none of which you could find
even with Superman's abilities.

384
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,294
No, this isn't a prank.

385
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,431
The reality is you fit all of
our Justice League criteria.

386
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,366
- You have superpowers.
- Check.

387
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:24,633
- Fight for good.
- Double check.

388
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,236
And not a kid.

389
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:28,737
Check-aroni.

390
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:31,707
So, Shazam, what do you say?

391
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:34,944
I... will be
the best Leaguer ever!

392
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:37,846
I promise, seriously,
you'll never regret this.

393
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:39,349
Shazam, the Justice League

394
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:42,352
is more than a
well-tuned crime fighting unit.

395
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,454
It's a family.

396
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:47,023
A... family?

397
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,492
And families
are built on trust.

398
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,027
Shazam, we think that

399
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:53,429
you could be a great
addition to the team.

400
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,797
But in order for us
to fully trust you,

401
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:58,401
we need to know
who you really are.

402
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:00,370
Not the superhero.

403
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:02,372
But, you.

404
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:05,208
My, uh... Oh, no.

405
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:07,510
Don't worry,
we'll go first.

406
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,078
Well, except for Batman,

407
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:12,248
he kind of gets an exception
because he's so grumpy.

408
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:13,749
I'm not grumpy.

409
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,257
Yeah,
I don't know you.

410
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:23,825
No idea.

411
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,429
I mean, that's not
even really a disguise.

412
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:27,696
Well, sure it is.

413
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,400
The star draws your view
from my face.

414
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,401
Not really.

415
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,172
Clark Kent?

416
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:39,175
Oh, wow! You did
that amazing exposé

417
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:40,809
on building
without instructions.

418
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:42,811
That was fantastic.

419
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:44,080
Oh, thanks,

420
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:45,781
I worked really hard
on that piece.

421
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,051
- Ahem.
- Oh, right.

422
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,787
So, are you ready
to be part of the family?

423
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:53,856
I...

424
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:55,358
I...

425
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:58,194
I can't.

426
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,932
I'm sorry, I... I really am.

427
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,234
I have to go.

428
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,503
Just as I surmised,

429
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,305
Shazam has something to hide,

430
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:10,373
and this proves

431
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,840
he is not to be trusted.

432
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:13,209
But you hide everything.

433
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:14,611
- Bat exemption.
- No, but I...

434
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:16,412
Bat exemption.

435
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,447
Now, come on.

436
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:19,315
We have monsters to catch.

437
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,587
Huh? Oh!

438
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,556
Hmm. Mm.

439
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,927
I can't believe I didn't just
join the Justice League.

440
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:34,964
But if they knew that
I was just a kid...

441
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:38,401
- Whoa, is that guy flying? Oh, man!
- Nice cape.

442
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:41,437
I've never seen a superhero.
Wow.

443
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,513
Look, Mommy,
Superman got a new costume.

444
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,181
Bye, Red Superman.

445
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:27,650
Stay still.

446
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,552
How did you even get in here,

447
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,921
you pesky beast?

448
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:33,990
Oh, hello, Billy.

449
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,824
How was your day?

450
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,827
Oh, you know.

451
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,097
It doesn't take a wizard

452
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,132
to know something's
bothering you.

453
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:46,202
But I'm a wizard,
so maybe it does.

454
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,806
Billy, you can tell me
anything.

455
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:52,375
I had
this great day, you know?

456
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:56,145
Fighting bad guys,
meeting my heroes, but then...

457
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:59,415
But then the Justice League
wanted me to join their team.

458
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:01,484
That sounds wonderful.

459
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,654
It was, except,

460
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:05,888
in order to join,

461
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,623
they said
they needed to trust me.

462
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,327
Which means I would have
to reveal my secret identity.

463
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,396
And you were afraid
they would reject you

464
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:15,798
when they found out
you weren't an adult?

465
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:17,166
Exactly.

466
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:19,335
I know that, in your heart,

467
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:22,438
all you've ever wanted
was a family, Billy.

468
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:24,273
Somewhere to belong.

469
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,909
I've tried to give you
that place,

470
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:28,945
but my time is running out.

471
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:31,681
Soon, you'll need
to find your own way.

472
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:34,784
And you'll discover
that being in a family

473
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:37,453
doesn't come without
its own risks.

474
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,521
Risks?

475
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:39,722
Like what?

476
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,157
Trust, my son,

477
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:44,260
trust to share a part
of yourself with others.

478
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:47,296
And hope that those you
share it with will accept it.

479
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:48,866
You're talking about
you sharing

480
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:50,633
the power of Zeus
with me, right?

481
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,603
The first guy you chose
to be the Wizard's champion?

482
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:56,939
Well, I wouldn't say first.

483
00:25:57,006 --> 00:25:58,608
There was another.

484
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:02,512
<i>His name was Teth Adam.</i>

485
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:05,681
<i>Shazam!</i>

486
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:08,451
<i>But he would become
Mighty Adam.</i>

487
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:11,988
<i>He started out as
the hero I hoped he would be.</i>

488
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:17,326
But I was blind not
to see his growing ambition.

489
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:21,330
Soon, he was corrupted by
his power and turned to evil.

490
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:24,000
<i>He tried to enslave the world,</i>

491
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,469
<i>but after a long
and trying battle,</i>

492
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:27,804
<i>I defeated him.</i>

493
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:30,373
<i>No!</i>

494
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,644
And thus, he became
Black Adam.

495
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:36,914
What did you do?

496
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,081
I locked him away

497
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:42,318
where he can never harm
anyone again.

498
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:48,057
The point is, Billy,
that even I,

499
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:51,394
the wise and powerful Wizard,
risked something

500
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:55,064
and continue to risk
by giving that power to you.

501
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,767
My true champion.

502
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,101
Aw, shucks.

503
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:01,337
What is it?

504
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:08,211
The League?

505
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:11,047
I sense a trap. Go.

506
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,648
And remember, Billy,

507
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:16,887
nothing creates trust
like helping those in need.

508
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:18,488
Wisdom of Solomon?

509
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,456
No, common sense.

510
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:21,557
Now go.

511
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,664
There you are.

512
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:32,568
Now just hold still.

513
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,572
I hate moths.

514
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:45,181
Fan out.

515
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,795
No sign of anything
out of the ordinary.

516
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:04,834
Strange. The Bat Radar
indicates the tracer should be right...

517
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:06,402
where that box is.

518
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:08,872
- Oh, I got it.
- No, it's a trap.

519
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:13,809
Right as always, Batman.

520
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:23,052
The Monster Society
welcomes you.

521
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,489
Is that a talking worm? I mean,
come on, we fight worms now?

522
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:28,959
I'm no mere worm, Flash.

523
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:31,460
I'm the powerful Mr. Mind,

524
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:34,330
the greatest villain
in the galaxy.

525
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:37,034
Wanted in over three quadrants
of the universe

526
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,101
for my evil evilness.

527
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:44,073
And now I can add defeating the
Justice League to my accomplishments.

528
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,309
Sivana, if you please?

529
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,913
Huh?

530
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,019
Though my powers of
mental persuasion are strong,

531
00:28:56,085 --> 00:29:00,924
I know they could never tame the
superheroic minds of the Justice League.

532
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,627
Well, maybe the Flash.

533
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:07,730
Thanks... a lot.

534
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:11,001
You'll never...
get away with this.

535
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,368
I already have.

536
00:29:12,435 --> 00:29:15,438
The adult mind
is hard to manipulate,

537
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,140
but the mind of a child...

538
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:20,476
Sivana, fans.

539
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:28,351
- Huh?
- What?

540
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:33,356
- It worked!
- Of course it worked.

541
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:35,758
Dr. Sivana is no slouch.

542
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:37,426
I'm a kid?

543
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:40,529
Well, I'll be
butter-churned in July.

544
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,465
But I don't wanna be a kid.

545
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,467
What are you talking about?
I don't feel any different.

546
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,436
Turn us back, Sivana,
this instant.

547
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:51,041
Sivana can do
nothing and neither can you.

548
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,953
Ah, so easy.

549
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,122
I have all of you now.

550
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:07,590
Wait! I don't see Batman.

551
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:08,591
He's gone!

552
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:10,826
Go, my monsters.

553
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:14,463
Find the Batman
and bring him to me.

554
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,566
And now, Junior Justice League,

555
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,202
are you ready to do my bidding?

556
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:25,741
Well, as Pa used to say,
"Does a cow moo when you pull its udder?"

557
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:28,811
What?

558
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,981
I'll assume
that's a yes,

559
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:37,386
so welcome to
the Monster Society of Evil!

560
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:59,176
There.

561
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,510
There is the false Bat.

562
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:03,947
Get him for the master.

563
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,093
Uh-oh.

564
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,933
Ha-ha!

565
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,671
Got you.

566
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:32,541
Come out, Batsy.
There is no place to go.

567
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,045
Huh?

568
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:37,379
Ha! Got you, got you.

569
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:39,315
Now you're stuck in Bat Glue.

570
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:51,393
No place to go, Batman?

571
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,663
Or should I say "Batboy"?

572
00:32:07,944 --> 00:32:09,478
Are you okay, kid?

573
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:11,214
I saw those bad guys and
thought you might need some help.

574
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,616
- I...
- I mean, I appreciate the amount of work

575
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,284
you put into your cosplay,

576
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,586
but superhero-ing
is kind of dangerous.

577
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:19,722
- I...
- How about I drop you off to your mom?

578
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:23,759
Maybe she'll take you out for a milkshake
or something. Those always cheer me up.

579
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,999
I am Batman.

580
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:31,567
Sheesh.

581
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,569
Mr. Mind transformed us
into children

582
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:36,438
in order to control our young
impressionable minds.

583
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:40,609
But because I'm awesome, I was able to
get away before his powers affected me.

584
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:43,412
- Wow, you really are Batman.
- Duh.

585
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,581
I guess that's a no
on super-hearing.

586
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:47,583
Okay, okay. Digesting.

587
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,718
Well, listen, Batman,

588
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:52,321
how about you stay here
while I take care of...

589
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,390
No. Mr. Mind controls
the monsters

590
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,625
and the preadolescent
Justice League.

591
00:32:56,692 --> 00:32:58,828
There's a chance
he can get you, too.

592
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:01,497
I don't want you jumping in
there and causing more trouble.

593
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,399
- But I can help.
- Yeah.

594
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,202
I don't work with people
I can't trust.

595
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:08,004
And after your quick exit
at the Hall of Justice,

596
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:10,506
I can't trust you.

597
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,342
- What are you gonna do, then?
- It doesn't matter what I'm going to do.

598
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,777
I'm Batman...

599
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:17,346
...and everything I do
is incredible.

600
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:22,919
The Batmobile.

601
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:24,855
My diary is never
gonna believe this.

602
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:28,024
Well, okay.
Good luck, Batman.

603
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,593
I know there's no obstacle you can't overcome.

604
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,329
- I have complete faith in you.
- Come on.

605
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:33,395
You're a real hero.

606
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:34,396
Change of plan.

607
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:35,999
Do you really wanna help?

608
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,733
Uh-huh.

609
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,737
In my youthful state,
I'm unable to reach the pedals.

610
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:44,975
- So, you'll need to drive.
- Drive?

611
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,543
You can drive a stick,
can't you?

612
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:51,114
Okay, no...

613
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:53,816
Stop. Wait, no. Not that way.

614
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:55,784
I thought you said you'd done this.

615
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:58,889
Of course I have.
I'm an adult.

616
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,157
Just a little rusty. Oh!

617
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:04,027
Rusty? And why are you in third gear?

618
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:08,064
Okay, let's just
stay off the freeway.

619
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:13,602
Hello! Welcome!

620
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:15,638
Have a great day.

621
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,841
Well, what do we have here?

622
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:23,113
It's not even Halloween
but, my, you look wonderful.

623
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,315
What brings you in today?

624
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:29,718
The master needs food
like a pig needs a pile of mud.

625
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:33,522
Ooh, isn't that nice?

626
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:41,097
Brick O's! My favorite!

627
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,935
Looks like I have the last one.

628
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,970
- I'll take that. Thanks.
- Huh?

629
00:34:54,978 --> 00:34:57,280
- It looks like it's ripe...
- Huh?

630
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,614
...for the picking.

631
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:08,158
Look what I found. Guess who's
going to be master's favorite now?

632
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:12,262
As my ma used to say,
"You can't win a pig kissing contest

633
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:13,796
without getting
a little dirty."

634
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:15,731
That doesn't
even make sense.

635
00:35:15,798 --> 00:35:17,200
- Does, too.
- Does not.

636
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:19,668
- Does, too.
- Does not, infinity plus one!

637
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:23,472
Ow!

638
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,875
I'm telling the master.

639
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:33,016
Have a nice day.

640
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:41,124
Mmm.

641
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:43,226
Ugh. Gross.

642
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:46,762
Oh, good. Mmm, you're back.
Just place the food anywhere.

643
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:49,698
Mmm, I'll get to it eventually.

644
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:54,437
I know it's me saying this but
shouldn't you, I don't know, slow down?

645
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:57,840
<i>Eat more faster.</i>

646
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,742
Slow down? No.

647
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:02,611
If anything, I need to...
speed up.

648
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,514
Mmm.

649
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:09,252
Peas? What are peas
doing here?

650
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,619
What's the rule?

651
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:12,889
No peas, please.

652
00:36:12,956 --> 00:36:15,657
Exactly.
Anything else is fine.

653
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:18,261
Broccoli, arugula, whatever,
just no peas.

654
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,397
Sheesh. Now go!

655
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:23,400
Give me more.
I must have more!

656
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:26,202
Oh!

657
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:42,618
Whoa. Wow!

658
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:45,121
This place is amazing!

659
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:48,557
I thought the Rock of Eternity
was cool, but this place...

660
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,127
Rock of Eternity?

661
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:53,695
Nexus of magic
in another dimension.

662
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:55,564
Uh, it's a long story.

663
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,400
What are you doing?

664
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,969
My Bat Computer is the most
sophisticated computer on the planet.

665
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:02,704
High-def with over
a billion mega-brixels,

666
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:03,739
state of the art.

667
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:05,475
It also streams Brickflix.

668
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:10,646
And it has the ability to find
anyone at anytime in the world.

669
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:12,982
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Way cool.

670
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:14,050
There.

671
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:25,794
They're stealing food from
everywhere. We have to stop them!

672
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:27,564
I have to stop them.

673
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:30,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't trust me. But,
I mean, come on.

674
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,769
I helped you with the monsters,
the Batmobile... sort of.

675
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:37,440
I know it's hard to believe,
but I don't trust people very easily.

676
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:40,809
No, that's not hard to believe
at all. You live in a cave.

677
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:42,678
In our line of work,
we have to be careful.

678
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:44,780
I mean, what if
you were a bad guy?

679
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,183
I've already revealed
too much to you.

680
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,718
You're lucky I don't
take you out right now.

681
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:51,888
I could, you know?
'Cause I'm Batman.

682
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:54,723
And Batman is totally
the best hero.

683
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,993
O... kay?

684
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,828
Point is, it pays
to keep people at a distance.

685
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:01,730
- So you...
- Never get hurt.

686
00:38:01,797 --> 00:38:05,368
Hemingway once said,

687
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:08,737
"The best way to find out
if you can trust someone

688
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:10,240
is to trust them."

689
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:12,808
Fine. Shazam!

690
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:23,719
- Billy Batson.
- Hey.

691
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:26,556
I don't understand.
How did you...

692
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:30,160
It all started when I helped you
during that Two-Face situation.

693
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:39,068
Oh, no. Which one?
Which one?

694
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:42,438
<i>The red wire, Billy.</i>

695
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:44,407
<i>I don't know who
the voice belonged to.</i>

696
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:46,409
<i>I just knew it saved our lives.</i>

697
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:49,946
<i>After that, I went about
my usual routine.</i>

698
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:54,017
Well, Billy, that's the last of the
money you got from recycling.

699
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,818
Hope this sandwich is worth it
'cause I'm starving.

700
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,290
Spare some food.

701
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:09,265
Have a great day.

702
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:15,572
You're a nice boy,
Billy Batson.

703
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:17,307
Hey, how do you know my name?

704
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:24,080
<i>That wasn't the only weird thing that
happened to me over the next couple of days.</i>

705
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:26,449
Excuse me, ma'am,
let me give you a hand.

706
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:31,154
You're
a nice boy, Billy Batson.

707
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:37,493
<i>I just kept running
into the strangest people.</i>

708
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:42,599
Hey, mister, you dropped this.

709
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:45,535
- Huh?
- You're a nice boy.

710
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:47,070
Here. For your trouble.

711
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:50,340
Free subway token?
Thanks, mister.

712
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,878
<i>Little did I know
that small token</i>

713
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,681
<i>would lead me
on an incredible journey.</i>

714
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:04,354
<i>Billy Batson, you have
been found... worthy.</i>

715
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,356
That voice.

716
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:18,268
<i>Climb aboard for
the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

717
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:29,178
What is this place?

718
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:35,418
"The seven deadly enemies
of man."

719
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:38,054
Whoa, what a scary bunch.

720
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:40,423
Billy Batson!

721
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,826
I've been expecting you.

722
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:47,196
You? That old man
I gave the food to.

723
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:49,098
That woman I helped
to cross the street.

724
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:50,867
And that guy I returned
his money to.

725
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,935
- They were all you.
- Yes.

726
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:55,804
I did that to test you, Billy.

727
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:57,806
Test me? Test me for what?

728
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:01,010
To see if you're worthy
of great power.

729
00:41:01,077 --> 00:41:02,844
And you are, Billy.

730
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:05,814
Never have I seen
a heart so pure.

731
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:08,284
The world is a dangerous place.

732
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:11,820
It needs heroes.
Heroes like you.

733
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:14,691
All you need to do
is say my name.

734
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:15,925
Your name?

735
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:17,493
Shazam!

736
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:20,063
Sha... zam?

737
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:23,466
No, no, no.
You can't just say it timidly.

738
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:27,036
Otherwise, how would you
ever introduce yourself to people?

739
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:29,906
That'd be ridiculous.

740
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:33,242
Say it with meaning,
with purpose.

741
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:35,111
Shazam!

742
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:41,317
<i>After getting the power
of Shazam, I went to work,</i>

743
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:43,686
<i>helping the city
as best I could.</i>

744
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:45,154
<i>It was awesome.</i>

745
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:47,357
<i>Not just because I had
these incredible powers</i>

746
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,292
<i>but, you know,</i>

747
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,060
<i>because I was a grownup.</i>

748
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:53,996
Sorry, kid.
Maybe next time.

749
00:41:54,497 --> 00:41:55,164
Next.

750
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,535
- Whoa!
- One, please.

751
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:06,542
<i>But even with
all that power,</i>

752
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:09,679
<i>it didn't really matter.</i>

753
00:42:09,746 --> 00:42:10,980
<i>I just wanted to belong.</i>

754
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:13,883
<i>To not be alone.</i>

755
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:18,654
You wouldn't understand.
You're the Batman.

756
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:20,356
You've got friends, a family.

757
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,658
But being a kid,

758
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:24,460
an orphan,

759
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:25,863
it's the worst.

760
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:28,398
I totally understand if you
don't want to work with me,

761
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:29,932
now that you know.

762
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:43,646
Uh... I'm sorry.

763
00:42:43,713 --> 00:42:46,884
I know this is supposed to be,
like, an important moment,

764
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:48,684
but I don't really
recognize you.

765
00:42:50,686 --> 00:42:51,988
Maybe in your adult form?

766
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:55,057
I'm Bruce Wayne.

767
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:57,827
Bruce Wayne?

768
00:42:57,895 --> 00:43:00,163
Like, <i>the</i> Bruce Wayne?

769
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:01,899
Billionaire Bruce Wayne?

770
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:04,534
The Bruce Wayne with all those
super expensive sports cars?

771
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,304
The Bruce Wayne with the private
jet that has its own arcade in it?

772
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:11,007
Holy moly! What's that like?

773
00:43:11,073 --> 00:43:13,342
It's okay. I mean,
I only have, like,

774
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:15,711
500 games onboard.
No big whoop.

775
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:17,580
Awesome!

776
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:19,348
Listen, Billy,

777
00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:22,853
when I was a kid about your age,
I lost my parents, too.

778
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,922
So I know what it is
to be alone.

779
00:43:24,987 --> 00:43:28,291
I took that fear and loneliness and
decided to do something good with it.

780
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:29,927
Just like you're doing.

781
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:33,229
Be proud of who you are, Billy.
Kids can be heroes too.

782
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:36,032
My three former Robins
are a testament to that.

783
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:38,768
What you did? That's brave.

784
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:40,570
Showing me really who you are?

785
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:43,306
That's trust.

786
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:47,577
I don't know what the others would say,
but you're all right with me.

787
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:49,412
Now, back to business.

788
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:52,815
We have to figure out why the
Justice League is gathering all that food,

789
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,953
and how to stop that telepathic tyrant,
Mr. Mind.

790
00:43:56,018 --> 00:43:58,889
Speaking of food, I'm starving.

791
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:00,089
Ooh, me too.

792
00:44:00,156 --> 00:44:01,624
Hey, wanna see something cool?

793
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:04,093
Alfred, can I get two glasses
of milk and cookies?

794
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,661
And not the oatmeal kind.

795
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:08,698
Maybe... Ooh, something
with chocolate chips in it?

796
00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:10,600
As you wish, Master Damian.

797
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:13,135
Uh, Damian? I'm...
Oh, oh, yes.

798
00:44:13,202 --> 00:44:15,371
- Faster, old man.
- Old man...

799
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:17,840
- You have your own butler?
- Not bad, right?

800
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,609
He'll make me whatever I want.

801
00:44:19,675 --> 00:44:22,612
Unless I make him mad,
which happens more than...

802
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:24,547
Wait a minute. That's it!

803
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:29,652
Mr. Mind said that
in order to control us,

804
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:32,522
he had to make sure our minds
were young and impressionable.

805
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:34,457
But that also means
he has limits.

806
00:44:34,524 --> 00:44:36,626
And if I'm right,
which I always am,

807
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:38,728
the more active the brains
of our friends are,

808
00:44:38,794 --> 00:44:41,230
the more difficult they are
to control.

809
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:43,432
So we have to make them
angry or stressed.

810
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:46,068
- And that will break his hold on them.
- Exactly.

811
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:50,974
Once the hold is broken, we toss one of
these disrupters onto them, and presto!

812
00:44:51,073 --> 00:44:53,376
No more mind control.

813
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:55,344
- Got it.
- And, Shazam?

814
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,214
Good luck.

815
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:07,958
The most powerful ring
in the galaxy,

816
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:12,662
and here I am trolling
the ocean for stinky fish?

817
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:13,596
Ugh.

818
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:16,867
Say,
that ring is pretty cool.

819
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:21,170
Oh, hey. Yeah. It can
make anything I can think of.

820
00:45:21,237 --> 00:45:22,638
- Really?
- Really.

821
00:45:22,705 --> 00:45:25,541
Even... I don't know,
a boat?

822
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:26,776
Please.

823
00:45:28,344 --> 00:45:30,246
Wow. What about a whale?

824
00:45:30,313 --> 00:45:31,647
Like I told you,

825
00:45:32,181 --> 00:45:33,849
anything.

826
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:35,117
Not bad.

827
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:37,753
So you can make anything?
A jet?

828
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,323
Two jets?

829
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:44,861
What about a dog piloting
a jet while drinking a shake

830
00:45:44,928 --> 00:45:48,297
and wearing sunglasses
while wearing a large hat?

831
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:49,799
And barking out the ABCs.

832
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:51,567
Yeah. All right.

833
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:53,836
Oh, also a knight
in shining armor

834
00:45:53,904 --> 00:45:57,139
with a sword, riding a bicycle,
handcuffed to a T-Rex,

835
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:58,541
- standing behind a pony...
- Slow down.

836
00:45:58,608 --> 00:46:00,242
...on top
of an armored car.

837
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,045
Oh, and can you get
a sports car in there, too?

838
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:06,382
Anything... else?

839
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:08,517
Just this.

840
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,323
One down.

841
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,335
Mmm, prime rib.

842
00:46:26,402 --> 00:46:28,204
Mr. Mind is totes
gonna love this.

843
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:32,708
Ah, Wonder Woman, I see you're
still flying that invisible clunker.

844
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:35,378
Clunker? Why, you...

845
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:37,380
My mom gave me this jet!

846
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:40,149
It can run circles
around your rodent mobile!

847
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:43,020
No. No, it can't.

848
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,022
- Can, too.
- Cannot.

849
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:46,890
- Can, too.
- Cannot.

850
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:49,158
- Can, too!
- Prove it, then.

851
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,128
First one to the end
of the canyon wins.

852
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:52,361
You're on!

853
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,828
Looks like there's room
for only one of us, hotshot.

854
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:30,700
Ha! That did it.

855
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:32,835
Huh?

856
00:47:36,305 --> 00:47:37,874
No way!

857
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:41,777
I totally would have won if I'd
had a more aerodynamic cow.

858
00:47:41,844 --> 00:47:43,612
You never did like to lose.

859
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,149
Argh! Just wait
till I get my hands on you.

860
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:49,953
Now, now, Wonder Woman,
no one likes a sore loser.

861
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:54,724
Two down.

862
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:05,835
Whoo-hoo!
Pardon me.

863
00:48:05,902 --> 00:48:07,403
Flash coming through.

864
00:48:13,076 --> 00:48:16,079
Wow. That's quite
a pile of food you have there.

865
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,748
- Yeah, so?
- Well, I mean, uh,

866
00:48:18,814 --> 00:48:21,450
how are you gonna get it
all to your master?

867
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:23,686
I'll just run it over
to him, duh.

868
00:48:23,753 --> 00:48:26,022
Oh, just, uh,
one by one, then?

869
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:27,224
Mm-hm.

870
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:28,557
Huh.

871
00:48:28,624 --> 00:48:30,559
I just thought
because you're so fast,

872
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:34,497
you could do something a bit,
I don't know, flashier?

873
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:37,700
- Hey, I can be flashy.
- Oh, I'm sure you can.

874
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:41,403
Superman said he could do it faster, but,
I mean, you know, what does he know, right?

875
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:42,873
Superman said that?

876
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:46,176
Ooh. After all the times
I beat him in a race...

877
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:47,777
Whatevs. I'll show him.

878
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:50,813
- You better step back.
- Oh. Sure.

879
00:48:55,751 --> 00:48:59,122
Ha-ha! See? Nothing to it.

880
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:00,257
Hmm.

881
00:49:00,322 --> 00:49:02,391
Is that the best you can do?

882
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:03,860
No.

883
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:05,694
Watch this.

884
00:49:17,573 --> 00:49:19,675
Where am I?

885
00:49:30,786 --> 00:49:32,521
Mmm, nice.

886
00:49:35,424 --> 00:49:38,195
Master's gonna love
this Kent Farm's corn.

887
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:40,529
Superman, save me.

888
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:43,599
Oh, hi, Clark.

889
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:46,535
Well, I'll be a tadpole
on a lily pad.

890
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:48,171
What are you doing here?

891
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:49,605
I've come to help you.

892
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:52,108
Help me? I'm Superman.

893
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:54,410
You're the one
that's gonna need help.

894
00:50:01,717 --> 00:50:03,586
Somebody needs a nap.

895
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:11,827
You know
I have X-ray vision, right?

896
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:18,534
Who's the hide-and-seek
champ now?

897
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:21,071
More like chump.

898
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,609
A Boy Scout like you
is no real threat

899
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:29,478
to an awesome superhero
like Batman.

900
00:50:30,746 --> 00:50:33,083
I hear a lot
of gums flappin'...

901
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:37,153
but not a lot of wind.

902
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,589
You may have muscles, Clarky,

903
00:50:40,656 --> 00:50:43,659
but when it comes to
strategy or planning, you...

904
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:48,564
You're just lucky
I'm pulling my punches.

905
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:51,734
Ooh,
I'm shaking in my Bat Boots.

906
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,070
You're not even wearing
any boots.

907
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:01,644
Ah!

908
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,980
You got any more insults
now, dingbat?

909
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:05,315
Just one.

910
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:07,884
I liked you better when
you wore your underwear...

911
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:09,618
on the outside.

912
00:51:09,685 --> 00:51:12,122
Huh?

913
00:51:17,793 --> 00:51:18,594
Oh, boy.

914
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,134
I'm glad to see everyone
back to normal.

915
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:27,037
Well, relatively.

916
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:30,539
Can we, like,
get this over with

917
00:51:30,606 --> 00:51:32,608
so I go back to being an adult?

918
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:34,277
Being a kid is the worst.

919
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:37,646
Huh. I haven't really noticed
a difference at all.

920
00:51:37,713 --> 00:51:40,283
That's because you've always
been a kid.

921
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,519
But I'm dying. The mood swings,
the hunger pains.

922
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:45,587
How can you even
trust kids at all?

923
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:47,723
All these hormones,
no life experience.

924
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,825
I feel like I'm going to cry
at any given moment.

925
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:52,362
Hey, being a kid
isn't that bad.

926
00:51:52,429 --> 00:51:54,630
Kids, back to business.

927
00:51:54,697 --> 00:51:56,632
What we know,

928
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:00,536
Mr. Mind has been hoarding a massive
amount of food here at this warehouse.

929
00:52:00,602 --> 00:52:04,740
The League will take myself and Shazam as
pretend prisoners in order to get into the base.

930
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:07,743
Once we are in his inner sanctum,
we'll use these mental dampeners

931
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,446
to protect us from
Mr. Mind's control,

932
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:13,450
and stop this Monster
Society of Evil once and for all.

933
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,158
That door does open, you know.

934
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:23,460
No food?

935
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:25,627
Why did you come back
empty-handed?

936
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:28,697
We brought something better
than food, Jeepers.

937
00:52:28,764 --> 00:52:31,167
We brought prisoners.

938
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:36,605
That's right. Batman is here.

939
00:52:36,672 --> 00:52:39,775
You better take me
to Mr. Mind right now.

940
00:52:39,842 --> 00:52:42,711
Please.
We don't take orders from you.

941
00:52:42,778 --> 00:52:44,414
No one can see the master
right now.

942
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:47,516
Children, leave the prisoners
and continue gathering food.

943
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:51,321
Uh, Batman, what's plan B?

944
00:52:51,388 --> 00:52:53,589
Well, what are you waiting for?

945
00:52:54,057 --> 00:52:55,624
Batman?

946
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:58,594
Uh, sorry. At this age,
I wasn't all that good at thinking ahead.

947
00:52:59,996 --> 00:53:01,730
Creatures, get them!

948
00:53:01,797 --> 00:53:03,732
Jig's up. Attack, now!

949
00:53:06,568 --> 00:53:08,104
Excuse me.

950
00:53:10,572 --> 00:53:11,941
For a doll,

951
00:53:12,008 --> 00:53:13,675
why'd you have to be
such a...

952
00:53:13,742 --> 00:53:15,945
you know, Dummy?

953
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:21,951
Let go, imposter!

954
00:53:22,018 --> 00:53:25,288
Imposter?
I called this name first.

955
00:53:35,865 --> 00:53:38,535
Kryptonian, I've defeated
your kind before.

956
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,569
You're no match for Oom.

957
00:53:48,912 --> 00:53:51,381
This would be beneath
adult Superman.

958
00:53:51,448 --> 00:53:53,682
Me? Not so much.

959
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,755
Come on, it's not funny.

960
00:53:59,822 --> 00:54:02,525
I didn't want to leave
the swamp, you know?

961
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:04,894
But he didn't care.

962
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:07,030
No one understands me.

963
00:54:13,702 --> 00:54:15,071
It's over, Sivana.

964
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,942
I hope so.

965
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:21,978
I'm tired of being
mind-controlled. We all are.

966
00:54:22,045 --> 00:54:25,814
All I want to do is go home and work
on my own plans for world domination.

967
00:54:25,882 --> 00:54:28,418
Great! I mean, good.

968
00:54:28,485 --> 00:54:29,919
Not good. It's...

969
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:32,688
It's good that you wanna stop,
but not...

970
00:54:32,754 --> 00:54:35,859
- Where is Mr. Mind?
- He's there.

971
00:54:39,062 --> 00:54:40,762
What do you think
we'll find in there?

972
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:43,799
Whatever it is,
we'll face it together.

973
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:47,703
By Hades' heatstroke,

974
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:49,472
what is that?

975
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:52,342
It appears to be
some sort of chry-sal-lis.

976
00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:55,612
Everyone knows
it's pronounced chrysalis.

977
00:54:55,677 --> 00:54:57,313
Can we just call it a cocoon?

978
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,883
Well, whatever we're
calling it, what's it for?

979
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:02,185
For Mr. Mind.

980
00:55:02,252 --> 00:55:04,954
Uh, guys, I think
we need to get out of here.

981
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,057
Now!

982
00:55:08,124 --> 00:55:09,092
Seconded.

983
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:42,724
We're gonna need
some serious moth balls.

984
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:46,629
We can do this, team.
Let's get him.

985
00:55:49,499 --> 00:55:50,533
Fools!

986
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,569
You have served your purpose.

987
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:57,507
You gathered the sustenance I
needed to complete my transformation.

988
00:55:57,574 --> 00:55:59,342
Now nothing on Earth

989
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:04,746
can stop me from ruling
over you small-minded mortals.

990
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:06,416
Nothing on Earth?

991
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:07,749
That's it.

992
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:09,052
Follow me!

993
00:56:15,757 --> 00:56:20,396
You won't get away
from me that easily, Junior League.

994
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:23,333
Whatever it is you're hoping
to do, Shazam, do it fast.

995
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,407
<i>Follow them.</i>

996
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:32,642
<i>Follow them.</i>

997
00:56:37,247 --> 00:56:39,048
He's coming!

998
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:39,916
Hold on!

999
00:56:46,055 --> 00:56:48,491
Oh, this ride better end quick.

1000
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:58,468
Is this supposed to slow down?

1001
00:56:58,534 --> 00:57:00,169
Uh, yeah?

1002
00:57:07,343 --> 00:57:09,811
The Wizard who gave me
my powers lives here.

1003
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:11,481
He'll know what to do.
Come on.

1004
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:16,386
<i>Do you see</i>

1005
00:57:16,452 --> 00:57:18,855
<i>the power of eternity?</i>

1006
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:22,458
Yes. The power,
I must have it.

1007
00:57:30,733 --> 00:57:32,869
Wizard. Wizard!

1008
00:57:32,935 --> 00:57:34,937
What? Huh?

1009
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:36,906
Oh, Billy!

1010
00:57:36,973 --> 00:57:38,341
It's good to see you.

1011
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:40,476
- "Billy"?
- Uh...

1012
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:42,378
I said...

1013
00:57:42,445 --> 00:57:44,947
"Silly." Silly Shazam.

1014
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,848
So good of you to come.

1015
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:48,384
And you brought
some young friends

1016
00:57:48,451 --> 00:57:50,953
to trick or treat
at the Rock of Eternity.

1017
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,623
Lovely costumes.

1018
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,793
The star on that tiara
really draws your eyes

1019
00:57:56,859 --> 00:57:58,661
away from your face.

1020
00:57:58,728 --> 00:58:00,063
Told you guys.

1021
00:58:00,129 --> 00:58:02,198
I think I have some candy corn
in the back.

1022
00:58:02,265 --> 00:58:04,367
- Wizard...
- Mm, but that was 100 years ago.

1023
00:58:04,434 --> 00:58:05,635
Uh, Wizard?

1024
00:58:05,702 --> 00:58:07,203
Does candy corn go bad?

1025
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,573
Ugh. No. Wizard,
this is the Justice League.

1026
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,209
They've been transformed
by a malevolent worm

1027
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:15,445
that just transformed
into a giant moth

1028
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:18,481
who is floating around outside
waiting to destroy us!

1029
00:58:18,548 --> 00:58:21,417
A giant moth?

1030
00:58:21,484 --> 00:58:23,920
I... hate... moths.

1031
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,095
This building, it tastes...

1032
00:58:32,161 --> 00:58:35,398
It tastes like eternity.

1033
00:58:36,366 --> 00:58:39,669
<i>Yes. More. More!</i>

1034
00:58:39,736 --> 00:58:40,703
The power,

1035
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,572
it's intoxicating!

1036
00:58:50,146 --> 00:58:52,281
What is happening?

1037
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:57,687
That giant moth is
feeding off the Rock of Eternity.

1038
00:58:57,754 --> 00:59:01,457
This place is the nexus
of limitless magical power!

1039
00:59:01,524 --> 00:59:05,495
If he eats much more,
he may be unstoppable.

1040
00:59:06,162 --> 00:59:08,131
Not to mention...

1041
00:59:08,866 --> 00:59:10,666
Oh, no!

1042
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:12,435
What is it?

1043
00:59:12,502 --> 00:59:15,138
Hurry! The more
the rock is destroyed,

1044
00:59:15,204 --> 00:59:17,875
the more it weakens
the defenses of the building.

1045
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:22,512
Shazam,

1046
00:59:22,578 --> 00:59:24,547
if what is inside
this prison is released,

1047
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:28,184
an unspeakable terror
will be unleashed upon us all.

1048
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,253
You must use the power of Zeus,

1049
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,189
and together,
you can defeat this evil.

1050
00:59:33,857 --> 00:59:35,324
The power of Zeus?

1051
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:36,894
But I don't know what that is!

1052
00:59:36,959 --> 00:59:40,997
You must completely trust them.

1053
00:59:41,063 --> 00:59:44,902
You have to be willing to let
them see you as you really are.

1054
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:46,269
Yes. Yes, that's great.

1055
00:59:46,335 --> 00:59:48,137
But can you just
be more specific...

1056
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,012
Free! Free!

1057
00:59:56,078 --> 00:59:59,649
By Poseidon's pits,
who is that?

1058
00:59:59,715 --> 01:00:02,920
I am Black Adam.

1059
01:00:02,985 --> 01:00:05,988
Earth's mightiest mortal.

1060
01:00:06,589 --> 01:00:08,324
Holy moly.

1061
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:10,726
The power of eternity,

1062
01:00:10,793 --> 01:00:12,728
it is mine!

1063
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:18,534
Ah.

1064
01:00:18,601 --> 01:00:21,103
My unwitting pawn.

1065
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:23,005
You? The voice.

1066
01:00:23,072 --> 01:00:24,942
The voice inside my head.

1067
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:26,409
But how?

1068
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:30,279
Centuries of isolation
strengthens the mind.

1069
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:33,115
I just needed
to harness my powers,

1070
01:00:33,182 --> 01:00:36,018
and use the Rock of Eternity
as an antenna

1071
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:37,955
to find a weak-minded being

1072
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,623
that would be open
to suggestion.

1073
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:41,925
Weak mind?

1074
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:43,759
I'm Mr. Mind.

1075
01:00:43,826 --> 01:00:46,897
And now, I'm all-powerful.

1076
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:52,134
Let me show you power, worm!

1077
01:01:00,743 --> 01:01:02,044
Shazam!

1078
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:10,586
Oh, dear.

1079
01:01:10,653 --> 01:01:12,555
Oh, no.

1080
01:01:12,622 --> 01:01:16,292
Oh, this doesn't look good
at all. Huh?

1081
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:20,663
Shazam!

1082
01:01:24,634 --> 01:01:27,036
His costume,
he looks just like you.

1083
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:28,237
Who is he?

1084
01:01:28,304 --> 01:01:30,306
The Wizard's first champion.

1085
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:33,877
Evidently, he went crazy
and took over the world.

1086
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:35,244
We're in trouble.

1087
01:01:35,311 --> 01:01:37,079
Oh, must go faster.

1088
01:01:37,146 --> 01:01:38,581
Must go... Oh!

1089
01:01:39,815 --> 01:01:41,150
Hello.

1090
01:01:41,217 --> 01:01:43,486
Perhaps we could come
to some sort of arrang...

1091
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:50,560
Heh.

1092
01:01:56,033 --> 01:01:57,366
Wizard.

1093
01:01:57,433 --> 01:02:00,670
It is time we finish this.

1094
01:02:00,736 --> 01:02:04,140
If you want the Wizard,
you'll have to get through me!

1095
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:06,576
You'll have to get
through all of us.

1096
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:10,546
Sorry, kids,

1097
01:02:10,613 --> 01:02:13,115
you need to be
this high to fight me.

1098
01:02:13,182 --> 01:02:14,684
Aw, man!

1099
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,953
He's joking, Flash.

1100
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:17,186
Oh! I knew that.

1101
01:02:17,253 --> 01:02:19,155
What I'm not joking about

1102
01:02:19,221 --> 01:02:20,523
is your doom!

1103
01:02:27,229 --> 01:02:29,032
Hyah!

1104
01:02:29,098 --> 01:02:31,701
- Whoa! Hey, let go of me. I'm Batman.
- Hey, hands off!

1105
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:34,437
Yeah. Hey, not the cape. This is silly.

1106
01:02:34,503 --> 01:02:36,472
Whoa!

1107
01:02:37,206 --> 01:02:39,342
Leave my friends alone!

1108
01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:41,377
You.

1109
01:02:41,444 --> 01:02:45,514
So, the Wizard found
a new errand boy.

1110
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:48,584
Come. Come show me
what you have.

1111
01:02:59,096 --> 01:03:02,732
You amateur,
you're making this too easy.

1112
01:03:08,237 --> 01:03:09,805
Ha-ha.

1113
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:11,841
Pathetic.

1114
01:03:15,311 --> 01:03:17,413
You're not capable
of wielding the power

1115
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,482
that that suit represents.

1116
01:03:20,783 --> 01:03:22,818
You're nothing but a boy.

1117
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:34,830
Say good night

1118
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:37,000
forever.

1119
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:38,367
Stop!

1120
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:44,240
This is between us, Adam.

1121
01:03:44,306 --> 01:03:45,808
Leave the boy alone.

1122
01:03:47,743 --> 01:03:48,744
Fine.

1123
01:03:49,845 --> 01:03:52,214
Whoa!

1124
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:13,836
Got him.

1125
01:04:16,205 --> 01:04:17,573
Thanks, Wonder Woman.

1126
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,342
All right, League,
it's time to stop this madman

1127
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:21,744
once and for all.

1128
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:24,447
But how?
He's more powerful than we are,

1129
01:04:24,513 --> 01:04:25,949
especially as kids.

1130
01:04:26,016 --> 01:04:27,249
We have to try.

1131
01:04:27,316 --> 01:04:29,218
We can't leave the Wizard
to face him alone.

1132
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:31,554
Agreed! Come on, guys!

1133
01:04:38,627 --> 01:04:41,230
It's some kind of energy field.

1134
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,338
Wizard!

1135
01:04:49,405 --> 01:04:51,707
<i>Billy, you mustn't interfere.</i>

1136
01:04:51,774 --> 01:04:55,078
<i>I will hold Black Adam off
as long as I can.</i>

1137
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:57,713
<i>I've created a portal
back to Earth.</i>

1138
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,281
<i>Go! Now!</i>

1139
01:04:59,348 --> 01:05:00,683
I'm not leaving you.

1140
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,251
<i>Never mind about me.</i>

1141
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:03,819
<i>Black Adam is too dangerous</i>

1142
01:05:03,887 --> 01:05:06,388
<i>for you and the others
to face right now.</i>

1143
01:05:06,455 --> 01:05:07,924
But what about you?

1144
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:10,093
<i>You must go now.</i>

1145
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,560
<i>If I don't stop him,</i>

1146
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:14,396
<i>you will be
the last line of defense.</i>

1147
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:17,968
<i>Remember, the power of Zeus.</i>

1148
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:23,173
Wizard!

1149
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:28,844
Your time
is finally up, Wizard.

1150
01:05:34,316 --> 01:05:36,052
No!

1151
01:05:46,428 --> 01:05:49,398
I'm coming for you, Shazam!

1152
01:05:49,465 --> 01:05:50,967
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no.

1153
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,569
I'm coming for all of you!

1154
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:06,682
Let's go home.

1155
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:13,023
I've got a plan.

1156
01:06:13,089 --> 01:06:14,824
When I was first turned
into a child,

1157
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:16,492
I found our vehicles
were ineffective

1158
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:17,894
because of our height.

1159
01:06:17,961 --> 01:06:21,797
In fact, Shazam had to drive
the Batmobile.

1160
01:06:21,865 --> 01:06:24,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You got to drive the Batmobile?

1161
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:26,802
- Oh, sweet!
- Are you kidding me?

1162
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:28,637
Yeah, it's definitely
stick shift.

1163
01:06:28,704 --> 01:06:31,274
For our
vehicles to be effective,

1164
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,609
they need to be our size.

1165
01:06:33,676 --> 01:06:36,012
It's time to build
something new.

1166
01:07:14,985 --> 01:07:18,154
Well,
butter my bricks and call me a biscuit!

1167
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:19,956
These look amazing!

1168
01:07:21,324 --> 01:07:22,625
The trouble alert.

1169
01:07:25,195 --> 01:07:26,662
Lois Lane reporting live

1170
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:28,697
from the League of Nations
building in Metropolis,

1171
01:07:28,764 --> 01:07:31,667
where a man has appeared
floating down through the air.

1172
01:07:31,734 --> 01:07:33,870
He is hovering
toward the main assembly now.

1173
01:07:33,937 --> 01:07:35,872
Maybe there's
a new hero in town.

1174
01:07:39,175 --> 01:07:40,243
No. Not a hero.

1175
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,443
Definitely not a hero.

1176
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:44,881
Black Adam is here.

1177
01:07:44,948 --> 01:07:46,849
And I thought I was fast.
Sheesh.

1178
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:47,783
What now?

1179
01:07:47,851 --> 01:07:50,452
Now we do
what we were born to do.

1180
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:52,155
We save the day.

1181
01:07:56,825 --> 01:07:59,828
Nothing on Earth
can stop this party. Whoo!

1182
01:08:06,568 --> 01:08:08,071
Bad feeling about this.

1183
01:08:08,138 --> 01:08:10,073
Maybe he's here
to install the disco light.

1184
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,275
Excuse me. You can't
just barge in here

1185
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:13,742
and ruin our party...

1186
01:08:15,644 --> 01:08:16,880
Party over.

1187
01:08:16,947 --> 01:08:18,381
People of...

1188
01:08:21,017 --> 01:08:22,185
Sorry.

1189
01:08:22,252 --> 01:08:24,120
People of Earth,

1190
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:27,456
I, Black Adam,
am your rightful ruler.

1191
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:30,093
You will obey me
without question.

1192
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,828
Those who don't will be
crushed beneath my...

1193
01:08:32,896 --> 01:08:34,197
Feet?

1194
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:38,168
What?

1195
01:08:38,234 --> 01:08:39,635
Who dares?

1196
01:08:39,702 --> 01:08:41,204
The Justice League,

1197
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:43,006
that's who!

1198
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:53,116
Execute plan Playtime.

1199
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,452
Foolish children.

1200
01:08:55,517 --> 01:08:57,486
Your games won't stop me.

1201
01:08:57,553 --> 01:09:00,056
You must think
you're pretty slick.

1202
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:06,595
What?

1203
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:09,299
Need help getting cleaned up?

1204
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:11,034
How about this spin cycle?

1205
01:09:14,503 --> 01:09:15,472
Tag! You're it.

1206
01:09:24,114 --> 01:09:25,048
Batter up!

1207
01:09:33,156 --> 01:09:35,925
All right, Flash,
let's wrap this up.

1208
01:09:38,228 --> 01:09:40,363
What kind of games
are these, children?

1209
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,232
The kind you'll lose.

1210
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:44,034
Now, Princess!

1211
01:09:54,077 --> 01:09:55,677
Huh. Enough!

1212
01:09:55,744 --> 01:09:57,080
Not quite.

1213
01:09:57,147 --> 01:10:00,250
Every game should end
with a little fireworks.

1214
01:10:04,686 --> 01:10:06,688
- Did we do it?
- We must have.

1215
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:08,925
He is flatter than a flapjack
on the griddle.

1216
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:29,745
Hah!

1217
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:38,720
Kneel before me.

1218
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:41,391
Kneel before
the great Black Adam.

1219
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:43,359
What?

1220
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:45,095
Say, leave the kid alone!

1221
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:46,996
You are a horrible human being.

1222
01:10:47,063 --> 01:10:49,165
Pick on somebody your own size.

1223
01:10:49,232 --> 01:10:50,266
Get out of here!

1224
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:51,534
Stop it!

1225
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,269
- Leave us alone!
- I am Black Adam.

1226
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:54,537
We know.

1227
01:10:54,603 --> 01:10:56,239
I am all-powerful!

1228
01:10:56,306 --> 01:10:57,806
We know.

1229
01:10:57,874 --> 01:11:00,210
We'd never bow
to the likes of you.

1230
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:05,048
Coward!

1231
01:11:05,115 --> 01:11:07,851
What now? We need,
like, three more Shazams

1232
01:11:07,917 --> 01:11:09,519
to even put a dent in that guy.

1233
01:11:09,586 --> 01:11:10,652
Three more?

1234
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,088
Shazam!

1235
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,992
Shazam!

1236
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:26,536
<i>Remember, the power of Zeus.</i>

1237
01:11:26,603 --> 01:11:27,971
The power of Zeus!

1238
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:30,739
Guys, I know what I have to do.

1239
01:11:30,806 --> 01:11:33,209
But, to do it,

1240
01:11:33,276 --> 01:11:35,612
I have to show you
who I really am.

1241
01:11:35,677 --> 01:11:37,046
Remember, Shazam,

1242
01:11:37,113 --> 01:11:39,949
the only way to trust someone
is to trust them.

1243
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:43,319
This might tickle.

1244
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,288
Shazam!

1245
01:12:12,315 --> 01:12:13,917
This is amazing!

1246
01:12:13,983 --> 01:12:16,052
We're adults again.

1247
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:17,153
I feel...

1248
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,889
More powerful
than a locomotive.

1249
01:12:19,956 --> 01:12:21,823
Way more powerful.

1250
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:23,159
Hi.

1251
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,029
I'm Billy Batson.

1252
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:28,364
You're a...

1253
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:29,999
Kid.

1254
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:32,168
Now you know
why I didn't want to tell you.

1255
01:12:32,235 --> 01:12:34,370
I didn't want you
to think less of me.

1256
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:37,140
Billy, being a hero
isn't about your age

1257
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:39,008
or having flashy superpowers.

1258
01:12:39,075 --> 01:12:40,443
Part of being a hero

1259
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:42,711
is trying to make the world
a better place,

1260
01:12:42,778 --> 01:12:44,147
no matter what age you are.

1261
01:12:44,214 --> 01:12:47,083
Yeah. That
and an awesome costume.

1262
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,319
By the way,
why didn't my costume change?

1263
01:12:49,385 --> 01:12:51,054
You've already got
a lightning bolt.

1264
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,290
Billy, you're going to make
one incredible member

1265
01:12:54,357 --> 01:12:55,925
of the Justice League.

1266
01:12:55,992 --> 01:12:58,861
Ha-ha!
Sentimental fools!

1267
01:12:58,928 --> 01:13:00,897
Even by using
the power of Zeus,

1268
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:02,565
you will not defeat me.

1269
01:13:02,632 --> 01:13:04,934
I am Black Adam!

1270
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:06,869
As my ma used to say,

1271
01:13:06,936 --> 01:13:11,140
"There's nothing worse than a
rooster that hollers before sunrise."

1272
01:13:22,518 --> 01:13:24,454
Well, Terrance,
your mother and I

1273
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,722
are both school teachers,

1274
01:13:25,787 --> 01:13:27,557
so I hope you like
studying every day.

1275
01:13:27,624 --> 01:13:31,327
Oh, and we almost never eat at
those fun fast-food burger places.

1276
01:13:31,394 --> 01:13:33,463
Your father makes
wonderful salads.

1277
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:35,265
And, we have a rule.

1278
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:38,167
No more than 20 minutes
of TV a day.

1279
01:13:59,889 --> 01:14:01,924
You're safe here, folks.
And remember,

1280
01:14:01,991 --> 01:14:05,261
there's no better insurance
than a safe driver.

1281
01:14:06,329 --> 01:14:07,196
Billy?

1282
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:09,432
Billy! You have to help me.

1283
01:14:09,499 --> 01:14:10,867
Hey, Terrance, what's up?

1284
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:12,235
My new family...

1285
01:14:12,302 --> 01:14:14,304
I have to do homework,
eat my vegetables.

1286
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:16,673
There's even a time limit on how
much I can watch TV.

1287
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:19,042
Maybe we should get out
of the city right now.

1288
01:14:19,108 --> 01:14:20,476
Let's go to your mom's.

1289
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,911
Terrance can help her
clean up the basement

1290
01:14:21,978 --> 01:14:22,945
and organize
her coin collection.

1291
01:14:23,012 --> 01:14:24,247
You're gonna love it, buddy.

1292
01:14:24,314 --> 01:14:27,183
No!

1293
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,452
I'm really happy
for you, Terrance!

1294
01:14:29,519 --> 01:14:31,487
Whoo-hoo!
Pardon me.

1295
01:14:48,504 --> 01:14:49,572
Hyah!

1296
01:14:57,513 --> 01:14:58,915
Shazam!

1297
01:15:22,638 --> 01:15:24,140
We're back!

1298
01:15:24,207 --> 01:15:25,475
Oh, man,

1299
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,210
if I had to hear one more
of Superman's farm sayings,

1300
01:15:27,276 --> 01:15:28,511
I might have quit the League.

1301
01:15:28,578 --> 01:15:29,645
Oh, that's for sure.

1302
01:15:29,712 --> 01:15:31,314
- You can say that again.
- Yeah.

1303
01:15:31,381 --> 01:15:32,815
- It was awful.
- Yes, I couldn't agree more.

1304
01:15:32,882 --> 01:15:34,217
They're not that bad.

1305
01:15:36,586 --> 01:15:38,421
What did you do?

1306
01:15:38,488 --> 01:15:39,455
No.

1307
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:40,189
No!

1308
01:15:40,256 --> 01:15:42,358
The powers are mine!

1309
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:44,293
Shazam!

1310
01:15:45,027 --> 01:15:46,429
Shazam.

1311
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,499
Shazam.

1312
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,935
Shazam!

1313
01:15:54,771 --> 01:15:57,373
Looks like I might've
hijacked your magic.

1314
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,641
Sorry, not sorry.

1315
01:16:03,746 --> 01:16:05,548
I'll get you, Shazam.

1316
01:16:05,615 --> 01:16:09,018
Once I have my powers back,
you will be destr-

1317
01:16:11,053 --> 01:16:12,455
Destroyed!

1318
01:16:15,091 --> 01:16:17,593
Well, Shazam, you did it.

1319
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,462
No, we did it.

1320
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:22,365
But how did you know the lightning
would take away his powers?

1321
01:16:22,432 --> 01:16:24,400
Or change us back to adults?

1322
01:16:24,834 --> 01:16:26,402
Well,

1323
01:16:26,469 --> 01:16:28,204
let's just say...

1324
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:32,975
I had a hunch.

1325
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:35,211
Hmm.

1326
01:16:35,278 --> 01:16:37,547
So, now that we beat
the bad guy

1327
01:16:37,613 --> 01:16:39,715
and everything
is back to normal,

1328
01:16:39,782 --> 01:16:40,817
how should we celebrate?

1329
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:42,718
I know just the thing.

1330
01:16:45,588 --> 01:16:48,357
Remember how I told you
that Bat Computer could find

1331
01:16:48,424 --> 01:16:50,326
anyone anywhere?

1332
01:16:50,393 --> 01:16:52,428
After you revealed
your identity to me,

1333
01:16:52,495 --> 01:16:55,798
I had it search for any living
relatives you might have.

1334
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:57,033
You have two.

1335
01:16:57,099 --> 01:16:59,302
Your uncle and...

1336
01:17:00,036 --> 01:17:01,204
Billy?

1337
01:17:01,804 --> 01:17:03,039
My sister.

1338
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:04,474
Billy!

1339
01:17:07,743 --> 01:17:09,212
I'm Mary.

1340
01:17:09,278 --> 01:17:10,948
And this is our Uncle Dudley.

1341
01:17:11,013 --> 01:17:12,148
Hello, Billy.

1342
01:17:15,151 --> 01:17:18,554
That's what I'd call
a happy ending.

1343
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:20,690
I'm okay.

1344
01:18:07,737 --> 01:18:11,641
All I have to do
is find that Salvaxion warlord,

1345
01:18:11,707 --> 01:18:14,810
and I'll be knee-deep
in targman moolah

1346
01:18:14,878 --> 01:18:17,046
from now until next week.

1347
01:18:21,117 --> 01:18:22,451
What is this?

1348
01:18:22,518 --> 01:18:23,619
Let go!

1349
01:18:23,686 --> 01:18:27,024
Well, what do we have here?

1350
01:18:27,089 --> 01:18:29,692
What's your name, little fella?

1351
01:18:29,759 --> 01:18:32,161
Mind, Mr. Mind.

1352
01:18:32,228 --> 01:18:34,932
The greatest villain
in the galaxy.

1353
01:18:34,998 --> 01:18:39,970
Wanted in over three quadrants
of the universe for my evil evilness.

1354
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:41,637
"Wanted," eh?

1355
01:18:47,243 --> 01:18:50,047
This day just keeps
getting better.

1356
01:18:50,112 --> 01:18:51,280
Huh?

1357
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:53,616
Oh, my.

1358
01:18:55,284 --> 01:19:00,284
