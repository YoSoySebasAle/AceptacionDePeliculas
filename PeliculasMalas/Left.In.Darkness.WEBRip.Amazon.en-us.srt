1
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,574
Hello.

2
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:45,855
Celia. What's yours?

3
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,410
It's nice to meet you,
Donovan.

4
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,033
I can't.
I'm not allowed.

5
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:59,282
Hey, where'd you go?

6
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:07,463
Hey, where'd you go?

7
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:11,708
Where'd you go?

8
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:16,472
Where'd you go?

9
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,720
Whoa.

10
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:27,310
Where do you think you're going,
little lady, huh?

11
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:30,658
Grandpa,
I have to find him.Find who?

12
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,315
The boy.
He's gonna get away.

13
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,043
Come say hi to Mom,
and then you can go play, OK? Come on, honey.

14
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:37,113
OK.

15
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:46,674
Say hi to Mom.

16
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,161
Hi, Mommy.

17
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,992
I was just telling her
all about your new tooth

18
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,892
and how you're excited about starting volleyball practice next week.

19
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,343
Go on, sweetheart.
You can talk to her.

20
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:04,692
Just like you talk to me.
I know she's listening.

21
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,350
Pay attention, Celia.
We're here to see your mommy.

22
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:10,042
Tell her about your week.I don't want to.

23
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:13,563
What did you say? I said I don't want to.

24
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,945
Why?

25
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,636
I just don't.

26
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:21,709
Honey, your mother loves you.
She loves you very much, baby.

27
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,919
I won't.
You can't make me.Celia, honey!

28
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:53,258
Celia, no!

29
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:07,237
It's OK. She's OK.
It's OK, it's OK.

30
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:09,516
What are you doing?
Don't dothat.

31
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,035
It's OK, Grandpa.
He protected me.

32
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,141
He's always gonna protect me.

33
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:17,075
What if I would have
lost you, too, huh?

34
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:21,286
Don't do that, baby,
please.

35
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,871
Celia?

36
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,325
Out here.

37
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:04,156
One for the road.

38
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:07,332
Are you ready yet?

39
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,817
Hey, you can't rush
perfection.

40
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,441
Still have to find
my keys.

41
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:20,172
What would I do
without you?

42
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,485
You sure
you wanna do this? Do what?

43
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,661
I know what this day means.
I know how you get.

44
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:31,011
So we don't have to go
if you don't want to.Justine, it's my 21st.

45
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:33,600
I'd like to actually
enjoy my birthday for once.

46
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:36,603
You sure?
'Cause I'm totally fine just staying here.

47
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:39,675
Yes. I could use a party.

48
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,540
OK, then, let's go.
This afternoon,

49
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:46,129
several people were seriously injured in the accident...

50
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:48,856
Damn. I'm glad you didn't
get caught in that

51
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,376
on the way up here,

52
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,378
especially in that
piece-of-crap car.

53
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,862
Yeah.

54
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:58,452
Stop it.What?

55
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,454
Your birthday's
not cursed.

56
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:03,112
Accidents like that
happen every day up here.

57
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:05,597
I know.

58
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:09,118
I-I... we'll have fun
tonight.

59
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,431
...and recommends
alternate routes.

60
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:15,745
Yo! You hotties wanna be
in a movie?

61
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,644
You wish, losers!

62
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,888
Aren't you glad you came up here to share in this cultural experience?

63
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:23,546
Hey, I wanted
to do something different.

64
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:26,135
This is different.

65
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,862
I do my best to deliver.

66
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,899
Stay away from the froshies,
and you should be fine.

67
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,971
Just promise not to ditch me
five minutes after we get in

68
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:37,595
for some idiot.Scout's honor.

69
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,287
You'll be too busy
making it with Dougie Fresh,

70
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,462
and I'll be left alone
by the keg-erator.

71
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,188
OK, there's not gonna be any "making it,"
at least not by me.

72
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,363
Uh-huh. You came
all the way up here

73
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,676
for a little hand-holding
and friendly conversation.

74
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,334
I came here so I could be with my best friend in the whole world.

75
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:55,992
And the hot guy she promised
to hook you up with.

76
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:58,063
That's really
the cherry.

77
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,074
You gonna be OK?

78
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:12,940
If you ask me that
one more time, I'll kill you.

79
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,183
Come on.

80
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,332
Corby!

81
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,472
Justine!

82
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,785
Hey, you made it.

83
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,649
Hi. Follow me.

84
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:37,102
Corby, this is my friend Celia.
She's up from San Diego.

85
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,449
Pleasure to meet you,
pretty lady.Hi.

86
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,935
Can my boy Terry here
offer you a cocktail?

87
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,870
You two should try
the famous Terry Bomb.What?!

88
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:49,114
One shot
from each bottle.Huh?

89
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,048
One shot
from each bottle.

90
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,569
Uh, just beer,
please.

91
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,778
I want
a Terry Bomb!

92
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,647
So, where's Doug?
I want him to meet Celia.

93
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:08,168
He's upstairs. I think
you're gonna like him.

94
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:11,102
Really.

95
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,931
Let me see
if he's in here.

96
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,037
Dude!

97
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,041
All right.

98
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,940
Ladies?
Are you sure?

99
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:24,184
Cool. All right.

100
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,988
Well, I just -
you know, I missed my guy.

101
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:38,060
He's weirded out
when...

102
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:41,028
What's up, brother?

103
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:42,858
Hey, you seen
Doug around?

104
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:44,860
No, haven't seen him
since Jell-O shots.

105
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:47,034
Wow. You and your
fine companions

106
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:50,797
care to join us for a little
otherworldly excitement?

107
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,730
Yeah. What are we in,
third grade?

108
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:56,285
Hey, now, you dare mock
the great Ouija?

109
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:59,944
Jesus, Gopher,
put that thing away.

110
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,810
How you doin'? Don't listen to him.

111
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:07,330
He's really just a D&amp; D geek
under that shaved chest.

112
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:10,161
It's true.

113
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,473
Oh, my God.

114
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:15,097
Who's doing that?

115
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,650
It's not me, I swear.

116
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:19,964
Well, quick,
grab a pen and paper.

117
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:43,781
"Go home, Celia"?

118
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:49,476
It didn't say that.

119
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,133
Who the hell's Celia?

120
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,757
Um, she is.

121
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,450
Very funny.

122
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:01,453
I didn't--Oh, please.

123
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:04,008
You cannot punk me.

124
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:06,804
Hey, whoa, whoa, ladies,
let the man of the house...

125
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:13,155
Hey, bee-atch.

126
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:19,161
You chicaswait in here.
I'll be right back.

127
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:21,819
That was kinda weird, huh? Oh, stop.

128
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:24,856
I swear it wasn't me.Whatever.

129
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:28,411
OK, believe what you will.
Don't trust your number one girl.

130
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:29,723
He's kinda cute, huh?

131
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,035
Who, Corby? Uh-huh.

132
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,520
I think I might
hook up with him tonight.Really?

133
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:37,213
What, you don't approve?I'm not here to judge.

134
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:40,976
It's not for sure or anything.
There might be something better out there for me.

135
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,323
You wouldn't want
to miss out.

136
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:46,740
Look who I found.

137
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:48,362
Douglas.

138
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:50,364
I've been looking
all over for you.

139
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,228
This is my friend Celia.
It's her birthday.

140
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,058
Oh, yeah?

141
00:11:56,612 --> 00:11:58,407
Happy birthday.

142
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,409
Thanks.

143
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,376
Am I allowed
to ask the number?

144
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:04,344
The big 2-1.

145
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:08,831
Nice. Well, we'll have to
make tonight a special one.

146
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,869
Get the fuck
out of here.

147
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:17,797
Two beers!

148
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,626
Yeah!

149
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:35,711
D!

150
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:47,102
Do it!

151
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:49,276
Yeah!

Hey.

170
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,311
Hi.

171
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,832
What's wrong?

172
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:06,043
Nothing. Why?

173
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:12,118
You just seemed a little
- I don't know - distant back there.

174
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:16,053
No. I'm sorry.

175
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,089
Thanks
for getting me this.

176
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:21,058
It's no place for a girl
over there right now.

177
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:23,819
Naked keg stands.

178
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:26,580
No place for a guy,
either, really.

179
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,826
So where's your girl?

180
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,001
She ditched me
for a meathead.

181
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,072
Predictable.

182
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:40,077
Come on, I wanna
show you something.

183
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:43,804
Go home, Celia.

184
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,945
What was that?

185
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,947
What?

186
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,053
Nothing.

187
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,883
It was probably the music.

188
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:56,748
Come on.

189
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:03,583
♪ Television child,
your mind is

190
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:07,483
♪ Freakin' out

191
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:12,557
♪ But you know nobody
wants to see it

192
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:14,456
♪ Does anybody wonder

193
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,492
♪ Oh, what's goin' on
round here...? ♪

194
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:20,669
Ohh. You guys
have a make-out room?

195
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:22,257
Of course.

196
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,639
What kind of frat house
would this be without one?

197
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:29,954
I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself there, buddy.

198
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,232
No, over here.

199
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:37,030
Come on, I wanna
show you something.

200
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,549
What is it?

201
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,482
You'll see.

202
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,035
Come on.

203
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,631
What is this?

204
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:55,117
This was an old wine cellar
back in the day,

205
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,568
back before
this was a fraternity.

206
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:00,191
It's probably, like,
hundreds of years old.

207
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:02,021
Cool.Yeah.

208
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:05,507
I like to come down here
and think about, like,

209
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:10,167
who came through that door,
you know, what they wore,

210
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:13,342
what they talked about,
what they drank.

211
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:16,690
I guess that makes me
kind of a huge geek, huh?

212
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:20,453
No. No, I think
it's really cute.

213
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,527
There it is.

214
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:26,700
What?

215
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,771
That look.
Why are you so sad?

216
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,119
It's your birthday.

217
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:35,088
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to.

218
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:38,643
It's OK. You can tell me.
I'm good at keeping secrets.

219
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:41,784
It's not even a secret,
really.

220
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,581
I really hoped that this
wouldn't affect me this year,

221
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:49,999
but birthdays have never
really been great for me.

222
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:53,934
Well, my mom died
on my birthday.

223
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:58,491
She actually died
giving birth to me,

224
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:02,391
so every year, my birthday's
kind of like a reminder

225
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:05,291
that I killed her.

226
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:10,503
Shit, that - that's rough.

227
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:12,574
Yeah.

228
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:16,578
And apparently my dad hit the bottle and disappeared,

229
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:20,927
so I was raised
by my grandparents.

230
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:24,689
Which was great. I mean,
my grandpa was so amazing.

231
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:30,764
But he died last year,
so...

232
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,215
Well, I...

233
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,391
I just really miss him
so much.

234
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,151
No doubt.

235
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:43,225
Every year, I'd spend
my birthday with him,

236
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,093
and he just missed my mom
so much, but...

237
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:54,167
...he would always remember
to remind me that -

238
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:58,723
that her death
wasn't my fault.

239
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:01,726
That's - That's
some heavy shit.

240
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:04,315
And it was 21 years ago,

241
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,766
and I never even knew her.

242
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:13,669
Still, it's hard to eat cake
and ice cream, you know?

243
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,740
Sure.

244
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,262
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:23,472
I'm just really sorry.

246
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,509
It's like baggage central.

247
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:29,961
I don't even know why I'm talking to you about this.

248
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:37,141
Then let's not talk.

249
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,950
Go home, Celia.

250
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,779
What's wrong?

251
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:56,505
I just heard it again.

252
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,198
What?

253
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,821
I feel really weird.

254
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:05,376
I need to get out of here.
I need to get some air.

255
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,481
Wait, don't go.

256
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:09,691
Seriously.
I'm not feeling -

257
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,078
What did you do?

258
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:21,668
Come on, Celia.
Just relax.

259
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,386
Come on, man,
hurry it up.

260
00:20:56,462 --> 00:21:00,742
Hey. Hey, what the hell
is wrong with her?

261
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:03,296
Oh, dude,
I think she's OD'in'.

262
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:13,530
Hello?

263
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,499
Please help me!

264
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:19,975
This isn't real.
This isn't happening.

265
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:35,025
Somebody!

266
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:38,235
Please! Get me
out of here!

267
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,134
Somebody get me out of here.

268
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:44,483
Please! Somebody, please.

269
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:49,177
Justine!

270
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:02,846
Justine.

271
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,781
Anybody.

272
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,442
Grandpa?

273
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,831
Doug?

274
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,155
Hello?

275
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,963
Hello?

276
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:47,251
Holy shit!

277
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,652
Hello?

278
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,926
Hello?

279
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,102
Is anyone here?

280
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:51,177
You guys, come on.

281
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:54,629
If this is a joke,
it's really not funny.

282
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:02,948
Justine?

283
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,745
Justine, are you here?

284
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:33,047
Hello?

285
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,054
Grandpa.

286
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:43,298
Hey, little lady.

287
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,024
Happy birthday.

288
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,406
What's going on?

289
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,718
It's OK, Celia.
Everything's OK now.

290
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:52,169
No, no, no.
This is a bad dream.

291
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:55,034
Don't be scared.

292
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:58,900
But you died.Yes.

293
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,695
Then how...?

294
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:02,870
You died, too.

295
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:05,838
Those boys,
those filthy boys.

296
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:09,497
But they can't hurt you now.

297
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:12,086
You're safe now.
You're safe with me.

298
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,950
I'm dead?

299
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:16,021
Yes.

300
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:19,231
That stuff they put
in my drink.

301
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,820
I wanna wake up now.

302
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:25,099
This is not a dream, Celia.Yes, it is.

303
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,928
This is a terrible dream.

304
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:30,380
I just must have passed out somewhere,
and I'm gonna wake up.

305
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,455
I know how you're feeling.

306
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:39,976
I'm not dead!
This is crazy.

307
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,357
I don't have time
to explain it all,

308
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:45,257
but we have to
get out of this house.

309
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,328
Why? Listen to me, Celia.

310
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:49,813
Do as I say,
and nothing bad will happen.

311
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,920
But, please, we've gotta go.

312
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:54,956
You cannot stay here.

313
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,166
OK.Quickly.

314
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:00,272
Where are we?
What is this place?

315
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:02,688
Stay with me,
and you'll find out.

316
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:07,106
Celia, you must go.

317
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:08,936
You must get out.

318
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,938
I will meet you out there.

319
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:13,388
Where are you going?
Don't leave me.

320
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:17,116
I promise you,
I will find you. Go.

321
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:19,878
Whatever you do,
don't look back.

322
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,156
Run!

323
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,686
What the hell?

324
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:58,399
Hello?

325
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,265
Hello?

326
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,924
Hello?!

327
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,193
Oh!

328
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,886
Aah.

329
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:57,768
Grandpa?

330
00:32:57,803 --> 00:32:59,011
No!

331
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,564
Aah!

332
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,602
Oww!

333
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:18,410
Go back to the house,
Celia. Who is that?

334
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:23,035
Go back to the house, Celia.
It's the only way. Who's there?

335
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:27,488
Come on.

336
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,835
Come on, come on, come on.

337
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,147
Celia.

338
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:33,494
Sweetheart,
come on, let's go.

339
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:34,840
Go away!

340
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,359
It's OK.

341
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:39,983
What is this?
Where am I?

342
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,330
It'll all be over soon.What do you mean?

343
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:47,473
Aah! Aah!

344
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,139
Help!

345
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:18,125
Hello?

346
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,267
Is anybody here?

347
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,068
Hello, Celia.Stay away from me.

348
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,104
It's OK.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

349
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,761
Stay back. Get away.

350
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:36,212
Celia -Stop calling me that.

351
00:34:36,246 --> 00:34:40,112
You don't know me.
I don't know what you guys put in my drink.

352
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,114
I'm not one of those guys,

353
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,599
and this isn't
some bad trip.

354
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:47,913
I'm not dead.
Don't you tell me that I'm dead!

355
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:50,605
Look, I know you've had a tough night.
You're upset.

356
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,023
So let's just calm down
and talk about this, OK? Calm down?

357
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:57,647
Just invite me in.
I'll explain everything to you.

358
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,960
Oh, yeah, sure. Come in
so you can just kill me.

359
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:03,239
That's not why I'm here.

360
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,864
Now do you remember?

361
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:08,934
Oh, my God.

362
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:11,626
I'm your friend, Celia,

363
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:15,285
and I always have been.

364
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:18,771
Hello.

365
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:20,394
Hello.
What's your name?

366
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:22,292
Celia. What's yours?

367
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:23,949
They call me Donovan.

368
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,433
It's nice to meet you,
Donovan.

369
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,573
Can you come and play,
Celia?

370
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:30,404
I can't. I'm not allowed.

371
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:33,096
Don't worry.
I'm here to protect you.

372
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,926
I'm always going
to protect you, Celia.

373
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:38,826
The cemetery.

374
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,139
You saved me from that car.

375
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,900
And countless other times,
I might add.

376
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,454
So what are you,
like my guardian angel? Not exactly.

377
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:48,284
I died, too, just like you.

378
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:52,667
I was only eight at the time,
so I understand how scared you must be.

379
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:54,945
This might be easier
to explain

380
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,224
if I wasn't out here
freezing my ass off.

381
00:35:57,258 --> 00:36:00,399
If you think you're coming in here,
you're out of your mind.

382
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:03,402
You don't have a lot of time.
Two hours, give or take.

383
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:05,266
Come 2 a.m., it's lights out.

384
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,993
And then I suppose
I turn into a pumpkin.

385
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:10,064
No, then you become
completely vulnerable

386
00:36:10,098 --> 00:36:12,135
to these nasty things
out here.

387
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,449
So I'd can the sarcasm,
because I'm trying to help you.

388
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:18,521
I'm not letting you in here
just so you can turn into

389
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:21,696
one of those crazy,
psycho demon things like my grandfather just did.

390
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,560
You see, that wasn't
your grandfather.

391
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,493
It was the soul eater
that ate him.

392
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:28,703
So now he can appear,
act and sound like your grandfather.

393
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,429
This is crazy!

394
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,500
So what you're telling me

395
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:36,090
is that I wasn't only raped
and murdered tonight,

396
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:38,472
but that my grandfather
was eaten

397
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:40,681
by one of those things?!

398
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:45,548
I don't know what to believe.

399
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:48,861
Well, do you believe
that I am who I say I am?

400
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,279
Yes, I do.

401
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:55,178
Well, that's enough for the time being.
Let me in.

402
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,835
Well, it's not locked.

403
00:36:56,869 --> 00:36:59,286
You actually
have to invite me in.

404
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,737
You see,
this white light around is called your sanctuary.

405
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,808
People can't come in
your sanctuary

406
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:06,465
unless you invite them,

407
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,537
and once in,
they can't touch you unless you touch them first,

408
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:12,091
so don't touch them.

409
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,577
That would be bad.

410
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:16,475
OK.

411
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,683
Come in.

412
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,937
Come with me.

413
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:32,284
I have something
to show you.

414
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:38,911
Shit.

415
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:49,128
Wait. Hey!

416
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:53,063
Well, come on.

417
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:56,653
I'm not going out there.
I'm not really good with heights.

418
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:00,623
You're already dead.

419
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:02,694
Are you really afraid
of falling?

420
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,326
Take a look.

421
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:16,880
We're the only ones here.

422
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:19,849
Exactly. It's just
you and me now.

423
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,851
That's why
you gotta stick by me.

424
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,336
Wait. I just saw
something. Look!

425
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,338
What is that?

426
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,547
That is a soul eater.

427
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:29,928
What?

428
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:32,275
A soul eater
is exactly as it sounds.

429
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,278
It needs to feed, constantly,
or else it goes to hell.

430
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,970
They're all just waiting
for the perfect moment

431
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:39,972
when you step
out of the light.

432
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:42,009
That's when it can attack.

433
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:46,462
You're my imaginary friend.

434
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:49,465
I must just be imagining you.

435
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:51,329
I'm as real as can be.

436
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,331
In fact,
I'm a little offended

437
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,160
that you stopped
believing in me.

438
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:59,060
But you were the one
that stopped coming around.

439
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:01,442
I haven't seen you
since I was, like, eight.

440
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:04,031
Yeah, but I've been there
the whole time.

441
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:06,378
Like when your grandfather Joe
was in the hospital

442
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:12,695
or when you got drunk and crashed
your grandpa's car into the Dumpster.

443
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:16,319
I was there when you lost
your virginity.You were there for that?

444
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,081
I needed to make sure
that you were paying attention.

445
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,052
You really never left?

446
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:26,950
No.

447
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:29,988
I wish I had known that.

448
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:32,922
Uh-oh.What? What is that?

449
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,234
Well, that flicker means
that the light is dying.

450
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:38,237
We need to move to a place
where the light is strong... Why?

451
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:41,137
...fast.What happens
if it runs out?

452
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,519
You don't want to know.
Come on, let's go inside.

453
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,765
Celia, come on.
Hurry.

454
00:39:50,353 --> 00:39:52,044
Celia.

455
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,564
Rachel.

456
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,255
Celia, help.

457
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,430
You've got to help me.Oh, my God.

458
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,087
Don't listen to her.

459
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:03,193
Something's after me.
It's trying to kill me.

460
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:05,403
She's not who she says
she is, Celia.

461
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:08,647
Don't listen to him.
He can't be trusted.

462
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:12,513
He's not like you and me.
I'm your friend.

463
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:15,723
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

464
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:20,521
Celia, please,
you've got to help me.

465
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:23,524
I don't know.

466
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:26,044
Celia, look at me.

467
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:36,019
Do you remember?

468
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:38,021
Yes.

469
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:40,748
You came here
the night I died.

470
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:42,612
It was different.

471
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:45,132
I always liked playing
with you.

472
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,272
Yeah, right. I sucked.

473
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:50,448
You were always
so much better than me.

474
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,519
Well, I was tougher
than you.

475
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:56,315
Is that why
you stuck up for me

476
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,973
when everybody else made fun?

477
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:01,286
I knew it wasn't about you.

478
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,875
You were worried
about hurting someone else.

479
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:06,118
Do you remember the night
my grandfather died?

480
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:08,880
That was a terrible night.

481
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:11,054
I never really thanked you.

482
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:14,541
I was all alone.

483
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:18,130
You barely knew me,
but you stayed with me all night.

484
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:20,926
I wouldn't have made it.

485
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:24,551
After that night,
we were connected, weren't we?

486
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,311
Yeah.

487
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:29,521
I helped you then, Celia,

488
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:33,145
and now I need you
to help me.

489
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,147
Please?

490
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,258
Aah!

491
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,537
Aah! Aah!

492
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:16,672
Aah!

493
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:23,057
What the hell
just happened to me?

494
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:24,818
Gee, I don't know, genius.

495
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:27,130
Maybe it's the fact you ignored everything I told you.

496
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:29,995
I was confused.There's no time
for confusion.

497
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,378
They will do whatever it takes to get into your head,
to get you out of the light.

498
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:35,863
You have to be smarter than them.
You have to think.

499
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:40,350
OK, but - but if she -
if itwas not Rachel,

500
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:43,733
then how did it know all those
personal things about me?

501
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:45,908
Because when it feeds,
it takes everything -

502
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:48,807
memories, feelings,
every-

503
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:51,154
We have to get
to the basement.

504
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:52,570
Hurry.

505
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,986
Now!

506
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,229
Aah!

507
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,671
Try to stick by me
from now on, all right?

508
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:26,742
No problem.

509
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:29,986
Hey.

510
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:35,233
Look.

511
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:37,304
Are you seeing this?

512
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:40,652
I see everything.
It's a gift.

513
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:43,448
You'll find
I have many gifts.

514
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:47,072
You can only see your old world through mirrors.

515
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:50,386
So this is what's happening
right now at this exact moment?

516
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,456
Yes.

517
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,286
I guess they haven't
found my body yet,

518
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,116
else the party
would be over.

519
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,671
Once your body leaves the sanctuary,
your soul goes with it.

520
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:02,812
Then it's open season
on your ass.

521
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:07,990
Oh, come on now,
don't start that.

522
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:10,648
I could never stand
to see you cry.

523
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:14,065
I'm scared, Donovan.

524
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:18,172
Well, it doesn't
have to end this way.

525
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:21,382
I'm listening.

526
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:24,385
I'll show you, but you're
gonna have to be brave,

527
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,526
and I know that's not
your strongest suit.

528
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:30,633
I guess
you have been watching.

529
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,118
Come on.

530
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:41,679
What are you doing?

531
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,819
This will lead you to a place
without soul eaters.

532
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:46,614
That's where this
all started.It's OK.

533
00:44:52,862 --> 00:44:53,898
I can't.

534
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:55,313
Sure, you can.

535
00:44:55,347 --> 00:44:59,179
No. Donovan, please.
I have a really bad feeling.

536
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,181
I've been through this
a few times.

537
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:03,114
I think I might know
what I'm talking about.

538
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:04,874
That place is evil.

539
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:09,189
I'm the guy who's protected you from evil your whole life.

540
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:11,536
I can't.

541
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,471
So you'd rather let them out there tear you to shreds?

542
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,543
That's what
you'd rather have?

543
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:20,545
There's still more time.

544
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:23,375
Please, let me see
if I can figure this thing out.

545
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,275
If we run out of time,
we can come back here.

546
00:45:28,277 --> 00:45:29,899
All right.

547
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:31,625
Thank you.

548
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,769
Remember - don't look them
in the eye.

549
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:41,428
Aah!

550
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:46,536
Aah!

551
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,372
Ow.

552
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,032
She got me.

553
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:02,449
You need to cover that.
Hurry.

554
00:46:02,483 --> 00:46:05,728
They're like sharks. They smell blood,
they know the source, they'll come.

555
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,180
Is that the right time? Oh, yeah.

556
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:12,390
We don't get much power here,
but enough for a few lights,

557
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:14,806
clocks, that sort of thing.

558
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:16,359
It's 1:08.

559
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:20,018
If that's accurate,
your time is halfway gone.

560
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:25,748
What's he doing?

561
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,887
Isn't it obvious?

562
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,517
That asshole.

563
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:44,560
Justine, no!

564
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,665
Keep your hand on the mirror.

565
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,254
As long as it's on the mirror,
you can hear everything they hear.

566
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:51,222
...cannot find her,
and it's been hours.

567
00:46:51,256 --> 00:46:54,018
You know what?
I think I saw her in the backyard.

568
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:56,158
It's cool. You wanna
go dance or something?

569
00:46:56,192 --> 00:46:58,505
No, I don't wanna dance.
I wanna find -

570
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:00,679
I don't want your beer.
I wanna find my friend.

571
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:02,785
I wanna - I don't want
your beer!

572
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,786
Are you sure? Yes!

573
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,133
Can't I just stay?

574
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:09,827
No. It may appear that you're in this room,
but it's just perspective.

575
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:11,898
It's not reality.Stop!

576
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:14,176
They can't hear you,
Celia.

577
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,936
I don't want beer.
I wanna find Celia.

578
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:18,801
Why? Why do you wanna
interrupt the magic?

579
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,493
She didn't just run off and get naked with Doug.
She wouldn't do that.

580
00:47:21,528 --> 00:47:24,151
Neither would you,
apparently.

581
00:47:24,186 --> 00:47:26,188
Don't be a jerk.
I just wanna find Celia.

582
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:29,294
Would you stop freaking out.
She's a big girl.

583
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:31,262
I think she can
take care of herself.

584
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:33,678
Look, it's her birthday. I don't
want her to think I ditched her.

585
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:36,163
I promise you, she's not
thinking about that.Asshole.

586
00:47:36,198 --> 00:47:39,649
She's off with my boy,
having a great time.

587
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,893
No!

588
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:43,653
I tried to tell you.

589
00:47:43,688 --> 00:47:46,001
I have to get back.
That's the stuff they put in my drink.

590
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:47,209
It'll kill her.

591
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:49,314
You can't affect living things
anymore, Celia.

592
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,386
You need to understand that.I have to help her.

593
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:55,079
It's out of
your hands now.

594
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:58,289
Whoa. Let's think about this
for just one second, all right?

595
00:47:58,323 --> 00:48:00,808
Your light is dying
as we speak.

596
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:03,984
If she drinks that,
she creates a new sanctuary.

597
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:06,021
That gives you more light.

598
00:48:06,055 --> 00:48:09,438
And plus, you two
get to be together... again.

599
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:12,786
I can't just
let her die.

600
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,340
It's kind of
the order of things.

601
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,963
Fuck you.

602
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:19,034
There's no need
for the f-word.Shh!

603
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:22,623
Seriously, baby, why don't we
give 'em another half an hour?

604
00:48:22,658 --> 00:48:25,937
I swear,
she's gonna walk through the door with this huge smile on her face.

605
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:28,284
You clearly have a lot of confidence in your friend.

606
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,011
Hey, my bros know how
to get it done right.

607
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:33,082
Obviously.Justine, walk away.

608
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:34,428
He's a dick.

609
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:38,950
Stop! No! No!

610
00:48:38,985 --> 00:48:41,125
I'm gonna need
a lot more of this.No!

611
00:48:48,753 --> 00:48:51,549
Did you just see that? Nice one.

612
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:01,386
What?

613
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:09,187
We gotta go.

614
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:16,712
Hey, wait. You lied to me.

615
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,920
I did not.

616
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,991
Yes, you did. You said
I couldn't affect things.

617
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:22,062
You said there was
nothing I could do.

618
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:25,307
Technically, you can't affect living things.
That's true.

619
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:27,309
Cup of beer does not
have a heartbeat.

620
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:29,794
Why would you
want her to die?

621
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:31,865
Because I'm here
to protect you, Celia.

622
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:34,454
We could've had her light,
had her sanctuary.

623
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:38,630
Look, I would never sacrifice my friend's life for my own, ever.

624
00:49:38,665 --> 00:49:41,461
It's that kind of thinking that's gonna get you sent you-know-where.

625
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:44,326
Don't listen to him, Celia.

626
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,362
You're perfect
just the way you are.

627
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:48,157
I'm very proud of you.

628
00:49:48,192 --> 00:49:51,747
Don't do anything
stupid here, Celia.

629
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:52,782
Shut up.

630
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:54,474
He's one of them.

631
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:57,063
How was he in my sanctuary?
He was in the living room.

632
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,651
He was in the light.
I was talking to him.

633
00:49:59,686 --> 00:50:02,861
I don't know.
Because you called him, let him in.

634
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,726
Grandpa?

635
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,073
Fortunately for you,

636
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:09,075
he can't come back
without another invitation.

637
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:12,768
Don't listen to him, Celia.
Listen to me.

638
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,735
He is not
your grandfather.

639
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,808
I know that,
but there's a part of him that is still in there.

640
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:21,501
Isn't there?

641
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:24,400
I'm here,
and you can be with me.

642
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:27,162
Listen to me, Celia.

643
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:31,511
I can take you to your mother.
I know she wants to meet you.

644
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:33,513
Yes.

645
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:35,480
Celia?

646
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:39,001
Just look at me, Celia.
Look at me.

647
00:50:44,282 --> 00:50:48,079
It's OK, you can go.

648
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:55,121
Mom?

649
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:05,545
I can't believe
you're standing here.

650
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,344
I don't know where to start.

651
00:51:11,378 --> 00:51:15,796
I know most of it, anyway.
I've watched you your whole life.

652
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:17,764
You're so beautiful.

653
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:23,287
So are you. More than
any of the pictures.

654
00:51:23,321 --> 00:51:26,842
I'm so sorry, Mom.
I'm so sorry.

655
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:30,708
You have to stop blaming yourself, please.

656
00:51:30,742 --> 00:51:35,230
You didn't kill me. It was my time.
It was supposed to be that way.

657
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:37,680
But it's so unfair.

658
00:51:37,715 --> 00:51:39,855
It was your death
that was unfair.

659
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,582
It was far too soon.

660
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:44,135
Celia, come now.

661
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,345
What, now?

662
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,038
You must find your way.But I don't understand.

663
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:55,215
I'm here with you now.
Why can't we just stay like this?

664
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,909
You have no idea
how I wish you could,

665
00:51:59,944 --> 00:52:02,326
but you must
earn it, Celia.

666
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,775
How?

667
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,881
Celia, come now.

668
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:09,712
What's happening?

669
00:52:09,747 --> 00:52:12,819
I can't say any more.
You have the answer inside.

670
00:52:12,853 --> 00:52:17,237
You must stay in the sanctuary.
The door is there.

671
00:52:17,272 --> 00:52:20,171
What door? What answer?

672
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:22,622
You can do it, Celia.

673
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:25,625
You belong here with me.
Remember that.

674
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:29,180
I'll be waiting for you.No, Mom. Wait!

675
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:32,597
Aah! Aah!

676
00:52:32,632 --> 00:52:35,048
Aah!

677
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,155
Donovan!

678
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:39,328
Get inside.

679
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,077
He's gone.

680
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:06,976
Are you all right?

681
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,152
I'm sorry.

682
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,362
Sorry's not gonna cut it
anymore, Celia.

683
00:53:13,397 --> 00:53:15,468
I've about had it
with you.

684
00:53:15,502 --> 00:53:17,677
There are others
that I can help,

685
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:21,819
others that listen to me,
pay attention to me.

686
00:53:21,853 --> 00:53:27,549
Wait. I'm sorry. It's just
that she was my mother

687
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,517
that I've never met
in my entire life.

688
00:53:30,552 --> 00:53:32,588
How was I
supposed to say no?

689
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:34,935
Because it's not real.

690
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:38,456
That place that you went
is a lie.

691
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:40,217
Everything is a lie.

692
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:42,978
Are you trying to tell me those things ate my mother's soul

693
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:44,807
and sent her to hell?

694
00:53:44,842 --> 00:53:48,017
No, not you mother.
She made it to heaven.

695
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:51,745
But it's the in-betweens
who get stuck.No, that's bullshit.

696
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,162
My grandfather and Rachel
- they were good people, both of them.

697
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:57,199
And good people
go to heaven.

698
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,444
Your grandfather wasted away
after your mom died.

699
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:02,273
That's not true.

700
00:54:02,308 --> 00:54:06,484
It is true. He might as well
have died along with her.

701
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:09,970
No. He looked after me,
he took care of me.

702
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:15,079
Yeah, I'm sorry.

703
00:54:15,113 --> 00:54:18,807
I don't mean to yell at you.
I don't wanna hurt you.

704
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,982
I don't wanna lose you
to them, you know?

705
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:27,298
The fact is, Celia,
your grandfather just went by the motions,

706
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,784
like most people these days,
after your mom died.

707
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:33,546
In the end, he lived
a mediocre life at best.

708
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:36,480
So did I.

709
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:38,344
No, don't say that.

710
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:41,278
Sure, you were timid
and held back by guilt,

711
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:43,383
but you had depth,
and that counts.

712
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:45,592
Yeah, a lot of good
that did me.

713
00:54:45,627 --> 00:54:48,699
I'm just sitting here,
waiting for these things to eat me.

714
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:54,946
Well, I told you about
another option, didn't I?

715
00:54:54,981 --> 00:54:57,121
Not yet.

716
00:54:57,155 --> 00:54:59,744
You have half an hour,
Celia.

717
00:54:59,779 --> 00:55:03,334
A half an hour -
that's all you've got.

718
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,406
Don't look at me like that.

719
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:08,891
I just wanna go home.

720
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:11,963
I know, sweetheart.

721
00:55:11,998 --> 00:55:15,312
I wish you could, too.

722
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:18,763
But it looks like you're
just shit out of luck,

723
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,526
so you're gonna have to
learn how to deal.

724
00:55:26,978 --> 00:55:28,739
What was that?

725
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,778
I think there's something
that I can do for you.

726
00:55:55,593 --> 00:55:57,595
What are we doing here?

727
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,703
You'll see.

728
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,932
Watch.

729
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:34,494
What's wrong with this guy?

730
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:38,533
Besides being a rapist
and a murderer? Plenty.

731
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:14,603
I don't wanna be here.Wait, don't let go yet.

732
00:57:14,638 --> 00:57:16,812
You'll wanna see this.

733
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:25,511
Don't stop.

734
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:31,551
Do it. Be free.

735
00:57:31,586 --> 00:57:33,070
Who's there?

736
00:57:38,765 --> 00:57:42,528
That's good, Doug.
Good.

737
00:57:42,562 --> 00:57:44,771
Donovan...

738
00:57:44,806 --> 00:57:47,187
It's what he wants,
Celia.

739
00:57:47,222 --> 00:57:50,397
If he didn't, I would not
be able to do this.

740
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:55,541
Stop!

741
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:59,441
Goddamn it.

742
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,754
You can't just kill him.

743
00:58:01,788 --> 00:58:05,205
After what he did to you?
He deserves to die.

744
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,587
What about not playing God?

745
00:58:07,622 --> 00:58:12,558
Celia, he wants to die.
I'm just helping him along.Aah!

746
00:58:15,112 --> 00:58:16,423
See?

747
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:19,668
You're no better
than he is.

748
00:58:19,703 --> 00:58:23,327
You're a monster.
I don't need you.

749
00:58:23,361 --> 00:58:25,985
Get away from me!

750
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:28,401
OK, fine.

751
00:58:28,435 --> 00:58:33,130
I wish you all the luck
in the world on your own.

752
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:02,124
Oh.

753
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,955
Damn it.

754
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,864
What are you doing?

755
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:21,316
Stay back.
How did you get here?

756
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,732
Uh, I drove.

757
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:27,391
No. No, this...

758
00:59:27,425 --> 00:59:29,462
You shouldn't be here.

759
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:32,051
What are you talking about?

760
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:35,572
This isn't your light.
This is still mine.

761
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:38,402
You son of a bitch.
You used my light.

762
00:59:38,436 --> 00:59:42,613
My sanctuary saved you.
How is that fair?

763
00:59:42,648 --> 00:59:45,374
You are seriously
tweaked, lady.

764
00:59:46,444 --> 00:59:48,032
Whatever. I'm out.

765
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,142
Stop. It's moving
too fast.

766
00:59:54,176 --> 00:59:55,833
You're fucking crazy.

767
00:59:55,868 --> 00:59:59,492
This sanctuary
won't last.Sanctuary?

768
00:59:59,526 --> 01:00:02,219
You're dead, Doug.
You rapist.

769
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:05,774
You're dead, and that stuff you put in my drink
- it killed me,

770
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:08,018
and you're going to hell
for it.

771
01:00:08,052 --> 01:00:10,814
You're out of your mind.

772
01:00:10,848 --> 01:00:12,091
Look!

773
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:22,515
Ho... Holy shit!
What the fuck is happening?!

774
01:00:26,243 --> 01:00:30,247
Oh, shit! Get back. Shut the door.

775
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:33,975
What the hell
was that thing?

776
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:37,668
It's a long story. Do you have
your car keys on you?

777
01:00:37,703 --> 01:00:39,325
Where's it parked? In the lot.

778
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:43,363
Well, we have to get to it.I'm not going
anywhere with you.

779
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:45,676
What does your watch say?

780
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:47,333
1:37.

781
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:49,059
All right, come on.
I'll explain on the way.On the way to where?

782
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:51,475
To the hospital. The light
will be strong there.

783
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:56,066
There was an accident on the freeway today.
A lot of people were hurt.

784
01:00:59,586 --> 01:01:01,519
What now?

785
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,073
We jump.

786
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:06,352
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not jumping that far.

787
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:09,286
You're already dead.

788
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,985
Where? Which way?

789
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,022
It's around the corner.

790
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:36,762
Where is it?

791
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:38,902
It's the black one.

792
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:48,566
All right, let's go.

793
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:50,948
The car won't start.

794
01:01:50,983 --> 01:01:52,916
What's going on?
This shouldn't be happening.Oh, my God.

795
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,745
Let's go.

796
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,196
Cars don't work out here.
There's not enough power.

797
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,923
What are you talking about,
there's not enough power?

798
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:02,649
Aah! Aah!

799
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:04,686
Aah!

800
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,550
Aah!

801
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:10,071
Aah!

802
01:02:19,356 --> 01:02:21,841
Aah!

803
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:33,025
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

804
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:54,253
Oh, shit.

805
01:03:27,148 --> 01:03:30,185
C, it's me again.
Where are you?

806
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,608
I'm getting kind of
freaked out here.

807
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:43,129
Corby's being a jackass.
Surprise.

808
01:03:43,164 --> 01:03:45,960
What happened to us
not ditching?

809
01:03:45,994 --> 01:03:47,858
Hold on, it might be you.

810
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:51,793
God.

811
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,982
Hey there.

812
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:45,812
Hi.

813
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:47,504
Recognize me?

814
01:04:47,538 --> 01:04:51,888
From the pictures.
You're my father.

815
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,476
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you.

816
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:56,444
You were sick.

817
01:04:58,756 --> 01:05:01,311
This is my house.

818
01:05:01,345 --> 01:05:04,901
Yeah. I wanted you
to feel more comfortable.

819
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:06,488
Wanna sit down?

820
01:05:06,523 --> 01:05:08,352
No.

821
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:11,148
I'd like to get to know you.

822
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:14,151
Well, it's too late.

823
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:19,777
Celia, come give
your grandmother a hug.

824
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:26,577
How did you get here?

825
01:05:26,612 --> 01:05:30,685
I came to see you.
I was so lonely for you.

826
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:35,172
You must hurry, little one.
You must find the source.

827
01:05:37,243 --> 01:05:38,935
Grandma?

828
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,592
Celia...

829
01:05:41,627 --> 01:05:44,837
What did she say to you?

830
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:49,014
What are you gonna do to me? What do you think?

831
01:05:49,048 --> 01:05:50,739
You cannot stay here. Celia!

832
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:52,189
Just relax.We were connected.

833
01:05:52,224 --> 01:05:54,605
"Go home, Celia"? Now do you remember?

834
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,883
Help!

835
01:05:57,884 --> 01:06:01,164
Where am I?

836
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:04,408
Help! Help!

837
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:06,963
Somebody please help me.

838
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:10,138
Donovan!

839
01:06:12,244 --> 01:06:15,385
What seems to be
the problem?

840
01:06:15,419 --> 01:06:18,940
I can't take this anymore.

841
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,702
I'll do whatever
you want me to.

842
01:06:22,737 --> 01:06:25,050
Just please, please,

843
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:28,053
please make them stop.

844
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,611
It's for the best.

845
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:51,628
Go ahead.

846
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:08,645
Somebody help me! Oh, God!

847
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:11,786
Help! Somebody help!

848
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,997
Help me! Aah!
Somebody help me!

849
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,757
Help! Help!

850
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:20,760
Help me! Help!

851
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,486
Help!

852
01:07:26,387 --> 01:07:29,010
Who are those people?

853
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,357
You promised
you'd do what I say.

854
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:34,050
And you promised that things
would get better.

855
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:36,155
It's better down there
than being eaten

856
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,502
by those creatures,
don't you think?

857
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:42,472
And my guess is, much better
than eternal damnation.

858
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:45,509
I'm not going down there.
I'm not going to be one of them.

859
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:48,098
You have to trust me, Celia.

860
01:07:48,133 --> 01:07:50,376
I know what I'm talking about.

861
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:54,277
No. I trust me,
and I'm not going down there.

862
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,797
Why can't you see

863
01:07:57,832 --> 01:08:00,766
that I'm the one
with the power here?

864
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,457
Get away from me.

865
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:04,494
No. This is my house.

866
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:07,013
You will do what I say,
and you will like it.

867
01:08:07,048 --> 01:08:09,015
What do you want from me?

868
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,466
What would you get
if I go down there?

869
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:15,056
Your soul.

870
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:18,715
You're one of them.

871
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:21,511
No, I'm not one of them.

872
01:08:21,545 --> 01:08:24,859
I'm something more,
something different.

873
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,103
Their rules
don't apply to me.

874
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:29,139
I have sophisticated tastes,
Celia.

875
01:08:29,174 --> 01:08:32,211
Refined, you might say.

876
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:34,593
They're just sheep in my flock.

877
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:36,595
I'm watching them.

878
01:08:36,629 --> 01:08:40,150
For who?

879
01:08:44,982 --> 01:08:47,502
Looks like your sanctuary's
almost gone.

880
01:08:47,537 --> 01:08:49,504
Pretty soon, you're not
gonna be safe anywhere.

881
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,713
Stay away from me!

882
01:08:51,748 --> 01:08:54,958
I would, but I think I'm gonna
hold on to you for myself.

883
01:08:54,992 --> 01:08:58,996
Just a little secret between you,
me and the big guy.

884
01:09:03,587 --> 01:09:06,107
Watch your step!

885
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:16,669
Celia!

886
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,262
Why do you run, Celia?

887
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:28,543
Celia, I'm going to find you.

888
01:09:28,578 --> 01:09:31,995
Why don't you save us both
some time here?

889
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:41,177
I miss you, Celia.

890
01:09:55,743 --> 01:09:58,366
Find her. Now.

891
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:12,553
Aah!

892
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,739
Keep your hands
on it.

893
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:31,434
We better get the pen
and paper ready.

894
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:40,132
Oh, my God,
it's moving again.

895
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:42,962
Are you guys
writing this down?

896
01:10:42,997 --> 01:10:45,102
Don't miss any letters.

897
01:10:53,145 --> 01:10:55,699
No way.
Are you feeling this?

898
01:10:55,734 --> 01:10:57,701
Stop it, Goph.
I know it's you.

899
01:10:57,736 --> 01:11:01,015
Honey, it ain't me.
What's it say?

900
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:06,986
Rear b-a-t-h?

901
01:11:10,473 --> 01:11:12,198
Celia?

902
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:37,672
Aah!

903
01:11:40,813 --> 01:11:43,195
This can all be over,
you know.

904
01:11:43,229 --> 01:11:47,199
It won't be over.
I'll be stuck down there with those people.

905
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:48,959
At least
you won't be lonely.

906
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:52,238
Why didn't you
just kill me?

907
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:55,345
Because, Celia,
you weren't ready.

908
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,590
I consider the culinary experience an art form.

909
01:11:58,624 --> 01:12:01,593
I nurture the souls until they're just the way I like them.

910
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:03,698
Those people in the cellar?

911
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:07,012
All carefully cultivated,
just like you.

912
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,222
You're disgusting.

913
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:13,605
Am I? You know, it's a shame

914
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:15,986
that you died when you did.

915
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:18,472
I had so many places
to guide you,

916
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:21,337
so many things to acquire.

917
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:24,270
True love,

918
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:26,514
motherhood, pride.

919
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:28,999
Pride is my favorite.

920
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:31,312
So you were just
protecting me

921
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,419
so you could create
a perfect meal?

922
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:38,181
But now I'll just have to
work with what I've got.

923
01:12:38,215 --> 01:12:40,528
How about we start
with your laughter?

924
01:12:40,563 --> 01:12:43,669
Not much to laugh about
these days, anyway.

925
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:46,292
Such a small thing
to trade.

926
01:12:49,295 --> 01:12:52,333
And how about your loyalty?

927
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,922
Loyalty is quite a delicacy.

928
01:12:54,956 --> 01:12:59,582
And what need do you
have for it here? I will give you nothing.

929
01:12:59,616 --> 01:13:02,274
I'd be careful
about what you say.

930
01:13:02,308 --> 01:13:05,864
This can be painful,
or it can be easy.

931
01:13:05,898 --> 01:13:08,418
That is your only choice now.

932
01:13:08,453 --> 01:13:11,110
I will give you nothing!

933
01:13:14,459 --> 01:13:17,945
Aah!

934
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:21,258
Maybe I should be done
with all of this,

935
01:13:21,293 --> 01:13:23,295
hand you to them,

936
01:13:23,329 --> 01:13:25,297
cut my losses.

937
01:13:33,339 --> 01:13:35,376
What have you done?

938
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,034
Once your body leaves the sanctuary,
your soul goes with it.

939
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:42,245
Goodbye, Donovan.

940
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:45,697
We're losing her.
Get the defibrillator.

941
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,328
Interesting.

942
01:14:48,104 --> 01:14:52,384
You must hurry.
You must find the source.

943
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:56,353
You must stay in the sanctuary.
The door is there.

944
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,874
You were right here
this whole time.

945
01:15:39,362 --> 01:15:42,192
Celia, you've almost made it.
I'm so proud of you.

946
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:45,575
But you must prove yourself...
...know you can do it.

947
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,060
You're supposed to
be here with me.

948
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,754
Mom, what's happening?
I can barely understand you.

949
01:15:51,788 --> 01:15:55,240
The link is weak...
...must hurry.

950
01:15:55,274 --> 01:15:58,795
But you must first
save your grandpa.

951
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:00,694
I know you can do it.

952
01:16:00,728 --> 01:16:02,109
Mom, wait.

953
01:16:06,803 --> 01:16:09,565
Mom!

954
01:16:11,912 --> 01:16:13,534
One more test.

955
01:16:14,535 --> 01:16:16,606
One more test.

956
01:16:18,504 --> 01:16:20,127
Shit, six minutes.

957
01:16:20,161 --> 01:16:22,336
There's no one here.

958
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,303
There's no one left
for me to save.

959
01:16:24,338 --> 01:16:27,030
What do you want me to do?

960
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:34,590
1, 2, 3.

961
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,761
Aah!

962
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:11,834
Grandpa, no!
You don't need to do this.

963
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:14,560
Grandpa. Papa.

964
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:18,564
Please.

965
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:28,851
Aah!

966
01:17:33,131 --> 01:17:35,409
Poor little soul

967
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:38,792
wanting so badly
to get into heaven.

968
01:17:38,826 --> 01:17:42,588
OK, I'll give you
what you want.

969
01:17:42,623 --> 01:17:45,902
Really? What's the catch?

970
01:17:45,937 --> 01:17:48,077
No catch. A deal.

971
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:50,113
Keep talking.
I'm listening.

972
01:17:50,148 --> 01:17:54,255
I want you to free
my grandfather.

973
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:56,395
Take a look.
Your grandfather's gone.

974
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:59,329
No, no, he isn't.
I can see him in there.

975
01:17:59,364 --> 01:18:00,883
Stop lying to me.

976
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:03,920
All right,
suppose it is true.

977
01:18:03,955 --> 01:18:06,716
Suppose I really can
free him.

978
01:18:06,751 --> 01:18:10,271
What do I get
in exchange?

979
01:18:10,306 --> 01:18:12,239
Me.

980
01:18:12,273 --> 01:18:13,689
All of me.

981
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:16,588
Ah, that's tempting,
but it's unorthodox.

982
01:18:16,622 --> 01:18:19,246
I'm not a man
who makes deals.

983
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,801
Please, just this once,
for me.

984
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:24,803
You can take
anything you want.

985
01:18:24,838 --> 01:18:26,425
Anything?

986
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:41,130
Oh, that is nice.

987
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:44,996
First free my grandfather.All right.

988
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:21,101
Stay there, Gramps.
She's mine now. Walk away.

989
01:19:23,413 --> 01:19:25,484
Shall we begin?

990
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:50,406
Hey! Yaah!

991
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,339
Stay away from her!

992
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:56,792
That's definitely
a deal breaker, Gramps.

993
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,313
Aah!

994
01:20:03,764 --> 01:20:05,628
Come on, come on.

995
01:20:09,528 --> 01:20:11,185
Get in. Trust me.

996
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,121
What about your -No. You're the only father
I've ever had.

997
01:20:16,156 --> 01:20:17,916
We have to go.

998
01:20:17,951 --> 01:20:19,815
Celia... Go, go.

999
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:21,023
Go!

1000
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:23,404
This is my house, Celia.

1001
01:20:27,753 --> 01:20:31,205
Celia, come on.

1002
01:20:37,936 --> 01:20:40,007
Go, Grandpa.Come on.

1003
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:44,046
I'm your protector, Celia.

1004
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:49,223
No, you aren't,
and you never helped me.

1005
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:51,812
Come on.

1006
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,780
Goodbye, Donovan.

1007
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:31,153
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

1008
01:22:31,187 --> 01:22:33,672
I mean, you know,
the last time we used this thing...

1009
01:22:33,707 --> 01:22:36,020
Please.

1010
01:22:36,054 --> 01:22:38,125
All right.

1011
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:46,478
Yeah, you know, it probably
lost its power or something.

1012
01:22:51,276 --> 01:22:53,727
Holy... Shit.

1013
01:22:54,831 --> 01:22:57,179
Are you getting this? Yeah.

1014
01:23:29,694 --> 01:23:34,595
"When you die,
I will come for you. Celia."
