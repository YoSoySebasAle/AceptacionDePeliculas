1
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:16,084
- Yes sir, I understand.

2
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:19,920
I understand your
order did not arrive.

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,125
I owe you a box of
Fazzle Glue and I'm...

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,429
Yes, yes sir you, ah...

5
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,598
you have a wonderful
Fazzle Glue day.

6
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,466
Alright, bye bye.

7
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,939
- I'm gonna have
to fire you, Edwin.

8
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,742
Do you have that password
list I was asking you about?

9
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,979
Uh...

10
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,249
uh, yeah.

11
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,719
Yes sir, here.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,887
I'm not sure I understand.

13
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,090
- Well, what's
not to understand?

14
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:57,858
- I mean, I --

15
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,026
- We're downsizing.

16
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,261
Is this all of them?

17
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,163
- Yes sir, every one.

18
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:04,632
- Alright here is a box
for all of your stuff.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,736
- But I've been
here 21 years, sir.

20
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,572
- I know, time flies doesn't it?

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,177
- I was eligible for a
pension in four months.

22
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,911
- Like I said, really sorry.

23
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,414
So get all of your
things together.

24
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,151
Betty will have your
last check ready.

25
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,121
- Mr. Clark!

26
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,193
Yes, Edwin?

27
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,498
- Who's gonna do my job?

28
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,568
I Mean, there's a lot of
things going on, I've got...

29
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,240
Of course, your youngest is
qualified he can do that job.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,541
- Well look, who knows?

31
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,378
We may hire you back
once things pick up.

32
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:53,181
- Yeah would you? That'd
be great because y'know

33
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,915
I think the world of Fazzle Glue

34
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,150
and I'll be here all the time,

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,352
I'll work even
more harder and --

36
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,820
- Look.

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,556
I didn't mean
"more harder", I meant "harder".

38
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,725
You know what I mean.

39
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,926
Okay.

40
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,297
Alright I'm just gonna,

41
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,566
I'm just gonna go ahead and
clean out my stuff here.

42
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,600
- Eat it all up, Bernice, so
you'll be big just like me!

43
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,153
- You're home?

44
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,790
I must have lost track of time.

45
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,269
Hey.

46
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,273
- What's in the box?

47
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,775
- Just stuff from my work.

48
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,077
- What did they do, fire you?

49
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,148
Oh, well, well good.

50
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,416
You don't need them.

51
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,753
All they ever did was
take advantage of you.

52
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:46,954
- What happened?

53
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,088
- Mr. Clark says
they're downsizing,

54
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,323
it's just a temporary thing.

55
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,625
- Downsizing, what
a bunch of baloney.

56
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,697
- Well, what about your pension?

57
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,866
- For crying out loud,

58
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,101
you're not getting
your pension either?

59
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,637
- Daddy!

60
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,705
Hi, honey.

61
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,906
- What's in the box?

62
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,676
- Just stuff from Daddy's work.

63
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:11,044
Hey I got something for ya.

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,182
- Another stupid mug.

65
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,851
- That's the latest edition
Fazzle Glue mug, huh?

66
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,986
Cool.

67
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,390
Look, Mr. Clark said
he'll hire me back

68
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,425
just as soon as things pick up.

69
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,494
It's just temporary.

70
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,495
- What'd he say?

71
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,329
- He says it temporary, dad.

72
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,599
- Temporary, right.

73
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,266
- What's going on?

74
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,268
- Your dad got fired.

75
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,004
- Dad!

76
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:37,938
- What?

77
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,973
You got fired, she asked.

78
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,981
What happened to your hair?

79
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,150
- I decided it was
time for a change.

80
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,185
- It looks like a wig.

81
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,954
- Coming from someone who wears

82
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,890
a Halloween costume everyday.

83
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,359
- Liberty Bell.

84
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,130
- Dad what are you eating?

85
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,466
- Chinese food.

86
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,200
- That's been in the
fridge for over a week!

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,269
- Week smeek.

88
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,272
It's got so much MSG in it
to last for over a year!

89
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,420
- Bad day?

90
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,457
- Yeah, a little.

91
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:33,861
I just need to do my
exercises more often.

92
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,000
So, are you doin' homework?

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,503
- Yeah, well it's the only way

94
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,873
I'll ever get out of here, so.

95
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,780
- Hey!

96
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,817
- I'm going to put all
my crayons in my new mug.

97
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,125
Okay, Yellow...

98
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,293
hm.

99
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:10,864
Blue, Black...

100
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,600
what is this color?

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,603
- Oh let me see it, pumpkin.

102
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,343
- That's all you
have to do, mom,

103
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,848
is stop it from shaking and
everything will be alright.

104
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,483
See?

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,142
Kinda, little thing
there.

106
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,145
Sorry about that.

107
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,581
- Your wife's
appointment was at 12.

108
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,851
- Uh no, it's uh, no.

109
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,186
It was one o'clock,
I'm quite sure.

110
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,989
- No it was 12.

111
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,357
You'll have to reschedule.

112
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,359
- Uh no its uh, no.

113
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,161
It was one o'clock,
I'm quite sure.

114
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,462
- No it was 12.
- It's okay.

115
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,965
We can come back another time.

116
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,868
- Look, I've got the card right
there, it says one o'clock.

117
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,070
- No, you must
have changed this.

118
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,838
- I didn't change that.

119
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,240
- We'll come back another
day, it's alright.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,341
- No, Jen I got this.

121
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,610
Look, I didn't change this.

122
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,012
- I'm sorry, you'll
have to reschedule.

123
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,283
I'm not leaving here until
I see Dr. White today.

124
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,787
Your not seeing him today.

125
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,489
Dr. White's office,
how may I assist you?

126
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,561
Hold on one moment.

127
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,166
- You must be the doctor.

128
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,702
- Yes, I must be.

129
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:58,305
- Look, our family has just
been through a major crisis

130
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,208
and your incompetent staff
messed up our appointment.

131
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,542
- You need to hold
on there, missy.

132
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,111
Back off, lady.

133
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,880
- It's okay, it's okay.

134
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,549
- As I was saying, my mother
needs to see you today.

135
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,119
Okay, okay.

136
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,994
- Put that down, put it down.

137
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:27,034
- So, your condition seems to
be getting worse with time.

138
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,902
Okay, arms up please.

139
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,572
And down, okay.

140
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,542
And are you still taking
the same medications?

141
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:40,113
- Well my husbands insurance
was changed back in April?

142
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,949
- Yeah, the medications
were costing

143
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,483
more than our mortgage payment.

144
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,985
- Hold on one second.

145
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,822
Sarah would you come in
here one moment, please?

146
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,558
Okay now insurance
companies and I,

147
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,828
we haven't been getting
along very well these days.

148
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,798
I want you to put Mrs.
Durshman on the list

149
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,933
for new Parkinson's
medication please.

150
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,734
- Yes, doctor.

151
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,703
- Okay, thank you.

152
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,937
Okay, there is a new drug.

153
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,640
It has not been released
yet and pharmaceutical

154
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,911
companies are offering it for
free, to selected patients.

155
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,479
- Wow are you serious doctor?

156
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,147
That's fantastic.

157
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,616
- It's done very well
in clinical studies.

158
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,951
I really think this
is gonna make you

159
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,253
feel a lot better,
improve your function.

160
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,023
- That's wonderful, thank you.

161
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,226
- Yes doctor, thank you
so much, that's great.

162
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,844
- Oh, can I say grace?

163
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,713
Of course you can.

164
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,317
- Thank you God, for the
food we are about to eat.

165
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,019
Oh, Amen.

166
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,354
- And God, could you
please help Edwin here

167
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,124
find another job?

168
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,192
God knows he could use the help.

169
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,728
- I can hear you,
dad, I'm right here.

170
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,962
- What?

171
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,931
It never hurts to
ask, you never know.

172
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,066
- You're preaching, not asking.

173
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,878
Dad.

174
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,347
Dad!

175
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,214
- What?

176
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,482
- You're grunting.

177
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,417
- I am not a grunt.

178
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,187
- I didn't say you were a grunt

179
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,023
I said you were making
grunting noises.

180
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,291
- Now, look.

181
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,895
You make me get food
all over Grandma's urn.

182
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,997
- I don't know why you insist
on eating with that thing.

183
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,732
- You know she
goes wherever I go.

184
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,102
- Grandpa even takes her
with him to go potty.

185
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,937
- Right you are, young lady.

186
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,639
Wherever I go your
Grandmother goes.

187
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,278
- Okay that is not Grandma,
that is Grandma's ashes.

188
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,446
- You take that back.

189
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,918
Where is she going?

190
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,421
- I'm going back to my
bedroom to eat dinner

191
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,291
where there is some
peace and quiet.

192
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,562
- I'll get it.

193
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,899
- Would you let me buy a new one

194
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,634
or at least unplug
it while we eat?

195
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,636
- I got it.

196
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,907
It just sticks once in
a while, it'll be fine!

197
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,350
Dad, why can't we just take her

198
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,787
and give her a proper burial
like normal people would?

199
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,056
- We will when I can
remember where the tree.

200
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,091
- What tree?

201
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,894
- Oh it's, um, the tree where

202
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,865
Grandma and Grandpa
carved their names in.

203
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,634
- They carved their
names in a tree?

204
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,202
- Mm-hm!

205
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,271
It's what people did back then.

206
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,639
- Don't do that now
or you'll get arrested

207
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,341
for destroying a tree.

208
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,177
- It doesn't destroy the tree.

209
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,847
- It doesn't help it.

210
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,823
- "My dearest William,
it's been only three weeks,

211
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,425
"yet it feels like an eternity.

212
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,495
"I pray your job is
not too much for you

213
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,731
"and cannot wait for you to
return and come back to me.

214
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,870
"Three years is such a long
time for us to be apart.

215
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,905
"I'm afraid I have
some bad news,

216
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,774
"my father has been
offered a job overseas.

217
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,345
"I'm not sure if he's
gonna take the job

218
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:36,216
"but if he does I fear we
will be even further apart.

219
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,386
"I don't know how I
will get through this.

220
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,257
"I regret having to
share this bad news

221
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,226
"but I feel you must know.

222
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,395
"The only thing
I can do is pray.

223
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,364
"Pray that we will
be together again.

224
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,368
"I must now conclude as my
eyes have welled with tears,

225
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,605
"with a heavy heart,
your true love, Beth."

226
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,333
- Oh, very nice.

227
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,702
- Good morning, girls.

228
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,405
And to you.

229
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,243
- Do you like my face I made?

230
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,578
- Best face ever.

231
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,480
- Can you go wake up
your sister, please?

232
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,082
- Sure!

233
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,987
Don't mind if I do.

234
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,038
You know, I've been thinking.

235
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,875
We need to catch up on all
the repairs around this place.

236
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,512
See, like that!

237
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,182
I finally have time to do things
like fix the kitchen table

238
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,351
while I'm waiting for them
to call me back to work.

239
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,053
Observe!

240
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,999
See what I mean?

241
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,433
I am number one.

242
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,768
Fix kitchen table.

243
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,493
- Did you wake your sister?

244
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,630
- Mm-hm!

245
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,833
- Dad, you feeling okay?

246
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,169
- I'm fine, it's alright.

247
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,873
- Well, where is she?

248
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,549
- I'll get her.

249
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,051
Liberty!

250
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,524
Liberty!

251
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,429
Hey, Lib?

252
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,808
Hey, come on, honey,
your mom made pancakes.

253
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,910
- I'm not hungry.

254
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,795
- Are you having an attack?

255
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,130
- Yeah.

256
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,299
- Focus on my hand, Jen.

257
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,701
Focus.

258
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,239
Keep focusing.

259
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,451
Good, good.

260
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,099
- Hey, don't worry about that.

261
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,567
I'm gonna get that fixed today.

262
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,670
- Great, now he's a plumber?

263
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,273
Awesome way to
start my vacation.

264
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,208
- What was that?

265
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,944
- I think you should
call a plumber, dad.

266
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,080
- Oh, okay.

267
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,022
- I'll be out in a minute, okay?

268
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,303
Where is she?

269
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,373
- She's in the bathroom.

270
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,176
Oh, well here she is, everybody.

271
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,984
Okay, ready?

272
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,190
Oh my gosh!

273
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,126
- What are you doing?

274
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:47,994
- I'm --

275
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,096
- No no, stop wiping.

276
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,734
Don't wash her down the drain!

277
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,076
- I got it.

278
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,499
Dad.

279
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,268
- Yeah?

280
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,935
- I think we should
take Grandma's urn

281
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,938
to the tree and bury
her ashes there.

282
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,308
- Well, it's a great
idea but Grandpa doesn't

283
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,910
remember exactly where
the tree is anymore.

284
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,111
Do you, dad?

285
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,882
- I can't remember much
of anything anymore.

286
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,785
- Wait, I have Grandma
and Grandpa's letters.

287
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,721
There has to be something
about the tree in there.

288
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,955
- What letters?

289
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,925
- The ones Grandma gave
to me before she died.

290
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,627
- She gave you letters?

291
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,663
I don't remember any letters.

292
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,598
- Can you get 'em?

293
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,266
- Yeah, I have a box of them.

294
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,736
- Do you remember
anything about letters?

295
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,038
- No.

296
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,695
- The tree has to be
mentioned in here somewhere.

297
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,268
- Do you remember
these at all, dad?

298
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,070
- No.

299
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,747
Could you, please?

300
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,051
- "My dearest William,

301
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,220
"I'm so happy to inform
you that my father

302
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,658
"turned down the offer
to move us overseas.

303
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,361
"I prayed every night and
God must have heard me

304
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,863
"because we are now
staying here at home."

305
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:37,997
- She must have
prayed awful hard

306
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:41,300
and God answered her prayers.

307
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,669
If they had have moved, then

308
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,138
that would have
been the end of us.

309
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,275
Please, can you go on?

310
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:53,112
- "I go the tree once a
week, I know it sounds silly

311
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,648
"but it makes me feel
like I am with you."

312
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:59,486
- Dad, that's the
tree, do you remember?

313
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,288
- "It's a bit of a ride
on my bicycle to Two River

314
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,958
"but when I am there I
can feel your presence.

315
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,627
"I think I will write my letters

316
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,430
"to you when I'm
here at the tree."

317
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,848
- I remember that tree.

318
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,184
It's about an hours
walk from her house.

319
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,221
It only seemed like five minutes

320
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,223
when I was with you Grandmother.

321
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,626
- Yeah, but the tree
is in Two River.

322
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,160
- Do you even know
where that is?

323
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,563
- Not exactly, but
it can't be very far

324
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,865
from Grandpa's old
house, remember, dad?

325
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,436
- I'm sure we can find it.

326
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:52,739
- Well okay, that's
what we should do.

327
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,541
We should get in the car
and drive out to Two River

328
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,775
and bury your Grandma.

329
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:58,110
- I couldn't ride
that long in the car.

330
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,046
- We can take the RV.

331
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,716
I'm off work, the
kids are on break.

332
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,052
We can make a mini
vacation out of it.

333
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,820
- I need my flashlight!

334
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,456
My sleeping bag!

335
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:10,690
My blanket!

336
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,958
My teddy bear!

337
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,761
I just need everything,
we're going to the tree!

338
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,231
We're going to the tree.

339
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,001
We're going
to the tree.

340
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,681
- Come on!

341
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,325
Haha! Haha!

342
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,333
Come on, Earnest, you
have to be real quiet!

343
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:37,610
- Do you wanna to read
another letter, sweetie?

344
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,484
- This one Grandpa wrote.

345
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,153
"My Darling Beth,

346
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,389
"I can't believe how long the
days and nights have become.

347
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,091
"I realized there
was a chance that

348
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:56,062
"we would never hold each other
again and I almost gave up.

349
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:58,631
"But what kind of man would I
be if I didn't do everything

350
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:02,468
"humanly possible to be by
your side 'til the day I die?

351
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,573
"I am so pleased
that you are not moving.

352
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,842
"You really have no idea what
that would have done to me.

353
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,477
"Another month has ended
and we are that much

354
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,914
"closer to being in
each others arms.

355
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:18,150
"I have a busy day tomorrow
and the night is late.

356
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,887
"I look forward to your
next precious letter.

357
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,822
"You are forever in my dreams.

358
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,725
"Your
true love, Will."

359
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,195
- That was really nice, dad.

360
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,201
What ever happened to that guy?

361
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,135
- Honey!

362
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,804
- No, really, I wanna hear this.

363
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,105
What ever happened
to that young man?

364
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,807
- He grew up.

365
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,374
- What do you mean "he grew up"?

366
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,310
- He was a kid,

367
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,779
then life hits you
in the keister.

368
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,682
But you, you have it easy.

369
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,851
- What, who has it easy?

370
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,252
- You do.

371
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,486
- Oh, I have it easy?

372
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,623
- You most certainly do.

373
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,890
- Well, you know what dad?

374
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,325
I don't think I do have it easy.

375
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,594
In fact, I think
I have it harder.

376
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:03,796
- You know what your problem is?

377
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,732
- No, what's my problem?

378
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,135
- You care more about
that stupid Glue company

379
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:12,471
than you do your own
wonderful daughters.

380
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,173
- Alright now,
I've heard enough.

381
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,075
First of all,

382
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,645
Fazzle Glue is not stupid.

383
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,013
And secondly, they named
me employee of the year

384
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,082
21 years, straight.

385
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,685
That's an accomplishment, dad!

386
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,687
- I'm done talking to you.

387
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:30,690
- Well, you know what?

388
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,624
You know what's ridiculous?

389
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:32,892
I'll tell you what's ridiculous.

390
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:36,062
You carrying around that
stupid urn all the time.

391
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,698
We can't take you
anywhere with that thing.

392
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,005
Was that Ernest?

393
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,608
Are you kidding me?

394
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,233
Oh my gosh!

395
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,143
- We can't do this
trip with Ernest.

396
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,445
We should turn around.

397
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,648
- We can't go back now,
we've gone like 200 miles.

398
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,351
I don't know why you
even let her have

399
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,786
a goat in the first place!

400
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:37,589
- Oh, that was just
as much your idea!

401
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,859
- Originally, I said no goat.

402
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,062
Where is she going now?

403
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,477
Jen, sit down.

404
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:05,451
- Jen, focus on my hand.

405
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,221
- I'm calling 911.

406
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,326
Focus.

407
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:24,070
Yeah, that's good, focus.

408
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,247
911,
what's your emergency?

409
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,715
Oh, hi.

410
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,383
No, um.

411
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,285
No, we're okay.

412
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,354
We're fine now
thanks, sorry, sorry.

413
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,732
- Why do you always
have to do what I do?

414
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,743
I can't
believe you brought Ernest.

415
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,113
- He gets lonely.

416
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,422
- Alright.

417
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,727
Jessie!

418
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,663
Goats don't eat jellybeans.

419
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,671
Alright.

420
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:51,650
- Hey, I think I may
have found something.

421
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,485
This one is from Grandma.

422
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,054
"My dearest William,

423
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,956
"as I was making
my way here today

424
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:59,992
"I noticed some men
surveying Jack's property.

425
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,793
"Word around town is
that they are putting

426
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,231
"in a new highway not
too far from here."

427
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:09,135
- We had to go through Jack's
property to get to that tree.

428
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,839
But I'm having trouble
remembering the highway.

429
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,407
I'm gonna
go check on Ernest.

430
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,409
- Okay, pumpkin.

431
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,581
- It's all coming
back to me now.

432
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,084
I know exactly where it is!

433
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,620
- You guys, Ernest is gone!

434
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,427
- He's down there.

435
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,997
- I'll go get him.

436
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,099
- I'm coming with.

437
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:57,349
- Mom says you're
doing well at school.

438
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,617
- Yup.

439
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,988
- You thought about what you
might wanna do after that?

440
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:03,155
- Yup.

441
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,094
Well, I'm
sorry it's so rough for you.

442
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,596
You
sound like Grandpa.

443
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,501
You're right,
I do sound just like him.

444
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,969
- Sorry about your job.

445
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:19,638
I know that place really
meant a lot to you.

446
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,143
- Well, hopefully
they'll call soon.

447
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,778
- What did you do there anyway?

448
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,780
- You never knew
what I did for work?

449
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,382
- No.

450
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,284
- I was in charge of
all the product orders.

451
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,720
- And you did this for how long?

452
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,822
- 21 years and eight months.

453
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,126
- That's longer than
I've been on this planet!

454
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,163
- Yup, and you know what?

455
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:47,099
When you were born they
gave me the whole week off.

456
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,536
- Wow, that must have
been real nice of them.

457
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,272
- That was real nice of them!

458
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:56,775
You know, I don't know what I
did to make you so miserable.

459
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,977
Honestly, what did I do?

460
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,713
- You didn't do anything,
that's the point.

461
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,717
All you ever do is talk
about that stupid company!

462
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,992
- I do talk about
that place a lot.

463
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,097
I was never really
good at anything.

464
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:22,268
I struggled in school, I
didn't have a lot of friends.

465
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:25,637
And then they gave me all the
products and all the orders

466
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:29,141
and finally I was good
at something, you know?

467
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,214
- And then they ripped the
rug out from under you.

468
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,919
- Sounds like he's
getting further away.

469
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,657
- We have to go find him.

470
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,828
- I'll wait here in
case he comes back.

471
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,097
Go ahead.

472
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:53,565
- Okay let's go find him.

473
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,869
- Where is this goat?

474
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,439
- Ernest!

475
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,041
- Ernest.

476
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,411
- Ernest!

477
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:08,514
- Oh hey, looks like your mom
and Jessie are looking too.

478
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,915
Hey!

479
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,450
- Daddy!

480
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,455
- Hey pumpkin, no luck, huh?

481
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,391
- No, we have to find him.

482
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,792
- Don't worry, we'll find him.

483
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,994
- Have you guys
heard him lately?

484
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,796
- No, not for a while.

485
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,605
- Look!

486
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,907
It's Ernest's poop!

487
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,113
This is definitely Ernest's!

488
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,116
He can't be far.

489
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,220
- Ew, Jessie that's disgusting.

490
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,722
- Yeah, it sure does
look like Ernest's poop,

491
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:54,326
but let's put it back on the
ground, okay?

492
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,433
- Ernest!

493
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:04,102
- Ernest!

494
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,174
Ernest!

495
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,524
- Alright, go with Mommy.

496
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:26,925
Come on.

497
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,970
- No luck, huh?

498
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,972
- No.

499
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,175
We're gonna have to
stay here for the night.

500
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:46,845
I'm gonna go ahead and
get the camper locked up.

501
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,217
Ernest!

502
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,786
Ernest!

503
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,452
- Everything okay?

504
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:30,522
- Yeah I was just getting
the camper set for the night.

505
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,896
- We have to find Ernest.

506
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,233
Jessie will be
crushed if we don't.

507
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,502
- I know.

508
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,010
Let's get some sleep.

509
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,812
- It's all my fault.

510
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,747
- No dad, it's not your fault.

511
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,082
- If I hadn't --

512
00:36:57,082 --> 00:37:00,185
- Really dad, it's okay.

513
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:04,323
- We'll get up in the
morning and Ernest will be

514
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:08,460
right at that door waiting to
be fed, like he always does.

515
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,297
- I'm sure you're right.

516
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:16,302
- Come here, give me your hands.

517
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,941
Dear Lord, once we
embark on this journey

518
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:27,145
to finally put our
beloved Grandmother,

519
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,482
mother and bride to rest,

520
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:33,218
please be with us in days ahead.

521
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,421
And please Lord,

522
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:39,825
bring Ernest back safely.

523
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:40,792
Amen.

524
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,227
- Amen.

525
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,474
- Did you hear Ernest?

526
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,642
- Yeah, I did.

527
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,914
- Eddie, I saw a bob
cat a little earlier.

528
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,283
- I know, me too.

529
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,355
- We're just gonna have to
wait 'til in the morning.

530
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,459
Have a little faith,
he'll come back.

531
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,028
- Okay.

532
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,205
- Ernest?

533
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,475
- Ernest!

534
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,365
- What are you doing?
You're scaring him off!

535
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,301
Grab the rope.

536
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,434
Good job!

537
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,044
- Hey, how about another letter?

538
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,385
- "My dearest Will,

539
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,822
"I have enclosed a
photograph of myself."

540
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,195
- Wait, she sent you a picture?

541
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,034
- "It's been a warm summer,
I've taken a part time job

542
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:39,304
"to save up for when you
come home from your break.

543
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,073
"See you soon, your
true love, Beth."

544
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,210
- I would not wanna
leave a pretty girl

545
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,645
like that all alone.

546
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,746
- Well I can't just
marry her without

547
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:50,315
a house for her to live in.

548
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,018
I'm saving up every penny.

549
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,020
- To each his own.

550
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,295
- Is that the photo?

551
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,909
Wow, dad!

552
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:20,812
You must have been a happy man!

553
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,482
Bring back any memories?

554
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,827
- What's wrong?

555
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,395
- I trusted him.

556
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,267
- Trusted who?

557
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:44,402
- He's getting his memory back.

558
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,739
- I used to read my
letter to someone

559
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,375
I thought was my friend.

560
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,547
- You shared these
letters with your friend?

561
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:59,117
- Yes, I did.

562
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,253
He didn't have anyone.

563
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:05,591
I guess I felt sorry for him.

564
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,695
- Why on earth would you
share that with anyone?

565
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,229
- Be nice!

566
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:16,868
- I stopped once I saw how he
looked at her in these photos.

567
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,406
- Sorry dad, I didn't
mean to upset you.

568
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:25,343
- I don't wanna hear any
more of those letters.

569
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,989
- Seven-eights.

570
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,763
- You know, I've
never been to Tucson.

571
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:47,799
It's not exactly Tucson,
it's further south.

572
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,203
- Hey um, I think you should
get out from under there.

573
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:54,572
This piece of wood, it
doesn't look too safe.

574
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,541
I'm almost done.

575
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:00,078
Hey, is the 1516's in there?

576
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,385
So,
is that where she lives?

577
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,788
- That's where we'll live.

578
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:19,097
I need the clamp.

579
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:21,299
Clamp!

580
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:22,500
Ah, yeah.

581
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:26,772
Will?

582
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,274
Will, Will!

583
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,275
Help!

584
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,072
We almost lost you there.

585
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,820
- He's your brother?

586
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,521
- A friend.

587
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:58,096
He's gonna be okay, right?

588
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:02,200
- He's in a coma and he's
suffered severe head trauma.

589
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,972
I don't wanna alarm you
but I think the best thing

590
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:10,075
you can do is say
a prayer for him.

591
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:15,046
I've seen God do some
wonderful things.

592
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,404
Sam's going into surgery.

593
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:14,873
I need to tell you
there's a chance that he

594
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:15,773
may not make it.

595
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,057
"My dearest Will,

596
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:35,026
"I know you are very busy but
I have written two letters

597
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:37,195
"and have yet to
receive a response.

598
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:38,997
"I hope that you are well.

599
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:40,765
"Please call me on
Thursday of next week

600
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:42,467
"at eight o'clock PM.

601
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,103
"Forever yours, Beth."

602
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:00,051
- Waiting for a phone call?

603
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:02,854
- Uh yeah, a friend
needs help with homework.

604
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,189
- Homework?

605
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:05,723
It's summer.

606
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:09,760
- Uh, she's taking
a summer class.

607
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,164
- Don't forget to turn out the
light when you're done, okay?

608
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,832
- Okay, I won't.

609
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:39,424
- Beth, why are you
sleeping in here, honey?

610
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:41,592
- I must have fallen asleep.

611
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:45,130
- Well it's almost 11 o'clock,
come on, let's get to bed.

612
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:31,209
- Where are we?

613
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,677
- Something's wrong
with the camper.

614
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:35,981
I'm looking for a place to stop,
a gas station or something.

615
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:40,518
- But we're in the
middle of nowhere.

616
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:26,964
- Oh, great!

617
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,133
It's overheated.

618
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:31,369
- Is it something you can fix?

619
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,938
- I'm sure I can figure it out.

620
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:34,872
Ow!

621
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,476
Have to let it cool down first.

622
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,867
You're not getting
away this time!

623
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,273
What do you think of that, huh?

624
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,041
Alright, here is your food.

625
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:48,346
Alright, you stick around here.

626
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,757
It's an amazing view.

627
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:06,063
I'm proud of you, you know.

628
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,798
- What do you mean?

629
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,935
- I was never very
good in school.

630
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:13,338
So I made Fazzle Glue
my life's mission.

631
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:17,308
- It's just a transition,
you'll find something better.

632
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,853
So what's wrong with the RV?

633
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:31,656
- Ah, the radiator
hose has a leak.

634
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:35,193
- Anything?

635
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:37,195
- Yeah, surprisingly
I have one bar.

636
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,796
- Are you gonna call for help?

637
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,231
- Yep.

638
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,203
- Are those the keys?

639
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,673
- Yep.

640
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,112
- That's weird, I didn't
hear them hit the bottom.

641
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,115
- No, neither did I.

642
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,385
Oh hey, I see 'em!

643
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:02,387
I think I could reach that.

644
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:11,128
- Oh, you're close,
you're an inch away.

645
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,769
You dropped them.

646
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:22,006
- Yep.

647
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,243
I dropped them.

648
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:28,813
- Now are you gonna
call for help?

649
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,984
- Well, I guess so.

650
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,088
Only, now I have no bars.

651
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:41,125
- Great!

652
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:45,830
- Great!

653
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:02,413
- What are they doing out there?

654
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:05,983
- Maybe they're
just taking a break.

655
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,028
- Daddy!

656
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:22,867
- Oh!

657
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,202
- What are you guys doing?

658
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,005
- Dad dropped the
keys in that well.

659
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:30,575
- Cool!

660
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:32,677
- No, not cool, pumpkin.

661
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,245
Daddy was careless.

662
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:37,081
- That's one way of putting it.

663
00:53:41,486 --> 00:53:42,920
- Are you taking a break?

664
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,391
- Daddy dropped the keys
down that old well out there.

665
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,428
- You dropped the keys to
the camper down that well?

666
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:52,129
- Yes dad, I did.

667
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,732
- Well, what are you gonna do?

668
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,402
- I'm gonna get the keys.

669
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:59,670
- I'm just curious,
how does someone

670
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,173
drop keys down a well?

671
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,343
- Don't need it right now, dad.

672
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,290
Let it video,

673
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,327
drop my phone down the well,

674
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:24,995
see right where the keys are.

675
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,832
- Can't we just call someone?

676
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:31,802
- Mom's phone doesn't
have any signal either.

677
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:37,542
- How far off the
main highway are we?

678
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:50,755
- Honey, can you check
your phone for a signal?

679
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:51,756
- Nothing.

680
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:54,091
Look, I got this okay?

681
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,062
- And we're recording.

682
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:02,600
Here we go.

683
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,310
Okay, that's it hit the bottom.

684
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:22,953
- So what are you gonna do once
you see the keys down there?

685
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,356
- Please, dad, I'm trying
to concentrate, okay?

686
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:28,125
- Ew, gotta be
snakes down there.

687
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,927
- Cool.

688
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:32,597
- Alright that's
enough, do you think?

689
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,601
Let's see what we got.

690
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:49,847
- Oh, there they are!

691
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:50,915
- Yeah.

692
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:52,817
- At the bottom of the well.

693
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:56,787
- And not in his pocket
where they're supposed to be.

694
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,890
- Let's climb down there, dad.

695
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:06,330
- Hey, grab me a
hanger from the camper.

696
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,365
- Well what do you think
you're gonna do now?

697
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,967
- I'm gonna make a
hook out of the hanger,

698
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,969
slip it through the
rope, drop it down there

699
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,838
to the bottom and grab the keys.

700
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:15,873
- That'll never work.

701
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,576
- Hello!

702
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:21,446
- Be careful, pumpkin.

703
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:23,380
- So are you going
to explain to me

704
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,217
exactly how you put
us in this situation?

705
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,420
- The keys fell out
of my pocket, okay?

706
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,456
- How did the keys fall
out of your pocket?

707
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:34,091
- They just did.

708
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,193
- In all the years
I've worn trousers I've

709
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:39,797
never had keys just
fly out of my pocket.

710
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:43,501
Maybe a coin or
two, but never keys!

711
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:45,002
- They were at the
top of my pocket

712
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,604
and they just
pulled out and fell.

713
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:49,006
- Normal people usually
put something important

714
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:52,577
like car keys deep
inside their pocket,

715
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:53,844
not on top.

716
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,145
- Well maybe I'm not normal.

717
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,581
- That's an understatement.

718
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:58,949
- Oh, now that's
teamwork, high five!

719
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,417
Just me, okay.

720
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:07,492
Okay.

721
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,661
Lower it down.

722
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:16,901
There at the bottom.

723
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,703
- You'll never see anything
down there, it's pitch black!

724
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:20,437
- Dad, please!

725
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,775
- Okay, go on and
do your own thing.

726
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,043
- I hear 'em!

727
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,013
- Yeah, me too.

728
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,848
- There it is
again, you got 'em!

729
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:33,518
- Yeah, I think so.

730
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,385
Woohoo.

731
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:41,626
- Told you that'd never work.

732
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:43,093
- I'm just gonna
have to try again.

733
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:46,130
I'm going
back to the camper.

734
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:47,725
- There's something
I wanted to tell you.

735
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:50,795
They're looking for
guys to work on a ranch.

736
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:52,029
I can make enough money to put

737
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,231
a nice down-payment
on a house for us.

738
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:55,566
- A house for us?

739
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,401
- Yeah.

740
00:58:57,401 --> 00:59:01,405
But the ranch is in New Mexico.

741
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:04,108
- New Mexico?

742
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:06,376
How long will you be gone?

743
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,313
- That depends, the
longer I contract for,

744
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:12,583
the more money I
can make per day.

745
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,856
- Is it for a couple of months?

746
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:22,526
- No, no it's not for
a couple of months.

747
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,464
It's for three years.

748
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:29,834
- Three years?

749
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,241
- I know it...

750
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,276
- That's a long time, Will.

751
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:40,778
Three years.

752
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:45,616
- I'll be able to come home
when the seasons break.

753
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,319
Beth, what kind
of man would I be

754
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,421
if I can't make a life for us?

755
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:55,425
- It looks like you've
made up your mind.

756
00:59:56,994 --> 01:00:00,731
- When I come back, Beth.

757
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:03,533
Then we'll get married.

758
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:09,674
You do wanna get married?

759
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:12,743
- Yes, I want that
more than anything.

760
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,244
- Well then, why are --

761
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,814
- Three years?

762
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:20,350
- Three years is
really not that long.

763
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,196
- Oh, I have one bar!

764
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,464
Who should I call?

765
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,067
Oh, I know, I'll search
for a towing company.

766
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,836
- Yeah, good idea.

767
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,343
I've lost
the signal again!

768
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,914
- Daddy you can lower me down
there and I can grab the keys!

769
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:53,650
- We are not lowering
you down there.

770
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,087
You know what, pumpkin?

771
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:59,589
Let's go back to the camper.

772
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,026
- But I wanna go
down in the well!

773
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:04,628
- That's just not
gonna happen, okay?

774
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:07,164
- You know, she hardly
weighs anything.

775
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:10,034
I can lower her
down really slowly.

776
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:13,003
She grabs the keys
and we're gone.

777
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:18,208
- We are not lowering
her down there!

778
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:21,011
- Please, Mom!

779
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,346
- What possibly could happen?

780
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:26,516
- She falls, that's
what happens!

781
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,652
- I won't fall, Mom!

782
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:29,887
- No, I've got a great idea.

783
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:31,455
Hold on, I'll be right back.

784
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:35,559
- Maybe I should get Grandpa.

785
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,864
- Everything will be okay, Mom.

786
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:52,709
- Okay pumpkin, are you ready
for our super secret mission?

787
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,944
- Yes!

788
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:57,114
- Okay, come on over here.

789
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:30,314
- Have you lost your mind?

790
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:31,581
- Oh, someone doesn't look

791
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,084
too thrilled about
your little plan.

792
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:40,024
- Okay, ready?

793
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,126
Put your foot in there.

794
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,846
- Have you lost your mind?

795
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:09,786
- How are you doing
down there, pumpkin?

796
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:14,258
I guess she's okay.

797
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,644
- Are you at the bottom?

798
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,146
- Yes!

799
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:40,084
- Do you see the keys?

800
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,460
- I got them!

801
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,936
- Looks like we got company.

802
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:10,915
- Okay, I'm going to need
you to be really quiet

803
01:04:10,915 --> 01:04:11,848
for a minute, okay?

804
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,617
Shh quiet, super secret mission.

805
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,319
- Okay!

806
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:18,188
Shh, super secret mission.

807
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:21,125
- Howdy, folks.

808
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,326
- Hi.

809
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:31,268
- So uh, what are you
all doing out here?

810
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:34,471
- Uh, we just had a little
engine trouble, you know?

811
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:37,774
- Hm, engine troubles, huh?

812
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:41,011
- Yeah, it over-heated a bit.

813
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:43,580
- Did you need me to
call you a tow truck?

814
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,582
We can get one out
here right away.

815
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:46,816
- No, no, no.

816
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:47,651
Are you
sure? It's no trouble.

817
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:49,119
- No, we're good now.

818
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,788
I mean, it's under control.

819
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:54,191
We're just letting it
cool down.

820
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:57,227
- Okay, if you need
anything, give us a call.

821
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,162
You have a safe trip.

822
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:00,697
- Okay, bye bye now.

823
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,238
- You still got
hold of that rope?

824
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,740
Of course I do.

825
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:21,952
- Okay, are you
ready to come up?

826
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:24,088
- She's gonna be
heavier coming up.

827
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:26,323
We don't want you to drop her.

828
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:57,121
- That was fun,
can we do it again?

829
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,493
That was so much fun.

830
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,662
I was on the rope and you,

831
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:08,532
I could hear you yelling
"grab the keys in the dirt!"

832
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:11,835
It was so much fun!

833
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:14,271
- Mm-hm, yeah.

834
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:20,044
- There's your problem,
the hose got a leak in it.

835
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:22,446
Give me a screwdriver
and a sharp knife.

836
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:23,647
- I got this, dad.

837
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,083
- Stop with that "I got this."

838
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,818
Get the screwdriver and knife.

839
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:33,757
- How's it going out there?

840
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:35,892
- We'll get it figured out.

841
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:38,995
- Dad, that was so much
fun, can we do it again?

842
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:42,166
- I don't think so.

843
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:46,036
Why don't you finish
your sandwich?

844
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,882
- I want to thank you for
taking the time out to, uh.

845
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:01,218
- Oh, I know it was
important to you, dad,

846
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:03,720
to come out here.

847
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:07,957
- Eddie, do you know
why I'm so rough on you?

848
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,459
- No, why is that?

849
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:11,995
- You're not close to the Lord.

850
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:14,931
- Well, that's gonna solve
all my problems, huh?

851
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:16,733
- That's the problem
with your generation.

852
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,568
- Oh, my generation?

853
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:20,470
- That's right,
you expect all the

854
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,871
problems to be fixed right now.

855
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,840
That's not the way it works!

856
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,310
- Would you give it a rest
with the holy roller stuff?

857
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,378
Man, it's getting old.

858
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:37,921
I'm sorry that was uncalled for.

859
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:46,096
- Okay, go ahead
and start her up.

860
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:47,697
Alright.

861
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:18,094
Knew it all the time.

862
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:22,366
Alright, lets go find that tree.

863
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:24,201
- Yes!

864
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:44,854
- Okay, it's the next exit.

865
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:17,987
- Okay guys, we're almost there!

866
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:44,314
Wait, I thought you
said the next right?

867
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,483
This is a dead end.

868
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:49,185
- This can't be the right road.

869
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:53,189
- Look, the maps says
it's the road, see?

870
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:02,599
- Stupid goat.

871
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:04,301
- Maybe there's a way around?

872
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:05,835
- I don't see
another way around.

873
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:09,406
This is supposed to be the
road that leads to Two River.

874
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:32,996
- Thank you, Jessie.

875
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:56,286
- Why aren't we going to
the tree to bury Grandma?

876
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:58,922
- Because the road's
blocked, pumpkin.

877
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,599
- I think he wants to be alone.

878
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:18,675
- Do you remember that old tree?

879
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:22,278
Yes, I remember
the tree.

880
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,181
- I want you to
put my ashes there.

881
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:28,485
- Don't talk like that,
you're gonna be fine.

882
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:31,721
- We both know I
don't have very long.

883
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:34,991
I left something there for you.

884
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:36,493
- What are you talking about?

885
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:39,729
- It's nothing really,
it's just a young girl who

886
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:44,200
wrote a letter to her
true love.

887
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,837
I'm glad we were married.

888
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:50,840
We had a wonderful
life together.

889
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,543
- Yes we did.

890
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:57,347
- I'm going to close
my eyes for a moment.

891
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:13,189
- Are you just gonna leave
him out there all night?

892
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,758
- No.

893
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,563
I'll go get him.

894
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:36,145
Come on, you can't
sit here all night.

895
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:42,151
Come on.

896
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,688
- Eddie, take me to that church.

897
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:13,877
- Let's dance.

898
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:15,411
- Dance?

899
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:17,313
Beth, there's no music.

900
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:20,183
So what? Come on.

901
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:30,660
You see, we don't need music.

902
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:04,994
- Beth?

903
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,797
- Dad?

904
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:09,799
- Where did she go?

905
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,937
- She's gone, dad.

906
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:18,274
- Eddie?

907
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,688
It's a miracle you're
here.

908
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:35,324
I've never told you this story.

909
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,426
I was working toward getting
a home for your mother

910
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,063
so we could get married
and start a family.

911
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:45,769
Somebody almost made
all that not happen.

912
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:55,411
Paul had his own plan in mind.

913
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:07,590
- Is this about that boy?

914
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,959
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

915
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:13,863
- Honey, do you really think
I don't know whats going on?

916
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:17,867
I was once young too and
in love with your father.

917
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,504
So i understand.

918
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:27,176
- I write letters to
him almost everyday

919
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:30,079
but suddenly he
doesn't write me back.

920
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,081
- Sometimes boys
can be pretty dumb.

921
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:34,550
They can do stupid things.

922
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,686
- Maybe he's met
someone over there.

923
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,888
- Well maybe he has
but I would lay odds

924
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:42,859
she's nowhere near as
beautiful and as smart as you.

925
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:48,898
Oh honey, God will work
this all out for you.

926
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:56,706
"My dearest Will,

927
01:17:56,706 --> 01:17:59,442
"I have asked that you call
so I can rest my nerves.

928
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:00,944
"Where are you?

929
01:18:00,944 --> 01:18:02,912
"I'm lost without you.

930
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:05,782
"Please send me something.

931
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:08,517
"Even if it means goodbye."

932
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:27,703
- I'm sorry, what did
you say your name was?

933
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,173
- My name is Paul.

934
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:34,177
I've come a long way to
have a word with Beth.

935
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:36,679
It's about Will,

936
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:40,083
it's kinda important.

937
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,255
Beth.

938
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:51,394
- Do you know this young man?

939
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:54,130
- It's okay, dad.

940
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:04,740
- Could I talk to you?

941
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,943
- Sure.

942
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:10,914
- You uh, you might
wanna sit down.

943
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:18,121
- So how do you know Will?

944
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:21,024
- We worked together.

945
01:19:21,024 --> 01:19:22,859
- You said your
name is Paul, right?

946
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:26,195
- Yes, yeah.

947
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:27,596
- You traveled all this way?

948
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,867
You must have something
important to say to me.

949
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:37,540
- Beth.

950
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,607
- He's dead, isn't he?

951
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,144
- No, no, no.

952
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:45,281
He's not dead, he's, uh.

953
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:50,353
- Are you going to tell me?

954
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:53,722
- Yeah, yeah I'm gonna tell you.

955
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:58,194
Will met someone and

956
01:19:58,194 --> 01:19:59,863
now they're gonna get married.

957
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:03,066
- I'm sorry, did you say
he was getting married?

958
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,567
- Yes.

959
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:05,468
- You came all
this way to tell me

960
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:08,137
he was getting married?

961
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,975
- I found this letter
that you sent to him.

962
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:15,611
He had thrown it in the garbage.

963
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:17,313
I asked him if he
was gonna tell you

964
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:20,316
and he just said
"She'll get over it."

965
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:23,186
I mean, I felt so bad for you.

966
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:27,323
I saw the address on
the envelope and...

967
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:30,559
well here I am.

968
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:33,696
- I don't believe it,
I need to go see him.

969
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:38,534
- No, no you don't
wanna do that.

970
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:40,937
- I need to see this for myself.

971
01:20:40,937 --> 01:20:42,138
I need to meet this girl.

972
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:44,007
- He's not there anymore.

973
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:44,974
- Where did he go?

974
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:48,477
- I don't know where they went.

975
01:20:48,477 --> 01:20:49,812
Beth.

976
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:54,050
He's gone, Beth.

977
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:57,653
He's gone.

978
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:02,791
And she believed him.

979
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,138
They began dating.

980
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:16,739
His family had money.

981
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,241
The only reason he
was working there

982
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,143
was because he got
into some trouble

983
01:21:20,143 --> 01:21:22,645
and his father
wanted to punish him.

984
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:24,413
Thought it would humble him.

985
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:27,883
Turn him into a stand-up man.

986
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:37,927
I finally woke up, recovered

987
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:41,897
and was able to
travel back home.

988
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:50,773
- Beth!

989
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:53,576
It's me, I'm home.

990
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:56,412
- What are you doing here?

991
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,282
- What do you mean,
"what am I doing here"?

992
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:01,917
- I'm home.

993
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,587
- What are you talking about?

994
01:22:10,326 --> 01:22:14,863
- What are you doing here?

995
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:21,337
I said!

996
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:24,207
What are you doing here, Paul?

997
01:22:24,207 --> 01:22:28,177
- Look, they said you
weren't gonna make it.

998
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:34,250
- So you thought you
could just take my girl?

999
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:38,054
- What's he talking about, Paul?

1000
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:40,323
Paul told me you got married.

1001
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:42,758
- Married?

1002
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,040
- Go home, Paul.

1003
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:03,079
- So you never got married?

1004
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:04,347
- No.

1005
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:06,849
- Well then why didn't
you answer my letters?

1006
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:10,419
- I was in an
accident, I couldn't.

1007
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:16,425
A tractor fell on me, Beth.

1008
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:20,129
I've been in the
hospital the whole time.

1009
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,370
- Andy.

1010
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:32,908
- Your mother and
I saw each other

1011
01:23:32,908 --> 01:23:35,378
every single day after that.

1012
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:37,146
- What ever happened to Paul?

1013
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:40,883
- I don't know and
nor do I care to know.

1014
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:46,489
- Oh sorry, we just walked in.

1015
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:49,092
- Grandpa came here
to talk to God!

1016
01:23:49,092 --> 01:23:52,128
- Well that's alright,
my church is your church.

1017
01:23:52,128 --> 01:23:53,996
- And we're gonna
go bury Grandma

1018
01:23:53,996 --> 01:23:56,665
at the tree at at Two River.

1019
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:58,234
- Two river?

1020
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:00,769
There's a place I haven't
heard mentioned in years.

1021
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,838
Ever since the
freeway went through,

1022
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:05,174
Two River has become just
a memory around here.

1023
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:07,443
- So you know where the tree is?

1024
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,912
- Well, I can tell you
how to get to Two River,

1025
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:12,047
but they have a lot of trees.

1026
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,516
- We just need to
know where to go.

1027
01:24:13,516 --> 01:24:15,851
- I'll find the tree
once we get there.

1028
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:49,352
- Dad, are you okay?

1029
01:24:49,352 --> 01:24:51,754
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

1030
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,567
There it is.

1031
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:16,044
I remember that bench.

1032
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:24,587
- Look, there's your names!

1033
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:30,826
- Oh, the tree's all dead now.

1034
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,565
Do you have the urn?

1035
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:40,636
- I don't have it, I
thought you had it.

1036
01:25:45,408 --> 01:25:49,412
- I must have left
it at the barricade.

1037
01:25:49,412 --> 01:25:51,614
- Don't worry dad, I'll get it.

1038
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:52,915
Here, why don't you sit down?

1039
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:55,184
Let's clear the bench, can we?

1040
01:26:08,397 --> 01:26:09,698
- Are you okay?

1041
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:11,634
Can we get you anything, dad?

1042
01:26:12,635 --> 01:26:14,770
- I'm fine now.

1043
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:18,173
- You guys wait here, I'm
gonna go run and get the urn.

1044
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:23,846
- Let's give Grandpa some space.

1045
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:14,196
"My dearest Willam,

1046
01:27:14,196 --> 01:27:16,899
"I have finally let
go, I have been told

1047
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,701
"that you've found another.

1048
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:22,771
"But deep in my heart I know
we will be together again.

1049
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:25,708
"Your true love, Beth."

1050
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,084
- Mom.

1051
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:41,824
Grandpa found another letter.

1052
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:45,821
- Grandpa!

1053
01:28:48,891 --> 01:28:49,992
- Just a little cat nap, honey.

1054
01:28:51,594 --> 01:28:53,429
- Dad, you're killing me here.

1055
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:00,963
- Hey, pumpkin.

1056
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:01,897
Hey.

1057
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,466
- Where's your flight suit?

1058
01:30:03,466 --> 01:30:05,801
- Dad, that's for little kids.

1059
01:30:05,801 --> 01:30:07,703
Okay.

1060
01:30:08,871 --> 01:30:10,138
You know what Ernest needs?

1061
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,140
- What?

1062
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,410
- I think Ernest needs a friend.

1063
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,779
Grandpa!

1064
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:19,414
What do you think?

1065
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,709
- Mom, your hand!

1066
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:47,610
It's not shaking.

1067
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:49,211
- She's right.

1068
01:30:49,211 --> 01:30:51,213
That medication
is really working.

1069
01:30:51,213 --> 01:30:54,650
Yeah, it's really
helped.

1070
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:56,384
So who's gonna say grace?

1071
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,555
- Um, I'd like to say it.

1072
01:31:05,227 --> 01:31:09,464
Dear God, thank you for
bringing us this meal

1073
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:12,868
and thank you for allowing us to

1074
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:15,070
lay our mother and
Grandmother to rest.

1075
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:24,112
- And thank you for
bringing our family closer.

1076
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:28,283
- And thank you
for giving us the

1077
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:31,520
strength to complete
our journey.

1078
01:31:32,655 --> 01:31:33,556
- Amen.

1079
01:31:33,556 --> 01:31:34,723
Amen.

1080
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:45,968
- Hello?

1081
01:31:45,968 --> 01:31:47,736
Oh hi, Walt.

1082
01:31:47,736 --> 01:31:49,838
It's Walt from Zebra Glue.

1083
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,074
Yeah I haven't heard
from you in a long time.

1084
01:31:52,074 --> 01:31:55,277
- He owns your dad's old
company's competition.

1085
01:31:56,879 --> 01:32:00,616
- Well sure, yeah they
let me go last week.

1086
01:32:02,785 --> 01:32:06,188
Well yeah, this Monday?

1087
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:07,355
Well, yeah!

1088
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,526
Of course I remember
where your office is.

1089
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,396
Okay, yes, thank you sir.

1090
01:32:14,396 --> 01:32:18,233
Alright, yeah, okay.

1091
01:32:18,233 --> 01:32:20,869
Thanks, bye.

1092
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:25,641
That was Walt from Zebra Glue.

1093
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:27,409
He offered me a job.

1094
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:28,811
Zebra Glue?

1095
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:30,245
I use that all the time.

1096
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:32,981
Now that's a real company.

1097
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:36,151
- What, he just offered
you a job, just like that?

1098
01:32:36,151 --> 01:32:39,688
- Yeah, he said they wanted
someone with real loyalty.

1099
01:32:39,688 --> 01:32:41,724
They've wanted me for a
long time but they'd never

1100
01:32:41,724 --> 01:32:43,091
think I'd leave Fazzle Glue.

1101
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:45,527
That's amazing!

1102
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:47,029
- I know.

1103
01:32:47,029 --> 01:32:49,765
The only problem is the pay...

1104
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:54,469
is double what I got before!

1105
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:01,777
- So does that
mean I get a phone?

1106
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:04,579
- Yes, as soon as
you get all A's.

1107
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,148
Okay, let's eat!
