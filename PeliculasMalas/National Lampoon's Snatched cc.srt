00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:08,275
[rock and roll playing]

2
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:48,413
Man: 
Burgers, I love burgers.

3
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:49,724
Who doesn'’t love burgers?

4
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,862
You show me a guy
who doesn'’t love burgers,

5
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:53,896
I'’ll show you...

6
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:55,517
I'’m just saying,
we all love burgers.

7
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:56,931
And why not?

8
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,103
They'’re one of life'’s
simple pleasures.

9
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,896
They make us happy,

10
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:02,482
and when it'’s all
said and done,

11
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,413
that'’s all anybody wants, right?

12
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:05,793
To be happy.

13
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:09,344
I say, what makes every guy
happy are the four B'’s:

14
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:12,827
burgers, beer, babes,

15
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:14,310
and your buddies.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,862
Speaking of buddies,

17
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,862
let me tell you a little story about my buddy, Frank--

18
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:19,689
Ahh, they don'’t come any nicer.

19
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,448
This guy had it all.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,724
He'’s so nice, he was willing
to give one of his kidneys

21
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:25,275
to his brother-in-law,

22
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:27,000
and it wasn'’t even
his brother-in-law anymore.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,724
It was his ex-wife'’s brother.

24
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:31,758
You never know what you got
until you lose it.

25
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,034
I'’m getting ahead of myself,
let me back up.

26
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,551
Frank had the dream job.

27
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:38,724
He was the city'’s 
number one sportscaster.

28
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,793
And when asked how she plans

29
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,931
to spend her $83 million
lottery winnings,

30
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:46,172
the 97-year-old widow said

31
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,758
she'’s going to Vegas.

32
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,448
And you know what they say,

33
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:53,068
"What happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas."

34
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,896
Well, let'’s hope so,
huh, Marco?

35
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:57,413
And coming up next,

36
00:01:57,413 --> 00:02:00,241
Frank'’s got some big sports
news for us. Right, Frank?

37
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,620
You betcha.
Bigger than big.

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,172
Great. But first, let'’s take
a quick look at weather.

39
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:08,275
Jedda, when are you going to do
something about this heat?

40
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,551
When are you gonna do something
about racial profiling?

41
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:13,379
Don'’t be asking me 
about this heat.

42
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,827
I am not Mother Nature.
Don'’t ask me about the heat.

43
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:17,965
We are in conjunction 
with Mars.

44
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:20,068
We are so hot right now

45
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:22,689
because we are getting 
the vapors in the atmosphere

46
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,965
from the planet Mars--

47
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:26,275
Hey, did you clean
your room yet?

48
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,068
I'’ll clean it later.

49
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,827
You'’re not going to your
father'’s game tomorrow

50
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:31,620
unless your room'’s clean.

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,896
Mom, it'’s the Charity Challenge.

52
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,655
Dad'’s coming on in a second
to talk about it.

53
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,862
Come, smell the money

54
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:39,689
because nobody 
should be ugly and poor.

55
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:42,551
I'’m Roger Byamm.

56
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,413
Wrapping up with sports.

57
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,137
Frank, you have 
a big game tomorrow.

58
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:48,206
That'’s right. It'’s the Charity Challenge.

59
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:51,482
Our team, the Ringsiders, will take on Rotolo'’s Pizza.

60
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:55,655
If we win, $5,000 goes 
to the Children'’s Bureau 
of New Orleans.

61
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:56,896
The first pitch, 3:00 p.m.

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,793
We hope to see you 
all out there.

63
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:01,517
For myself, Jay, 
Frank and Jedda,

64
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:04,689
thanks for watching 
Channel 7 news at 6:00.

65
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:05,931
You don'’t have
to speak for me.

66
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,689
I can speak for myself.

67
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,413
I can say, "Bye-bye."
See? I'’m a grown woman.

68
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,655
Bye-bye.

69
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:14,172
Shane: 
Clear.

70
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,275
So, Jedda, are you
gonna come watch
the game tomorrow?

71
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:18,275
Could use the support.

72
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,137
Well, there'’s nothing
I'’d rather see

73
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:22,068
than your fine white asses

74
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,517
in some tight baseball pants,

75
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:26,413
but I can'’t find a babysitter
for my son, Jihad.

76
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:28,206
But I'’ll be there in spirit.

77
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,551
The greatest double play combo
in Little League history,

78
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,172
Johnny Green to Frank Baum.

79
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,655
Hey, how long have you two been
playing ball together anyway?

80
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:37,379
Since before you were born.

81
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,275
Met during Little League,
been friends ever since.

82
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:40,551
As you might have noticed,

83
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,172
some of us have aged
better than others.

84
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,275
What?

85
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,827
-Woo!
-Again.

86
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:51,517
Oh, my, backdoor.
[chuckles]

87
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:54,931
So I just reminded
your old man

88
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:56,931
not to go killing himself
before the surgery.

89
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,344
You know the last thing
I need is a bruised kidney.

90
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:02,275
Frank is not my
old man anymore.

91
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,896
Oh, please. The two of you are
still in love, just admit it.

92
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,241
We'’re getting a divorce.

93
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,413
Listen. I know you'’re
my big sister and all,

94
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,000
but let me remind you
that neither of you

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,586
have signed any papers yet.

96
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,758
Okay. He'’s been
really busy at work,

97
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,896
and now he'’s giving you
a kidney,

98
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,655
so I haven'’t wanted
to add to it

99
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,758
by saying, "Gee, thanks
for saving my brother'’s life.

100
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:23,758
Now would you sign
these papers?"

101
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:25,758
Yeah, but you came
to the game and all.

102
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:27,758
I came to the game
because of Frankie.

103
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:30,137
-He wants to see
 his dad play ball.
-Uh-huh.

104
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,413
Johnny: 
If you ask me,

105
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,379
I think they'’re still 
in love, too.

106
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,241
But one thing 
that'’s stopping them

107
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,793
is Frank'’s new girlfriend, 
Trinnie, get a load of her.

108
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:38,965
Hey, baby.

109
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,137
Mwah.

110
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,689
-Oh!
-Oh.

111
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,103
Is he your dad?

112
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:47,068
No, he'’s my boyfriend.

113
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,551
Oh, wow.
You like them old.

114
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:54,758
Frank happens to be the city'’s
number one sportscaster.

115
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,689
Oh, yeah.

116
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,896
I'’ve seen his work.

117
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:01,620
[moans]

118
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,586
Look, Henry.

119
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:04,793
Everything Frank and I
ever did

120
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:05,965
happened around
a ballpark,

121
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:08,310
a golf course,
or a boxing ring.

122
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,448
It'’s--it'’s--it'’s just not
what I want.

123
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,482
What do you want?

124
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:14,241
I want him to grow up.

125
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:15,965
I'’m not raising 
two teenagers.

126
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,724
Besides,

127
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:20,655
he'’s with that
millionaire hoo-ha now.

128
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,172
Woman: Diane?

129
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, speak of the devil.

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,413
Oh, excuse. Oh.

131
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:28,137
Diane, I just want
you to know

132
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,551
how wonderful I think
it is that you brought
little Frankie here

133
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,517
to see his daddy
play this game.

134
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,413
A boy should
be around his daddy.

135
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:38,620
I was just telling Frank
last night in bed

136
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,689
that I think
you'’re doing a fine job
with little Frankie.

137
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,896
He'’s a great boy.

138
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,827
And Diane,
I want you to know

139
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:50,379
that I'’m not trying
to take your place
in any way.

140
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,724
-Umpire: Play ball!
-[crowd cheering]

141
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:09,862
Here we go. 
Here we go. Get it.

142
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:11,275
[cheers]

143

Announcer: 
A double-play combination

144
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,896
from Baum to Green 
to first base.

145
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:17,551
Let me buy peanuts
for everybody.

146
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,413
Hey, peanuts.

Umpire: You'’re out.

-Strike three.

Announcer:
Oh, for Christ'’s sake.

151
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,379
You guys could screw up
a two-car parade.

152
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,482
What are we gonna do?

153
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,275
Remember our second
Little League championship?

154
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:17,896
Henry Ott?

155
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,000
-Henry Ott.
-Henry Ott.

156
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:23,206
We need you to get on base.

157
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:26,137
Right. So should I bunt or...?

158
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,724
Yeah. We need you
to take one for the team.

159
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,103
What does that mean?

160
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:32,172
Crowd on the plate.
Let the pitch hit you.

161
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:34,034
What? Won'’t that hurt?

162
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,620
Yeah. Shake it off.

163
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,241
- Umpire: Batter up.
- You'’re the man, Shane.

164

[crowd cheering]

165
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,931
-Ah.
-Ooh.

166
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,068
[crowd cheering]

167
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:20,103
Safe.

168
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,482
Are you okay?

169
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:22,655
[crowd cheering]

170
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah! Yeah!

171
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:32,000
Because if you'’re hurt,
I can get you some money.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,965
Oh, yeah, I smell money.

173
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,931
Stay down. Stay down.

174
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:38,482
Medic!

175
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,931
Johnny: 
So Frank came through,

176
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,137
as he always does, 
and we won.

177
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,827
The kids of New Orleans won.

178
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,896
And we went to celebrate 
at our bar,

179
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:48,034
Larry Holmes'’ bar.

180
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:49,344
Larry: 
Kill the jukebox!

181
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:50,931
Yup, that Larry Holmes.

182
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,137
I wanna make a toast
to a bunch of great guys, man.

183
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:54,862
You guys played
a heck of a game.

184
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,344
-To the champ!
-[cheering]

185
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:05,862
Can I have everyone'’s attention,
just for a minute, please?

186
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,896
Thank you.

187
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:12,103
Um, I--I'’d like to make a toast
to the man of the hour.

188
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,896
And for me, many more hours.

189
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:18,379
I don'’t know how many
of you guys know this,

190
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:21,793
but Frank is giving me a kidney
the day after tomorrow.

191
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:24,827
And I just--
I wanna say thank you.

192
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:28,137
To my hero, Frank.

193
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,310
To Frank.

194
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,206
Frank, you'’re one
brave son of a bitch.

195
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,620
That is a beautiful thing
you'’re doing. Beautiful.

196
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,551
Ah, you'’d do
the same thing, buddy.

197
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:38,724
No, I wouldn'’t,
I'’m a pussy.

198
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:40,551
I can'’t stand
the sight of blood.

199
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:44,206
I can'’t stand the sight
of my ex-wives either
or their brothers.

200
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:47,000
Although, I wouldn'’t mind
seeing their blood.

201
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,103
Well, geez, Dad.

202
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:51,793
I didn'’t know you could
still run that far.

203
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:52,965
Hey, hey.

204
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:56,413
But, uh, really that--
that--that was awesome.

205
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:59,344
And--and Uncle Henry, I.

206
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,034
Listen. When I get out
of the hospital,

207
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,448
you and I are gonna spend
some serious time together,
all right?

208
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,379
-We are going fishing...
-Hey, Frankie.

209
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,793
Well, another great game.

210
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,310
Thanks for coming.

211
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,827
Listen, Frank,
despite our differences,

212
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:17,655
I really want you to know
how much I appreciate

213
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,689
what you'’re doing
for my brother.

214
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:22,241
Hmm, Doc says
three to four days,

215
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,965
I'’ll be out of the hospital,
a little rest, I'’ll be back
at the station.

216
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:29,103
It'’s a big deal to me Frank,
so thank you.

217
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, Frank Baum,
you'’re just the man
of the hour.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,448
I think we ought
to get going soon,

219
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:40,068
so we can celebrate
this big evening,
don'’t you?

220
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,655
Let'’s have another drink
with the boys.

221
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:43,172
Hey, everybody,
everybody, hey, hey,

222
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:46,275
I wanna thank you all
for a great game today,

223
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:49,655
you played your asses off.
Especially Shane.

224
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:52,724
Yeah, Shane. That is
a championship ass.

225
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,655
[cheering]

226
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,275
We raised $5,000
for a great charity.

227
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:02,793
-To the children of New Orleans.
-Children of New Orleans.

228
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:05,448
[cheers and applause]

229
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:09,758
Trinnie: 
It'’s game time.

230
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,448
Batter up.

231
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,965
[imitating echo]:
Today, today, today, today,

232
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:26,206
I consider myself,
self, self, self

233
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:29,655
the luckiest man,
man, man, man

234
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,931
on the face of the Earth,
Earth, Earth, Earth.

235
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,689
[music playing]

236
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:36,206
Newscaster: 
And from all of us 
at Channel 7 News,

237
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,724
good night.

238
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:38,965
Director: Clear.

239
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,827
Good show. Good show.
Good show.

240
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,655
Now Frank, I know you'’re
going on medical leave,

241
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:45,206
so I'’m thinking maybe
we'’ll do a news story
on your organ donation.

242
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,793
You know, sweeps season'’s
coming up, and I got
nothing else on the calendar.

243
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:49,068
-I don'’t think so, Stan.
-Great.

244
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,689
Hmm, that reminds me.
Biff!

245
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,103
I wanna introduce you
to the guy

246
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,689
who'’s gonna be filling in
for you while you'’re gone.

247
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,103
Biff, Frank.
Frank, Biff.

248
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:56,896
-Frank? So nice
to finally meet you.
-Pleasure.

249
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,862
It'’s an honor to pinch-hit
for you while you'’re out.

250
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:00,586
-Yeah.
-I'’ve been watching you for

251
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,517
as long as I can remember.

252
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:03,931
How long have you been
on the air?

253
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,586
Seems like forever.
[chuckles]

254
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:08,862
So, uh, how long
are you gonna be gone?

255
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,379
I don'’t know.
A week, maybe two.

256
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,310
Oh, cool.
Great. Yeah.

257
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, I'’ve been, uh,
trying to finish up
my reel.

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,655
My agent says that ESPN
is very interested in me.

259
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,034
Who'’s, uh, your agent, Frank?

260
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:24,172
I don'’t have one.
I'’m not going anywhere.

261
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:26,896
Who knows these days, right?

262
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,413
Woman [on speaker]: 
Dr. Howard, Dr. Howard, 
Dr. Howard...

263
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:35,448
Hey, you.

264
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,896
Margarita,
that'’s your name, right?

265
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:40,482
I need to have a smoke. 
Cigareto.

266
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:44,862
Nicotino,you understand? 
Nicotino, comprendo?

267
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:47,551
Just stay in here.

268
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,310
There'’s one more patient
coming in.

269
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,896
If I'’m not back,
just have him sign this.

270
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,379
-Comprendo?
-Okay.

271
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,896
Okay. After the patient
signs this,

272
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:59,655
take the paperwork,
put it into the blue folder.

273
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,965
The blue folder goes into
the orange folder, okay?

275
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,793
Okay.

276
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:07,965
Then the orange goes
into the green, okay?

277
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:09,586
Okay.

278
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,206
Now listen, mamacita,

279
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,931
whatever you do,

280
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:20,448
do not put the blue
into the red

281
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:23,000
and into the green, okay?

282
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,172
-Okay.
-Muchas nachos.

283
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:30,620
Hi, I'’m Frank Baum.

284
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,965
Is this pre-surgery check-in?

285
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,103
Okay.

286
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,689
-Okay?
-Okay.

287
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:40,655
Okay.

288
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:43,103
-Okay.
-Okay.

289
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:44,965
Woman [on P.A.]: 
Dr. Holsen to the ER.

290
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:48,586
I need to talk to Dr. Metalon
on the 4th floor, okay?

291
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:49,827
Okay.

292
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,758
Okay.

293
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,655
Dr. Scholl to Orthopedics.

294
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,448
Dr. Scholl 
to Orthopedics.

295
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,379
Woman: 
Okay, Frank,

296
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,551
now count backwards 
from a hundred.

297
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:11,344
Ninety-nine, ninety-eight,

298
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:16,172
ninety-seven, ninety-six...

299
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:20,482
Two.

300
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:22,896
[beeping]

301
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:30,448
Morning, baby.

302
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,000
Time to take some vitals.

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,068
Okay. What do you need?

304
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,931
Oh, just temperature,
blood pressure.

305
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:40,034
Your breakfast should be up
in a minute. You hungry?

306
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,517
I guess.
I'’m just tired.

307
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:46,068
Yeah. Well, you had
some surgery, missy.

308
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,586
The anesthesia should, um,
wear off in a minute.

309
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:51,137
Good morning.

310
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:53,103
Rise and shine.

311
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,896
Look what I got for you today.
Breakfast.

312
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,655
-Oh, thank you.
-I'’m Annie Mae.

313
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,068
If you need anything, you
just press that button, baby.

314
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,620
Okay. Thanks.

315
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,068
You'’re too out of it
last night to order

316
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,758
so I got you the slim diet.

317
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,275
All the posties order that.

318
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:08,758
Okay. Great.
Thank you.

319
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:11,000
If you need anything,
just let the nurse know, okay?

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,379
All right.

321
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,172
-Morning.
-Morning.

322
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,275
I have today'’s newspaper
and some magazines for you.

323
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:19,689
Great, thank you.

324
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:22,862
Do you have Sports Illustrated
or something like that?

325
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:25,068
Sure. Not with me,

326
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,068
but I'’ll see if I can find one
and bring it back later.

327
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,827
Okay, great. 
Thank you.

328
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:34,275
Good morning.

329
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:38,655
It'’s the first day
of the rest of your life.

330
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,034
And you are?

331
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:43,482
Dr. Ramada. I performed
the surgery on you.

332
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:46,310
-Where'’s Dr. Metalon?
-Should I know him?

333
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,137
Well, I guess. I mean,
he'’s the one I talked to.

334
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,896
I thought he was gonna
perform the surgery.

335
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,827
Well, the thing is, you'’ve
already had the surgery

336
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,724
and it could not
have gone better.

337
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:59,551
And it looks like you are
doing very, very well.

338
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,379
-How'’s Henry?
-Who'’s Henry?

339
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,724
Henry. He'’s Henry Gayle.

340
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,551
He'’s the reason
I had the surgery.

341
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, sure.

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,827
His name is Henry.

343
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:12,103
-Yeah.
-Well, I don'’t know

344
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:16,034
but, uh, I'’m sure
he'’s very happy.

345
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,827
Well, I don'’t know about happy,

346
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:19,275
but as long as he'’s okay.

347
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,275
Are you in any pain?

348
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,103
Actually, yeah.
A lot.

349
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:24,344
Where?

350
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:25,793
My balls.

351
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:29,068
[laughing]

352
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:30,931
Impossible.

353
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:33,310
No. No.
They--they really hurt.

354
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,068
Well, it may hurt
but I can assure you,

355
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:38,379
it'’s not your balls.

356
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:40,379
I'’m no doc,
but I'’m telling you,

357
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,448
the whole groin
is, like, throbbing.

358
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,206
You know?

359
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:46,758
Let me take a look.

360
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:48,275
Please.

361
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:56,620
Wow, that is beautiful.

362
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,931
Yeah. Doc, maybe you could
just look at the incision.

363
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,137
I am.

364
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:03,586
Oh.

365
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,344
I thought they took it
from somewhere else.

366
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:09,241
Well, where else do you think
we might'’ve taken it from?

367
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:12,310
I don'’t know,
I just--yeah.

368
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,275
Now look, Frank,
or is it Fran?

369
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,344
Frank.

370
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:20,103
When you get home,
tell Henry to, uh,

371
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:23,344
take it easy for a while
until everything heals.

372
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:24,551
All right. Will do.

373
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,241
I mean, we don'’t
live together, so.

374
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,172
-Really?
-Yeah.

375
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,758
So what should I do
and not do?

376
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:36,172
Well, I would say start
with some gentle foreplay

377
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,241
and make sure you use
a good lubricant.

378
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,896
-What?
-To keep it moist.

379
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:42,931
-Moist?
-Yeah, sure.

380
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:46,068
You'’re not gonna be able
to do that naturally.

381
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:47,448
Didn'’t they explain this to you?

382
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:49,172
No. Actually, they didn'’t.

383
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:52,965
Well, lube, okay?

384
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,379
Okay. Well, whatever.

385
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,896
I had no idea
donating an organ

386
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,517
was gonna be
such a hassle.

387
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:00,379
[cackling] Donating?
That'’s a good one.

388
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,862
I never heard it
called that before.

389
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:04,172
Well, that'’s what I did,
right?

390
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,517
No. No. No. Frank,
you know, I like you.

391
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:08,034
You'’re a funny guy.

392
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:10,034
You know, you don'’t just
take that organ and...

393
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,517
[laughing]

394
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:15,827
What a minute.
You'’re my doc, right?

395
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,482
Well, I would say I am.
I performed the surgery.

396
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,896
-I mean, you took my organ?
-Yeah.

397
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:22,655
And then you gave it
to Henry?

398
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:25,103
Oh! Oh, no.
Oh, no, no.

399
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:28,172
I'’m sorry, no.
You thought Henry had it?

400
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:32,137
-What do you mean? Yeah.
-Well, that'’s so sweet.

401
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:34,103
No, no, no, Frank.
It--it--

402
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:36,379
it'’s not like your tonsils.

403
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,379
You don'’t take it home
in a jar.

404
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:40,758
Wait, Henry doesn'’t have
my kidney?

405
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,517
-Kidney?
-My kidney.

406
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:43,896
-Kidney?
-Yeah, my kid--

407
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:45,172
Jesus, Doc,

408
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:47,517
I donated my kidney
to Henry Gayle.

409
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,241
Oh, boy.

410
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,241
Oh, boy what?

411
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:58,379
Oh, shit, oh, boy.

412
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,034
Wait, wait,
what does that mean?

413
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:03,758
Uh, your name Frank Baum?

414
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:05,103
Yeah, I'’m Frank Baum.

415
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,448
This does not make any sense.

416
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:09,413
I don'’t like the sound
of that, Doc.

417
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:10,586
Well...

418
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:11,620
Oh, Jesus, Doc.

419
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,620
What are you saying here?

420
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,689
Are you in touch 
with your feminine side?

421
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,689
Well, what are you 
getting at, Doc?

422
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,413
There'’s been a little mix-up.

423
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,793
A mix-up?

424
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:25,137
We took the wrong organ.

425
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:30,068
The wrong organ?

426
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,448
Like my liver?

427
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:34,344
No.

428
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:36,137
Well, I still have my heart.

429
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,068
Right.

430
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:48,448
Oops.

431
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,724
No!

432
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:15,413

Hey, Dad, what'’s up?

435
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,413
Hey, buddy.

436
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:36,724
-Trinnie: Hey, how are you?
-Bad.

437
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:38,655
Oh, not feeling so well?

438
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,413
-No.
-A little pain, Pop?

439
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:43,344
Yeah, pain,
but worse than pain.

440
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:46,620
Oh, my God, Frank,
did something go wrong?

441
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,206
They said everything
went perfectly.

442
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,068
No, it did not go perfectly.

443
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:52,517
Not perfectly at all,
at all, at all.

444
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,137
Well, Dad, what is it?

445
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:56,482
I don'’t wanna
talk about it, son.

446
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:58,793
No, look, Frank, what happened?
How serious is it?

447
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:01,034
I don'’t wanna
talk about it, okay?

448
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:02,517
Okay.

449
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:05,413
Hey, there'’s
the man of the hour.

450
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:07,310
-Oh, Jesus.
-I figured you could use

451
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,241
a little root pop after
what you'’ve been through.

452
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:10,586
What is this, a party?

453
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,068
What'’s his problem?

454
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,689
Surgery didn'’t go right.

455
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,586
Is he okay?

456
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:18,241
I don'’t know.
He won'’t talk about it.

457
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:21,793
What? Frank, what the hell
happened? Are you okay?

458
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:23,724
No, I am not okay.
I don'’t wanna talk about it.

459
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:25,586
You can'’t make me,
I'’m never gonna talk about it.

460
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,103
Come on, Dad,
what'’s the deal?

461
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:29,206
This is crazy. You don'’t even
sound like yourself, Frank.

462
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,413
I am not myself.

463
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:32,310
Come on, buddy, Frank.

464
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,793
That'’s just
the medication talking.

465
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,275
You'’re gonna be back again
to your old self in no time.

466
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,620
No, buddy, no.

467
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,482
I'’m never gonna be
myself again.

468
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:41,862
It'’s over.

469
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:45,310
Frank, this is ridiculous.
Stop being like this.

470
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,344
All right, Dad, come on.
Snap out of it.

471
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:49,586
You don'’t understand.

472
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:51,068
Something happened.

473
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:53,241
That doctor, he...

474
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:54,896
Frank, sweetie?

475
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,241
Oh, Jesus.

476
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:58,034
Oh, there he is.

477
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:01,344

What'’s wrong with him?

480
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:05,965
He says he'’s not himself
and never will be again.

481
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:08,172
Why? What happened?
Did something go wrong?

482
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:09,724
It'’s horrible,
just horrible.

483
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:12,689
Come on, Frank,
what happened already?

484
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:15,448
The doctor, he--

485
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:18,275
Frank Baum,
here I am

486
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:21,000

and prayers of
the entire parish.

-Him too.

-Oh.
-What'’s wrong
with the boy?

489
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:28,862
Look, Frank, this is enough.
You'’re being childish.

490
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,724
Come on, Frank,
what is the big deal here?

491
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,379
You wanna know?
You wanna know what'’s wrong?

492
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:35,068
You wanna know
what those bastards did to me?

493
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:37,206
Take a look at this.

494
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:53,310
Hey, Frank, thanks for
saving my life.

495
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,793
I didn'’t.
There was an error.

496
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:57,068
Huge error.

497
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,482
Unimaginable error.

00:22:58,482 --> 00:22:59,689
Biblical error.

499
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,689
What do you mean?
I got a kidney.

-Not mine.
-Hold on, Henry.

501
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:06,241
If you don'’t have
Frank'’s kidney,

502
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:09,931
whose kidney do you have?

so it'’s always exactly the way you want it, fresh and tasty.

And we don'’t skimp on toppings.

00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:21,034
More sauce, more cheese, 
more sausage.

Rotolo'’s Pizzeria.

526
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:28,896
Man: 
And now for your five-day 
forecast with Jedda.

527
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,413
Boy, look,

528
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:32,758
don'’t make me come home 
and have to whup you.

529
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:35,068
No, no, no, wait a minute, 
wait a minute, wait a minute.

530
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:37,068
Turn on the TV and put--

531
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:39,000
and put on Channel 7.

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,965
Now, listen, listen to me.

533
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:44,482
Don'’t you dare set 
that babysitter on fire again.

534
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,275
Jedda, weather.

535
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:48,344
It'’s hot! 
And it'’s gonna be hot.

536
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:51,275
It'’s New Orleans 
in the summertime. Hot.

537
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:54,137
And now Biff has a special 
sports update for us.

538
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:57,896
Biff, I can'’t believe 
you actually rode 
a horse in the Derby.

539
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,689
And finished in the money.

540
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:01,586
I can vouch for that.

541
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:04,034
-That was truly amazing.
-[trumpet fanfare]

542
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,379
Thanks for the tip.

543
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,275
I'’m out.

544
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,551
I'’ll raise you a buck.

545
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:17,275
This is too rich for me.

546
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:18,965
I'’m just
a poor working stiff.

547
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:23,586
Your buck, and I'’ll take
last raise.

548
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,034
-What you got, man?
-Full boat.

549
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:27,344
Oh, very nice.

550
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:28,827
I got a bigger boat.

551
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,448
Thank you, gents.

552
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:32,482
A pleasure 
doing business with you.

553
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:35,034
This is not my week.
I mean, really.

554
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:42,275
Oh, come on, Frank,
it'’s--it'’s nothing.

555
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,379
It'’s nothing at all.

556
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,724
Nothing.

557
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,482
Nada, who cares?

558
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:49,034
Who cares about what?

559
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:52,137
Who cares about nothing,
right, guys? Nothing.

560
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:53,965
Nothing.

561
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:58,206
Johnny, did you tell them?

562
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,758
No. Nothing.

563
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,413
All right. Something.

564
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:06,275
I--I--I might have told them
to just be a little supportive.

565
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,344
Frank, it'’s nothing.

566
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:13,586
It'’s nothing, Frank.
Come on, who cares?

567
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:16,655
So, you got a snatch.
No big deal.

568
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:18,689
Yeah, no big deal.
Nothing to worry about.

569
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:21,137
-Really?
-Really, really.

570
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,379
-Who cares? Who cares?
-Don'’t give it another thought.

571
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:26,551
Doesn'’t make a difference.
It'’s nothing, buddy.

572
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,275
I mean, come on, guys,
think about it.

573
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:30,206
Who among us,
at one point or another,

574
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:32,448
has not seriously wished
that they had a snatch?

575
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:39,103
Well, to be honest,
I never have.

576
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,758
I never even thought about it.

577
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:42,034
Yeah, me neither, it'’s awful.

578
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,482
But the point is, buddy,
we love you.

579
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,896
You are the man.
You are the one and only.

580
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,310
So, come on, don'’t be so damn
hard on yourself.

581
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,896
I appreciate the support, guys,

582
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,758
but I am getting this
taken care of.

583
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:53,482
I am getting back to normal.

584
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:56,517
Back to normal.

585
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:59,724
Okay, boys, ante up.
Five cards.

586
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:01,103
Jacks or better.

587
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,517
I mean, it'’s not like things
have really changed.

588
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,310
You look the same to me.

589
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,275
Yeah, you'’re as ugly
as always.

590
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:10,655
[laughing]

591
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:12,689
Yeah, I mean, it'’s not like
it'’s a turn-on.

592
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:19,379
What?

593
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:22,000
You having a--a snatch.

594
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,482
It'’snot--that'’s not, I guess,
a turn-on or anything.

595
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:29,793
Yeah, yeah,
too ugly to fuck.

596
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,482
I mean, there are
some guys that, you know,

597
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:35,137
they had a snatch.

598
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,344
I mean, you--you know,

599
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,241
I don'’t know, you know.

600
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,931
-You lost me.
-Be grateful.

601
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:44,034
I'’m just saying there are
some pretty guys that maybe,

602
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:47,034
just maybe, you might
have to consider.

603
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,413
What, are we
in a Turkish prison?

604
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,827
Well, I'’m not saying

605
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:52,310
you'’d bypass Halle Berry
to get to them,

606
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,517
but say you'’re--

607
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:56,103
you'’re stranded
on a desert island.

608
00:27:56,103 --> 00:27:57,551
-Like Gilligan'’s Island?
-Exactly.

609
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,413
-I'’d do Ginger or Mary Anne.
-Me too.

610
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,896
But what if
they weren'’t there?

611
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:05,758
Mrs. Howell.
Definitely Mrs. Howell.

612
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,103
Good call. Old, but rich.

613
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,620
Okay, okay.

614
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
But let'’s say
you'’re the Skipper

615
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,379
and it'’s just Mr. Howell
and Gilligan.

616
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,275
Okay, guys, stop, okay?
Stop.

617
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:17,172
What'’s the question?

618
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,206
If Gilligan had a snatch,
is what I'’m saying.

619
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:20,758
That'’s the option?

620
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:23,000
And we'’re moving
right along.

621
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Okay. Forget it.

622
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,931
-Matt Damon.
-Huh?

623
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:33,241
What about Matt Damon?

624
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,551
If Matt Damon and I
were on a desert island

625
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:38,344
and he had a snatch,

626
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:40,275
maybe.

627
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,241
Matt Damon? Hmm.

628
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:46,137
Hmm. Matt Damon
is awfully pretty.

629
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:48,586
-Very.
-Agreed.

630
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:51,172
Matt Damon is
a very pretty man.

631
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:54,482
Well, I'’d do Matt Damon on
the condition he had a snatch.

632
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,758
Jesus, guys.

633
00:28:55,758 --> 00:28:57,551
So you'’re saying,
we would--

634
00:28:57,551 --> 00:28:59,413
we would bang Matt Damon
if he had a pussy?

635
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:01,724
-You'’ve done worse.
-True.

636
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:04,586
Yeah. Matt Damon.

637
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:05,793
On a desert island.

638
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:08,827
With a snatch.

639
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:12,448
Well, I would have
to vote yes.

640
00:29:12,448 --> 00:29:13,827
I need to use the head.

641
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,448
So it'’s agreed.

642
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:17,724
If one of us were trapped
on a desert island,

643
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:19,517
and the only other person
on said desert island

644
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:22,827
was one very pretty actor
by the name of Matt Damon,

645
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,827
and this said actor,
Matt Damon,

646
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:27,275
had no male genitalia,
but in fact, a snatch,

647
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:29,034
we would therefore fornicate

648
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,896
with said pretty actor,
Matt Damon?

649
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,862
-Yes.
-If he'’d have me.

650
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:35,103
Frank: Jesus, guys, 
is it too much to ask?

651
00:29:35,103 --> 00:29:37,172
When you use the toilet, 
put the seat down!

652
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:38,965
[toilet seat slams]

653
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:42,103
Woman: 
I'’m sorry, but he'’s not 
in his office.

654
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:44,241
-When do you expect him? 
-I really can'’t.

655
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,862
-Frank Baum.
-Doctor.

656
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:47,379
What brings you here?

657
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:49,448
I was wondering if you'’d like
to give me my penis back.

658
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:50,655
I'’d love to.

659
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,413
-Great, when can we schedule?
-I can'’t.

660
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:54,034
What the hell?
I thought.

661
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:56,758
I would love to,
but since your operation,

662
00:29:56,758 --> 00:30:00,172
I'’ve lost my license to perform
surgery in the United States.

663
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:01,931
I might go to Bangkok.

664
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,827
No, no. You'’re the one
that got me

665
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:05,655
into this situation
in the first place.

666
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:07,689
I was supposed to donate
my kidney, not my--

667
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,655
Frank, maybe it'’s not
such a bad thing.

668
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:12,689
Why don'’t you take it out
for a test drive?

669
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:14,379
A what?

670
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,586
You know, take it around
the block a few times.

671
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:18,000
You might like it.

672
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,620
No, no, I don'’t wanna test it.
I want my dick back.

673
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,517
You'’d have to talk
to Dr. Weller about that.

674
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:26,793
Who--who'’s Dr. Weller?

675
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:28,689
I am the head 
of the hospital'’s

676
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:31,068
gender reassignment department.
And you are?

677
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:33,000
I'’m Frank Baum.

678
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:37,137
Of course. You.

679
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:39,620
Please sit in the other chair.

680
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,896
Oh, that one broken?

681
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:43,586
Of course not.

682
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:45,620
Please don'’t cross your legs.

683
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,103
Okay.

684
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:49,000
-Please don'’t do that.
-What?

685
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,275
-That.
-What that?

686
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:52,724
That that. Stop it now.
I insist.

687
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:54,862
-Okay, stopped.
-Thank you.

688
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:58,379
Now, what seems to be
the problem?

689
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,551
Well, first of all,
I have a vagina.

690
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,620
And a very nice one,
I might add. Congratulations.

691
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,724
Thank you,
but I don'’t want it.

692
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:08,206
You should'’ve thought
of that before you got it.

693
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:09,448
-What?
-Tell me,

694
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:11,103
did you give serious
consideration to this

695
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,275
before you had your
gender reassignment?

696
00:31:13,275 --> 00:31:14,793
No, never for a second.

697
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:17,172
Well, that seems rather silly,
don'’t you think?

698
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:19,172
No, no, no.
There'’s been a terrible mistake.

699
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:21,413
Okay, let me guess.

700
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,275
Your mother was overbearing
and your father was distant.

701
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,413
You loved to play with dolls

702
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:30,000
and put on your mother'’s pretty
dresses and high-heeled shoes

703
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,275
every morning
when she went off to work.

704
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:35,068
-Never.
-Not even once?

705
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:36,206
-Never.
-Hmm.

706
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:39,931
Doctor, if we could
just schedule

707
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,827
the operation
and give it all back.

708
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,379
No.

709
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:46,310
-No?
-No.

710
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,862
-Why not?
-Well, it'’s not that easy.

711
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,758
We don'’t just change
someone'’s gender willy-nilly.

712
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:51,689
-Oh, I--I--
I beg to differ you do.
-Don'’t.

713
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:53,000
-Do.
-Don'’t.

714
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
-Do, did. Well, you did with me.
-Well, I didn'’t.

715
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,620
-Well, the other doctor,
 he did.
-Ah, yes.

716
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,448
He doesn'’t work here anymore.

717
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,517
In fact, he'’s no longer
even a doctor.

718
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:03,137
I know. He told me.

719
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:06,172
-This is all so sad.
-I know.

720
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:08,172
Not you, him.

721
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:09,862
He'’s been a surgeon
his whole life.

722
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:11,517
Now, it'’s all down the drain.

723
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:13,862
No more pension,
no retirement in Florida.

724
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,862
Wait, I'’m the one
who was screwed here.

725
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:18,413
-He lost his license...
-I lost my dick, you prick.

726
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:20,724
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey.

727
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:22,586
I can'’t work with you
if you'’re gonna be hostile.

728
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:25,310
I'’m hostile because you
won'’t give me my dick back.

729
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,310
I don'’t have it.

730
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,034
I just wanna be a man again.

731
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,344
-Are you a misogynist?
-Of course not, I love women.

732
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,103
As long as you don'’t
have to be one.

733
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,413
Tell me, are you the same way
with blacks as well?

734
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,724
-Blacks, blacks.
Do you like blacks?
-Of course...

735
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:43,068
Yeah, as long as you don'’t
have to actually be black.

736
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:44,724
-No, no...
-Would you rather
be a black man

737
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:46,034
-or a black woman?
-Neither.

738
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:48,689
My point exactly.

739
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:51,275
I'’m sorry, you'’re just not ready
to be transformed.

740
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:53,586
And until you are, I can'’t,
in all good conscience,

741
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:55,344
approve you
for gender reassignment.

742
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:56,827
This is crazy.
You'’re crazy.

743
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:59,344
That is exactly the kind of
attitude that is going to delay

744
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,448
your gender reassignment
procedure.

745
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:03,827
Oh, my God. Okay.
What do I have to do?

746
00:33:03,827 --> 00:33:06,103
Just--just tell me
what I need to do. What?

747
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:09,310
When you are ready to...
[inhales, exhales]

748
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,068
...heal yourself and calmly
progress down

749
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:13,862
the path toward gender
reassignment

750
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:15,931
like a nice, calm, normal,

751
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:18,620
sane human being,
then we can talk.

752
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,034
Until then, I have other
patients to see.

753
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:26,448
This is not over.
Not over.

754
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:33,034
[deep voice]
It'’s never over.

755
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:42,379
Do you suffer from sneezing 
and runny eyes every spring?

756
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:45,344
Think maybe it'’s pollen 
or spring fever?

757
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:49,379
Take it from me, Roger Byamm, 
it'’s time to think again.

758
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:52,413
You may be suffering 
from asphaltitis...

759
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,896
[indistinct chatter]

760
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:58,517
...of the nose and sinus area 
caused by the microscopic...

761
00:33:58,517 --> 00:34:00,448
-Hey, Frank.
-Yup.

762
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:02,862
-Can I talk to you?
-Yeah. Give me a minute.
I'’m almost done.

763
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:05,413
Now.

764
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:08,655
Sure, what'’s so important?

765
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,034
There seems to be
a little problem.

766
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,827
-With what?
-With you.

767
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:13,620
Me? With what?

768
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,586
There'’s been a few complaints
from some of the other
gym members.

769
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:19,034
What? Like--
was the equipment
not wiped down?

770
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,689
It'’s kind of a different
problem than that.

771
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:24,000
We'’ve gotten a few
complaints about you using
the men'’s locker room.

772
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,758
I'’m a man.

773
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:28,517
Yeah, but with a vagina.

774
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:31,275
And so, technically,
you shouldn'’t even be in there.

775
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:33,206
What, you want me to use
the women'’s locker room?

776
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:35,103
You'’re not supposed
to be in there either.

777
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:36,482
So you don'’t want me
to use the men'’s locker room,

778
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:38,344
you don'’t want me to use
the women'’s locker room,

779
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,655
what kind of discrimination
is that?

780
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:43,068
It'’s just making some people
feel being uncomfortable.

781
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:44,896
You'’re saying you don'’t want me
to work out here anymore?

782
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:47,000
Yes, yes, that'’s what
I'’m saying.

783
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,241
I'’m sorry.

784
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,793
[scoffs]

785
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:52,310
Roger: 
Let'’s smell the money, baby.

786
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,551
I smell money for you 
and for me.

787
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,517
Call the offices 
of Roger Byamm.

788
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:58,931
I answer the phone myself.

789
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:02,103
You know what?
I ought to sue your ass.

790
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:04,758
I ought to sue you
for discrimination.

791
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:07,379
I'’m gonna sue you
into next Tuesday, big guy.

792
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:10,862
You know that?
And I'’m gonna sue you,
Mr. West Village.

793
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:14,034
And I'’m gonna sue you,
Mr. Tattoo Man.

794
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:15,586
And I'’m suing you, baby.

795
00:35:15,586 --> 00:35:18,551
But first, I am suing
that goddamn hospital!

796
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,965
Roger: [chuckling]
Okay, Earl.

797
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:24,172
Keep that neck brace on
and work on that limp.

798
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:25,413
Pain and suffering.

799
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:27,137
Pain and suffering
are good, Earl.

800
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:28,931
They are good.

801
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:31,724
-If you say so.
-I do say so. I know so.

802
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:33,896
Now, we'’ll work on
mental anguish next time,

803
00:35:33,896 --> 00:35:36,517
but for now,
what, Earl?

804
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:39,896
-Pain and suffering.
-Ha! There you go.
Way to go, Earl.

805
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:43,103
-Earl, what do I smell?
-Money?

806
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,206
Yeah, you'’re getting it.

807
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,793
Earl? [sniffing]

808
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:48,000
Money.

809
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,965
Yeah. That'’s it, baby.

810
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:52,620
Hey, Frank. How are you?
You look great.

811
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,034
Come on in.
All right.

812
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:58,068
Gosh, I'’m sorry for
the wait, everyone.

813
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,482
But remember,
it'’s Vicodin Monday.

814
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:05,517
So, Frank,
what can I do to help?

815
00:36:05,517 --> 00:36:08,379
Well, um...

816
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:12,655
you know, this isn'’t easy.

817
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:15,586
Suing people never is,
but that'’s what we do here.

818
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,103
Well, it'’s a little--
it'’s--it'’s--

819
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:18,689
it'’s personal.
It'’s embarrassing.

820
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:20,586
Nothing'’s embarrassing.

821
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:21,862
Well, it'’s sexual.

822
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:23,517
-Can'’t get wood?
-Hmm?

823
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:26,586
-Impotent.
-Oh, in a way.

824
00:36:26,586 --> 00:36:29,068
- Preservatives
in the food, maybe.
-What?

825
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:30,965
I got some cash
last year for this guy.

826
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:33,310
He had a really hot wife,
and she left him

827
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,206
because he lost the chub
in his chubby.

828
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:36,896
I blamed it
on salad dressing.

829
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:38,896
I know that sounds crazy,
but it worked.

830
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,413
Yeah. Well, it'’s--it'’s--
that'’s not it exactly.

831
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:44,931
Oh, well.
Look, don'’t worry about it.

832
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,379
This happens all the time.

833
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:48,344
We just have to figure out
someone to blame it on.

834
00:36:48,344 --> 00:36:50,413
No, no.
I know who to blame.

835
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:51,793
Great, makes my job
a lot easier.

836
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,413
Who are you thinking?

837
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:56,931
Look, it'’s--it'’s worse--
it'’s worse than that.

838
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,965
Is there anything worse
than a limp dick?

839
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:01,689
No dick.

840
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:03,344
I'’m Roger.

841
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:06,827
-At the hospital,
they cut off my dick.
-What?

842
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:09,310
I was going to give my ex-wife'’s
brother my kidney.

843
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,620
-I came out with a vagina.
-They did what?

844
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,034
They cut off
my dick and my balls.
They gave me a snatch.

845
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:20,655
[chuckles]
Okay. You'’re putting me on.

846
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,586
Man, you had me going.
This is a put-on.
[laughs]

847
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:27,413
Are there cameras here
somewhere, huh?

848
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:30,068
I'’m being Punk'’d, right?
This is kind of cool.

849
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:32,137
I know.
I was famous around here

850
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:35,034
but I didn'’t think
Ashton Kutcher
knew who I was.

851
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:36,379
What do I do,
just kind of what,

852
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,586
play along with it,
huh, Frank?

853
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:38,793
No. You don'’t understand.

854
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:41,655
I have a vagina, a beaver,
a snatch, a twat,

855
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:42,896
a muff, a gash, a cooz,

856
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,379
whatever you wanna call it,
I have one.

857
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,965
Sure you do,
I see it all the time.

858
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:47,931
[loudly] You know,
I think I'’m gonna check case law

859
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,931
to see if there'’s
a precedent for this.

860
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:54,344
-[belt clanks]
-[unzips pants]

861
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,551
Oh, my God.

862
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,448
I smell money.

863
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:11,793
Frank, this is big.

864
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,931
This is huge!
It'’s unbelievable!

865
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:16,068
I have never seen
anything like this,

866
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:19,103
because there has never
been anything like this.

867
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:22,379
There is no case law
for anything like this.

868
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:24,586
Oh, my God.
You have hit the lottery.

869
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:26,413
I'’ve hit the lottery.
We have hit the lottery.

870
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:29,275
You'’re gonna be rich, Frank.
I'’m gonna be richer.

871
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:32,689
Oh, there'’s gonna be
lots and lots and
lots of money.

872
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,965
Warehouses full of money.

873
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:37,517
Obama and every democrat
that ever lived

874
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:40,034
has never given away
the kind of money
we'’re talking about.

875
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:43,551
You'’re a one-man economic
stimulus package, Frank.

876
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:45,275
Do you smell it?

877
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:46,655
[sniffs]

878
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,413
-Breathe.
-[sniffs]

879
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,034
That'’s money.

880
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:54,448
Oh, Frank,
I smell money.
[laughs]

881
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:56,827
Johnny: 
Well, by now, 
Frank was desperate.

882
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:59,586
I am one with my open mind.

883
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,689
And Dr. Weller suggested 
to go to a support group.

884
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:03,068
All:
I am one with my open mind.

885
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:06,655
I am one with
my singing heart.

886
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:08,758
Johnny: 
And let me tell you, 
what a group.

887
00:39:08,758 --> 00:39:10,137
All:
...with my singing heart.

888
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:14,344
I am one with my
blossoming genitals.

889
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:19,034
All: 
I am one with my 
blossoming genitals.

890
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:20,793
Yes.
[exhales]

891
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,172
[exhales]

892
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,517
Uh, is this the...?

893
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:27,206
Oh, you must be Frank.
Welcome to the group.

894
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:29,241
Come on in
and have a seat.

895
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:36,241
Everyone, Frank is gonna
be a part of our little group.

896
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:39,965
Honey, ease up
on the testosterone shots.

897
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:41,862
You'’re there.

898
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:44,724
I like them manly.
I'’ll do you like a jackhammer.

899
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:47,310
[grunting]

900
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,241
-Ladies, ladies...
-I ain'’t no lady.

901
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:50,862
Sorry, Michelle.

902
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:52,517
It'’s Mitchell, and you
damn well know that.

903
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:54,655
Yes. Mitchell, please.

904
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:57,517
Frank is here for the same
reason that you all are.

905
00:39:57,517 --> 00:39:59,655
He wants a penis.

906
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:02,448
Well, no shit.

907
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:05,275
Exactly how much
testosterone do you take?

908
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:07,000
Hmm? None.

909
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,206
Well, how much
were you taking?

910
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,413
-None.
-Bullshit.

911
00:40:10,413 --> 00:40:12,482
Frank is a unique case.

912
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:13,724
Yeah. I'’m a, uh...

913
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:14,965
I'’m a unique case.

914
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:18,103
Yeah. You'’re the ugliest
woman I ever seen.

915
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:20,172
Don'’t let them hurt your
feelings, Frank.

916
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:22,862
They can be mean,
especially the little one.

917
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:24,965
Up yours, princess.

918
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:29,103
Michelle, Mitchell.
Please be supportive.

919
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:31,103
Ugly, so ugly.

920
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:32,689
-Well, thank you.
-For what?

921
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,827
-I don'’t wanna
look like a woman.
-You don'’t.

922
00:40:34,827 --> 00:40:36,551
Well, not a pretty one
for sure.

923
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:38,344
But you are pretty
in your own way.

924
00:40:38,344 --> 00:40:39,586
What freaking way
is that?

925
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:42,172
Frank is unique in
that he isa man

926
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:44,758
who happens to have
a vagina by mistake.

927
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:46,310
-Same here.
-No, no, no.

928
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,965
What she means is I'’m--
I'’m a man,

929
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:52,448
but because of an accident,
I have a vagina.

930
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:53,965
Same here, same here.

931
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:56,758
No, no, I--I--
I was born a man.

932
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:58,482
-What?
-With a penis.

933
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,034
-You were?
-Yes, I was a man.

934
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:03,034
-There was an accident.
-What sort of accident?

935
00:41:03,034 --> 00:41:04,793
A terrible accident.

936
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:07,034
Frank, you wanna--
you wanna share your story?

937
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes, Frank, please,
tell us how you lost
your dick.

938
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,000
Well, my brother-in-law,

939
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,517
my ex-brother-in-law, he--
he needed a transplant.

940
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,068
-He needed a dick?
-A kidney.

941
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:21,793
I'’m already confused.

942
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:23,793
-Go on, Frank.
-The admitting nurse,

943
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:25,241
she didn'’t speak English
very well.

944
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,241
-Fucking spics.
-No, she wasn'’t Spanish.

945
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,862
Koreans,
those fucking people.

946
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,103
Actually, she was, like,
Indian or Pakistani,
something like that.

947
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:33,620
Oh, like the ones
that answer the phone

948
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,103
when you call about
your credit card?

949
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:37,068
Yeah, like that.

950
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:38,724
Did she have a red dot
on her forehead?

951
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:41,103
-She did.
-They'’re so hot.

952
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:43,689
I would like to do one
of those women with a red dot.

953
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:47,965
Mitchell, please. Frank.

954
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:52,068
The next thing I knew,
it was gone.

955
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:53,689
So your brother-in-law'’s
got your dick?

956
00:41:53,689 --> 00:41:55,862
-They do dick transplant?
-I have no idea.

957
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:58,000
-Well, who'’s got your dick?
-I think they threw it out.

958
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,034
-Those bastards.
-Son of a bitches.

959
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,655
-I want that dick.
-I want that dick.

960
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:03,620
I hadthat dick.

961
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,137
Everybody, I think
we should have

962
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:10,310
a moment of silence
in memory of Frank'’s penis.

963
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,379
[soft music playing]

964
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:21,862
Doc, I went to that support
group you suggested.

965
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:23,482
Why can'’t I get
my surgery now?

966
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:24,827
Oh, Frank, Frank, Frank.

967
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:27,068
Just because you went to one
meeting with a bunch of pre-ops

968
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:28,862
who wanna have their
genders reassigned

969
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:31,448
doesn'’t mean you'’re
physically and emotionally
prepared for this procedure.

970
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,068
You'’ll have to do
more than that to get
approved for your operation.

971
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:35,965
Well, who decides
when I get approved?

972
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:37,172
-I do.
-You?

973
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:38,172
-Me.
-Just you?

974
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:40,448
Just me.

975
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:43,620
Woman [on speaker]: 
Dr. Hugh to Psychiatry. 
Dr. Hugh to Psychiatry.

976
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:47,206
Hey, girl.

977
00:42:47,206 --> 00:42:48,896
Hey, Frank.

978
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:51,344
So I'’m planning on having you
talk to someone from the NHL

979
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:53,551
-for the upcoming
winter sport season?
-Great.

980
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:55,241
But would you feel
more comfortable

981
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:57,689
if you had to interview
someone from the Croatian

982
00:42:57,689 --> 00:42:59,758
women'’s gymnastics team?

983
00:42:59,758 --> 00:43:01,551
No, the usual, Sugar Bowl,
stuff like that.

984
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:03,413
Sure, fine.

985
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:06,137
So listen, you'’re gonna
be on the 5:00, the 7:00,

986
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:07,586
and the 11:00 news.

987
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,551
This is huge.

988
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:12,344
Why didn'’t you tell us before?
You know we'’re in sweeps.

989
00:43:12,344 --> 00:43:14,068
Wait, what?

990
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:17,310
Your sex change operation.

991
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,275
That lawyer guy
who advertises with us,

992
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:22,241
Roger Byamm, we picked up
his press release
on the lawsuit.

993
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:26,724
Frank, you are a one-man
ratings bonanza.

994
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:29,551
Can you say local Emmy?

995
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:31,448
You know, Stan,
I think I'’d really rather

996
00:43:31,448 --> 00:43:33,448
keep this private,
if you don'’t mind.

997
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:35,206
And our viewers, I don'’t
think they want this.

998
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:37,068
They tune into us
for news.

999
00:43:37,068 --> 00:43:39,827
Oh, please, please.
Our viewers get their
news off the internet, Frank.

1000
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,793
They come to us
for entertainment.

1001
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:45,034
Frank, this is all
about the ratings.

1002
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:47,448
Some people
are gonna tune in
just out of curiosity.

1003
00:43:47,448 --> 00:43:49,275
Heck, we might even pick up
some freaky viewers.

1004
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:51,482
-Hey, I'’m no freak.
-I know.

1005
00:43:51,482 --> 00:43:54,137
All I'’m saying is,
Frank, the freaks,
they'’ve got TVs too.

1006
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:57,655
As a matter of fact,
we should be selling ad space

1007
00:43:57,655 --> 00:44:00,241
to all of those joints
that sell to the freaks,

1008
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:01,827
all that freaky stuff.

1009
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:03,137
Sales!

1010
00:44:03,137 --> 00:44:05,793
Frank, every talk show
is calling to interview you.

1011
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,482
We'’ve got messages
from Ellen, Regis,

1012
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:09,172
Katie Couric,
Letterman, Oprah.

1013
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:11,241
-Oprah?
-Yeah. And Dr. Drew
from Loveline.

1014
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:13,413
And speaking of that,
can I ask you a question?

1015
00:44:13,413 --> 00:44:14,655
What is it, buddy?

1016
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:17,206
Where exactly
is the G-spot?

1017
00:44:20,586 --> 00:44:22,517
I'’m not sure.

1018
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:24,620
Great. You have a vagina
and you don'’t even know.

1019
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,931
How am I ever gonna find it?

1020
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:27,137
My girl.

1021
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:29,241
My name is Frank.
I am not a girl, Jedda.

1022
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:31,172
Okay, let me just talk to you.

1023
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:35,310
This whole you got
a va-jay-jay thing
is not a big deal.

1024
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,758
My brother Earl
had the same operation

1025
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:40,896
and everything
turned out fine.

1026
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:43,206
He would show up
for Christmas dinner

1027
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:45,448
as Uncle Earl,
and then he would

1028
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:48,344
come back for dessert
as Aunt Earlina.

1029
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:50,413
And we all got two gifts.

1030
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:53,137
Oh, one thing.

1031
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:55,068
Yeast.

1032
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, my God. Frank...

1033
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:02,241
you'’re a cougar.

1034
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:08,241
-What are you doing?
-My desk now.

1035
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:11,206
Ned, we have a situation.

1036
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:13,793
[soft rock playing]

1037
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:25,137
You'’re my stud,
my main man.

1038
00:45:25,137 --> 00:45:26,310
Hmm, this is nice.

1039
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,103
I'’ve missed you.

1040
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:32,344
And your little Trin Trin
has missed her man, too.

1041
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:35,586
I tried calling and calling,

1042
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,758
but you never picked up.

1043
00:45:37,758 --> 00:45:40,896
Well, I had a lot
to think about.

1044
00:45:40,896 --> 00:45:45,758
Well, I hope you were
thinking about me
all that time.

1045
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:49,103
Well, I guess we need
to be a little patient.

1046
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:50,758
I'’m gonna get
that operation

1047
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:52,586
and everything'’s gonna
get back to normal.

1048
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:56,827
Mm-hmm.
Maybe even better.

1049
00:45:56,827 --> 00:45:59,068
Hmm?

1050
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:03,482
Maybe it can be like
the Six Million Dollar Man.

1051
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:06,034
We can build him,

1052
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:08,586
we can make him
better than he was.

1053
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:10,586
Well, I'’d like to think
I was okay before.

1054
00:46:10,586 --> 00:46:11,896
[laughs]

1055
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:14,068
No complaints.

1056
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:16,448
No complaints, mister.

1057
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:25,275
Oh, yeah.

1058
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:27,068
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:28,862
Oh, yeah.

1060
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,896
Oh, oh, oh, no,
oh, oh. Oh.

1061
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:40,344
-[Trinnie moans]
-Oh.

1062
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:44,827
Oh.

1063
00:46:45,896 --> 00:46:49,206
Okay. I'’m sorry, I can'’t.

1064
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,862
What?

1065
00:46:50,862 --> 00:46:54,275
I'’m sorry, I just
cannot do this. Wow.

1066
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:56,172
Can'’t do what?
Baby, it'’s me.

1067
00:46:56,172 --> 00:47:00,620
No, it'’s not,
at least not all of you.

1068
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,655
I'’m just--I'’m not--
I'’m not like this.
I'’m not.

1069
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:06,241
-Like what?
-I'’m not a lesbian.

1070
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,931
Me neither,
I'’m not even a woman.

1071
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:09,137
I'’m me, Frank.
I'’m a man.

1072
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:10,827
With a vagina.

1073
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,413
Frank, ugh!

1074
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,551
Even if I wanted
to experiment,

1075
00:47:15,551 --> 00:47:18,655
it would be with some
hot chick like Angelina Jolie

1076
00:47:18,655 --> 00:47:20,137
over wine or whatever.

1077
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,344
But not like this.

1078
00:47:21,344 --> 00:47:23,172
I'’m sorry, Frank,

1079
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,517
but this just
is not gonna work.

1080
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:26,793
I tried, but I don'’t know.

1081
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:28,000
I don'’t wanna see that, Frank.

1082
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,034
What?

1083
00:47:29,034 --> 00:47:33,206
Your snatch, Frank,
your snatch.

1084
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:36,758
I don'’t think I'’m ever
gonna forget it, ever.

1085
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:41,103
Where are you going?

1086
00:47:41,103 --> 00:47:43,620
To get drunk,
very drunk.

1087
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,586
-And then you'’re coming back?
-No.

1088
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:46,862
Well, then where
are you going?

1089
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:49,000
To therapy,
weeks, months,

1090
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,413
maybe years of therapy.

1091
00:47:50,413 --> 00:47:52,103
As much as my daddy
can afford.

1092
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,206
Well,
I'’ll call you tomorrow.

1093
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:56,413
-We can talk about it,
all right?
-No. Aah!

1094
00:47:56,413 --> 00:48:00,000
There it is again. Jesus.

1095
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,896
[sighs]
Goodbye, Frank.

1096
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:04,965
Goodbye.

1097
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,586
[door slams]

1098
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,793
Drive safely.

1099
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:17,344
So you'’re all
alone now, huh?
Me, too.

1100
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:19,862
I'’m all alone too,
who cares?

1101
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:24,137
So what?
The main thing is
we have each other.

1102
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:25,482
Right?

1103
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:26,724
You bet, buddy.

1104
00:48:26,724 --> 00:48:30,034
I mean, you remember
when Marge left me

1105
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:32,862
for that cable guy? Huh?

1106
00:48:32,862 --> 00:48:34,862
You were there for me.

1107
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:37,793
Oh, and Emily left me
for the mailman?

1108
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:40,793
You were there for me.

1109
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:44,379
When Joan left me for the guy
who mows the lawn.

1110
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,758
-The Mexican guy?
-I think he was Ecuadorian.

1111
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,551
But you were there for me.

1112
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,137
Women, they come and go,
they come and they go.

1113
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,482
But friends,
best friends, Frank,

1114
00:48:54,482 --> 00:48:59,551
like you, you'’re always
there for me.

1115
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:01,551
I always will be, buddy.

1116
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:03,310
How long have we known
each other, huh?

1117
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,758
Thirty years?

1118
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:07,965
-Thirty-one?
-Thirty-one years, wow.

1119
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:10,931
Long time.

1120
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:14,517
Hey, Frank,
what do you say?

1121
00:49:14,517 --> 00:49:16,172
How about we kick
things up a notch?

1122
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:21,068
-What do you mean?
-Notch, kick, up.

1123
00:49:25,103 --> 00:49:26,137
You wanna fuck me?

1124
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,379
[laughs]

1125
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:29,068
-What?
-What?

1126
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:32,275
Jesus Christ, Frank.
My God, what are you, crazy?

1127
00:49:32,275 --> 00:49:34,586
Okay. Sorry, sorry,
I thought--

1128
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:37,310
when you--
when you said--

1129
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,931
sorry.

1130
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:40,758
My God.

1131
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:42,551
Oh, man.
[chuckles]

1132
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:46,172
Hey, now that you
brought it up...

1133
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:48,275
-You do wanna fuck me?
-What? No.

1134
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:50,172
-No, I don'’t wanna fuck--
-You do.

1135
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:51,827
It'’s not like I wanna
kiss you or anything.

1136
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:54,793
I'’m just saying you got
a nice new shiny vagina,

1137
00:49:54,793 --> 00:49:56,655
it'’s a waste
just sitting there.

1138
00:49:56,655 --> 00:49:57,896
Let'’s take it for a spin.

1139
00:49:57,896 --> 00:49:59,689
I am not gay.
You are not gay.

1140
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:01,379
You weren'’t until,
like, a second ago.

1141
00:50:01,379 --> 00:50:02,965
No, I am not gay.

1142
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:04,896
You wanna fuck me?
We'’re not that drunk.

1143
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:07,620
Me fucking you,
not gay.

1144
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,206
Johnny fucking Frankie,
very gay!

1145
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:13,310
You have a vagina, huh?
Not gay.

1146
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,517
Buddy, all I'’m saying
is we have

1147
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:17,724
what married couples
wish they had.

1148
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:20,862
I mean, we'’re best friends,
we'’re buddies.

1149
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:22,344
I mean, think about it.
Picture this.

1150
00:50:22,344 --> 00:50:23,896
I don'’t want to picture it.

1151
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,000
Sundays, huh?

1152
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,413
What do you like to do?

1153
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:29,448
-Saints games.
-Saints games, me too.

1154
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:31,689
-What do you do
on Saturday?
-Golf?

1155
00:50:31,689 --> 00:50:34,793
Golf, 10:00 tee time,
sharp, me too.

1156
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:38,000
You like burgers,
I like burgers.

1157
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,206
[whispering]
I love burgers.
You are not fucking me.

1158
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:44,965
Both of you guys
are making me sick.

1159
00:50:44,965 --> 00:50:46,862
All right, 
I won'’t fuck you.

1160
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:48,931
You most certainly
will not fuck me.

1161
00:50:48,931 --> 00:50:51,758
So I says to him,
"Dad, the good news is

1162
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:54,620
you'’re finally gonna get
that son you always wanted."

1163
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,068
[all laugh]

1164
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:58,448
Hey, what do you say
we take a five-minute break?

1165
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:09,172
You look down, Frank.
What'’s going on?

1166
00:51:09,172 --> 00:51:10,931
I just want Weller
to give me that surgery

1167
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:12,655
so I can get
my life back.

1168
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:14,275
Well, that'’s natural.

1169
00:51:14,275 --> 00:51:15,620
But in the meantime,

1170
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,965
you need to focus
on your inner self.

1171
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:20,448
In fact,

1172
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:22,931
we'’re doing a day
of readings and poetry

1173
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:25,103
as a little fundraiser
for the center.

1174
00:51:25,103 --> 00:51:27,206
Why don'’t you
read something?

1175
00:51:27,206 --> 00:51:29,655
Express how you feel,
get it out of your system.

1176
00:51:29,655 --> 00:51:31,689
In public?
I don'’t think so.

1177
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:32,896
Yeah, come on.

1178
00:51:32,896 --> 00:51:35,103
Nobody would understand it.

1179
00:51:35,103 --> 00:51:36,310
Aww. Frank,

1180
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,827
it'’ll be a good way
for you to get know

1181
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:39,068
about other people
at the center.

1182
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:42,931
Plus, it might look good
to Dr. Weller.

1183
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:44,689
Weller.

1184
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:46,482
What'’s that tool'’s problem?

1185
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:48,310
Yeah, he'’s a tool
with a God complex.

1186
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,758
-What do you say?
-I don'’t know.

1187
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:53,068
Gabriella,
can you help Frank

1188
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,137
write something to read
at the fundraiser?

1189
00:51:55,137 --> 00:51:57,413
Yeah, I could totally help.

1190
00:51:57,413 --> 00:51:59,172
-Well...
-Great.

1191
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:02,034
Everyone, Frank has decided

1192
00:52:02,034 --> 00:52:04,344
to join you in your
upcoming performance.

1193
00:52:04,344 --> 00:52:06,793
-Oh, awesome.
-[applause]

1194
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:09,206
In the meantime,
why don'’t we figure out
a little group activity

1195
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,896
for everybody
to participate in
before the show?

1196
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:14,965
-Oh, putt-putt golf.
-Are you crazy?

1197
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,482
Those fucking golf clubs
are bigger than me.

1198
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,034
-That'’s not fair.
-Let'’s do batting cages.

1199
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:23,137
-You play ball?
-Does she play ball?

1200
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:25,172
Abbe'’s the Great Bambina.

1201
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:28,068
I'’ve been playing softball
18 years, pal.

1202
00:52:28,068 --> 00:52:29,275
And she ain'’t bad either.

1203
00:52:29,275 --> 00:52:33,034
-Her?
-No strike zone.

1204
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:40,241
Let me catch my breath.

1205
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,862
That was great, huh?

1206
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:43,724
-[laughs]
-Sure, Dad.

1207
00:52:43,724 --> 00:52:47,275
What? Cats in the Cradle.
You love that one.

1208
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:50,206
Well, not really.
I mean, not anymore.

1209
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:53,275
I liked it when
I was, like, seven,
but I'’m grown up now.

1210
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:56,172
Wow.

1211
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,793
Well, all grown up, yeah.

1212
00:52:58,793 --> 00:53:00,206
You'’re a man now, huh?

1213
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:02,103
That'’s right, Dad.
I am a man.

1214
00:53:02,103 --> 00:53:05,241
Well, let me ask you
something then.

1215
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:07,827
Man to man.

1216
00:53:07,827 --> 00:53:11,034
You'’re okay with everything?

1217
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:12,379
What everything?

1218
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:15,310
I don'’t know, I mean,
your mother and I we...

1219
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,482
we don'’t get on that well.

1220
00:53:17,482 --> 00:53:20,620
You know,
everything else?

1221
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,655
Look, you'’re my dad.

1222
00:53:23,655 --> 00:53:25,896
I love and I'’m proud of you.

1223
00:53:25,896 --> 00:53:30,413
I don'’t care what you have
or don'’t have down there.

1224
00:53:30,413 --> 00:53:33,206
It'’s never been a factor
in my life,

1225
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:35,931
and I wanna keep it
that way.

1226
00:53:35,931 --> 00:53:37,137
Deal?

1227
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,172
-Deal.
-All right.

1228
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:44,965
Wow, no more Storyland, huh?

1229
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:46,827
Nope.

1230
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:50,172
Okay, well, let me ask you
this then, man to man.

1231
00:53:50,172 --> 00:53:51,758
What are you into now?

1232
00:53:51,758 --> 00:53:53,275
-Man to man?
-Mm-hmm.

1233
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:55,724
Chicks.

1234
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:58,034
-[man chuckling]
-[beer bottle opens]

1235
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,034
Breakfast is the most important
meal of the day.

1236
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:03,448
You'’re sure you won'’t 
have a beer?

1237
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,965
No, no. It'’s a little early
for me, Pop.

1238
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:07,655
You know,
those are twist-offs.

1239
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:10,344
Twist off.

1240
00:54:10,344 --> 00:54:13,758
A bottle to me
is meant to be popped open.

1241
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:16,275
Hell, if I had a buck
for every bottle of beer
that I opened,

1242
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:18,413
I'’d owned a brewery.
[laughs]

1243
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:21,413
I could remember
when you were a kid,

1244
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:23,896
I use to open up
your root beer bottles
with this, remember?

1245
00:54:23,896 --> 00:54:25,862
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

1246
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,724
Those long-necked Barq'’s,
I remember.

1247
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:29,689
That'’s the one.
[chuckles]

1248
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:31,931
I'’d have my beer
and you'’d drink your root beer,

1249
00:54:31,931 --> 00:54:35,137
and we'’d be like
a couple of old-timers.

1250
00:54:35,137 --> 00:54:37,413
Made me feel like
a grown-up.

1251
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:39,034
Yeah. Yeah.

1252
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:44,137
What'’s the matter, son?
What'’s--what'’s eating at you?

1253
00:54:44,137 --> 00:54:46,793
Oh, you know, Pop.

1254
00:54:46,793 --> 00:54:48,586
Oh, that?

1255
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:51,551
Yeah. That damn shame.

1256
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:53,413
I'’m hoping they let me
have my surgery soon.

1257
00:54:53,413 --> 00:54:54,965
I just wanna be a man again.

1258
00:54:54,965 --> 00:54:56,931
You are a man,
a good man.

1259
00:54:56,931 --> 00:54:58,482
Well, it doesn'’t
feel that way.

1260
00:54:58,482 --> 00:55:02,965
You know, there'’s a lot
that goes into being a man

1261
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:04,310
besides having a johnson.

1262
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh, they took my balls too.

1263
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I got an idea.

1264
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,344
Come on with me.

1265
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:12,275
-Where?
-Come on, come on, come on.

1266
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,344
I'’ll show you. Come on.
Let'’s go.

1267
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,172
Hey, good morning, sweetie.

1268
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:18,241
Well, hello, Frank.
You'’re looking mighty good
today.

1269
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:20,103
How are you?
Thank you very much.

1270
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:21,586
Meet my son Frank.

1271
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:24,344
-Frank, Jr.?
-No, Frank the VI.

1272
00:55:24,344 --> 00:55:26,344
-The VI?
-Long story.

1273
00:55:26,344 --> 00:55:29,172
All the men in my family
are named Frank.

1274
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:32,068
Like George Foreman and all
his boys being named George.

1275
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:34,896
I don'’t know. We'’re Franks
and they'’re Georges.

1276
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,310
[laughs]

1277
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,517
Okay. Well, may I be
frank with you?

1278
00:55:38,517 --> 00:55:39,931
Why not?
Everybody else is.

1279
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,482
Yeah, yeah.

1280
00:55:41,482 --> 00:55:43,793
Oh, where'’s Hunter?

1281
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:46,724
-Where else?
-Oh, where else is right.

1282
00:55:46,724 --> 00:55:48,068
-See you later, sweetie.
-Have a good day, guys.

1283
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:49,000
Thank you.

1284
00:55:55,034 --> 00:55:58,241
Hot dog.
That'’s a good man.

1285
00:55:58,241 --> 00:55:59,793
Hey, Frank.

1286
00:55:59,793 --> 00:56:02,000
How'’s it going? Wanna do
some one-on-one with me?

1287
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,413
Come on.

1288
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:05,482
Lay off us old-timers,
will you?

1289
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:07,137
Hey, this is my son Frank.
He'’s a hotshot.

1290
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:08,517
He'’ll give you
some competition.

1291
00:56:08,517 --> 00:56:10,172
Oh, I don'’t know about that.

1292
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:11,965
How about Around the World?

1293
00:56:11,965 --> 00:56:13,517
-Huh?
-Why not?

1294
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:15,206
Take it easy on him,
will you?

1295
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:17,586
-Okay.
-All right.

1296
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:20,034
Hey, how about you guys, huh?

1297
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:22,379
How are you doing, Joe?
Let me give you a hand.

1298
00:56:24,896 --> 00:56:26,862
-Good luck.
-All right.

1299
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,689
I'’ll take your wallet.

1300
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:33,000
[indistinct chatter]

1301
00:56:57,862 --> 00:57:01,586
All right.
This is the one.

1302
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:03,241
Oh!

1303
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,620
I think I just got hustled.

1304
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,344
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1305
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:16,551
Playground.

1306
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:18,586
Warren Easton High School.

1307
00:57:18,586 --> 00:57:20,724
Warren Easton High School?

1308
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:22,206
Mm-hmm.

1309
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:24,724
Wait a minute.

1310
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:27,344
You'’re Hunter Mileaux.

1311
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:29,000
The one and only.

1312
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,172
I remember you.
You were all-state.

1313
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:38,379
-Life, huh?
-Life, man, Afghanistan.

1314
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,344
Land mine.

1315
00:57:43,551 --> 00:57:44,862
Wow.

1316
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:46,758
Yeah, it ain'’t how
I saw life going,

1317
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:51,862
but I'’m here talking to you.

1318
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:54,724
And I think I just kicked
your ass at basketball.

1319
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:57,862
-[laughs]
-I think you did.

1320
00:57:57,862 --> 00:58:00,482
See, life is not
about yesterday.

1321
00:58:00,482 --> 00:58:02,344
It'’s about today.

1322
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,517
It'’s about now.
It'’s about next week,

1323
00:58:04,517 --> 00:58:06,275
next year.

1324
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,103
I get out of here
next month.

1325
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:10,241
Got a job as
an accountant.

1326
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:12,655
Took the classes
while I was in here.

1327
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:17,103
I got a life
and a career.

1328
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:21,310
Don'’t get me wrong,
I miss the fast breaks

1329
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,620
and the slam dunks.

1330
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,551
Man, you used to fly
through the air,

1331
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:25,827
just hang there.

1332
00:58:25,827 --> 00:58:28,482
Listen to the roar
of the crowd.

1333
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:31,689
It'’s unreal, man.
Just unreal.

1334
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:33,758
But it'’s in here.

1335
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:35,206
Right here.

1336
00:58:35,206 --> 00:58:37,862
Nothing could take
that away from me.

1337
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:41,103
And no matter what
you see here,

1338
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:44,034
or what body parts
aren'’t here,

1339
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:45,689
I'’m here.

1340
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,517
I'’m right here.

1341
00:58:59,172 --> 00:59:00,827
Yo.

1342
00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:07,000
You guys have a lot
in common, you know?

1343
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,137
Nah. I'’m just
a sportscaster.

1344
00:59:09,137 --> 00:59:11,137
You know, a lot of people
don'’t know this,

1345
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:13,758
but Hunter was instrumental
to saving lot of lives.

1346
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,965
That mine went off
right under him,

1347
00:59:15,965 --> 00:59:18,275
and it took everything.

1348
00:59:18,275 --> 00:59:20,068
He crawled with
what he had left.

1349
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:22,758
He went down and radioed
for support.

1350
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:25,000
That tough SOB.

1351
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,448
But let me tell you something,

1352
00:59:26,448 --> 00:59:29,586
I'’ve been in combat
and I'’ve seen a lot,

1353
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:32,310
but I never saw anything
more beautiful

1354
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,965
than you being wheeled
into that operating room,

1355
00:59:34,965 --> 00:59:37,172
ready to give
one your kidneys.

1356
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:40,655
You went in there
to save a man'’s life.

1357
00:59:40,655 --> 00:59:43,931
Not for pay,
or patriotic duty,

1358
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:47,965
but just because
you'’re a man.

1359
00:59:47,965 --> 00:59:50,448
You'’re brave, son.
Real brave.

1360
00:59:50,448 --> 00:59:53,655
Okay,

1361
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:56,000
so they took
your junk instead.

1362
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,827
But that doesn'’t change
why you were there.

1363
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:02,896
Having a penis
makes you a male,

1364
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:04,620
but it doesn'’t make you a man.

1365
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:09,448
You'’re a man,
Frank Baum.

1366
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:11,310
Understood?

1367
01:00:14,379 --> 01:00:16,172

Hey, Frank, I just wanted
to come check on you.

1370
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, uh, I'’m not so sure
about this.

1371
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,034
I'’m thinking maybe I ought
to tell some funny stories
about athletes instead.

1372
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,517
There was this one time
in Puerto Rico,

1373
01:00:39,517 --> 01:00:41,862
I was at this bar mitzvah,
with Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson

1374
01:00:41,862 --> 01:00:44,413
-and Elton John.
We'’re at the piano...
-No. Frank, don'’t do that.

1375
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:46,689
Be a part of this.

1376
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:48,724
Use this experience.

1377
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:51,103
-For what?
-To learn.

1378
01:00:51,103 --> 01:00:54,413
Learn about yourself,
and maybe about your friends,

1379
01:00:54,413 --> 01:00:57,344
and the people who love you
and why they love you.

1380
01:00:57,344 --> 01:01:00,000
Oh, I say

1381
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,793
these are not the parts 
and poems of the body only,

1382
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,344
but of the soul.

1383
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:11,482
Oh, I say now, 
these are the soul.

Hey, Chad.
Check this out, man.

1422
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:40,034
Looks like a circus
came into town early.

Hey, what kind of freak show
are you guys putting on?

Hey, cool it guys, huh?

Dude, look at that one.
That is the ugliest one
I'’ve ever seen.

these freaks now?

So, first real date, huh?

1447
01:04:35,758 --> 01:04:37,482
First official date.

1448
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:39,724
Right, official date,
of course.

of unofficial dates.

Listen, kiddo.
-Yeah?

-Let'’s have a little talk.
-About what--no, Dad.

1452
01:04:46,517 --> 01:04:48,379
I already know this stuff.

how to be pleased without

Okay. Great.
[chuckles]

1456
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:00,827
So no other questions?

1457
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:02,965
Well, now that
you mention it,

1458
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,517
I do have one question.

1459
01:05:04,517 --> 01:05:06,620
What is it, son?

1460
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,965
-Dad, it'’s kind of
a tough one.
-It'’s all right.

01:05:09,965 --> 01:05:11,793
All right.

you might not have seen online.

I wanna talk to you
about Frank Baum.

He has a family,
and friends,

and a life he should
get back to.

cut your bullshit
and help the man?

is my friend.

we asked to go through this.
He didn'’t.

1519
01:07:23,379 --> 01:07:26,000
So why don'’t you help the man
get back to his life?

1520
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,034
It'’d be a nice thing to do.

And sometimes, Doc,

it just feels good
to do something nice.

He'’s growing up so fast.

1534
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,206
Seems like every time
I turn around,

1535
01:07:59,206 --> 01:08:01,965
I'’m missing something
in his life.

1536
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:05,241
That'’s easy to fix.

1537
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:08,068
-Don'’t turn around.
-[chuckles]

1538
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,000
You know, this whole...

1539
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,172
screwup.

1540
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:21,827
It'’s like I see
everything clearly now.

1541
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:24,103
I look at myself
and I say,

1542
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:26,620
"What the hell
was I thinking?"

1543
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:32,103
I should'’ve been focused
on you and Frankie.

1544
01:08:32,103 --> 01:08:34,655
How'’d you put up with me?

1545
01:08:34,655 --> 01:08:37,482
That'’s a good question.
[chuckles]

1546
01:08:37,482 --> 01:08:41,655
Uh... yeah.

1547
01:08:41,655 --> 01:08:45,896
Thanks for dinner.
I should head back.

1548
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:48,620
Um, Frank...

1549
01:08:49,931 --> 01:08:51,206
you look tired.

1550

[chuckles]

1551
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:56,137
And I think maybe
you should stay the night.

1552
01:08:56,137 --> 01:08:58,448
Oh, Diane, no way. No.

1553
01:08:58,448 --> 01:09:00,827
I couldn'’t--I can'’t--

1554
01:09:00,827 --> 01:09:02,344
you know, I mean,

1555
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:05,517
we couldn'’t,
you know...

1556
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,103
No, I know.

-Hello?
-Frank.

1562

-Dr. Weller.
-Yes?

1563
01:09:28,758 --> 01:09:31,413
I have some news I think
is going to make you

1564
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:34,620
and your friends
very happy.

1565
01:09:39,482 --> 01:09:42,068
Hey, Shane.

1566
01:09:42,068 --> 01:09:44,137
I want you to pull
some footage for me

1567
01:09:44,137 --> 01:09:45,551
and shoot my new promo.

1568
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:48,275
Oh, sure, but that
has to be cleared
by promotions and the...

1569
01:09:48,275 --> 01:09:50,275
Sure. Sure.

1570
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:54,034
Do you have to clear it
when you help out
your Uncle Frank?

1571
01:09:54,034 --> 01:09:56,551
Oh, he'’s not my uncle.
He'’s my friend.

1572
01:09:56,551 --> 01:09:59,275
Yeah, whatever
that is all about.

1573
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:00,827
-Huh?
-I just wonder why

1574
01:10:00,827 --> 01:10:02,482
a young up-and-comer
like you

1575
01:10:02,482 --> 01:10:04,586
would lasso yourself
to that guy'’s star.

1576
01:10:04,586 --> 01:10:06,965
He'’s old, he'’s a freak,

1577
01:10:06,965 --> 01:10:08,793
and he'’s on his way out.

1578
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:10,931
Okay, listen,
Biff Baxter,

1579
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:12,965
or whatever
your real name is,

1580
01:10:12,965 --> 01:10:15,379
I really hate
to do this but...

1581
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:17,413
you are a butthole.

1582
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,551
Hey, hey.

1583
01:10:18,551 --> 01:10:20,586
Shane, watch your language
there, buddy.

1584
01:10:20,586 --> 01:10:22,103
Well, he had it
coming to him, Frank.

1585
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:25,310
What has you rattling cages,
Biff?

1586
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:28,068
Dude, all I'’m saying
is your lame reports

1587
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:30,275
are gonna cost the station
the ratings bump.

1588
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:31,482
I got it.

1589
01:10:31,482 --> 01:10:33,620
I'’d love to stay
and debate you,

1590
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,482
but Shane
and I have practice.

1591
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,137
Oh, yeah, that charity
challenge bullshit.

1592
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,310
Bullshit?

1593
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:44,034
Yeah.

1594
01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:47,310
A bunch of
middle-aged men and him.

1595
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,758
I could beat you guys
single-handed, blindfolded.

1596
01:10:50,758 --> 01:10:53,620
But the rules state
I got to have nine on a team.

1597
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,965
Is that a challenge?

1598
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:59,068
Me and my friends are in.

1599
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:01,241
How do I know you'’ve got
what it takes?

1600
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:03,172
-Five Gs?
-Eight friends.

1601
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:04,724
Oh.

1602
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:06,517
Are we on?

1603
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:08,000
You win,
I leave Channel 7.

1604
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,931
I win,

1605
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:12,586

Frank, what if we lose?

1608
01:11:28,965 --> 01:11:30,551
Shut up, Shane.

So, now that Frank was gonna 
get his junk back,

1610
01:11:32,931 --> 01:11:35,379
we just had to help him 
get his job back.

1611
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,965
Frank, are these guys
gonna show up

1612
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,275
or are we gonna win
by forfeit?

-I don'’t know.

Oh, my God. Look at them,
they'’re like pros.

What can I do, Frank?
What can I do?

1617
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:44,241
You can act like a man.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1619
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:47,620

We need you
to get on base.

Right. You want me
to bunt or swing away?

1634
01:14:40,448 --> 01:14:42,862
Yeah, we need you
to take one for the team.

1635
01:14:42,862 --> 01:14:44,275
What does that mean?

1636
01:14:44,275 --> 01:14:46,103
Lean over the plate.
Let the pitch hit you.

1637
01:14:46,103 --> 01:14:47,655
What? Won'’t that hurt?

01:19:33,275 --> 01:19:35,137
-Well, thank you, ma'’am.
-Oh, thank you.

1709
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,103
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1710
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:39,068
I wanna give you something.

1711
01:19:39,068 --> 01:19:40,965
All right.
I appreciate that.
[chuckling]

1712
01:19:43,206 --> 01:19:46,482
-Oh, you are too kind.
-Thank you very much.

1713
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:51,275
Cheap-ass bitch.

1714
01:19:51,275 --> 01:19:54,551
I just love peanuts.

1715
01:19:54,551 --> 01:19:56,689
I always have.

1716
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:59,931
I should tell my daddy
that I want him to buy me

1717
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:01,413
a big old peanut ranch.

1718
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:02,620
Oh!

1719
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,137
But do you know,

1720
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:07,724
I do not know why
they call it peanut butter.

1721
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:10,137
You cannot cook with it,
believe me.

1722
01:20:10,137 --> 01:20:12,000
I have tried.
