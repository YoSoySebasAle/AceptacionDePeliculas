1
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:21,994
Hold it! Hold it!

2
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:23,822
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy.

3
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,738
FBI, all right.

4
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,924
Stop!

5
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,231
FBI!

6
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,015
I'm sorry, sir,
the plane has
left already.

7
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,277
You can't
go through!

8
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,410
We have one
passenger that
just went through.

9
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:30,672
I'm sorry, sir!
You can't
go through.

10
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:31,760
You can't
go through!
FBI!

11
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:32,891
We need security!
Security right away!

12
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,980
We have 3 people
who just went
through.

13
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,250
Come on.

14
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:44,947
Eat and run.

15
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,296
Whoa!

16
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,346
Hold it!

17
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:58,178
FBI. We're taking
your truck.

18
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:09,510
Freeze!

19
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:11,207
Come out of the car!

20
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,938
Price?

21
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,465
Special agent turgenson.

22
00:04:54,946 --> 00:05:00,038
Does this asshole look like
Vincent moretti to you idiots?

23
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,824
Were you with him
all the way?

24
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,695
Yeah...

25
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,524
Except for
the men's room.

26
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,011
Where is he?

27
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm not fucking around!

28
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:20,668
He's a key witness against
the barinas drug cartel.

29
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,973
You got him to turn

30
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:22,844
and hung him out
to dry.

31
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,585
We're giving him
protection.

32
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,718
Ha. And a stand-up
job at that.

33
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,851
Too bad
the hit last week

34
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:30,939
almost got
him killed.

35
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,375
So the system ain't perfect.

36
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,985
Mine is.

37
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,161
Find yourself
another dude.

38
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,119
No fucking way!

39
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,904
We've spent 2 years
on this guy.

40
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,253
Unh!

41
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,691
No wonder we kicked
your ass out.

42
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,345
Arrest him.

43
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:51,786
Powell?

44
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:55,920
Release him. Now.

45
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,748
This is an
FBI operation,

46
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:58,532
not NSA

47
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,838
I'm changing that.

48
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,713
Let him go.

49
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,025
I'm gonna
catch up with you.

50
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,898
I swear.

51
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:26,386
You ok?

52
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,170
Yeah. Be a lot
better if I knew

53
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,214
why I'm hiding
a witness

54
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:30,999
that could put
the hurt on barinas.

55
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,523
You are not doing
anything, price,

56
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,872
we are.

57
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,441
It's a work-for-hire,
like always.

58
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,877
Need-to-know basis.

59
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,749
That's bullshit.

60
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,881
Moretti was
one of our plants.

61
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:46,275
We have larger fish to fry
with the cartel.

62
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:47,972
Only those idiots
at the bureau,

63
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,540
they always miss
the big picture.

64
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:01,943
From now on, price,
remember this:

65
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,248
We don't ask about

66
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,641
the private clients
you run through our system,

67
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:07,862
don't ask about ours.

68
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,917
Tastes great, guys.

69
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,450
Everything ok?

70
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,887
Yeah? Good.

71
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,768
Welcome to the breezes.

72
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,074
Thank you.

73
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:46,814
Um...

74
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,206
Take care of them.

75
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,905
This way, please.

76
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,226
Ladies, gents...

77
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,751
Have a pleasant evening.

78
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,188
Thank you.

79
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,194
I can't believe it.

80
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:23,894
We're broke, and he's
giving away $50 cigars.

81
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,166
$38,000 loss this month
for the breezes.

82
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,778
$176,000 for the year.

83
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:38,953
And now this:

84
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:42,783
It's an I.R.S. Garnishment
for back taxes.

85
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,133
It's been...

86
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,482
Difficult.

87
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,919
Difficult?
It's disastrous.

88
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:49,964
Every penny we're making

89
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,140
gets swallowed up
by this...Eatery.

90
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:55,230
Kev, you know we can't
promote the restaurant.

91
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,448
It could expose US.

92
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:59,147
I just want some relief
for Christ's sakes.

93
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,105
You know the deal
with the NSA...

94
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,759
They get 2 freebies
a year from US,

95
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:05,457
and we get
unlimited access
to the network.

96
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,807
Yeah, and that's great,

97
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,939
except all we've done
this year are the freebies.

98
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,769
Forget it.

99
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,903
I need a drink.

100
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,914
Sorry, we're closed.

101
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:29,786
Even for
your best friend.

102
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,614
Sonny!
Hey.

103
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,616
Look at you.

104
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,315
Undercover
suits you well, I see.

105
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,578
Where have you been?

106
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:39,883
Seattle.

107
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:42,494
Seattle's got rain
and the icarus group.

108
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,846
I know the bureau
doesn't give a damn
about rain.

109
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,630
I heard you got
Paul elkert

110
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,677
to turn state's evidence
against the syndicate.

111
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,940
Nice work.

112
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,290
Thank you very much.

113
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,726
So how's biz?

114
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,554
Not bad. We're
winning awards,

115
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:03,472
but I got a feeling
that's not why
you're here.

116
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:05,953
Turgenson.

117
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:08,869
He's pissed
about moretti.

118
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,697
I knew the judge.
I intercepted it for you.

119
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,264
I thought i'd
give you a heads-up.

120
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,006
Well...

121
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:19,096
Too bad he can't
take a joke.

122
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,228
Hey, look, man.

123
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,316
You pulled
his pants down

124
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,839
in front of a lot
of people.

125
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:24,754
He wants payback.

126
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,843
Be careful,
all right?

127
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:27,975
All right.
Thanks.

128
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,195
Hey, come on.
Let me fix you something.

129
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,327
No, I'd love to,

130
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,763
but I got
a grand jury
waiting for me.

131
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,592
Justice
never sleeps, man.

132
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,593
Hey.

133
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,942
Hey, Sonny.
Anything interesting?

134
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,509
Yeah, sure,

135
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,554
if you call looking
at window washers
all day interesting.

136
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:43,817
What about
the periphery?

137
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,035
We got 2 guys
out back.

138
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,994
It's all clear.

139
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,866
All right.
Here we go.

140
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,738
I'm going inside.

141
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,262
Yeah, sure.

142
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:15,718
Sonny here yet?

143
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,198
Yeah,
he's inside, sir.

144
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,155
Good.

145
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:18,982
How about getting US
inside, too?

146
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:19,896
Or haven't
you guys heard,

147
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,984
"the cleaner"
is on our case.

148
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,594
I've heard,
and I'm not worried.

149
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:23,770
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:24,640
- Of course not.
- A bullet to his head

151
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,815
couldn't do
too much damage.

152
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,689
Shut up.

153
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,793
Hi.

154
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,316
All here.

155
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,840
We've been detaining
them separately for
the last 5 days.

156
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,625
Good. We don't want them
comparing testimonies.

157
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:54,452
They friendly?

158
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,932
They gonna finger
yoesky?

159
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:56,933
They like the deals

160
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:57,978
and the protection
we're offering.

161
00:11:58,021 --> 00:11:59,066
That's why there are
no lawyers here.

162
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,545
Good.
Let's do it.

163
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,852
We're gonna start
with paolo bucci,
then Renee Brooks,

164
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:06,116
end with elkert.
Got it?

165
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,297
You know anything
about a warrant

166
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,473
I'm supposed to get
on your buddy price?

167
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,171
I have no idea.

168
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,651
I'm going for a smoke.

169
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:28,356
Take bucci
and escort him to
the grand jury room.

170
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,189
I gotta go.

171
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,149
Look, genius,

172
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:42,805
unless you want me
to ruin your
snappy shoes,

173
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:46,896
I suggest
you let me out.

174
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:56,166
What? You wanna
hold the toilet
paper for me?

175
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,908
Uptight pricks.

176
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,448
Please place
your left hand on the Bible

177
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,887
and raise your right hand.

178
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:31,941
Do you solemnly swear

179
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,856
that the testimony
you shall give

180
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,466
this court and jury
today

181
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,816
in this matter on trial

182
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,992
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

183
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,210
and nothing but the truth,

184
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,429
so help you god?

185
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:42,909
I do.

186
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,824
Please be seated.

187
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,767
Mr. Bucci, let's begin
with the description

188
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:19,380
of your duties
with the icarus group.

189
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,390
Come on!
Don't just
stand there!

190
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,305
Do something!

191
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,573
Outside!

192
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:39,443
Get outside!

193
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,532
There's a sniper!

194
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,808
Who are you?

195
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:01,030
You can't just
kill me like this.

196
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,821
No, don't!

197
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,171
Don't!

198
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,925
Help! Help!

199
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,491
Here comes the cleaner!
Watch out! Watch out!

200
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:28,884
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

201
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,408
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

202
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:32,279
Shut up!

203
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,150
Check in
the bathroom!

204
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,239
Check if
she's there!

205
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,679
Damn it!

206
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:45,422
God! Would somebody turn off
that fucking alarm?

207
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:51,559
Hey!

208
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,690
I got a court order
right here

209
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,257
authorizing his release.

210
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,868
We cannot guarantee
his safety if he's
not in our custody.

211
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,000
Are you kidding me?

212
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,697
He stays
in your custody,

213
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:00,829
he gets killed.

214
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,787
Let's go.

215
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,573
Son of a bitch.

216
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,967
Who the hell
did this?

217
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,318
It's got the cleaner
written all over it.

218
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,450
As in
the assassin?

219
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:15,409
No, as in Sara Lee,
you idiot.

220
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:19,500
So tell me, you saw nothing
but window washers all day,
jerkoff?

221
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,544
Yeah.

222
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:23,069
Well, I think
you missed something.

223
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,901
What are you
looking at?

224
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:53,751
Price, we need to talk.

225
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,884
Do you know who I am?

226
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,669
Yeah. Paul elkert.

227
00:16:58,713 --> 00:16:59,670
Good.

228
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,020
Then you know
why I'm here.

229
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,023
Not really.

230
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:08,288
Did you read
the morning's paper?

231
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,856
Look...

232
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,815
I'm a restaurateur.

233
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:14,816
Come on, price.

234
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,471
You know the situation,
don't you?

235
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:21,170
It's all right there,
The gunman...

236
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:24,608
It's the cleaner.

237
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:25,696
Right.

238
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,091
I'm telling you.
I saw him.

239
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:32,138
You saw the cleaner?

240
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,661
Yeah.

241
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,445
It was dark.
He had a hood on.

242
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,447
But it was him
all right.

243
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,101
He walked right up to me,

244
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,711
put a gun to my head,

245
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,496
and then he frisked me.

246
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,845
What was he after?

247
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:45,890
I don't know.

248
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:46,848
You're right.

249
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:47,936
If he didn't
find it though,

250
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,111
you wouldn't
be alive now,
would you?

251
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,157
That's very perceptive
of you, price.

252
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,550
He probably missed it
because it was...

253
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:56,597
Taped under
that rug of yours.

254
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,948
Now I am impressed.

255
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:02,081
I'm not.

256
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,821
What is it?

257
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,824
The key to my
safety-deposit box.

258
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:10,611
The money you stole
from yoesky.

259
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,744
So, price, you gonna
help me or not?

260
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:15,920
Your case is too hot.

261
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:21,839
Icarus wants you bad,
the FBI even worse.

262
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:23,624
I'll pay you.

263
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,191
My understanding
is you're having

264
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,540
some financial
trouble.

265
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,933
I.r.s. Liens,

266
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,370
fed pressure.

267
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:33,242
I can make it
all go away.

268
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,765
$1 million.

269
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,158
$5 million.

270
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,638
5.

271
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:40,162
Plus, half the money
you stole

272
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,903
to a charity
of my choice.

273
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,905
You're out
of your mind.

274
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,950
Then you're out of luck.

275
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:48,866
Good-bye.

276
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,085
Shit.

277
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,217
Wait!

278
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,436
Price!

279
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:54,829
Ok.

280
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:56,787
It's gonna take me
some time.

281
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:57,875
48 hours.

282
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,791
I could be dead by then.

283
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:03,272
No, you'll be safe.

284
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:27,688
Unh!

285
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,966
Unh!

286
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,721
Mr. Price...

287
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:03,202
Will you behave
if Ivan and nicholai
let you up?

288
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,727
Well, I'm not the one
breakin' arms here.

289
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,902
Do you know who I am?

290
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:11,819
Ed McMahon
and the prize patrol?

291
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,212
I got an idea.

292
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,344
Where's my money?

293
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:20,131
Behind door
number one, asshole.

294
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:26,964
Unh!

295
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,942
That's enough.

296
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,510
Can we talk?

297
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:53,208
I don't know where
elkert put the money.

298
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,472
I can't tell you
where he is.

299
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:06,090
We are going
to find him...

300
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,092
Then we'll be back.

301
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:11,879
Have a good evening,
Mr. Price.

302
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,592
This will
piss off the feebs
to no end.

303
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:32,465
I'll understand
if you don't want in.

304
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,597
Aw, screw 'em.
We need the moola
anyway,

305
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,512
but can I ask you
something first...

306
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,341
The D.C. home
for boys?

307
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,429
It's an orphanage.

308
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,649
Yeah, I know that.
It's a lot of money.

309
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,912
Hey, we get 5.

310
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,872
Ok, we're goin' deep
on this one.

311
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,917
Deep? Shit.

312
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,005
We're not even
supposed to know

313
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,049
where they
end up, anyway.

314
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,834
That's NSA
policy, right?

315
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:54,748
But we do.

316
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,097
They don't know that.

317
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,360
True, but this time,
we won't,

318
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,319
and neither will they.

319
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,668
I don't get it.

320
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,713
It's icarus
and the cleaner
we're dealing with,

321
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:07,326
so I'm making sure
elkert goes beyond
the vanishing point.

322
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,675
How?

323
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:11,330
We'll get to that.

324
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,896
Connie...

325
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,944
Get your
com lines open
to these providers.

326
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,598
Secure lines only.

327
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,468
On it.

328
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,817
Kevin, transportation.Yeah.

329
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:23,907
Minimum 5,000 access points
and reservations.

330
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,997
All modes. Everything
cancelable in 30 days.

331
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,608
Shit. Tall order.

332
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:30,261
Yep.

333
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,089
That's
why Charlie's

334
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,962
crunching
route permutations
on daedalus.

335
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,442
Patch me through.

336
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,710
Can we get started,
please?

337
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:48,062
All right. We'll be using
a mersenne prime algorithm.

338
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:51,544
That makes shadow tracking
that much more difficult.

339
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,415
Elkert will get
a handheld unit

340
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:56,679
with an encrypted
flash-memory card.

341
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:02,859
He'll have more than
150 links along the way.

342
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,906
We'll need
all our resources.

343
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:09,910
Call on the least-used providers
in the NSA system...

344
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,913
Providers who won't even know
what it's all about

345
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:15,829
but are looking
for a trigger code,

346
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,396
a break in the chain,

347
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,137
an infiltrator that needs
to be disposed of.

348
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:23,967
If there is a match,

349
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,882
he gives up a new envelope.

350
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,884
He'll get
birth certificates,

351
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,930
passports, subscriptions,

352
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:31,758
then on to the next link.

353
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,108
I've run
the provider list,

354
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:37,807
but there are 2
noted as "unknown."

355
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:42,333
That's our ace
in the hole...

356
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:45,162
Something I've been saving
for a rainy day.

357
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,514
Static drops...

358
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,168
Providers who
can't give up information

359
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,909
even if they wanted to.

360
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,043
If you remove
the human element,

361
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,131
there can be no betrayal.

362
00:23:57,174 --> 00:24:01,614
He must enter
the correct code here...

363
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,924
Or he dies.

364
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,884
If he gets through
without mistakes,

365
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,974
his trail will forever
be erased.

366
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:18,500
He'll be a ghost.

367
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:35,952
I ought to install
a revolving door.

368
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,434
You boys
got reservations?

369
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,175
Shut up.

370
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:45,875
I told you I'd be back
to see you real soon.

371
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,973
Now we can do this
the easy way...

372
00:24:57,974 --> 00:25:01,195
Or we can do this
the hard way.

373
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,070
This pillow talk, Sam?

374
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,738
If you think
you're gonna try...

375
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:25,741
Relax.
I'm not gonna interfere,

376
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:28,570
but I got an interest.

377
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,485
Really? What's that?

378
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,489
Let's just say price
tricked US, too.

379
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,535
Elkert's so deep,
we can't even
track him.

380
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,101
Now I wanna
talk to him.

381
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:44,499
Yeah? Well,
I want the skinny
on price and his people.

382
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,987
Hey, buddy.

383
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,294
Sonny.

384
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,256
I tried to warn you,
man.

385
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:07,609
Yeah, and now
you're here to offer
me a friendly deal.

386
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,306
Nah, nothin' like that.

387
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,877
Though, you did
put a whole new twist
on this icarus affair.

388
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:17,793
Elkert's still alive.

389
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:24,191
I might not be,
though.

390
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,586
Jason price.
FBI academy '81.

391
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,459
Top of his class.
Youngest special
protection agent

392
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,156
in division history.

393
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,157
8 commendations

394
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,811
including
a presidential citation,

395
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:39,423
but was suspended twice
for insubordination.

396
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,295
What do I look like,
an idiot?

397
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:43,689
I know all this shit.

398
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,648
Gimme the post-bureau stuff.

399
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,216
Icarus knows
I was a plant.

400
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:53,307
The cleaner's been
contracted to whack me.

401
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:56,876
Jesus, Sonny.

402
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,747
Do I have "stupid"
written on my forehead?

403
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:02,098
Look. Wiretap
on yoesky's phone.

404
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:04,753
Conversation took
place this morning
with the cleaner.

405
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:07,277
Find him, and while
you're at it,

406
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,976
there's another haircut
I want you to schedule.

407
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,455
The cleaner, filtered:
We already discussed
that.

408
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,544
His type is usually
not a Mark.

409
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:16,983
I'll double
the fee. Just do it.

410
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:21,465
We picked him up right after
the second suspension...

411
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,207
Put his skills to use
in east Germany.

412
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,906
With NSA funding,
he devised

413
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:30,387
the most sophisticated
protection system
in the world,

414
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,998
called "daedalus."

415
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:35,262
It was used for
hiding western agents
who had been exposed.

416
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:36,959
Never lost a runner...

417
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:39,875
But when the wall
came down,

418
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,008
the usefulness
of the program
came into question,

419
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:46,403
so price made a deal with
the NSA and went private.

420
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,710
Son of a bitch.

421
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:49,972
What about
his people?

422
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:53,280
That information
is beyond even
my clearance.

423
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:56,631
I don't know what the hell
you want me to do.

424
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,893
Yes, you do.

425
00:27:57,937 --> 00:28:00,591
You're FBI, Sonny.

426
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,071
I'm not touching this.

427
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,856
You would give
a scumbag like elkert
a fighting chance.

428
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,074
You won't even help
your best friend?

429
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:06,380
How could you put me
in this position?

430
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:08,599
Because I don't have
a fucking choice!

431
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,819
You know how screwed up
the FBI is.

432
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:11,820
I mean, hell.
Your own kid Charlie

433
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,387
just hacked the system
last month,

434
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,346
and he e-mailed
the director a list
of protected witnesses

435
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,652
just to piss him off.

436
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,872
The fucking system
is a joke.

437
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:25,181
Please. I got
nowhere else to turn.

438
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:34,538
So you know where all
the guys are he stashed?

439
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:37,933
You wanna find elkert
or don't you?

440
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:52,818
Rival agencies
sharing
a private moment.

441
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:53,862
How touching.

442
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:56,082
What happened
to elkert, price?

443
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,912
What happened
to "I don't ask,
you don't ask?," frank?

444
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,914
That only
works one way.

445
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,263
Well, then, it's my way.

446
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:06,657
You have a good thing
going here, price.

447
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,137
I wouldn't spoil it.

448
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,836
You have
a lot more to lose.

449
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,576
Fuck you.

450
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,013
I designed daedalus,

451
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,798
so if you wanna
play hardball,
remember this...

452
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:20,933
The only losers
will be the marks
I ran under for you.

453
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:21,977
Is that a threat?

454
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,587
No.

455
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,852
I just think that...

456
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,681
On a need-to-know
basis,

457
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:33,075
there's some pretty
important people

458
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,208
who'd rather
not be known.

459
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:38,689
He's free to go.

460
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,909
What?

461
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:43,912
We had a deal.
We had an understanding.

462
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:47,089
I changed my mind.
Agency prerogative.

463
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,875
This is fuckin'
blackmail!

464
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:53,835
I'm goin'
to the director.

465
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,620
All right.
You do that.

466
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:03,497
I'd watch my next few steps
very carefully.

467
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,630
We will be.

468
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,299
Do what I told you?

469
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,824
Yeah.
Utilities on,

470
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,914
bank accounts open,
mail's running,

471
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:31,481
gym membership,
I even went
to the dentist.

472
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,875
Yeah, like
you're staying put.

473
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,921
Except I'm somewhere
else, right?

474
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,009
That's right.

475
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,053
But where
am I gonna be?

476
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:40,360
Here...

477
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,973
Rub off the gold seal.

478
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:48,585
Use your thumb so you
don't damage the chip,

479
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,197
then pop the card in.

480
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:01,903
Connecticut?

481
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:04,601
Just the first leg
of many.

482
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:07,387
How are you gonna
know if I make it?

483
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,345
I will. I will.

484
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,391
You see the car
in the parking lot?

485
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:14,916
Key's in the visor.

486
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:20,052
Will I ever
see you again?

487
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:23,969
No.

488
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:32,107
Remember sister Sarah
from the boys' home?

489
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:37,460
She gave me this thing
when I was 8 years old.

490
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,377
She said as long
as I wore it,

491
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:45,468
I'd always
be taken care of.

492
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:48,036
I want you to have it.

493
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:52,911
Thanks.

494
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,437
Good luck, Sonny.

495
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,918
Yeah. See ya.

496
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,851
Burned-out car
was found in
a ravine yesterday

497
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:22,157
by a couple
of hikers.

498
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,465
The coroner puts
the time of death
at 52 hours.

499
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:28,424
Jesus.
Are you sure?

500
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:30,513
Yeah. It threw US
at first

501
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,559
because there were
2 sets of I.D.S...

502
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:35,562
One for Carl sands
from Connecticut...

503
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:39,740
Then we found
Sonny's FBI badge
halfway up the hill.

504
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,698
It can't be.

505
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:46,007
We ran a dental check
on some teeth we found.

506
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:50,881
Care to comment
on these, golden boy?

507
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,796
Fuck you.

508
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,885
He was a friend.

509
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,713
He's a dead friend now.

510
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,367
You've got a lot
of explaining to do,

511
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,980
and this time, you won't
have the NSA around
to cover your ass.

512
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:06,071
Ok, ok. Come on, Jason.
Come on.

513
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:11,032
Have a nice day.

514
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:16,951
But we double-checked
everything.

515
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,170
What happened?
What went wrong?

516
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:20,172
Well, that's just it.
Nothing could have.

517
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,957
I've done this
too many times.

518
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,791
The only way the cleaner
could have gotten to Sonny

519
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:32,836
is if he was
already inside.

520
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,883
But how is that
possible?

521
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:39,104
I don't know...

522
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:40,757
But I'm gonna find out.

523
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,413
Yeah.

524
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,937
Kev,
we're reconstructing
Sonny's route.

525
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:48,069
I need
all transpo details

526
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,549
uploaded to Charlie
for processing.

527
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:54,032
I'm on it. I should
have the first leg
within the hour.

528
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,911
What a dump.

529
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:06,392
Let's go.

530
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:17,707
You sure this is it?

531
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:20,536
Kevin confirmed
the point with Charlie.

532
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,843
It's a provider.

533
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,976
Step back.

534
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:41,557
Wait here.

535
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,531
Ok, Jason.
I got it.

536
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,185
The next provider
is in Pittsburgh.

537
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:04,189
163 red maple street.

538
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,521
Good afternoon.
What'll it be?

539
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:33,914
Daedalus.

540
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:37,439
Well, I'll be.
I never thought
I'd hear that word.

541
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:45,708
So, um, what do I do?

542
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:46,796
Show me
your provider kit.

543
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,929
Yeah.
That's right.

544
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:57,242
Check him.

545
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:08,253
He's dead, Jason.
Let's go.

546
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,820
I know.
Let's get outta here.

547
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:18,567
Jason, there's a break
at the 5th point,

548
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:19,916
but you gotta hurry.

549
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,397
Thanks, Charlie.

550
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:23,224
What is it?

551
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,921
We've reconstructed

552
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:27,228
the 3rd and 4th link
of Sonny's path.

553
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:31,363
Those providers
are dead, too.

554
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,541
We gotta get
to the next one fast.

555
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,217
If you don't
get the rustproofing,

556
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,653
you're gonna be unhappy
about the whole thing.

557
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:02,220
Now, you trust me
on this. You get
the rustproofing,

558
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,222
it's all gonna
work out for you,
see it? All right.

559
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:09,009
Well, personally,
I think you're gonna
be very happy.

560
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:18,845
I'm lookin' for Jerry.

561
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:21,456
That'd be me.
Can I help y'all?

562
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,025
Yeah, let's chat
about daedalus.

563
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:29,377
I'm sorry.
I...I don't understand.

564
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:31,161
The hell you don't.

565
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:34,339
Unh!

566
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,874
Raaaaugh!

567
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:11,463
So, you're a big
talker, Jerry?

568
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:12,202
No, no.

569
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,466
Well, are ya?
No, no.

570
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,123
Who'd you
talk to, Jerry?
No one!

571
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,864
Who?
No one!

572
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:30,482
It was a voice...
Fake voice...Fake voice.

573
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,744
What did they want?

574
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:32,658
I don't know.

575
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,834
You don't know? I don't know.

576
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,100
They want me
to use the flash card.

577
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:42,363
They want me
to use the flash card.

578
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,365
You know the rules.

579
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:46,236
Why'd you do it?

580
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:50,850
What did you
give him, Jerry?

581
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:54,984
Nothin'. I give him
nothin'. Nothin'.

582
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,560
I gave him the address
that came up.

583
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:08,563
I thought it was for TV.

584
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,956
Sorry.

585
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,612
Anyone else show up?

586
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,527
Later. This guy...

587
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,313
I...i gave him the stuff.
That's it. I swear.

588
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,924
I swear.

589
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:22,751
Unh!

590
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:25,711
Give me
your provider kit.

591
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:34,459
If I find out you lied,
I'll be back...

592
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:37,157
And it ain't
gonna be for TV.

593
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,988
Unh!

594
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:16,805
Yeah, Jason, it's me.

595
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,154
Go ahead, Charlie.

596
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:20,679
There's some
good news, and
there's some bad news.

597
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,028
First, the good.

598
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:23,769
Daedalus'
extrapolation couldn't
pinpoint a hole.

599
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:26,902
The codes received
were all in order.
No penetration.

600
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:29,470
Charlie, he knew
Sonny was going there,

601
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:32,212
but don't tell me
he couldn't have
cracked the system.

602
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:34,214
Anything is possible.

603
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:36,129
Sonny wasn't supposed
to be in Virginia.

604
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:39,437
The code should
have directed him
to south Dakota

605
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,263
where he'd link and...

606
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,396
Wait, wait.
South Dakota?

607
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,268
Yeah, Kevin's checking
all the transpo routes,

608
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,792
but so far,
there's no redirect

609
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:48,924
in the database
for Arlington.

610
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:51,318
That doesn't make sense.

611
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,102
Unless...

612
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,408
Unless what?

613
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,063
Sonny...

614
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,893
He figured it out.

615
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:41,063
I'll check
the back door.

616
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:42,848
Be careful.

617
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,836
Let go of me!

618
00:42:57,879 --> 00:42:59,141
Who the hell are you?

619
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:02,188
If you'd get off of me,
I'd tell you, you jerk.

620
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:06,932
I thought you were
with the FBI or icarus.

621
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,631
Don't sweet-talk me.

622
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:11,893
What's your name?

623
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:13,242
Renee Brooks.

624
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:16,071
I was one
of Paul elkert's
associates at icarus.

625
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:19,466
The cleaner
tried to kill me
at the courthouse,

626
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:21,642
but I got the hell out.

627
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:22,774
How'd you manage that?

628
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:25,820
I was in the bathroom.
I heard gunshots,

629
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:28,649
so I climbed
through the window
as fast as I could.

630
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:31,696
Still doesn't explain
what you're doin' here.

631
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:33,959
Are you always
this sympathetic?

632
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:37,353
No wonder
you and elkert
got along so well.

633
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:40,269
How'd you know
about me and elkert?

634
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:42,663
He told me he was
coming to see you

635
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:48,321
and that
I should, too,
because I got this.

636
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:53,065
What is it?

637
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:58,592
It's a key to
a safety-deposit box
in the Caribbean

638
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,463
worth $100 million.

639
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,291
Do you expect
me to believe

640
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:05,773
that elkert would
hand you a key
to money he stole?

641
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:06,861
He trusted me.

642
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:09,385
I took care of his
finances at icarus.

643
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:12,911
Besides, the bank
requires 2 keys.

644
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,564
Why would
he hand one to you?

645
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,523
He didn't have a choice.

646
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:18,394
He keeps one with him.

647
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:21,441
The other one was
in his safe at icarus.

648
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:22,964
When the FBI raid
went down,

649
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,270
I grabbed
what was inside.

650
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:26,402
And now you're
gonna get it to him?

651
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:27,708
No doubt for a price.

652
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:31,016
10% is my standard
safekeeping fee.

653
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,888
When did you
last talk to him?

654
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:35,629
The day of the hit.

655
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,978
I was supposed
to come to you

656
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:38,197
after he was
safely hidden,

657
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,026
but you
weren't around.

658
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,158
And why should
I lead you to elkert?

659
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:45,247
For the money
he owes you.

660
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,989
What if I don't?

661
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,861
He'll contact
me anyway.

662
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:52,472
I'll just
have to wait.

663
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,961
You don't really buy
that phony story.

664
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:06,181
Of course not...

665
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:08,967
But there's a link
to elkert there.

666
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,359
We need to keep
her close

667
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:12,187
in case he does
contact her.

668
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:13,754
I don't see why.

669
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:18,628
The cleaner
is inside, going after
our biggest fish,

670
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:21,109
and that means the FBI
has a shot at him.

671
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:25,244
It also means all
our people are exposed.

672
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:27,942
I need to put
a stop to this

673
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:29,727
before someone else
gets hurt.

674
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,048
So?

675
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:50,356
I haven't decided yet.

676
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:51,444
Where's your car?

677
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,490
Got a rental.

678
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:56,231
She your girlfriend?

679
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:57,319
What's it to you?

680
00:45:57,363 --> 00:45:59,408
Just wondering why
she doesn't like me.

681
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,715
Like's got nothin'
to do with it.

682
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,804
It's trust she's thin on.

683
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,501
I think it's you
who's lacking.

684
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:09,027
Maybe, but I want
the truth...

685
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,030
And I don't think
I'm getting it.

686
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:53,941
You ok?

687
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:57,597
That truthful enough
for you?

688
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:09,827
Tell me more about elkert...

689
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,785
What you did for him.

690
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,308
I set up shell companies

691
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:16,268
that billed icarus
for services in
out-of-the-way places,

692
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:19,271
like Africa
and the middle east.

693
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:20,925
Trouble spots.

694
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:23,928
Places no one would
go check.

695
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,104
It worked
for a long time,

696
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:31,849
then he got reckless.
Kept wanting more,

697
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,807
taking bigger risks.

698
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,941
Greed?
Control.

699
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:39,291
He was consolidating
power and assets

700
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,336
to challenge yoesky.

701
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,556
What happened?

702
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,818
Sonny.

703
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,690
He was playing
both sides
against each other,

704
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:51,390
setting icarus up
for the FBI.

705
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,524
When did elkert find out?

706
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:58,701
Not until it was
too late.

707
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:00,486
Sonny lured elkert

708
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:03,576
with a billion-dollar
weapons buy

709
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,926
involving 4 countries.

710
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,189
The feds were waiting.

711
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,843
Elkert was floored.

712
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:14,282
He trusted Sonny
like his own.

713
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,155
He made everyone
look bad.

714
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:23,944
So that's why yoesky
put the hit out.

715
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,601
And the cleaner?

716
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:29,950
What do you mean?

717
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,431
You were on the inside.

718
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:33,693
You must have heard stories.

719
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:39,786
Just a killer.
Expensive. Never misses.

720
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:44,399
No one knows who it is.

721
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,055
That's a stock answer.

722
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,971
I was hoping for an idea
of who I'm dealing with.

723
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:53,060
I couldn't tell you
who it is,

724
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:54,366
but I'll tell you this.

725
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:57,064
I think the cleaner's
looking for a way out.

726
00:48:57,108 --> 00:49:00,589
What makes you say that?

727
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:01,590
Because it's
what happens

728
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,505
when you work
for the mob.

729
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:06,334
You do things you
don't really want to do

730
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:09,947
just so you can believe
you're actually getting
somewhere,

731
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,470
when in fact
you're only biding time

732
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:14,952
until you can no longer
do what they ask.

733
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:19,739
And then
you're eliminated.

734
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:24,265
Kind of sounds
like an excuse.

735
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:28,704
Maybe, but it happens
to everyone.

736
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:32,665
Elkert, Sonny, me.

737
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:36,582
It'll happen
to the cleaner.

738
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,244
Do you, um,
have a rest room?

739
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,073
Through there.

740
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:50,813
Thank you.

741
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:41,734
Hello?

742
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:42,996
Kev, listen.

743
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,432
I need you to call Charlie
on the secure line.

744
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:47,305
I want the two of you
to gather all statistical data

745
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:48,610
on Sonny's run.

746
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:49,829
Specifically?

747
00:50:49,872 --> 00:50:51,918
Route corridors, phone calls,
bank charges,

748
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:53,050
credit card bills,
whatever.

749
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,008
I'm looking
for anything abnormal

750
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,836
that'll confirm my suspicion.

751
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:57,793
Which is?

752
00:50:57,837 --> 00:50:59,882
If the cleaner
was on the inside,

753
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:02,233
how come he was
a step behind Sonny?

754
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,886
He isn't. He got him.

755
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,584
Not where he was
supposed to be.

756
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:07,977
That's what's not right
about this.

757
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:09,979
Something's fishy.

758
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:13,853
Ok, I'm on it.

759
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:24,864
Shh.

760
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:26,083
What is it?

761
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:28,172
There's someone outside.

762
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:16,481
Go up...Go upstairs. Go.

763
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:21,225
FBI. Everybody freeze.

764
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:35,369
Price, we know
you're in there!

765
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,589
We know she's with you.

766
00:52:37,632 --> 00:52:40,069
Price, we got a warrant!

767
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:53,735
Exit plan.

768
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:57,870
Somebody break a window!

769
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,952
They're gone.
I think we're safe.

770
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:40,565
You don't really
need protection, do you?

771
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:44,177
That was some job
you did on that agent.

772
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,093
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

773
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:50,531
When you work for icarus,
you'd better be ready.

774
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,845
Come in.

775
00:54:01,977 --> 00:54:04,284
They're gonna start
coming down hard now.

776
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:05,720
Did Kevin talk
to Charlie?

777
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:08,332
They ran the matrix.
There's something.

778
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,420
What?

779
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:12,814
He said you should
see it for yourself.

780
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:15,643
Do you mind if
I leave her with you?

781
00:54:15,687 --> 00:54:17,254
No way.
No way!

782
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,821
Now listen, both of you,

783
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:20,909
in case you
haven't noticed,

784
00:54:20,953 --> 00:54:22,694
we got a big problem
here.

785
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:23,782
I need to go
and see Charlie,

786
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:25,262
and I can't take
either of you.

787
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:29,048
So, can we be adults
for 2 seconds here?

788
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:32,747
Thank you.

789
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,360
Just take her
to the safe house

790
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:39,450
and wait for me there.

791
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:26,801
So, what'd you
want me to see?

792
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:29,935
While cross-checking
through some
975 million calls

793
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:31,632
made during Sonny's run,

794
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:34,069
we came up
with a remarkable
coincidence.

795
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:35,897
The provider at every
one of Sonny's stops

796
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:39,727
received a call within
an hour of his arrival.

797
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:40,815
Well, how could that be?

798
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,862
It can't. I mean,
one of the providers

799
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:45,777
is fisherman
in bar harbor,

800
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,648
who hadn't had a call
on the secure line

801
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:48,954
for the last 2 years.

802
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,782
And that was
a wrong number.

803
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:52,871
All right.

804
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:56,178
Guess we gotta
bring elkert in.

805
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:59,356
I thought there was
no way to trace him.

806
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:04,099
Think I tell you everything?

807
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:20,899
Well, this is,
um, interesting.

808
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:24,859
It's safe.
That's all that matters.

809
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:28,863
So, how long
you and price
known each other?

810
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:36,044
Long enough.

811
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:38,656
For what?

812
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:41,398
To know when he's not
thinking clearly.

813
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:47,099
You always
warm up to everyone
this quickly, Connie?

814
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:51,408
It takes a lot more than
the damsel-in-distress routine

815
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:52,539
to sell me.

816
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:57,718
Well, lucky for me
it's him who's buying.

817
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,030
I'll take
the bedroom.

818
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:08,468
Thank you.
Good night.

819
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:16,781
Reverse the factor
by the 29th marsenne prime.

820
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,959
Match your beta code.

821
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:24,005
Sending these codes

822
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:26,834
could expose
the providers
and their locations.

823
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:28,836
You sure you want
to do this?

824
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,188
We got no choice.
Continue.

825
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:41,936
Well?

826
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,981
I wonder if
the runners ever knew

827
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:44,591
they were leaving
a DNA trail behind

828
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:47,899
by rubbing off
those gold patches.

829
00:57:47,942 --> 00:57:49,857
Doesn't matter now.

830
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:53,034
Yeah.

831
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:05,220
So, you found the remote
that bombed her car
in her purse?

832
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:06,961
Man, that is fucked up.

833
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:08,093
Hey.

834
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,398
Sorry.

835
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:12,967
Well, it sounds to me
she's after all the money.

836
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:13,881
Yeah.

837
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:16,710
Well, then why
keep her around?

838
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:19,931
Well, I need her
at arm's length...

839
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:24,196
And, there's
another possibility.

840
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,415
What's that?

841
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:29,897
She's not who
she says she is.

842
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,470
Think we hit a static drop.

843
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,647
Let me do it.

844
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:48,568
The static drop coordinates?

845
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:52,833
A back door.

846
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:10,851
Next card's
not coming up.

847
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:15,377
He didn't use it.

848
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:17,728
He jumped track on his own.

849
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:20,382
That's what he planned
all along.

850
00:59:20,426 --> 00:59:23,081
Yeah, well, then
he could be anywhere.

851
00:59:23,124 --> 00:59:25,431
Back up
to the previous provider.

852
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:28,303
What did he give elkert?

853
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:32,133
Plane tickets.

854
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:34,788
Ok, match that provider
with all tickets

855
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:37,182
ever issued to him.

856
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:43,971
2 hits.
Phoenix and Boston.

857
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:45,930
I.d.s?

858
00:59:45,973 --> 00:59:47,888
No.

859
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:50,456
But there are 2 high
probability addresses
for those areas.

860
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:52,371
But I can't tell
if they're providers

861
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:54,982
or final covers.

862
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,856
Ok, call Kevin. Tell him
I'll pick him up in an hour.

863
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:00,814
Ok.

864
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:12,739
Well, at least you two
didn't strangle each other.

865
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,959
Spare the chitchat.
Did you find him?

866
01:00:15,002 --> 01:00:16,961
No, but there're
2 possibilities.

867
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:18,092
In other words,
he's lost.

868
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:20,268
He broke protocol,
jumped track.

869
01:00:20,312 --> 01:00:22,227
But there's
still a chance
if we move.

870
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,750
What do we do?

871
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:24,751
We split up.

872
01:00:24,795 --> 01:00:26,623
Kevin's already
arranged flights.

873
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:29,626
You and him
hit Phoenix...

874
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:32,019
We'll go to Boston.

875
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,850
We?

876
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:47,818
Come on, let's go.

877
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,915
How well did you
know Sonny?

878
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,004
Not real well.

879
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:03,703
And only for about 2 months.

880
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:08,795
I was the last one
brought into the circle
by elkert.

881
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:10,754
And he trusted you?

882
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:13,626
It's why he trusted me.

883
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,934
I had no allegiance
to anyone else.

884
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:20,894
How'd Sonny manage
to fit in?

885
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:22,156
It wasn't so hard.

886
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,943
He had more mob in him
than a lot of made men.

887
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:27,945
Sonny? No way.

888
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:29,033
He may have been FBI,

889
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:31,078
but he loved
the high-flying lifestyle

890
01:01:31,122 --> 01:01:33,646
the syndicate afforded him.

891
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,736
Houses, boats...

892
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,782
Personal well-hidden assets

893
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:42,829
in countries the government
can't touch.

894
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:44,352
Nonsense.

895
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:45,745
I set it up for him.

896
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:49,270
Ok, I don't want
to hear anymore.

897
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:52,926
How long did you know Sonny?

898
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,973
Since we were kids.

899
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:59,411
We were orphans
in social services
together.

900
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:01,848
Grew up
in the same streets,

901
01:02:01,892 --> 01:02:04,416
same foster homes.

902
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:08,072
Eventually joined
the FBI together.

903
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:32,444
So, if you happen
to run into the cleaner

904
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:34,272
during all this,

905
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:35,795
what will you do?

906
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,623
I'll ask him
to walk away,

907
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,799
leave my runners
alone.

908
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:42,889
And if he doesn't?

909
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,197
I'll kill him.

910
01:02:48,112 --> 01:02:50,854
Or her.

911
01:02:58,426 --> 01:02:59,863
Come on.
What?

912
01:02:59,906 --> 01:03:01,386
Why?

913
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:02,822
We're being followed.By who?

914
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,955
Someone who
doesn't really know

915
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:08,480
what a bottle of ripple
can do to you.

916
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:59,052
Are you ok?

917
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:01,011
Yeah. Fine.

918
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:36,089
Price!

919
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,450
Gimme your hand.
Come on.

920
01:04:54,673 --> 01:04:56,849
Come on!

921
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:04,944
Big baby.

922
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:06,946
Thanks.

923
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:12,082
Well, you know,
one back scrubs the other.

924
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,997
Speaking of which, I...

925
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,826
I think I'm gonna
take a shower.

926
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:32,265
Everything ok?

927
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,267
Yeah. Why?

928
01:07:34,311 --> 01:07:38,663
Well, you're looking at me
like I have nothing on.

929
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:44,973
This is nice.
Who's this from?

930
01:07:45,017 --> 01:07:46,801
Used to belong
to Sonny.

931
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,766
What is it?

932
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:58,074
I need you to wait here.

933
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:00,206
Why? Where are you going?

934
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:04,471
If I'm right,
to meet Sonny's killer.

935
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:19,981
Hello?

936
01:09:20,025 --> 01:09:21,026
Charlie, it's me.

937
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:23,550
The Boston address
is a static drop.

938
01:09:23,594 --> 01:09:25,465
Anything from Connie?

939
01:09:25,509 --> 01:09:27,511
She's still in the air.

940
01:09:27,554 --> 01:09:29,991
Ok, call me when she lands.

941
01:09:30,035 --> 01:09:32,385
But I think hers
is a dead end.

942
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:35,127
What makes you say that?

943
01:09:36,563 --> 01:09:38,957
Faith.

944
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:34,230
Aah! Unh...

945
01:10:45,371 --> 01:10:46,894
Jason, it's me.

946
01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:50,811
Sonny?
What the hell?!

947
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:53,118
Get up!

948
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:57,078
Let me explain.
Shut up, man.
Shut up!

949
01:10:57,122 --> 01:10:59,733
I knew I was being tracked.

950
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:03,041
Just couldn't figure out how.

951
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,698
What the hell's going on?

952
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:09,917
I faked my own death.

953
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,965
With the dental work.

954
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:16,968
I scattered some teeth
behind.

955
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,710
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

956
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:20,493
I helped you.

957
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:23,496
I know, man.
I fucked up.

958
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,106
No shit.

959
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,325
Why'd you do it?

960
01:11:26,369 --> 01:11:29,459
It's fuckin' turgenson.
He's after the money.

961
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:31,548
He knew about some perks
I took from icarus.

962
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:34,333
He told me he'd nail me
if I didn't do it.

963
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:35,552
Do what?

964
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:38,206
Penetrate your system.

965
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,599
Why?

966
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:40,600
If you were convinced
that the cleaner
whacked me,

967
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:41,514
you'd think the cleaner
was inside

968
01:11:41,558 --> 01:11:42,994
and getting close.

969
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:45,257
You'd have no choice
but to go back
to elkert. Save him.

970
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,650
And then I would
fuckin' follow you,

971
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:49,870
and I would deliver him
to turgenson.

972
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:51,045
You killed those providers?

973
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:53,091
No, I didn't do that!
That was turgenson.

974
01:11:53,134 --> 01:11:54,875
He killed 'em
after each pickup.

975
01:11:54,919 --> 01:11:57,791
I had no idea, I swear.

976
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:05,625
I knew something stank
about your death.

977
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:07,540
Fuck, man,
the pressure is huge.

978
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:08,541
My sources
are telling me

979
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:09,934
that the cleaner's
close.

980
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,806
Your sources?
Who are they?

981
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:14,982
I mean,
who are you, really?

982
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:17,333
It's me, man.

983
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:19,160
Who's the cleaner?I don't know.

984
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:21,424
Yes, you do!

985
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:22,512
Fuck,
it's the cleaner.

986
01:12:22,555 --> 01:12:25,079
He doesn't give
a rat's ass about you.

987
01:12:25,123 --> 01:12:27,430
Those are yoesky's thugs.

988
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:29,736
Come on.

989
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,043
Get your gun!

990
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:36,134
Make sure you leave
no trace of him.

991
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,062
Get down. Move!

992
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:19,427
Let's go.

993
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:31,483
Jesus. Ok, what now?

994
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,963
Jump.
Jump?!

995
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:35,835
You bastard!Jump.

996
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:09,216
Room 56.
When'd she leave?

997
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,870
About an hour ago.

998
01:16:10,914 --> 01:16:13,133
She make any calls?

999
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,618
Seattle.

1000
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,718
You have reached the mailbox
of Renee Brooks.

1001
01:16:32,762 --> 01:16:36,592
Please leave a message
after the tone.

1002
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:40,117
So, what was it?

1003
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,642
It's how elkert
or somebody contacted her.

1004
01:16:43,686 --> 01:16:45,862
Who?

1005
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:51,563
All right, where do we
go from here?

1006
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,695
You go with me.

1007
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:56,350
I'm gonna have
a little talk with elkert.

1008
01:16:57,743 --> 01:16:58,875
After all
that's gone down,

1009
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:00,877
Why are you dragging
Sonny along?

1010
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,400
He's my prime suspect.

1011
01:17:02,443 --> 01:17:04,881
The way to find
elkert is through
a safety-deposit box.

1012
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:07,448
It has to be registered
in his name at a bank.

1013
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:09,276
Jeez, we don't
even know which one.

1014
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,671
I'm not exactly
a specialist
in bank systems.

1015
01:17:12,715 --> 01:17:14,717
Well,
I know someone who is.

1016
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,981
Time to recall
another runner, kid.

1017
01:17:28,556 --> 01:17:30,210
And that's
where we are.

1018
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:33,866
I need to put
your knowledge of
bank systems to use.

1019
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:34,867
What are we looking for?

1020
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:36,564
A
safe-deposit box...

1021
01:17:36,608 --> 01:17:39,089
And its owner,
Paul elkert.

1022
01:17:39,132 --> 01:17:40,481
What bank?

1023
01:17:40,525 --> 01:17:41,787
That we don't know.

1024
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:43,876
Caribbean somewhere.

1025
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:50,796
Shit.

1026
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,754
That many?

1027
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:54,713
Cayman Islands alone
have 1,034.

1028
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:57,716
10,000 banks.
That's 10 million accounts.

1029
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,978
All with passwords.

1030
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:01,285
Renee
hid assets with you
in the Caribbean.

1031
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:02,547
So?

1032
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:05,811
I'll bet she used
the same bank
for elkert.

1033
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:07,291
For control.

1034
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:08,596
What was it?

1035
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,689
Aruba.
Banco financiero di Aruba.

1036
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:29,922
It's a hit...

1037
01:18:29,966 --> 01:18:33,404
But no personal info.
Just an e-mail.

1038
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:34,971
Can we use it?

1039
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:36,146
Isp's out of Canada.

1040
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:38,148
Could use the a.C. Program
I once wrote.

1041
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:41,325
E-mail the account
and attach trojan virus,

1042
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:42,848
hack their billing database,

1043
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:45,808
but it might
easily get traced.

1044
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:47,766
You might
not be the only one.

1045
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,768
NSA, FBI, you name it.

1046
01:18:49,812 --> 01:18:51,814
Anyone might
get this info.

1047
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:52,989
Don't worry.

1048
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:57,515
Anything happens,
I'll take care
of you.

1049
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:09,962
Something
on your mind?

1050
01:19:10,006 --> 01:19:13,749
Just wondering
what's gonna happen.

1051
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:18,188
My guess would be
someone's gonna die.

1052
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:27,327
All right,
what do we do?

1053
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:28,328
We go in.

1054
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:29,590
What kind of fuckin'
plan is that?

1055
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:31,767
It's the only one
I got.

1056
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,594
Let's go.

1057
01:19:44,605 --> 01:19:46,999
Fuck!

1058
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:49,523
Get down!

1059
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:15,941
Ok, I'll take
the back.

1060
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:17,943
Look
for a way in.

1061
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:22,121
Don't betray me
again, Sonny.

1062
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:35,874
Elkert, it's price!

1063
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:38,921
What do you want?

1064
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:40,096
I'm here to help you.

1065
01:20:40,139 --> 01:20:41,184
Your life's in danger.

1066
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:43,839
You never should
have come here!

1067
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,490
Stop shooting!
It's me, Renee!

1068
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:29,928
Renee! What are
you doing here?!

1069
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:32,365
She's gonna
kill you, elkert!

1070
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:33,410
Shut up, Sonny.

1071
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:36,848
God damn it,
who else you got here?!

1072
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:42,114
How about the cleaner,
elkert?

1073
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:43,986
The cleaner?!

1074
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:45,770
What the fuck
you talkin' about?!

1075
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:48,512
Take your pick,
either one.

1076
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:05,921
Fuck you!

1077
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:08,967
Elkert!

1078
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:11,927
Elkert!

1079
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,799
Kill 'em.
Kill 'em all!

1080
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,908
Sonny?

1081
01:23:25,565 --> 01:23:28,612
I'm so sorry.

1082
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:34,400
Sonny?
Unh.

1083
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:02,080
Elkert?

1084
01:24:02,994 --> 01:24:05,344
Stay away from me,
price.

1085
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:08,217
Take it easy.
I'm here to help you.

1086
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,174
Bullshit.

1087
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:11,916
You led them all
straight to me.

1088
01:24:13,526 --> 01:24:14,919
You called Renee.

1089
01:24:14,962 --> 01:24:17,791
Why the fuck
would I call that bitch?

1090
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:19,445
She had
your second key.

1091
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:20,794
I don't need a second key.

1092
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:23,623
That safety-deposit box
is in my name.

1093
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:27,192
You only need a second key
if you're not me.

1094
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:28,280
Hold on.

1095
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:30,630
The cleaner's been
after this key for...

1096
01:24:30,674 --> 01:24:35,853
Cleaner doesn't exist,
price.

1097
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:38,160
You said...

1098
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:40,771
I just mentioned him
so you'd help me.

1099
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:41,902
Yoesky invented the cleaner

1100
01:24:41,946 --> 01:24:45,645
to scare people
shitless. That's all.

1101
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:47,995
Well, how about
the courthouse hit?

1102
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:50,607
Sonny set that up
for me.

1103
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,087
I made Sonny
a rich man.

1104
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,871
He owed me big-time.

1105
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:56,482
Yeah, Sonny.

1106
01:24:56,526 --> 01:24:58,049
Think about it, price.

1107
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,705
Who else
but a government agency
would know the exact time,

1108
01:25:01,748 --> 01:25:05,839
location, and the layout
of a secret grand jury hearing?

1109
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,287
Stop shooting.
I can get you out.

1110
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:21,551
I'm the last chance
you got.

1111
01:25:21,594 --> 01:25:23,466
I don't need
your help, price.

1112
01:25:23,509 --> 01:25:27,426
Fuck you
if you're gonna
get any of my money.

1113
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:39,786
You?

1114
01:25:49,448 --> 01:25:53,800
But I trusted you.

1115
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:23,743
You expect me
to believe

1116
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:27,051
she shot elkert
to save you?

1117
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:29,096
That's right.

1118
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,881
Horseshit!

1119
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:33,840
I'm gonna tear
your story apart.

1120
01:26:35,494 --> 01:26:37,844
Like you did
to my providers?

1121
01:26:37,888 --> 01:26:39,194
You murderer.

1122
01:26:39,237 --> 01:26:41,718
I don't know
what the hell
you're talking about.

1123
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:42,806
They were innocent.

1124
01:26:42,849 --> 01:26:45,069
Nobody's innocent,
price.

1125
01:26:46,853 --> 01:26:49,291
Drop it,
turgenson, drop it!

1126
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:52,207
Place him under arrest.

1127
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:54,209
Can't arrest me,
I'm FBI!

1128
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:57,342
You're wanted
on 5 counts of murder
in the first degree.

1129
01:26:57,386 --> 01:26:59,083
Get him outta here.

1130
01:27:07,961 --> 01:27:10,268
I warned you
this case could go bad.

1131
01:27:10,312 --> 01:27:12,705
Why did the NSA
want elkert dead?

1132
01:27:12,749 --> 01:27:14,490
You picked up on that.

1133
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:17,449
Not so hard, considering
your panicked reaction
when I ran him under.

1134
01:27:17,493 --> 01:27:18,755
Elkert was too hot.

1135
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:22,149
We have certain
jurisdictional rights,

1136
01:27:22,193 --> 01:27:24,674
but we couldn't
seize him from the FBI

1137
01:27:24,717 --> 01:27:26,893
without raising
a red flag.

1138
01:27:26,937 --> 01:27:28,808
So you had him come to me.

1139
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:30,201
We thought
we'd track him...

1140
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:35,685
Quietly, but
we weren't expecting
your static drops.

1141
01:27:35,728 --> 01:27:37,817
Very clever.

1142
01:27:37,861 --> 01:27:40,994
So, you were working
with icarus all along.

1143
01:27:41,995 --> 01:27:44,868
The mega arms deal
Sonny got involved with,

1144
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:47,305
only the NSA
had the interest
and resources

1145
01:27:47,349 --> 01:27:49,220
to set that up.

1146
01:27:49,829 --> 01:27:55,487
So you were
using the syndicate
to illegally divert weapons

1147
01:27:55,531 --> 01:28:00,144
to some dirty little war
somewhere, right?

1148
01:28:02,364 --> 01:28:05,323
That's what
elkert had on you.

1149
01:28:05,367 --> 01:28:07,499
That's what
you didn't want
the FBI to know.

1150
01:28:07,543 --> 01:28:10,328
You don't
have to worry
about that now.

1151
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:12,635
Icarus
has pulled out.

1152
01:28:12,678 --> 01:28:14,506
Your actions
have torpedoed

1153
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,857
important
national operations
and objectives.

1154
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:20,599
Bullshit.

1155
01:28:27,214 --> 01:28:29,695
Was she your cleaner?

1156
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:31,958
Does it matter?

1157
01:28:33,786 --> 01:28:34,961
No.

1158
01:28:35,005 --> 01:28:36,093
I guess this is one time

1159
01:28:36,136 --> 01:28:38,443
when there's no
need-to-know on my part.

1160
01:28:41,403 --> 01:28:46,190
Well, you...
Take care of yourself,
price.

1161
01:28:46,233 --> 01:28:48,018
Thank you.

1162
01:29:05,209 --> 01:29:06,645
And I've arranged
with the NSA

1163
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:11,781
for a 5-million wire transfer
to each of your accounts.

1164
01:29:11,824 --> 01:29:14,784
Whoa.
Powell agreed to that?

1165
01:29:14,827 --> 01:29:16,829
If I shut daedalus down
forever.

1166
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:20,006
I did explain
the potential downside

1167
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:23,749
of having
a motley crew like
you guys running it.

1168
01:29:27,927 --> 01:29:29,146
Thanks.

1169
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:32,062
Look after yourself,
will ya?

1170
01:29:33,846 --> 01:29:35,892
Hey.
Hey.

1171
01:29:36,849 --> 01:29:39,025
Who's gonna
mother me now?

1172
01:29:39,069 --> 01:29:41,724
I'll send you
monthly e-mails.

1173
01:29:41,767 --> 01:29:43,595
Yeah, yeah.

1174
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:48,426
So, what do we do
to get you under?

1175
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:50,515
Nothing.

1176
01:29:50,559 --> 01:29:52,299
This one's
my own doing.

1177
01:29:52,343 --> 01:29:55,477
The ultimate
vanishing act?

1178
01:29:57,087 --> 01:29:58,001
Yeah.

1179
01:29:58,044 --> 01:30:01,744
I'll miss you guys.

1180
01:30:14,844 --> 01:30:19,326
How can you just
disappear on US
like this?

1181
01:30:22,329 --> 01:30:25,942
It's the only way
I can leave it
all behind, Connie.

1182
01:30:25,985 --> 01:30:30,207
I guess things never did
settle right for US?

1183
01:31:10,856 --> 01:31:13,206
Everything ok?

1184
01:31:14,947 --> 01:31:15,861
You?

1185
01:31:15,905 --> 01:31:17,559
Fine.

1186
01:31:17,602 --> 01:31:19,822
Free as a bird.

1187
01:31:35,707 --> 01:31:38,362
So where are we
going?

1188
01:31:38,405 --> 01:31:40,582
If I told you...

1189
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:42,932
We wouldn't be safe.
