Am I crazy?

00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,262
Not so I noticed.

177
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm a scientist.

178
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,179
I'm supposed to
deal in specifics,

179
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:01,356
and I'm being spooked
by a feeling.

180
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,400
The rockets again?

181
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:03,793
The rockets again.

182
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:05,229
Josh, you told me
that the only one

183
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:06,970
who could handle them
was Cody Briggs.

184
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,580
[SIGHING]
He's the best there is,

185
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,018
but he is no match
for a computer.

186
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:15,936
Now, am I
being difficult?

187
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,459
No, you're being Josh.

188
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:20,854
I mean, the computers
don't show any no-nos.

189
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,986

Hello, Doppler.

194
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,266
Good day to you,
Mr. Thornwell.

195
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,399
Mr. Bowdish said
to tell you
he's waiting for you.

Thank you.And congratulations, sir.

Elliot, is there anything
to Josh's fuss
about postponement?

199
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,335
Oh, no, it's...
It's too remote.

200
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,163
You'd better show me.

201
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,954
Starflightis an airplane.
 It's not a spaceship.

202
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,478
It was designed to operate
in a gravity field.

203
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,916
Take a look at this.

204
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,048
See, before the booster
rockets are cut off,

205
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,224
that thing is
moving at better than
half a mile a second

towards space.

207
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,186
What Josh is worried about
is a possibility of a slip

208
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,971
that could
lift  Starflightright out
of the atmosphere.

209
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:37,017
And you and I know
that can't happen.

210
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,453
Yeah, but supposing
it does,

211
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,151
what does that do
in terms of
cabin pressure?

212
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,980
Well, you'd have
a pressurized craft

213
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:47,418
pushing against
the nothingness
of a zero atmosphere.

214
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:50,334

any structural flaw...

Other cabins have 
been outfitted

218

219

an international crew 
to cover this event.

220
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:29,112
Starflight  is operated 
through a complicated network 
of computer banks.

221
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:32,812
It took two years 
to program the software 
for these computers.

would like you
on his far right.

Well, we won't
call them troubles,
but some qualms.

Well, uh...

232
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:09,152
Josh, you give me
one shred of evidence

233
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:12,503
that this magnificent plane
of yours is not ready
to take off,

234
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,592
and I'll cancel
the flight.

Smile, Josh.

236
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,384
I would prefer it
if the rockets

237
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:24,951
were under
ground control, yes.

238

for her maiden flight,
isn't she?

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,956
Well, uh...

240
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,920
Now, will the two
Mr. Thornwells,
come with me?

241
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,445
What if he would've
said no flight?

242
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:44,666
Then Mr. Joshua Gilliam
would have missed the plane.

Sir, this is a maze 
I'm looking at.

00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:14,386
I'll consult 
with Captain Herrera.

701

For now, I'd cut 
the power feed

another configuration,

to reduce friction
to a minimum,

to affect reentry.

come through.

in the computer.

had a conventional aircraft
in a reentry mode before.

depends on the instincts
of the person

and that's Josh.
