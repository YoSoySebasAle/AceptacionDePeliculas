1
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:04,761
You never know when and
why you fall in love with someone.

2
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:06,139
That is what makes love exceptional.

3
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,548
This story is about a woman
who falls in love with man at the...

4
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:15,998
very first sight and her world
now revolves only around him.

5
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,479
Ram is coming for me..

6
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,519
From the minute I got to know about this,

7
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,518
Every second feels like a million years.

8
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,830
My heartbeat has increased.

9
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,838
When the person we love is coming
in search of us

10
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,679
We cannot express that feeling in words

11
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,358
Ram...

12
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:13,918
Ram...

13
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:15,999
Ram, get up!

14
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:19,039
Ram...

15
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,598
Ambulance...

16
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,279
What are you doing with that mobile?

17
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:09,919
I'm trying to search where can
we find tender's head.

18
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,639
We don't have food to eat and you want
an english girl to roam around?

19
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,598
Why are our lives so boring?

20
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:21,639
How many years should we stay here
in this country? I am fed up.

21
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,159
Whatever it is,
drinking raw is really difficult.

22
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,879
- Hello...
- Hey buddy!

23
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,239
It's me, Gopi from India

24
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,958
- Yeah tell me.
- What time is it there?

25
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,279
Idiot, you called me to know the time?

26
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:40,959
No buddy! I heard IPhone Max R
has released.. Buy me one.

27
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,668
Is that enough? or do you need
the back case and tempered glass too?

28
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:48,358
Why do you have to waste money on it.
I'll buy them here.

29
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,558
Idiot!

30
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,438
You think money in Australia
grows on trees?

31
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,839
We keep aside our respect and work
under all white and black people here

32
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,119
and you want Iphones and Ipads?
Shut up and cut the call.

33
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:00,358
Please buddy.

34
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:01,399
Idiot!

35
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:03,908
What is your problem?
Can't you just have the beer and enjoy

36
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,919
Happiness? Enjoyment?

37
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,118
We just use those words in our lives.

38
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
Frankly speaking no human being
on this earth is happy.

39
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,479
- Oh god! He is high
- Buddy...

40
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:16,719
Whole life flashes before our eyes
while we are drunk.

41
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,238
I'll ask you something tell me
the answer.

42
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,439
Did your parents feel happy
as soon as you were born?

43
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:21,199
Yeah

44
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:22,399
According to me,

45
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:25,719
we should cry when someone gives birth
and laugh when someone dies.

46
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,198
Really? Don't say all this nonsense logics.

47
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,518
I'm serious.

48
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,119
We should cry before coming into this world
as we will face all the problems.

49
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,559
And feel happy when we are dying
so that there will be no troubles.

50
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,239
Don't listen to him buddy,
he will keep wasting our time.

51
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:42,639

Are you still sleeping?

54
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,439
We were awake till morning,
tell me what's the matter.

55
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,599
Which record did you break by
staying awake till late in the morning?

56
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,878
I finished 30 beers in 4 hours and
broke my own record.

57
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:08,119
Wow! That's such a great thing.

00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,878
I have an important meeting in office

60

If you have an important meeting,
why did you call me?

61
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,959
Let me finish.

from India today,

please go and pick her up

65

You need not call me for that,
you can directly book an uber.

Hey, she is a girl and new to this place too.

She is coming from India all alone,

68
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,319
Can't she come to your place
from the airport?

69
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:34,198
Don't tell me all these idiotic logics.

do you have?

Breaking your 40 beers record?

74
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,039
Not you, we should scold that J.D
for giving you money

75
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:51,079
Not just drinking, I have other works too.

76
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,159
Stop it.

77
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,198

89
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,159
Utham is busy and couldn't make it,
he asked me to pick you.

90
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,239
Oh...

91

here you are all alone.

Got a warm welcome as soon as
I stepped in Australia.

110
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,839
When I saw him, there was a fight

111
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:58,404
between my heart and my mind.

112
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:02,714
I heard everyone say
"Love at first sight is trash" but no...

113
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:04,669
By the way, What is your relation with Utham?

114
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,064
Nothing. We have grown up at one place.

115
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,335
Utham, I dropped her at your place

116

don't plan anything else.

Hi Amrutha, how was your journey?

121
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,159
I felt I was on earth when I was
on the flight.

122
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399
And when I got down,
feels like I am flying.

123
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:37,764
It is because of the long journey.

124
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,195
Yeah. Why didn't you come to pick me up?

125
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,599
Got a lot of work dear.

Nothing much, everything's normal,
job searching.

00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:48,886
Still job searching, how long?

143
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,199

not like you.

Let me tell you something,

00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,047
Did we ever raise any questions on this?

154
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:22,848

people like you take them away from us.

155
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:28,583
We don't say anything that doesn't mean
you can talk whatever you want.

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,199
By the way, how does he look?

182
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,919
He was so hot,

183
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,319
he came to pick me up from the airport.

184
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:44,079
Is it? What is his height?

185
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,159
And how about his body?

186
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,358
I will call you back, you first cut the call.

187
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,239
He is here.
- Hello...

188
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:51,799
Bye... Bye...
Okay bye!

189
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:01,039
[DOORBELL]

190
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:06,319
- Hi...
- Hello...

191
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:08,919
- Utham...
- Yes, yes... Please come.

192
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,919
You guys are still not ready?

193
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,519
I am ready! Jyothi is taking time.

194
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,559
Your mobile.

195
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,598
You want some water?

196
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:23,199
No, thank you!

197
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,119
Impressed.
- Why?

198
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,799
You asked me if I need water.

199
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,439
Indian girls and their respect is very nice.

200
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,599
I remember hearing this in India
and again now.

201
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,198
See if she's ready, let's leave

202
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,959
Amrutha, tomorrow is your birthday, right?

203
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,759
Yeah, I don't even remember!

204
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,758
You don't remember your own birthday?

205
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,719
I remember everything until
I got down the flight,

206
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:54,079
as soon as I got down I forgot
lot of things.

207
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,439
She must have celebrated it
with her family every year,

208
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:59,559
but this time she’s here.
So she might have forgot.

209
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,278
Yes.

210
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,239
Advance Happy Birthday

211
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:05,998
Thank you!

212
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,359
Ok then, let's invite everyone tomorrow

213
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:11,878
and celebrate it grandly.

214
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,598
Yeah

215
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:15,639
No, I don't like such things please.

216
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,719
I anyway have everyone I like around me,
that's enough.

217
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,079
Atleast wish her dude

218
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,079
What is the meaning behind that smile?

219
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,918
I don't like birthday's

220
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,439
Why?

221
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:33,519
According to me,
it is the mistake of our parents

222
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:35,398
that we are here today.

223
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,318
No doubt, you were born
because of the same reason.

224
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,478
Why do you take it in a negative way?

225
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,359
Take it in a positive way.

226
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,479
We are here to achieve something.

227
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:47,278
He is not able to achieve anything
so he feels that way.

228
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:50,239
It is tough to understand my philosophy,
leave it.

229
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:55,239
You are getting mad day by day,
consult a doctor

230
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,118
Okay leave it.

231
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,599
Amrutha when are you joining college?

232
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,839
I have to join tomorrow.

233
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:02,959
Tomorrow?

234
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,839
I have a meeting tomorrow

235
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,399
So...

236
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:11,638
She is a girl, how can she go alone,

237
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:14,359
she is new here that too our Indian.

238
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,158
No no, stop it! I'll take her.

239
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,643
Wow... It looks so good.

240
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,242
All these are common here.

241
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:05,361
I am a nature lover,
can you take me to some nice places here?

242
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:07,602
I need not leave my work and
show you all these.

243
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:10,722
In few days you will get used to it.

244
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,402
Sir is mad at me.

245
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:14,922
I shouldn't have said that.

246
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,082
Okay!

247
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:20,601
I'll take you whenever I have time.
- I thought you are always free...

248
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:22,281
Hello...

249
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,282
I didn't mean it that way.

250
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,841
Brother told me this.

251
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,809
This Malayali guy is here
only to spoil my name

252
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,162
Sorry.

253
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,962
I am really sorry!

254
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:34,002
That was my fault,

255
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,202
how can I take it back?

256
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,522
I'll do 100 situps on the road?

257
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:43,482
Or should I sit on ice for an hour?

258
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:46,281
If this is not enough, I'll write a letter saying

259
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:50,282
you are not the reason behind my death
and jump from top of that building.

260
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:52,922
You smiled?

261
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,721
Thank god that means you excused me.

262
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:23,562
"Rain drops falling on me..."

263
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:28,161
"My love for you is eternal..."

264
00:20:29,202 --> 00:20:33,561
"I don't know what this feeling is..."

265
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:38,642
"Is this happening because
this is my first love..."

266
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:43,722
"Lightning thunders are now enough..."

267
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:48,642
"Listen to this girls feelings..."

268
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:54,282
"My heart wants me to be with you..."

269
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:58,881
"That smile is all enough for me dear...

270
00:20:59,202 --> 00:21:03,962
"I came for you with all the love..."

271
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:09,441
"I am giving all myself to you..."

272
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:21,722
Ram... your love, your anger,
your happiness, your sad moments,

273
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:24,362
everything should be mine.

274
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:26,762
I don't think you and me are different.

275
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,962
I want to be all yours.

276
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:32,442
You are like a drug.

277
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:34,442
I'm getting addicted to you,

278
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:35,841
Are you able to understand that?

279
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,202
From when?

280
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,242
- What?
- I mean exams?

281
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:42,282
Oh exams? From tomorrow

282
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,642
- Hi, is everything ok?
- Yeah.

283
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:00,921
Surprise…
- Wow!

284
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,522
It definitely is a surprise

285
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,042
Got a glass for you also….

286
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,362
Ofcourse...

287
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:11,442
Enough enough,

288
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:13,682
For you?

289
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:17,601
You are my only high.

290
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,162
Ram...

291
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:24,042
This is a really good evening

292
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:25,922
- Is it?
- Hmmm.

293
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:29,361
Here with you, like this.
It is too good.

294
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:32,562
How is it?
- Generally I won’t get high for the first peg.

295
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:34,521
But maybe because you gave me,

296
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,041
First peg is getting me high.

297
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:41,042
What is the matter?

298
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:44,361
Nothing.

299
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,081
Wanted to spend some time
with you like this.

300
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:54,122
- You want a cigarette?
- You have one?

301
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:55,161
Yeah...

302
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,161
Take it.

303
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:02,481
I have.

304
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:07,562
Ram...

305
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:12,561
My family, friends everybody took
good care of me since childhood

306
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:15,921
and I used to be really thinking
that is what life is.

307
00:23:17,082 --> 00:23:21,921
I was always first in college and then

308
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,921
and they were so many guys behind me

309
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:29,322
and I got so many proposals
but never liked any.

310
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:32,282
I never spoke to them…

311
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,041
But as soon as I came here,

312
00:23:35,162 --> 00:23:36,402
I liked you.

313
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:40,521
Travelling with you for these many days

314
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,322
made me realise what life is.

315
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,242
Destiny is unpredictable.

316
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:51,242
We were born in India

317
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:56,042
but met here in this country.

318
00:23:56,322 --> 00:24:01,281
We think of something and life gives us
something else.

319
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:08,642
I hope you understand
why am I telling you all this.

320
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:13,722
Ram...

321
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:14,961
Ram...

322
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:16,442
Get up!

323
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,401
Unnecessarily I got him drunk

324
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:37,161
Hi...

325
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,522
Sorry, I got high last night.

326
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:41,522
You were telling me something,

327
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,922
I didn't understand. Tell me now

328
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:46,761
Is it?

329
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:48,362
Actually...

330
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,642
- I don't remember it.
- What?

331
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,762
I got drunk and you forgot things?

332
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,482
Ya I don't remember.

333
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,882
Oh god, he is very near yet so far.

334
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,282
Tell me

335
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:13,761
Okay! I'll take leave, I have to go.

336
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:15,882
Hey.

337
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:22,881
Amrutha listen to me. I cannot act.

338
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:24,801
I am not like everyone else.

339
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,122
I can only understand love

340
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:31,962
but cannot give it back.

341
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:29,642
"Can I kiss you,
leaving all the boundaries behind..."

342
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:34,682
"Will I not pamper you forgetting
all the limits..."

343
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:39,882
"I will just stay in your arms..."

344
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:45,042
"I will promise that now I am all yours..."

345
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:48,842
Do you like cigarettes so much?

346
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:52,082
Sometimes... but why is it a problem
for you?

347
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:58,377
Why did you ask me to come here?

348
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:00,196
Because the nature is good

349
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:03,722
Yeah it is good

350
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:05,802
- Your lipstick is good too.
- Thanks.

351
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,762
- I applied it for you
- Why?

352
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:11,442
- So that you can spoil it.
- Why will I spoil it?

353
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:17,335
Okay, I'll only spoil it

354
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:19,697
Why do you want to ruin it
when it is looking good.

355
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:22,586
Okay!

356
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,802
You ruin it then

357
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:28,322
Sure?

358
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,322
I did it

359
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,242
Will anyone spoil lipstick like this?

360
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:46,842
"Every minute in your love I keep flying..."

361
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:51,921
"Next minute I'll be in your arms..."

362
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:57,282
"I will win your love..."

363
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:01,842
"Our hearts have become one..."

364
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:06,561
"Our togetherness will be affectionate..."

365
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:11,762
"I am asking the dreams to become true..."

366
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:16,842
"You are all over me now..."

367
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,042
"Just come to me..."

368
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:27,681
"Our love will float all over..."

369
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:32,162
"When we open the doors of love..."

370
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:37,322
"It should be on us just like the rain..."

371
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,921
Why is this man on call all the time?

372
00:29:03,282 --> 00:29:04,922
What brother? Is it love?

373
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:07,202
Hey, we ourselves don't have food to eat.

374
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,721
Do we need all this now?

375
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:10,362
Not us, it is about you.

376
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:13,802
Not today, but I will definitely
find a job that suits me.

377
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:15,282
How can you say that?

378
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:18,122
Listen, we all love money,
but will it give us back that love?

379
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:20,481
But if you love people
they will give it back to us.

380
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,361
People don't understand this logic
and spoil their lives.

381
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:42,921
Did you find him?

382
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:43,932
No brother.

383
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:52,041
This idiot is not even picking up my calls.

384
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:56,322
I will cut him into pieces once I find him.
- Will you throw them to crows and eagles?

385
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,761
- No, I will throw them to Kangaroos
- I guess Kangaroos doesn't eat meat.

386
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:01,922
You cannot bring that idiot,

387
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:04,122
but you tell me all these
nonsense dialogues.

388
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,122
Let's go!

389
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:20,841
Ram... I want to do a part-time job.

390
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,481
Let me know if there's anything

391
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:25,482
Oh why not, will find out tomorrow itself

392
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:26,682
What... Really?

393
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:27,642
Yeah

394
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:28,922
Thank you, Darling!

395
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,402
[PHONE RINGING]

396
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,321
- Hello.
- Ram, tell me

397
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,081
Nothing sir, I want a small help

398
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:37,442
Tell me what it is

399
00:30:37,562 --> 00:30:40,761
One of my friend needs a part-time job
at our restaurant sir.

400
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,041
- Is there any vacancy?
- Yeah yeah definitely,

401
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:45,722
ask her to join tomorrow.

402
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,241
Thank you sir, Bye!

403
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:51,042
Which Ram? You know him

404
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:52,202
What does he want?

405
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,882
One of his friend wanted a job. I said ok

406
00:30:57,242 --> 00:30:58,041
Okay!

407
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:03,402
Ram...

408
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,641
Ram... I got a job at your friend's
restaurant as an Accountant.

409
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:11,202
Weekly pay is $400, which is 20,000 rupees.

410
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:12,362
That means

411
00:31:12,882 --> 00:31:15,321
it will be Rs. 80K monthly.

412
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:18,081
Wow! If I earn this much for part-time,

413
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:21,321
I would be getting more for full time.
Thank you so much!

414
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:23,481
Thank you so much baby!

415
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:24,921
One more time

416
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:26,402
One more time

417
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,795
Enough, stop it now.

418
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:34,318
Hi!

419
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,460
- This is Abhay!
- Hello.

420
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,340
I am the business advisor
for this restaurant

421
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:40,594
Oh nice to meet you, I am Amrutha

422
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:41,995
- Nice name.
- Thank you!

423
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:44,035
- You are from?
- Hyderabad. And you?

424
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,875
Vizag. Your neighbouring state.

425
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:48,514
We are separated for name sake.
But we are all still united!

426
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,434
Yeah! It will be good if we are together.

427
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:52,315
What?

428
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:55,354
I mean it will be good
if our two states are together.

429
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:59,875
Call me whenever you want anything
in Australia,

430
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:01,554
I will resolve it in minutes.

431
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:03,394
I mean your problems.

432
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:04,754
Thanks!

433
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:10,354
- Ram...
- Yeah

434
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:12,794
I'm thinking off to move
out of brother's place.

435
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,474
Is it? Why?

436
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:17,555
How many days will I stay with them?

437
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:19,075
They might also feel uncomfortable

438
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:21,674
As far as I know, they don't feel that way

439
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,035
I know that

440
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:24,794
Then?

441
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:27,955
Because I need some comfort

442
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,234
Okay!

443
00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:33,035
Brother agreed to this. All set!

444
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:35,994
Oh. Where are you shifting?

445
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:38,755
I found a house near my work place.

446
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:42,515
- House?
- Yeah! Owners moved to India

447
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:45,434
House will be ours

448
00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:46,954
- What?
- Yeah

449
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,235
Who all will stay there?

450
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:51,715
You and me.

451
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:54,674
I need some comfort with you

452
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:56,755
Comfort? Really?

453
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,394
Yeah...

454
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,835
Comfort

455
00:33:02,474 --> 00:33:09,434
"Krishna, you please come quickly!"

456
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:16,514
"Krishna, you please come quickly!"

457
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:30,074
"You flow like a dream wave inside me...

458
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:44,995
"I look like a blooming flower
when I am with you..."

459
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:53,521
"You are my wish and breath..."

460
00:33:53,714 --> 00:34:00,314
"You just came into my life
like rain fall..."

461
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:10,826
"You are my desire and fire..."

462
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:18,074
"My soul and life is only for you..."

463
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:55,234
"You are there in my wishes..."

464
00:34:56,035 --> 00:35:02,834
"You are the meaning of my life..."

465
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:10,034
"Eye contact is intimating..."

466
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:17,594
"Body touch makes us feel excited..."

467
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:24,954
"My heart belongs to you..."

468
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:31,274
"Please listen to me.."

469
00:35:32,754 --> 00:35:39,794
"Krishna, you please come quickly!"

470
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:44,035
It works because this is Australia
and not India

471
00:35:47,954 --> 00:35:49,315
Yes!

472
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:53,555
That family who stays up,
when will they come back?

473
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:55,394
What?

474
00:35:56,634 --> 00:36:00,034
Please tell him clearly in english

475
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:02,275
- When will they come back?
- I don't know

476
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:05,075
- He doesn’t know itseems
- Thanks!

477
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,074
Hello... Listen to me,

478
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:12,514
Let me know if they come back.

479
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,194
If you give me the exact information,

480
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:19,274
I will give you money.

481
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:21,395
- Got it.
- You...

482
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,874
Stop it!

483
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:25,834
Language is not needed to talk
about money.

484
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:29,834
He understood the matter. Let's go!

485
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,795
Hey! Come here.

486
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,674
- Did Ram come to you?
- No brother, it's been many days.

487
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:41,754
Do you have any work with him?

488
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:46,714
I gave that idiot Rs.10K
with Rs.10 interest for 10 days.

489
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:50,914
Those are not Indian Rupees,
they are Dollars.

490
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:55,594
I am unable to take that money from him.

491
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:58,634
So decided to kill him.

492
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,715
Why do you have to kill him
for such small thing?

493
00:37:00,794 --> 00:37:03,994
Will you give me that money?

494
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:06,434
I don't have money with me now. Take it tomorrow

495
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:10,754
What? I don't understand
why are you clearing his debts

496
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,914
He was once my friend, brother

497
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,074
- Now?
- Now, No.

498
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:16,915
Why?

499
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:20,875
I pointed out his mistake and
he cut off with me.

500
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:23,714
- What did he do?
- What all he's doing is not right

501
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:27,355
Tell me the matter,

502
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:31,075
Otherwise I'll kill you with same knife
that I got to kill him.

503
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:33,355
- No, it's ok!
- I will do the mistake now

504
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:39,634
I asked him not to be irresponsible,
and he didn't like it.

505
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:43,154
It is not his mistake, it is yours.

506
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:48,835
You should not give anybody
good suggestions these days.

507
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:57,874
Tell him if you find him
or else you come and give my money.

508
00:37:58,594 --> 00:37:59,914
Do you get it?

509
00:38:02,395 --> 00:38:03,168
Hmm..

510
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:09,595
Abhi...

511
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:15,554
- Thank you very much Abhi.
- Why? He is my friend.

512
00:38:16,715 --> 00:38:19,834
Atleast you try to tell him.
How many days will he roam like this?

513
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:22,714
Will anyone who has come this far
will be like this?

514
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:28,394
If I try telling him anything,
he shuts me up.

515
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:33,194
Ask him to join us at work
and stop doing all this nonsense

516
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,954
He is lucky to have a friend like you.

517
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:40,754
I'll try to speak with him.
Thank you once again. Bye!

518
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:49,154
Hi...

519
00:38:50,634 --> 00:38:52,874
You came home early today?
You have any work?

520
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:54,514
No, nothing!

521
00:38:57,554 --> 00:38:58,594
Is anything wrong?

522
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:01,715
Nothing wrong.

523
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:07,794
Ram... Can I ask you something?

524
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,475
- Yeah
- Who is JD?

525
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:13,235
He is the worst fellow
in our Telugu community.

526
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,634
He makes cash out of our Telugu people's
imcompetence.

527
00:39:17,114 --> 00:39:18,074
Waste fellow!

528
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:20,075
When you know he isn't a good man,

529
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,875
Why did you borrow money from him?

530
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:24,074
I was in a bad situation
so I had to take it.

531
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:25,874
Why are you asking all this?

532
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,195
I don't need to know it, Ram

533
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:33,794
But I will feel bad when people
around talk about you.

534
00:39:34,794 --> 00:39:36,194
Why should I care about all that?

535
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:37,874
I didn't take that money for my needs.

536
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:40,874
My friend in India was in a serious condition
so I sent him that money.

537
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:45,074
I'm not saying what you did was wrong,

538
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:47,915
But you give him his money back, Ram

539
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:49,594
Yeah! I will give him.

540
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,034
Can we just not discuss about this now?

541
00:39:51,274 --> 00:39:53,874
Don't get mad at me. Please listen to me

542
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:55,714
Hmm, what is it?

543
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:57,955
How many days will you be idle?

544
00:39:58,114 --> 00:39:59,435
Why don't you start working?

545
00:39:59,594 --> 00:40:01,915
Getting a job immediately that suits
my interest is not easy

546
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:05,234
Why can't you do something else
till you get your favorite job?

547
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:09,194
I can't do any other job.
I will only do something I like

548
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:11,114
Why are you so stubborn?

549
00:40:11,314 --> 00:40:13,394
It sounds stubborn when I say the truth

550
00:40:14,074 --> 00:40:16,074
No Ram, listen to me.

551
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:18,554
There is a job at my work place.

552
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:22,394
If you join there,
you can clear your debts in 3 months

553
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,874
What the hell. You are helping me with job?

554
00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:28,594
I picked you up at the airport recently,

555
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:30,394
suggested you a job and now,

556
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,954
you are giving me these suggestions?
That too in a restaurant like that?

557
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:34,634
It is not like that, Ram

558
00:40:34,754 --> 00:40:37,194
I know what to do and
how to take care of things.

559
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:38,755
Stop giving me suggestions.

560
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,235
Everyone likes to give suggestions.

561
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:47,354
He is right, it was my mistake.

562
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:52,594
He came here before me,
he knows more than me.

563
00:40:58,994 --> 00:41:00,034
Ram!

564
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:04,634
Sorry… I will not say anything
like this again, I promise.

565
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:06,914
Hey…

566
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:08,114
Sorry.

567
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:09,594
Please please please.

568
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,554
Please smile...

569
00:41:12,994 --> 00:41:14,195
My baby.

570
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:21,715
Oh God!

571
00:41:22,074 --> 00:41:23,714
Ram, what happened?
- I cannot do it.

572
00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:27,154
My body isn't supporting me
This is why I ask you not to smoke.

573
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:30,994
I will stop. But jogging, not cigarettes

574
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,554
Okay, sit here.
I will finish one more round.

575
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:35,074
- Okay!
- Bye.

576
00:41:38,714 --> 00:41:39,754
Ram...

577
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,875
- Hey...
- Hey... How are you?

578
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:44,434
I'm good

579
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:45,835
What's up?

580
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:54,635
- See ya! Take care
- Bye!

581
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,474
- Come, let's go?
- Yeah!

582
00:42:00,714 --> 00:42:03,394
For the first time I'm mad at him.

583
00:42:03,674 --> 00:42:06,674
Any girl in my place will feel the same.

584
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:12,194
I heard that boys are not genuine
like girls.

585
00:42:12,554 --> 00:42:13,914
And now I experienced it.

586
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:18,954
Should I ask him?
Or wait till he tells me.

587
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:23,155
I can't wait, I will ask him.

588
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:26,114
Hey, Why are you silent?

589
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:29,995
Nothing. I am normal and fine.

590
00:42:30,274 --> 00:42:33,674
Ram, Who was that girl?

591
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:35,314
Girl? Which girl?

592
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:38,434
You just now hugged and kissed each other.

593
00:42:38,795 --> 00:42:39,914
You forgot already?

594
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:42,794
Oh Sophie? She's my old friend

595
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:45,674
We say Hi or shake hands with friends.

596
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:48,034
Do we hug and kiss them?

597
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:49,994
She said she's in love.

598
00:42:50,394 --> 00:42:51,554
With you?

599
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:53,434
With her boyfriend. I know him,

600
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:55,354
So she was telling me the same thing.

601
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:58,555
When she's in love with someone.
How can she hug you?

602
00:42:58,795 --> 00:42:59,915
All this is common here

603
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:03,154
It might be common for you,
but for me it is jealousy.

604
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:04,954
She has a boyfriend

605
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:07,994
Then ask her to hug him and not you

606
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:10,274
Hugging doesn't mean there
is something between us

607
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:13,154
You should've asked her to wait
and introduce me

608
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:15,914
You want me to introduce her to you, right?

609
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:16,754
Wait!

610
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:17,995
- Sophie...
- No Ram

611
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:21,394
- Don't embarass me. Please don't.
- You shut up.

612
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:24,154
Hey, she is Amrutha my girlfriend.

613
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:25,274
Oh Hi!

614
00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:27,154
Wow, you are so beautiful.

615
00:43:27,434 --> 00:43:28,154
Thank you!

616
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,195
Oh god! You guys make a good couple.
- Thank you Sophie.

617
00:43:32,754 --> 00:43:36,034
Ram is amazing,
I never met anyone like him

618
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:40,154
- I hope you guys be happy together.
- I got to go! See you.

619
00:43:40,434 --> 00:43:41,314
Okay bye!

620
00:43:41,394 --> 00:43:42,394
Bye!

621
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:52,234
Amrutha...

622
00:43:57,515 --> 00:43:59,114
- Where are you?
- Room. Why?

623
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:01,554
- Pick me up please.
- Where?

624
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:03,955
- Lakeview Gardens
- What are you doing there?

625
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:05,755
I'm begging. Come idiot.

626
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:07,634
Cut the call

627
00:44:19,315 --> 00:44:23,354
Mad female, look how is she holding
my husband-to-be

628
00:44:26,354 --> 00:44:28,514
- What happened?
- Torture has started friend.

629
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:30,754
Will there be any happy days in love?

630
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:32,794
First tell us the matter

631
00:44:34,314 --> 00:44:35,434
She's mad at you for this reason?

632
00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:37,034
If she's a girl from this country,

633
00:44:37,194 --> 00:44:40,394
she would've encouraged you.

634
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:43,555
Hey, she is an Indian.
That too a Telugu girl.

635
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,074
They are like that.

636
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:49,514
You face all these problems
when you stay together.

637
00:44:49,994 --> 00:44:58,514
Live separetely and meet once in a day,

638
00:44:58,634 --> 00:44:59,834
you will not face such issues.

639
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:04,234
When you sit together the whole day
and talk everything,

640
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:08,035
You become dry and start fighting
for small things.

641
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:11,074
Yeah! What he said is almost correct.

642
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:12,554
What should I now?

643
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:16,115
It is a long weekend from tomorrow,
we are all going on a long drive.

644
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:20,075
You also join, there will be a gap between
you both and everything will be fine.

645
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,515
She is already upset with me.
If I tell her this now,

646
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,074
I don't know how will she react.

647
00:45:25,194 --> 00:45:27,314
What is this dude?

648
00:45:27,715 --> 00:45:29,155
You are someone who doesn't fear of anything.

649
00:45:29,314 --> 00:45:31,234
But you are afraid of a girl now?
- Fool…

650
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,154
It is not like that. I don't want to hurt her.

651
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,754
Don't overact.

652
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:38,354
Look at him, he changed so much.

653
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:44,794
You took so much time to call back?
I was waiting for your call

654
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:46,994
You could've called me instead of waiting

655
00:45:48,274 --> 00:45:49,835
Okay. Tell me

656
00:45:50,034 --> 00:45:51,475
- What?
- Sorry

657
00:45:51,635 --> 00:45:52,715
Why?

658
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:54,154
Because you did a mistake

659
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:57,034
Oh for that?
Should I tell you something else?

660
00:45:57,115 --> 00:45:58,834
- What?
- Love you!

661
00:46:01,315 --> 00:46:03,194
Okay! Where are you?

662
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:06,035
- With friends.
- Come soon, I want to see you.

663
00:46:06,155 --> 00:46:07,274
Okay!

664
00:46:08,594 --> 00:46:11,434
Not like this, I will tell her directly.

665
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,582
- I'll meet you tomorrow. Bye!
- Bye...

666
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:19,959
Hey…

667
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:22,736
Let's go inside atleast.
Someone might see us.

668
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:24,937
It's ok, let them see.

669
00:46:25,057 --> 00:46:27,617
You can hug some random girl on road.

670
00:46:28,897 --> 00:46:31,616
But you get conscious when you hug me.

671
00:46:32,977 --> 00:46:34,057
Lift me up!

672
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,896
Why are you crying?

673
00:46:43,256 --> 00:46:44,337
What happened?

674
00:46:44,816 --> 00:46:47,536
Nothing. I like you so much.

675
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:50,057
I am mad about you. What to do?

676
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:54,376
Why are you mad about me.
Be normal and practical!

677
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:55,024
No! I can't.

678
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:58,897
I am like this. It felt bad all this while

679
00:46:59,737 --> 00:47:02,096
Please don't fight with me ever again

680
00:47:02,857 --> 00:47:03,937
I can't take it.

681
00:47:04,136 --> 00:47:07,097
Madam, you were the one who fought

682
00:47:07,537 --> 00:47:09,857
So? You will not talk to me unless I do?

683
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:11,456
Don't you love me?

684
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:16,256
I do. But you never gave me
a chance to prove it.

685
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:18,697
If you really want to prove it
you would've done it

686
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:22,177
I will, I will. Everything will fall
into place when time comes.

687
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,856
I will not give you that chance.

688
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,817
I will be the one who dominates.

689
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:28,976
- Is it?
- Yeah

690
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:31,177
Okay wait, let me get some water
I'm thirsty

691
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:32,497
Sit...

692
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:35,177
Don't leave me

693
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:40,417
Oh god! She isn't allowing me to move.

694
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,017
How should I tell her about
tomorrow's outing?

695
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:44,857
Baby...

696
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:48,176
I'm going on a longdrive with friends tomorrow.

697
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,096
Will be back in 3 days.

698
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:51,257
What?

699
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,976
3 days outing?

700
00:47:53,096 --> 00:47:53,857
Yeah.

701
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:57,776
I couldn't stay back without you
for 2 hours.

702
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:00,496
You want to go out for 3 days?

703
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:04,256
It's been so many days since
we all friends went out.

704
00:48:04,977 --> 00:48:08,137
They asked me and I confirmed.

705
00:48:08,336 --> 00:48:10,297
Now, If I don't go they'll feel bad.

706
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:15,736
And you don't care about my feelings?

707
00:48:17,057 --> 00:48:20,857
It is not like that baby.
We used to go on weekends

708
00:48:21,337 --> 00:48:22,377
I will also join you

709
00:48:22,537 --> 00:48:26,456
Only boys are going. So...

710
00:48:27,457 --> 00:48:29,216
You mean it is not possible, right?

711
00:48:29,696 --> 00:48:30,857
Yeah

712
00:48:35,737 --> 00:48:39,377
Okay go.

713
00:48:42,817 --> 00:48:45,417
But you need to be in touch.

714
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,217

00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:27,056
- When are you coming back?
- Tomorrow, why what happened?

740
00:51:27,176 --> 00:51:30,497
Amrutha fell down from stairs
and hurt her leg.

741
00:51:31,057 --> 00:51:32,776
I got her back home from hospital

742
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:34,657
Why didn't she call me?

743
00:51:34,856 --> 00:51:41,057
Because you asked her not to call
and disturb you

744
00:51:41,296 --> 00:51:43,496
Oh is it? I will start back right now

745

You keep telling me everything,

746

but you didn't inform me about this

747
00:52:01,697 --> 00:52:06,376
I didn't wanted to disturb you
when you were enjoying your tour.

748
00:52:08,977 --> 00:52:11,817
Is that tour more important than you?
Is this what you know about me?

749
00:52:12,817 --> 00:52:13,936

There is no time or patience
to do something

00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:12,697
- Then, what will you do now?
- What can I do? I have a friend in India.

760
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,416
He will do the funeral

Hey, he won't handover the passport.

763
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:20,937
And if he sees you there will be
a lot of fights

764
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,017
If he doesn't give, let's break his bones.

765
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:25,856
- Come, let’s go
- Buddy, trust me.

What is good, what is bad,

770
00:53:36,937 --> 00:53:41,456
What is hell, what is heaven

771
00:53:41,816 --> 00:53:46,216
What is truth, what is consent

772
00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:59,096
Everyone who is alive will die someday.

773
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:07,017
But as far as I know,
every human being dies everyday.

774
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,097
Thinking how is this possible?

775
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:13,496
Look at me, I always die for money

776
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:16,736
and all these people die for me.

777
00:54:16,897 --> 00:54:19,057
And you die for job.

778
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,337
Like this every human being is almost
dying daily.

00:54:24,017 --> 00:54:26,057

00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:28,736

- No brother.
- Hey!

782
00:54:31,177 --> 00:54:34,817

We cannot adjust so much money
immediately brother

786
00:54:44,816 --> 00:54:46,016
Then leave it.

When napkins are not there,
I am tearing my cloth and cleaning stuff

788
00:54:52,777 --> 00:54:59,377
Just in case if we meet a Pakistani guy
we help him if he in trouble

same place and that too Telugu people.

if we don't help each other?

and borrowed Dollars from me

895
01:03:29,383 --> 01:03:31,223
She just gave him lift

896
01:03:31,383 --> 01:03:33,143
Today she just gave lift

897
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:35,583
Tomorrow, she might lift him too

898
01:03:35,864 --> 01:03:37,143
That will not happen

899
01:03:37,304 --> 01:03:38,863
I trust Ram

900
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,263
More than I trust Ram,
I don't believe in girls here.

901
01:03:43,503 --> 01:03:45,344
Also, fair skin

902
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:48,423
That will not happen.
You are thinking way too far

903
01:03:48,743 --> 01:03:49,823
Why can't it happen?

904
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:51,583
She is much beautiful than me

905
01:03:51,824 --> 01:03:54,663
You mad girl! You think Ram loved you
because of your beauty?

906
01:03:54,783 --> 01:03:57,584
I don't know what he liked in me

907
01:03:57,824 --> 01:03:58,983
I know

908
01:04:01,343 --> 01:04:02,183
What?

909
01:04:02,264 --> 01:04:04,503
Ram loved you for your innocence

910
01:04:04,743 --> 01:04:05,863
How do you know?

911
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:08,183
He told me this when he came to my place

912
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:11,343
- Really?
- Yeah!

913
01:04:11,623 --> 01:04:14,783
Stop thinking all this and be nice to him

914
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:17,943
He really loves me so much?

915
01:04:18,183 --> 01:04:18,984
Yeah!

916
01:04:19,303 --> 01:04:21,704
He really likes you

917
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:26,143
Okay, I'll leave

918
01:04:28,103 --> 01:04:30,224
How could you lie so easily?

919
01:04:30,504 --> 01:04:35,623
Whatever I say, she will not understand
anything now

920
01:04:35,783 --> 01:04:36,503
Why?

921
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:41,184
As a girl I can understand
what she's going through

922
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:43,143
Ohh, what position is she in?

923
01:04:43,743 --> 01:04:45,263
You will not understand

924
01:04:46,063 --> 01:04:46,824
Ram...

925
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:48,864
Sorry.

926
01:04:49,143 --> 01:04:50,423
Sorry? For what?

927
01:04:50,703 --> 01:04:52,463
Just like that

928
01:04:52,743 --> 01:04:54,663
You will not just say it
without any reason. Tell me what is it.

929
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:56,264
I said nothing

930
01:04:57,623 --> 01:04:59,304
I understood a bit

931
01:04:59,864 --> 01:05:01,663
Tell me what did you understand?

932
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:08,663
Yeah! It is about Tana.

933
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:10,063
Stupid female!

934
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:13,063
How dare she told you bye.

935
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:15,903
What? No one should talk to me?

936
01:05:16,063 --> 01:05:19,023
They can speak. But I should know them.

937
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:21,663
If not you should introduce them,

938
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,783
I will see what their character is
and then decide

939
01:05:25,224 --> 01:05:26,543
What is this condition?

940
01:05:27,104 --> 01:05:28,543
You take it however you want,

941
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,863
I will be careful.

942
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:32,504
You are so handsome.

943
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:35,343
What if someone snatches you away?
- You are mad. I am not handsome

944
01:05:35,384 --> 01:05:36,263
I'm just an average guy.

945
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:39,503
Guy I loved is be handsome.

946
01:05:40,263 --> 01:05:41,863
You will understand it
if you see through my eyes

947
01:05:41,943 --> 01:05:43,263
Exactly like you said.

948
01:05:43,503 --> 01:05:45,344
I might look handsome to your eyes
not for everyone.

949
01:05:45,504 --> 01:05:46,904
What if someones sees it?

950
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:48,503
Don't you think this is too much?

951
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:49,623
Noo.

952
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:55,983
Hi Tana

953
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:57,423
Hi

954
01:05:59,904 --> 01:06:01,743
Ram, can I ask you something?

955
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:03,103
Yeah sure.

956
01:06:03,344 --> 01:06:04,623
What do you think about me?

957
01:06:04,704 --> 01:06:07,503
You are matured, talented, beautiful

958
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:08,703
Ohh nice.

959
01:06:10,263 --> 01:06:11,783
You know I'm married.

960
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:14,103
Really? You don't look like that

961
01:06:16,224 --> 01:06:17,383
I am divorced

962
01:06:17,624 --> 01:06:19,463
Oh sorry! Sorry for you

963
01:06:19,664 --> 01:06:20,864
That's ok.

964
01:06:21,623 --> 01:06:23,183
I just wanted to tell you.

965
01:06:23,303 --> 01:06:24,303
I am lonely here.

966
01:06:24,423 --> 01:06:26,384
My mom and dad live in Adelaide.

967
01:06:27,063 --> 01:06:29,943
So you can keep me company

968
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:32,144
Okay!

969
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,063
Brother, 5000 dollars

970
01:06:40,303 --> 01:06:42,503
What about the rest money?
I will give you soon

971
01:06:43,743 --> 01:06:44,663
Okay

972
01:06:48,223 --> 01:06:49,103
Hi...

973
01:06:51,503 --> 01:06:53,788
- What's up?
- Did you get the ID card?

974
01:06:58,783 --> 01:07:00,224
Is your blood O negative?

975
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:01,263
Yeah

976
01:07:01,943 --> 01:07:02,783
Okay

977
01:07:02,903 --> 01:07:05,423
I am hungry, let's eat something

978
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:09,183
Where shall we go?
- Your wish, where ever you want to go

979
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:10,503
Okay.

980
01:07:38,423 --> 01:07:41,068
"I know you are mine..."

981
01:07:41,078 --> 01:07:49,638
"I gave you all my heart,
I will be with all your life..."

982
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:54,343
“We both are one now and will be like this
for the next 100 years…”

983
01:07:54,463 --> 01:08:00,744
"I get all new dreams because of you..."

984
01:08:01,383 --> 01:08:10,573
"You gave me new dreams,
that I never dreamt of..."

985
01:08:10,743 --> 01:08:19,023
"You've become mine breaking the loneliness
that's around me..."

986
01:08:19,944 --> 01:08:22,373
"I know you are mine..."

987
01:08:22,383 --> 01:08:31,064
"I gave you all my heart,
I will be with all your life..."

988
01:08:51,303 --> 01:08:53,144
- Drink this one.
- No, I don't want that.

989
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:54,943
Drink it, It makes you warm...

990
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,504
I don't want that

991
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:09,423
"My heart wants you more than me..."

992
01:09:10,544 --> 01:09:18,263
"Can I live without even for a minute..."

993
01:09:20,103 --> 01:09:24,344
"Am I not just yours?"

994
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:28,583
"I will just be in your arms..."

995
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:29,864
Ram...

996
01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:31,064
Yeah!

997
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,663
Let's get married

998
01:09:33,223 --> 01:09:35,343
Why? Is that needed? We are happy now.

999
01:09:35,624 --> 01:09:37,143
What?

1000
01:09:38,063 --> 01:09:40,664
You might not need marriage, but I do

1001
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,863
Okay get married. Did I stop you?

1002
01:09:43,823 --> 01:09:44,863
What?

1003
01:09:45,303 --> 01:09:49,823
"On those sweet lips..."

1004
01:09:49,983 --> 01:09:54,223
"I will remain like this being yours..."

1005
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,703
"I know you are mine..."

1006
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:02,624
I gave you all my heart, I will be with all your life...

1007
01:10:02,903 --> 01:10:07,743
We both are one now and will be like this
for the next 100 years...

1008
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,783
Wait for 2 minutes

1009
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:31,133
Here it is!

1010
01:10:31,383 --> 01:10:32,343
Your coffee

1011
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:34,823
Somebody texted you, check it

1012
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:35,864
Who is it?

1013
01:10:54,903 --> 01:10:57,263
Ram.... Talk to me

1014
01:10:59,984 --> 01:11:01,103
What should I talk?

1015
01:11:03,983 --> 01:11:06,503
I cannot keep something inside
and behave normal.

1016
01:11:07,183 --> 01:11:08,904
I asked you what I felt.

1017
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:10,824
What is wrong in it?

1018
01:11:12,744 --> 01:11:14,624
It's not your mistake but mine

1019
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:20,984
Sorry, I will not touch your phone ever again.

1020
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:22,983
I am really sorry.

1021
01:11:32,263 --> 01:11:34,343
Hey, come here.

1022
01:11:40,143 --> 01:11:41,463
It is not like that baby

1023
01:11:42,183 --> 01:11:44,024
Don't tell me anything.

1024
01:11:44,544 --> 01:11:46,263
I trust you!

1025
01:11:52,663 --> 01:11:54,544
[PHONE RINGING]

1026
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,718
- Hello Ram.
- Hello Tana.

1027
01:11:57,839 --> 01:12:01,254
How are you?
- I am not feeling well for sure.

1028
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:03,653
I think I have fever

1029
01:12:03,808 --> 01:12:05,177
Did you take the medicine or not?

1030
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:07,409
I don't have the energy to take
the medicine.

1031
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:10,369
Can you drop by?
- Sure baby, text me.

1032
01:12:11,129 --> 01:12:12,009
Bye!

1033
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:22,930
Why is here?

1034
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:24,809
Where is he going?

1035
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,409
Whose house is this?

1036
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,088
Why did he come here?

1037
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:18,129
What is he doing?

1038
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:19,609
Take these medicines.

1039
01:13:19,969 --> 01:13:21,568
You need to drink a lot of water

1040
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:23,608
Sure Ram.

1041
01:13:24,769 --> 01:13:27,489
Tell me Ram, What do you want to drink?

1042
01:13:27,729 --> 01:13:28,809
No it's okay

1043
01:13:28,929 --> 01:13:31,049
But you have to take something

1044
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:32,169
Coffee

1045
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:33,809
It's not time for coffee.

1046
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:35,849
I'll tell you why...

1047
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:42,369
See.

1048
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:44,889
- But you said you’re not well.
- I wasn’t…

1049
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:46,889
Until you came.

1050
01:13:52,009 --> 01:13:53,170
I'll go get the broom.

1051
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:55,889
Hey, are you okay?

1052
01:13:56,769 --> 01:13:57,769
Yeah okay

1053
01:13:58,168 --> 01:13:59,329
Sit here!

1054
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,769
Ram, can you take me to the bedroom

1055
01:14:06,928 --> 01:14:08,969
Okay! Put down your leg carefully

1056
01:14:09,009 --> 01:14:10,089
Got you!

1057
01:14:27,649 --> 01:14:29,449
- Hi…
- How is Ram?

1058
01:14:30,209 --> 01:14:32,969
He got his favorite job, he's happy

1059
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:37,648
Yeah! He is very happy.

1060
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:42,328
You can't even imagine how happy he is.

1061
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:43,489
Sorry!

1062
01:14:50,249 --> 01:14:52,951
Not just that, he did so much.

1063
01:14:53,569 --> 01:14:55,489
I'm showing you the censored version.

1064
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:58,409
You trusted him madly. See what happened

1065
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,769
I'll leave

1066
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:11,849
What the hell?

1067
01:15:12,889 --> 01:15:14,369
This is recent one.

1068
01:15:24,049 --> 01:15:25,330
Amrutha...

1069
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:29,569
All that is in the video is not true.

1070
01:15:30,769 --> 01:15:33,289
I saw it with my eyes, and you're saying
it is not true.

1071
01:15:33,449 --> 01:15:35,809
Why are you cheating on me Ram?

1072
01:15:36,769 --> 01:15:40,129
I've trusted you so much!
I loved you so much,

1073
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:43,049
I thought you are all mine.

1074
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:45,169
Ammu, I am always yours.

1075
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:48,129
Don't try to convince me

1076
01:15:48,448 --> 01:15:51,809
Hey, why don't you understand?
Why should I even convince you?

1077
01:15:52,329 --> 01:15:53,969
Who sent you this video?

1078
01:15:55,729 --> 01:15:56,649
Abhi...

1079
01:15:57,249 --> 01:15:59,289
Waste fellow. Come with me

1080
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:03,209
Ram no, please no fights. Please

1081
01:16:03,329 --> 01:16:04,849
Shut up and come with me.

1082
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:07,768
Get in.

1083
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:30,089
Tell her the truth.
- I’ll tell you…

1084
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:33,289
Amrutha come and listen to him.

1085
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,929
Tana, what are you doing?

1086
01:16:42,049 --> 01:16:43,329
Tell me about yourself

1087
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:44,609
What do you want from me?

1088
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:46,969
I need you Ram.

1089
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:50,449
- Are you serious?
- I think I am in love with you maybe

1090
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:53,689
- You are kidding me, right?
- No Ram, I am quiet serious.

1091
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,848
- I think you are too…
- Yes, I am but not with you.

1092
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:58,369
What?

1093
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,649
Yeah!

1094
01:17:00,289 --> 01:17:01,449
Her name is Amrutha

1095
01:17:01,569 --> 01:17:02,608
Is she beautiful?

1096
01:17:02,689 --> 01:17:05,609
If I see from my eyes,
she might not be as beautiful as you.

1097
01:17:06,249 --> 01:17:07,569
But If I see her with my heart,

1098
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:11,128
after my mom I can only see Amrutha.

1099
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:14,889
I am not just in love with her.

1100
01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:17,049
Her love is more pure than mine.

1101
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:25,169
Comparing her love with mine is foolishness

1102
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:27,609
Wow! She is so lucky

1103
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:30,769
- I am lucky.
- You guys are made for eachother

1104
01:17:33,369 --> 01:17:35,128
Ram... Come here!

1105
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:41,689
Say sorry to Amrutha for me.

1106
01:17:42,529 --> 01:17:44,049
Sure. I will

1107
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:56,248
Hey...

1108
01:17:56,929 --> 01:17:59,849
You proved that you are genuine in your love.

1109
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,009
But is she the same?

1110
01:18:03,409 --> 01:18:05,449
- What are you talking?
- Not me..

1111
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:08,089
But if you listen to what I say, you will...

1112
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:09,729
- Hey you...
- Ram...

1113
01:18:09,929 --> 01:18:14,449
Job which you're doing now
is recommended by her.

1114
01:18:14,569 --> 01:18:16,809
She knows that you are useless

1115
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:19,408
Amrutha, what he's saying is true?

1116
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:20,689
Ram...

1117
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:22,409
Listen to me

1118
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:25,489
Amrutha, Just tell me if that is true

1119
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:26,529
Ram...

1120
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,230
Hey!

1121
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:28,928
Is is true or not?

1122
01:18:35,018 --> 01:18:38,458
Don't worry about anything,
this job is yours.

1123
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:40,369
How can you be so confident?

1124
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:42,435
It is about the confidence I have in you

1125
01:18:42,529 --> 01:18:44,289
I know that I will be getting
this job one day.

1126
01:18:44,368 --> 01:18:45,929
No one believed me.

1127
01:18:55,929 --> 01:18:57,529
Please open the door.

1128
01:18:58,289 --> 01:18:59,249
Ram!

1129
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:02,488
Ram please open the door.

1130
01:19:02,499 --> 01:19:02,988
Ram!

1131
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:08,689
Ram...

1132
01:19:15,169 --> 01:19:18,688
Ram don't go please.
I cannot live without you

1133
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:20,410
Enough is enough.

1134
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,249
You cheated once I don't want this to repeat

1135
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:23,849
How is this called cheating Ram?

1136
01:19:24,129 --> 01:19:26,329
- Why are you taking it in a wrong way?
- I will take it however I want.

1137
01:19:26,488 --> 01:19:28,528
You didn't even wanted to inform me
about the job?

1138
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,329
I know you wouldn’t agree to it.
So I didn't tell you

1139
01:19:31,489 --> 01:19:34,089
I loved you so much. I never thought
I will be cheated so easily

1140
01:19:34,209 --> 01:19:35,489
This is not cheating

1141
01:19:35,649 --> 01:19:37,249
You played with my emotions,

1142
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:38,848
you didn't even give some respect

1143
01:19:39,088 --> 01:19:40,609
Why are saying that Ram?

1144
01:19:40,768 --> 01:19:41,848
Am I not your girl?

1145
01:19:41,929 --> 01:19:45,009
Yeah! Even I felt the same.
But you didn't

1146
01:19:45,169 --> 01:19:46,969
That is the reason you didn't tell me
about your job

1147
01:19:47,129 --> 01:19:49,489
Be yourself, however you want.

1148
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:51,489
But don't leave me Ram, please.

1149
01:19:51,649 --> 01:19:52,889
Stop this nonsense.

1150
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:55,849
Go tell your friend that
I am resigning this job

1151
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:59,569
You are mad at me.
Why do you have to resign?

1152
01:20:00,009 --> 01:20:01,489
Wait Ram, please

1153
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:04,369
Not just mad, I hate you!

1154
01:20:04,529 --> 01:20:07,768
I cannot kill my self respect
and stay back.

1155
01:20:08,009 --> 01:20:09,889
I don't need you nor your fake love.

1156
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:18,689
- Hello
- Sorry brother.

1157
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:21,449
I am not in a position to give you
the balance amount.

1158
01:20:21,769 --> 01:20:23,809
I need some more time.
- Why?

1159
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,129
I lost my job brother

1160
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:30,169
I think your girl knows that
you will lose your job.

1161
01:20:30,529 --> 01:20:38,368
She cleared the payment but
asked me not to tell you.

1162
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,569
I couldn't control

1163
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:45,850
so told you about it

1164
01:20:46,369 --> 01:20:48,009
See you.

1165
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:52,409
Ram, listen to me Ram please

1166
01:20:52,529 --> 01:20:54,569
You made a fool out of me everywhere

1167
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:56,689
No Ram...

1168
01:20:57,688 --> 01:20:59,209
Ram please...

1169
01:21:01,444 --> 01:21:03,062
Ram.. Please!

1170
01:21:03,563 --> 01:21:04,045
Please Ram.

1171
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:06,319
- Hey, why don’t you understand?
- Please Ram…

1172
01:21:06,769 --> 01:21:08,158
Please don't go Ram. Please Ram

1173
01:21:08,169 --> 01:21:10,168
Get lost! Why are you behind me
like a dog

1174
01:21:10,222 --> 01:21:13,810
I am ok with whatever you say or scold,
but please don't go Ram.

1175
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:35,689
Ram...

1176
01:21:36,289 --> 01:21:38,729
Open the door Ram please, don't go

1177
01:21:38,889 --> 01:21:43,009
Please Ram, open the door.
Don't go Ram, please.

1178
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:32,929
"Is this called love?
Will it give so much pain..."

1179
01:22:33,009 --> 01:22:38,449
"Should I just cry that you are not here..."

1180
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:41,929
"My tears are floating like a river..."

1181
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:48,969
"Will I be able to see you in my dreams?"

1182
01:22:49,569 --> 01:22:55,888
"I am waiting for you to call me..."

1183
01:22:56,809 --> 01:23:03,409
'As you are not coming back, I feel lost..."

1184
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:10,449
"There is no life without you..."

1185
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:18,490
"Who said there is no love,
I am standing here today"

1186
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:25,449
"like a bird with no wings..."

1187
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:47,449
"Should I just tell you my feelings
behind my silence..."

1188
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:54,970
"I will be standing on a curved road
all alone..."

1189
01:23:55,529 --> 01:24:02,289
"Do you know that these are written
with tears in my eyes..."

1190
01:24:02,809 --> 01:24:09,688
"This pain in my heart is hurting me
so much..."

1191
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:17,236
"Should I shout that I am nothing
without you in my life..."

1192
01:24:17,488 --> 01:24:24,836
"I am alone just like a star
with no light..."

1193
01:25:23,978 --> 01:25:25,217
Did you find Ram?

1194
01:25:25,378 --> 01:25:28,378
I thought you would ask me
Why am I here as soon as you wake up

1195
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:29,458
Where is Ram?

1196
01:25:30,494 --> 01:25:33,614
Do you know what is your condition?

1197
01:25:34,173 --> 01:25:37,214
You've been lying here
since 2 days without food.

1198
01:25:37,854 --> 01:25:42,375
It is good that we came here on time.

1199
01:25:42,614 --> 01:25:43,734
Where is Ram?

1200
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,120
Are you mad?

1201
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,360
He is not here, nobody knows
where he is.

1202
01:25:47,503 --> 01:25:49,823
- Everyone is searching for him.
- Where did he go?

1203
01:25:50,183 --> 01:25:52,064
- When can he come back?
- Amrutha…

1204
01:25:52,863 --> 01:25:56,503
If you're love is true
he will come back

1205
01:25:57,463 --> 01:26:02,743
If you stop eating like this you will die
before he is here.

1206
01:26:04,903 --> 01:26:07,623
You know what is more painful
than death?

1207
01:26:09,985 --> 01:26:12,040
Loving someone wholeheartedly

1208
01:26:12,086 --> 01:26:15,006
Amrutha, think before you do something.

1209
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,509
We all know how much you love Ram.

1210
01:26:18,519 --> 01:26:25,804
He might have done that because
he was angry.

1211
01:26:29,502 --> 01:26:31,101
[Phone Ringing]

1212
01:26:34,504 --> 01:26:36,193
Amrutha, Ram is at Shepherd court.

1213
01:27:17,943 --> 01:27:20,424
Ram, why did you do this Ram?

1214
01:27:20,864 --> 01:27:23,583
Why did you leave me?

1215
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:27,704
You know I cannot live without you

1216
01:27:29,463 --> 01:27:30,225
Leave me!

1217
01:27:30,344 --> 01:27:33,904
Please Ram. I know it is my fault
Please forgive me

1218
01:27:34,065 --> 01:27:35,624
I will not repeat this ever again baby.

1219
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:38,024
Please! I cannot stay without you

1220
01:27:38,264 --> 01:27:40,064
I cannot live without you, I can't...

1221
01:27:40,264 --> 01:27:42,063
Amrutha, leave me. It doesn't look good

1222
01:27:42,344 --> 01:27:45,624
Let them see, I don't care

1223
01:27:46,304 --> 01:27:47,784
Why are you behaving like a Psycho?

1224
01:27:47,904 --> 01:27:51,264
I will really become mad
if you leave me Ram.

1225
01:27:51,704 --> 01:27:53,664
Be however you want.

1226
01:27:53,904 --> 01:27:55,824
I will not question again.

1227
01:27:55,984 --> 01:28:01,905
You need not work also.
I will take care of everything

1228
01:28:02,344 --> 01:28:05,784
Don’t do anything, just be with me.
That's enough

1229
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:11,271
You mean that I'm still a useless man, right?

1230
01:28:12,104 --> 01:28:14,583
I didn't say that, Ram.
You will look after me?

1231
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:18,184
- I didn't mean it in that way
- Then, why did you say that?

1232
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,744
I said that because I love you

1233
01:28:21,264 --> 01:28:25,304
Yeah that same love made me
stand on this road.

1234
01:28:26,144 --> 01:28:28,064
There is no freedom,

1235
01:28:29,384 --> 01:28:32,424
You must like all that I do.

1236
01:28:32,823 --> 01:28:34,304
You change everything as per your wish.

1237
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:37,704
Understanding each other feelings is what love is

1238
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,584
You shouldn't force people into anything

1239
01:28:41,384 --> 01:28:43,744
I've been observing ever
since we met each other.

1240
01:28:44,025 --> 01:28:46,905
You keep poking into everything
and call it love.

1241
01:28:47,584 --> 01:28:49,944
I cannot do this anymore.
Please leave me

1242
01:28:52,424 --> 01:28:53,384
Hey...

1243
01:28:53,664 --> 01:28:56,144
Ram, please don't say that.

1244
01:28:56,984 --> 01:28:58,664
I will not repeat this Ram

1245
01:28:59,184 --> 01:29:02,784
I'll stay however you want

1246
01:29:02,944 --> 01:29:05,024
I will whatever you want me to do

1247
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,344
I will prove that my love is true

1248
01:29:07,544 --> 01:29:10,184
Please give me one last time, Ram

1249
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:14,144
Will you really prove it?
- Yeah, I will

1250
01:29:15,903 --> 01:29:18,024
Then don't show me your face again.

1251
01:29:18,184 --> 01:29:19,904
And then I will trust your love.

1252
01:29:25,464 --> 01:29:26,664
Just leave!

1253
01:29:38,064 --> 01:29:40,384
Is this your final decision?

1254
01:29:41,224 --> 01:29:42,104
Yes.

1255
01:30:05,103 --> 01:30:06,683
What happened?
Where are you going Amrutha?

1256
01:30:09,264 --> 01:30:10,704
I am going back to India

1257
01:30:10,863 --> 01:30:12,304
Why? What happened?

1258
01:30:13,224 --> 01:30:16,585
- Will you really prove your love?
- Yeah, I will

1259
01:30:16,864 --> 01:30:20,744
Then don't show me your face again.

1260
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:23,264
Just leave.

1261
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:26,304
Amrutha, you going India in
this condition is not good

1262
01:30:26,664 --> 01:30:28,744
I cannot stay here brother.

1263
01:30:28,944 --> 01:30:33,304
If I stay back I cannot stop myself
from meeting Ram.

1264
01:30:34,224 --> 01:30:35,703
I cannot face all that

1265
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,024
Will you spoil your life for that?

1266
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:44,824
A person should never take a decision
when they are angry, sad or happy.

1267
01:30:45,744 --> 01:30:47,264
As you both have been together
for so many days,

1268
01:30:47,384 --> 01:30:49,224
He might have got irritated a bit

1269
01:30:49,464 --> 01:30:51,024
but love will be the same

1270
01:30:52,424 --> 01:30:54,864
If you want to win his love
You should first lose.

1271
01:30:55,904 --> 01:30:58,344
Stay away from Ram for few days

1272
01:30:58,623 --> 01:30:59,984
Things will settle.

1273
01:31:00,624 --> 01:31:03,184
Trust me Amrutha, time heals everything

1274
01:31:15,544 --> 01:31:16,464
What is this buddy?

1275
01:31:18,903 --> 01:31:19,944
why are you doing this?

1276
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:22,264
What did I do?

1277
01:31:23,224 --> 01:31:24,944
Don't ask me that.

1278
01:31:25,743 --> 01:31:28,744
How many days will you stay away
from everyone?

1279
01:31:28,904 --> 01:31:33,064
I think I'll be peaceful staying away
from people for few days

1280
01:31:33,704 --> 01:31:37,184
You mean, you were not peaceful
all these days?

1281
01:31:38,504 --> 01:31:39,705
I didn't mean it that way

1282
01:31:40,064 --> 01:31:43,904
We all know how much she loves you,

1283
01:31:44,144 --> 01:31:45,744
Why are you not understanding that

1284
01:31:46,464 --> 01:31:50,184
If you are here only to talk
about Amrutha, please leave

1285
01:31:51,704 --> 01:31:54,024
What? You want me to leave?

1286
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:57,183
Before I leave, I'll talk
everything clearly.

1287
01:31:58,584 --> 01:32:00,144
First tell me something?

1288
01:32:01,023 --> 01:32:02,424
What is Amrutha's mistake?

1289
01:32:04,544 --> 01:32:06,585
Mistake? It is a very small word.

1290
01:32:07,023 --> 01:32:08,144
She cheated on me

1291
01:32:08,703 --> 01:32:09,663
Cheating?

1292
01:32:12,304 --> 01:32:15,144
Loving you so much is cheating?

1293
01:32:15,784 --> 01:32:17,904
Thinking about you always
is called cheating?

1294
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:21,984
Leaving everything behind
for you is called cheating?

1295
01:32:22,504 --> 01:32:27,264
She wanted to live with you,
die with you, Is all this cheating?

1296
01:32:27,544 --> 01:32:30,624
She cared for you more than your parents

1297
01:32:30,705 --> 01:32:31,944
If she really cared about me so much,

1298
01:32:32,104 --> 01:32:34,824
Why didn't she inform me
about the job

1299
01:32:36,704 --> 01:32:41,624
She clearly knows you would never agree to it.

1300
01:32:41,744 --> 01:32:42,744
If this is called cheating

1301
01:32:42,824 --> 01:32:45,144
Then what you are doing with her now
is called betrayal.

1302
01:32:46,905 --> 01:32:48,063
Is this called betrayal?

1303
01:32:48,303 --> 01:32:50,024
Is that called betrayal, then?

1304
01:32:50,824 --> 01:32:54,104
You got that job because
you attended the interview

1305
01:32:55,064 --> 01:32:58,623
Because of your talent and
not because she recommended.

1306
01:33:00,064 --> 01:33:01,743
Okay, let us keep that aside.

1307
01:33:01,864 --> 01:33:05,104
She made a fool out of me by paying back
to JD. Isn't that a mistake?

1308
01:33:06,784 --> 01:33:10,024
Are they any great people for you
to become a fool?

1309
01:33:10,504 --> 01:33:13,983
She gave money back to JD and
asked him not to irritate you anymore.

1310
01:33:14,264 --> 01:33:16,544
She didn't make a fool out of you,
but instead saved your dignity .

1311
01:33:17,904 --> 01:33:19,504
And coming to that Abhay,

1312
01:33:19,665 --> 01:33:22,584
we both know about his character

1313
01:33:23,505 --> 01:33:25,305
Since the day Amrutha came here,

1314
01:33:25,984 --> 01:33:28,424
She only had you in her priority list.

1315
01:33:28,864 --> 01:33:33,224
It is your luck that you have her
in your life.

1316
01:33:33,464 --> 01:33:35,784
Girls are horrible these days,

1317
01:33:36,063 --> 01:33:40,224
and you've got her in your life

1318
01:33:40,384 --> 01:33:41,664
Please stop it!

1319
01:33:42,063 --> 01:33:45,224
You are just talking about
Amrutha continuously,

1320
01:33:45,304 --> 01:33:48,663
Not just her even I loved her
wholeheartedly.

1321
01:33:48,783 --> 01:33:52,144
My love is genuine too.

1322
01:33:53,064 --> 01:33:56,223
Then why can't you forgive her?

1323
01:33:57,064 --> 01:34:00,104
She wanted her love to win so she did this mistake,

1324
01:34:00,303 --> 01:34:01,304
why can't you forgive and move on?

1325
01:34:01,464 --> 01:34:02,904
Why should I compromise?

1326
01:34:03,024 --> 01:34:06,024
Why can't she do it?
- She was doing the same till now.

1327
01:34:06,624 --> 01:34:09,184
Whatever the situation is,
She was the one who always compromised.

1328
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:12,264
Sorry, I am really sorry.

1329
01:34:12,904 --> 01:34:17,343
It was my mistake.
Sorry sorry, I am sorry.

1330
01:34:17,704 --> 01:34:20,424
It was my mistake.
Please forgive me.

1331
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:24,464
If you want the relation to be strong,

1332
01:34:24,945 --> 01:34:27,104
You should also know to forgive people.

1333
01:34:28,544 --> 01:34:33,224
Amrutha is a girl who only
knows to give love.

1334
01:34:34,664 --> 01:34:38,463
The day you understand this
you will go back to her.

1335
01:34:39,464 --> 01:34:41,944
This is not my philosophy,
it is Nature's philosophy.

1336
01:34:44,034 --> 01:34:45,877
It is your wish now.

1337
01:35:02,624 --> 01:35:09,464
"You made my imagination come true with your love..."

1338
01:35:09,945 --> 01:35:16,344
"Our souls have become one..."

1339
01:35:17,304 --> 01:35:24,144
"Everything was so good when I was with you"

1340
01:35:24,663 --> 01:35:31,544
"I'm the one who left you,
it is my mistake..."

1341
01:35:31,904 --> 01:35:38,504
"Not having you in my life is giving me pain,

1342
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:45,504
and I'm unable to bear it..."

1343
01:36:01,304 --> 01:36:14,624
"It is all you everywhere
when I close or open my eyes..."

1344
01:36:16,024 --> 01:36:22,553
"My world is empty without you..."

1345
01:36:23,264 --> 01:36:29,464
"I've realised there is no life
without you..."

1346
01:36:30,945 --> 01:36:31,905
Utham...

1347
01:36:34,344 --> 01:36:36,184
Where is Amrutha, I want to see her

1348
01:36:38,007 --> 01:36:40,720
Harrison Street, Landsdale,

1349
01:36:41,526 --> 01:36:42,414
Melbourne.

1350
01:36:51,259 --> 01:36:54,513
[PHONE RINGING]

1351
01:36:57,392 --> 01:36:58,880
- Hello...
- Hello Amrutha...

1352
01:36:59,337 --> 01:37:00,977
Hi brother, How are you?

1353
01:37:01,137 --> 01:37:03,498
I'm fine, but guess what

1354
01:37:05,697 --> 01:37:07,338
Ram is coming for you...

1355
01:37:09,057 --> 01:37:12,217
Yeah Amrutha! He has totally changed.
- What?

1356
01:37:12,377 --> 01:37:14,376
He wants to see you,
He is coming in search of you

1357
01:37:18,096 --> 01:37:21,057
I told you know,
time heals everything Amrutha.

1358
01:37:21,177 --> 01:37:23,497
Thank you Brother...

1359
01:37:58,017 --> 01:37:59,817
Ambulance...

1360
01:38:02,617 --> 01:38:03,857
Yes, yes sir.

1361
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,657
His condition is critical.

1362
01:38:05,898 --> 01:38:09,257
The major complication and death
may be imminent

1363
01:38:09,457 --> 01:38:11,337
He has got multiple fractures in his body,

1364
01:38:11,537 --> 01:38:16,137
Mainly his heart is damaged.

1365
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:18,257
It's called Cardiac Tamponade.

1366
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:23,857
His heartbeat count will be decreased
to 20 times per minute from 70-80.

1367
01:38:24,937 --> 01:38:26,657
It is very tough for him to survive.

1368
01:38:30,336 --> 01:38:34,176
Maximum 24 hours.
Talk to the Indian Embassy,

1369
01:38:34,937 --> 01:38:38,658
Finish the formalities and
Plan how to take the body to India.

1370
01:38:40,417 --> 01:38:42,937
We are helpless, Sorry!

1371
01:39:38,496 --> 01:39:39,817
Where is Amrutha?

1372
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,497
I'm talking to you, where is Amrutha?

1373
01:39:47,337 --> 01:39:48,977
She is not here

1374
01:39:49,097 --> 01:39:50,417
Where did she go?

1375
01:39:50,577 --> 01:39:51,537
She has gone to India

1376
01:39:51,657 --> 01:39:56,736
I know she will not leave me
in this condition and go.

1377
01:39:57,537 --> 01:39:59,178
Tell me where she is.

1378
01:40:01,177 --> 01:40:02,457
Tell me the truth.

1379
01:40:03,777 --> 01:40:05,457
I'm not lying!

1380
01:40:05,857 --> 01:40:07,697
I can see it in your eyes Utham.

1381
01:40:08,177 --> 01:40:09,897
What you're saying is lie.

1382
01:40:15,017 --> 01:40:16,217
How many days can I hide the truth,

1383
01:40:16,497 --> 01:40:17,616
You must know it someday or the other.

1384
01:40:17,856 --> 01:40:19,097
What truth?

1385
01:40:20,496 --> 01:40:21,657
Where is Amrutha?

1386
01:40:36,137 --> 01:40:37,417
Hello brother.

1387
01:41:02,057 --> 01:41:05,017
Doctor, this is a developed country,

1388
01:41:06,017 --> 01:41:08,257
Well developed science

1389
01:41:09,297 --> 01:41:12,097
with advanced medical treatment.

1390
01:41:12,777 --> 01:41:19,697
Can't we treat a person who is
still alive with all these equipments?

1391
01:41:19,857 --> 01:41:21,216
There is one small chance.

1392
01:41:21,858 --> 01:41:23,136
But I don't think it'll work.

1393
01:41:26,617 --> 01:41:29,616
We can replace his heart
with someone who is brain dead.

1394
01:41:30,057 --> 01:41:34,416
or someone who met with
an unexpected accident.

1395
01:41:36,097 --> 01:41:38,657
There is a chance for him to live
if we replace his heart with them.

1396
01:41:38,937 --> 01:41:40,457
But we don't have a chance now

1397
01:41:40,657 --> 01:41:42,537
As it should be done in the next 24 hours.

1398
01:41:42,777 --> 01:41:47,016
Finding a heart with the same blood group
immediately is impossible.

1399
01:41:47,337 --> 01:41:49,097
So, you better take him home.

1400
01:41:49,698 --> 01:41:51,577
Doctor, can I see him?

1401
01:41:52,377 --> 01:41:53,137
Sure

1402
01:42:54,617 --> 01:42:55,457
Ram...

1403
01:42:56,577 --> 01:42:59,097
This doctor is talking all nonsense

1404
01:43:00,618 --> 01:43:07,458
He says your heartbeat isn't normal

1405
01:43:09,017 --> 01:43:14,058
But your heart will be fine and I know it

1406
01:43:31,417 --> 01:43:38,097
Love can solve any problem in this world

1407
01:43:40,497 --> 01:43:47,658
If your heartbeat stops, my love will have no meaning

1408
01:43:51,177 --> 01:43:52,697
You will be fine, Ram

1409
01:43:54,457 --> 01:43:55,737
You will be fine.

1410
01:45:20,737 --> 01:45:27,657
I always thought love is all about you being
how I like and me being how you like

1411
01:45:28,017 --> 01:45:32,298
But I understood it isn't like that

1412
01:45:32,697 --> 01:45:34,536
Love is all about being happy together

1413
01:45:34,977 --> 01:45:42,417
I thought pure love is only
about giving life,

1414
01:45:43,017 --> 01:45:46,896
but no, It is about loving someone truly

1415
01:45:47,337 --> 01:45:54,137
I still remember how my heart raced
when I first saw you

1416
01:45:54,617 --> 01:45:56,377
It is love at first heart for me

1417
01:45:56,697 --> 01:46:02,457
Love is two words and mad is two words

1418
01:46:03,018 --> 01:46:08,256
I love you madly,
and I can end my life for you

1419
01:46:08,857 --> 01:46:14,217
People kill themselves
and make their love win

1420
01:46:14,817 --> 01:46:22,338
You've given me place in your heart but today

1421
01:46:23,137 --> 01:46:25,657
if that heart stops beating,

1422
01:46:26,097 --> 01:46:27,857
How will my heart work?

1423
01:46:28,497 --> 01:46:30,777
The minute your heart stops beating,

1424
01:46:31,176 --> 01:46:32,697
mine will stop too

1425
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:35,778
So, I've decided to become your heart

1426
01:46:36,537 --> 01:46:42,498
I feel lucky for doing this, as no girlfriend
will ever get this opportunity in her life.

1427
01:46:43,177 --> 01:46:44,897
Not just happiness

1428
01:46:45,217 --> 01:46:47,178
but sacrifices are also a part of love

1429
01:46:47,496 --> 01:46:53,777
I've decided to do this to prove
that God can't tear us apart

1430
01:46:57,177 --> 01:46:57,936
Hello

1431
01:46:58,457 --> 01:46:59,257
Hello.

1432
01:47:00,577 --> 01:47:01,857
Royal City Hospital

1433
01:47:02,137 --> 01:47:02,897
Yes!

1434
01:47:03,816 --> 01:47:07,857
I got an information that you guys are

1435
01:47:08,657 --> 01:47:10,737
looking for heart transplantation

1436
01:47:11,097 --> 01:47:12,097
Yeah!

1437
01:47:12,937 --> 01:47:18,417
Someone just met with an accident
at Mantrait Caston way

1438
01:47:18,858 --> 01:47:22,737
Can you please send an ambulance
as soon as possible

1439
01:47:23,016 --> 01:47:23,976
Sure

1440
01:47:25,337 --> 01:47:26,177
Thank you!

1441
01:47:31,697 --> 01:47:37,218
People generally fear death,
but I am loving it today

1442
01:47:43,137 --> 01:47:46,497
It's time for me to end my life
and save my love

1443
01:48:06,057 --> 01:48:16,776
"You left me proving that
love never ends..."

1444
01:48:17,577 --> 01:48:28,337
"This merciless death took you
away from me..."

1445
01:48:59,097 --> 01:49:00,936
Ram, please don't cry!

1446
01:49:01,297 --> 01:49:03,816
If you cry, you know that
I'll feel bad.

1447
01:49:04,377 --> 01:49:07,577
We are not two different people,
we are one now.

1448
01:49:08,137 --> 01:49:13,257
I will be with you in every
aspect of your life

1449
01:49:13,777 --> 01:49:16,416
No one can ever take me away from you

1450
01:49:16,817 --> 01:49:20,297
I am your heartbeat every second now

1451
01:49:20,857 --> 01:49:24,657
Your problems, your happiness
everything has become mine

1452
01:49:25,177 --> 01:49:28,937
This is something no girl
can ever experience

1453
01:49:29,657 --> 01:49:35,057
Lovers can never come into this world
together or leave together

1454
01:49:35,777 --> 01:49:39,336
But for us, we both got a second chance,

1455
01:49:39,937 --> 01:49:42,657
We will live together, die together

1456
01:49:43,097 --> 01:49:46,698
I've made you all mine from today

1457
01:49:47,297 --> 01:49:50,457
You gave me a chance to prove my love

1458
01:49:50,697 --> 01:49:56,537
You made me a part of you
and gave my life a better meaning

1459
01:49:56,657 --> 01:49:58,297
I love you so much Ram...

1460
01:50:09,697 --> 01:50:16,697
"Did the earth just crack open..."

1461
01:50:17,777 --> 01:50:24,537
"Did the cruel life steal you from me..."

1462
01:50:25,897 --> 01:50:33,017
"Did the compassionate Gods forget me..."

1463
01:50:33,897 --> 01:50:40,896
"My love, won't you return..."

1464
01:50:42,017 --> 01:50:49,218
"I feel empty without you..."

1465
01:50:50,058 --> 01:50:57,497
"No matter how long,
I would still wait for you."
