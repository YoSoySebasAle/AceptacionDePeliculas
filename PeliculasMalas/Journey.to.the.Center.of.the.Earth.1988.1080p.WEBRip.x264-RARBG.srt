1
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,968
For centuries,
people have speculated

2
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:14,623
on the possible existence
of a civilization

3
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:17,321
living in the center
of the Earth.

4
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,628
Man has created
countless myths

5
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,804
concerning trolls,
underground cities

6
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:23,762
and mole men.

7
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:27,157
But could these legends
have some basis in fact?

8
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,464
Could there be
an underground empire?

9
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,205
And if there is,

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,599
are they planning
to conquer our world?

11
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,949
Is there something sinister
going on

12
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,299
in the center of the Earth?

13
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:40,388
No one can really say.

14
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,368
You incompetent twit.

15
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,631
You're fired!

16
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:19,460
Look, if your son
wasn't so evil...

17
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,897
He's sick.

18
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:25,292
Mr. Bumble will hear from me
about the cost of the damages.

19
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,989
And you can be sure

20
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,644
I'll never recommend a nanny
from his agency

21
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,125
to any of my friends.

22
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,692
Come, William.

23
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:02,807
Hello.

24
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:23,045
It didn't go well, Crystina.

25
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:27,745
Mrs. Wellington rang.
My, was her kettle going.

26
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,661
Does Mr. Bumble know yet?

27
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,751
No. He was out all day.

28
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:36,406
Well, at least I can resign
before he fires me.

29
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,761
Don't be too hard on yourself,
Crystina.

30
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:47,330
Mrs. Wellington's gone through
many governesses before you.

31
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,419
At least
you're still alive.

32
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:52,292
It's not just that,
Miss Ferry.

33
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,816
I'm not just cut out
to be a proper nanny.

34
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,340
I mean, Mr. Bumble sent me out
five times prior,

35
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,994
and each time I failed.

36
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:01,779
I'm just not nanny material,
I'm afraid.

37
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,869
Give it one more chance,
Crystina.

38
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,829
I'd love to, Miss Ferry.

39
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:10,527
Being a nanny was all
I've ever wanted to be.

40
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:13,313
Ever since
I was a young girl.

41
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:16,403
But I'll just have to face it.
I'm just not any good.

42
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,405
What will you do then?

43
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:21,146
Teach karate, I suppose.

44
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,588
Nannies R Us.

45
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,068
Nannies for all occasions,
may I help you?

46
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:32,070
Hey. My name is Mattie Asher,

47
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:34,595
and I'm personal manager
to a lot of big stars.

48
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,641
I need a nanny to fly to Hawaii today for a client of mine.

49
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,165
It's little Bernard,
he needs to be cared for.

50
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,124
Who was caring
for little Bernard?

51
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,821
He had a nanny.

52
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,520
She got torn apart
by five pit bulls.

53
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,479
Well, can you help me out
and ship a nanny to Hawaii?

54
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,829
What will you require
in her?

55
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:55,920
She's gotta be British
and cheap.

56
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:59,402
I have the perfect nanny
for you, Mr. Asher.

57
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:00,925
No.She'll be leaving

58
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,884
for Hawaii today.

59
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:05,234
No.

60
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:51,889
Now you're seeing a live shot by a helicopter high in the sky

61
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,500
of the recently erupted crater
on Kalani

62
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,066
which erupted last week

63
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,286
with a velocity
of 200 miles per hour.

64
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,028
Just proving once again
Mother Nature...

65
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,334
Hey, I was watching that.

66
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:06,382
Leave it alone, Bryan.

67
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:13,215
Enough, children!

68
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,391
That's it!
I'm throwing you to the apes.

69
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,480
There are no apes in Hawaii.

70
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:18,960
Yes, there are. Are not.

71
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:21,005
You wanna be the first
to find out?

72
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,708
Stop it. Aah!

73
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:30,972
Stop it! Stop it!

74
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,933
No, wait.  Stop it. Aah!

75
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,242
Miss, can I help you?

76
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,072
Billy Foul, please.

77
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,857
Room 607.
Thanks.

78
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,348
Hey, I hate to interrupt
the fun, music lovers,

79
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,306
but here's
an emergency announcement.

80
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,570
Kilauea is giving off signs

81
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,746
that it might erupt
at any moment.

82
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,008
Tourists are warned
to stay clear

83
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,578
and inhabitants of the slopes
are being evacuated.

84
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:16,626
Volcano Park is of course
closed until further notice.

85
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,281
And speaking of closings,
don't miss the exciting...

86
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,326
Lindy? Lindy?

87
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,242
...tonight at 9:00
at the Surf City Shangri-la.

88
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,767
All right. All right.

89
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,859
Yeah, all right.

90
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,383
...special guest, Billy Foul.
Hurry up and buy those tickets

91
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,994
because it'll probably be
your last chance

92
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:40,128
to see some of
these great performances.

93
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,390
And now, for the...

94
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:50,138
Yeah.

95
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:53,054
Mr. Foul?

96
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:56,013
I'm Crystina,
the nanny you requested.

97
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:02,846
Come in, come in.

98
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:20,864
Dear.

99
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,999
Is Bernard here?

100
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,349
Are you really a nanny?

101
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,090
Yes, I am.

102
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,440
I have my papers here
to present.

103
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,268
You don't look like a nanny.

104
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,618
You don't look like
one of my fans.

105
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:40,449
Sorry, Mr. Foul, but I've never
actually heard of you before.

106
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,800
You... Well, that's the trouble.
That is the trouble.

107
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,760
Eight months ago,
I was headed for the top.

108
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:50,372
Now I'm doing
a revival concert

109
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,417
here in tropical rock.

110
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,505
What happened, Mr. Foul?

111
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,032
Call me Billy.

112
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,992
I don't know
what happened.

113
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,646
People stopped buying
my records.

114
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,996
They stopped coming
to my concerts.

115
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,303
I suppose this concert
is my last chance.

116
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:11,132
If I don't catch on
and get that record deal,

117
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:12,612
I'll have to retire.

118
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,352
Go back
to what I was doing before.

119
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:17,312
What was that?Teaching karate.

120
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,229
You did want a nanny,
didn't you?

121
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,623
Now, look.

122
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:26,321
Bernard needs a bath.

123
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:32,109
So I want you to take him
over to this place.

124
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,811
Mr. Foul,
this is for a dog bath.

125
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,465
So? Bernard is a dog.

126
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,338
Aren't you? Come along.

127
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,427
There's a good boy.

128
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,257
Yes. And there we go.

129
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,824
Sit, sit.

130
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,695
There's a good boy.

131
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,698
Take those and cover you up.

132
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,092
There's a good check. Yeah.

133
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,399
Now, hotel security
is very tight.

134
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,097
So always keep him
well covered up.

135
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,794
The staff will freak
if they see him.

136
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,883
What's in that one?

137
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:11,627
Dog biscuits.
In case Bernard gets hungry.

138
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,846
All right, there you are.

139
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,370
What's the matter?

140
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,633
I'm a nanny to a dog?

141
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,853
Well, dogs need care too.

142
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,420
Now, there you go.

143
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:25,989
Now, remember,
always keep him out of the sun.

144
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,861
He hates daylight.

145
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:30,515
He's just like his daddy.

146
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,692
Well, go on then.
Off you go.

147
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,003
Bryan, leave your sister alone.

148
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:41,352
Stop it, you idiot.

149
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,876
You're freaking her out.Aah!

150
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,661
Sara, are you okay?

151
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:47,968
Sara? Is she dead?

152
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,796
No, of course not. Sara?

153
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,580
Why are you hitting her
if she's not dead?

154
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:52,929
Sar... Quiet.

155
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,801
What's the ma...? Sara, wh...?

156
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,977
Maybe she's brain dead.

157
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,761
You realize
you ruined her chances

158
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,981
of being an Olympic diver.
You know that, don't you?

159
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,984
I gotta get out of here. Me too.

160
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,334
Man, I should have went
to Lauderdale with Lisa.

161
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:19,956
Can I help you?

162
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,436
Can you get me
a taxi, please?

163
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,699
Sure.

164
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:29,096
Mom, Dad. Surprise.

165
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,838
Well, hello, Richard.
Where are you kids going?

166
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,230
I'm going for a ride.

167
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:34,405
That's nice. Richard.

168
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,842
We're going swimming.

169
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,148
That's nice, Bryan.

170
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,849
I've got a frog my throat.

171
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,894
Sounds more like a dog.

172
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,294
Mom..

173
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,078
Don't go too far.

174
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:57,733
Remember, we're having
dinner together tonight!

175
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,434
Help. There's a big tip in it
for you.

176
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,393
Will you get out of here?

177
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,966
Get me to the cave.

178
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:16,883
Sara?

179
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,627
Put it on my bill,
will you?

180
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,851
Watch where you're going.

181
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:32,986
Move your bloody Jeep.English? Really.

182
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,033
Where's my basket?

183
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,382
Didn't you want it in the Jeep?

184
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:39,514
Idiot.

185
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:42,560
You idiot.

186
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,781
Follow that Jeep.

187
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,351
Boo!

188
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,440
I was wondering
when you were gonna get here.

189
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,877
You're going to the cave? Just like every year.

190
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,487
But I thought
they closed the park.

191
00:13:56,661 --> 00:14:00,100
Since when did that
stop us? You too?

192
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,884
What's
the matter?

193
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,973
Don't worry, the bad volcano
is on the other island.

194
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,149
Now, sit down
and hold on, okay?

195
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,466
We're here.

196
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,729
Come on, come on, come on.

197
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,731
Let's go.

198
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,342
Shit.
Someone's coming. Hurry up!

199
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,176
What...?

200
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,962
You?

201
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:37,789
You took my basket,
thank you.

202
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,748
What basket? The baby's basket.

203
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,185
Right here.

204
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,187
You feed your baby
dog biscuits, do you?

205
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,363
They're not dog biscuits,
they're mine.

206
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,020
And it's not my baby.

207
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,066
He's my brother.

208
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,199
Now what are you doing?

209
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,548
Can you take me back now,
please?

210
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,333
You?
I'm not taking you anywhere.

211
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:02,118
But I can't stay here.
The taxi left.

212
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:05,252
Next time, tell him
to leave the meter running.

213
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,508
My name is Crystina,
by the way.

214
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,858
I'm Bryan.
That's my sister, Sara.

215
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,426
And yours? Ringo.

216
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,323
Ta-da.

217
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,242
I told you we should've
taken a left back there.

218
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,026
Here is the cave.

219
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,202
But it's just more rock.

220
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,465
Come on in.

221
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,781
You need help you with that?No, thank you.

222
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,392
Fine.

223
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:53,229
Don't go down too far,
sweet pea.

224
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:56,319
Here you are in one of the most
beautiful places in the world,

225
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,539
and you bring us to a cave.

226
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:01,498
You'll change your mind
as soon as eyes adjust.

227
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:04,327
How do you know
about this place?

228
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:07,113
I found it
when I was Bryan's age.

229
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,767
We come to Hawaii
every Christmas.

230
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,682
So you're not from here?

231
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,945
- Of course not.
- No one's from Hawaii.

232
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,952
Well, my eyes have adjusted.

233
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,345
It looks the same to me.

234
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,607
You can take me back now.

235
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,656
Leave it alone, please.

236
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,007
Ha! Some baby. A dog.

237
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,227
Your brother's a dog? He's not my brother.

238
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,532
Your sister?

239
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,448
I'm a nanny.

240
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:40,015
They didn't tell me
until I got here.

241
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,756
Why you keep him
in a basket?

242
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,193
The people I work for
are very particular

243
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,327
that he be kept comfortable
and out of the sun.

244
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,764
Bernard!
Bernard, come back here!

245
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:50,852
Richard!

246
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,594
Sara?

247
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,726
Sara?

248
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,945
Don't go any further!

249
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,555
What's the matter?

250
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,210
Are you afraid
to go after her yourself?

251
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,343
No.Then go and get my dog.

252
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,040
I want to go back.

253
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:08,522
Listen, lovesy,
I'm not your butler.

254
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,872
And you're certainly
not a gentlemen either.

255
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,308
What about your sister?

256
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:13,788
Yeah.

257
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,882
Wait, I'm coming too.

258
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,566
God! This is just like the Alps.

259
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,916
Magic Mountain.

260
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,528
Thank you.

261
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,272
Sara.

262
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,317
They have earthquakes
in this part of the country?

263
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,580
I guess they have anything
this far down.

264
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,192
Sara.

265
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:01,765
Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this.

266
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,724
Something's written here.

267
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:09,686
It must be some
of your American graffiti.

268
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,732
No, no, it can't be.

269
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,082
I've never seen
anything like this before.

270
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,823
I think
it's pointing somewhere.

271
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:18,391
Are you an expert
on graffiti then?

272
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,306
Maybe it's a dinosaur print.

273
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
No, definitely human.

274
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,440
Someone's chiseled at it.

275
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,442
Looks like erosion to me.

276
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,662
Most volcanoes are igneous,
you know.

277
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,055
They pay you to teach the dog
to answer that?

278
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,710
Just part
of a good English education.

279
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:37,714
Well, leave it in England,
tea bag.

280
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,765
Boy. Everyone under
the ledge. Come on, move, move.

281
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,253
Let's go.

282
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,435
Jump, will you?

283
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,741
Bryan, take Sara. Me next.

284
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,225
Sara, go get help!

285
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,140
Run, Sara, run!

286
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,663
I'll go get help!

287
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,855
I think Sarah
will find some help.

288
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,815
Help!

289
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,995
Come on down!

290
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,738
I can't!

291
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,130
I'm stuck!

292
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,786
You're not stuck!
Just let go!

293
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,269
Just fall, we'll catch you!

294
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,798
God, you fall heavy.

295
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:36,398
Hey!
I think I found the way!

296
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:54,285
I'm coming! Hang on!

297
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,771
Crystina, are you down here?

298
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,605
Crystina? Ay!

299
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,574
What are you doing
down here?

300
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:29,146
Are you all right?

301
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,105
I think one bit me.

302
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,109
Probably
just a scratch.

303
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:36,893
Do you see anything?

304
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:41,898
No.

305
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:44,814
Look.

306
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,773
What is it?

307
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,558
Must be another
dinosaur print.

308
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:51,734
Hey, it's pointing
to the waterfall.

309
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,954
Whoever left this
must've come this way too.

310
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:55,259
You think we'll find them?

311
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,132
Do we want to?

312
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,656
Let's go.Go... Where?

313
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,224
Down. Down? Are you nuts?

314
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:05,922
Someone else must have done it.
It must lead to a way out.

315
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:10,623
Look, what if Mom and Dad
come looking?

316
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,581
We'll leave them
a note.

317
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:35,909
Well?

318
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,434
Let's do it.

319
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,719
I'll handle this.

320
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:12,293
As long as we follow the stream,
we'll always find our way back.

321
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,773
Stay close, Bernard.

322
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,644
Stay close, Bernard.

323
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:25,219
Why do you keep doing that?

324
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:26,873
When I get back,
I want something to show

325
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,570
for all the trouble
you're putting me through.

326
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,006
Moi?

327
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,706
Make me some copies
for my term paper.

328
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,578
Not in your life. I'm sending
these to the Daily Mirror.

329
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,367
Watch where you're pointing
that thing.

330
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,587
Mind where you're looking.

331
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,375
Come on.

332
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,207
Hey, kid.

333
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,126
You okay?Yeah.

334
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,566
Richard,
why are the walls glowing?

335
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,394
Bioluminescence.

336
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,483
It's how fish see
at the bottom of the ocean.

337
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,790
Biology 101.

338
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:17,314
No, I read it
on a box of Cheerios.

339
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,882
Or Cocoa Puffs, I think.

340
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,409
Why don't we all get some sleep
so we'll be well rested

341
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,543
when the National Guard
gets here in the morning.

342
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:39,598
Go to sleep, Bryan.

343
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:17,113
My God.

344
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:01,027
- Hold on everybody, this is it.
- Going for a ride.

345
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,422
We did it, Bryan.

346
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,339
You saved us.

347
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,486
Aren't we going to try
and escape?

348
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,144
If we're gonna spend
the rest of our lives together,

349
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,188
we got to make
the best of it.

350
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,933
Together?
You and I down here forever?

351
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,109
Don't be stupid.

352
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,639
What?

353
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:53,122
It's a puddy cat.

354
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:55,255
See?

355
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:57,605
You're not
too far from home.

356
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,825
Here.

357
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,748
I just wanna go home.

358
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:11,401
Don't worry,
we're gonna get out of here.

359
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,881
Even if I have to dig a hole
to China,

360
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,230
we're gonna get out of here.

361
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,989
When I was a kid,
not much older than Sarah,

362
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:36,644
my daddy built me a tree house.
Except that he was really busy,

363
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,385
so I had to find a way
to get up there myself.

364
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,996
Then Bryan wanted to come up
in the tree house.

365
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,043
I wouldn't help
because I was with my friends,

366
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:45,914
and I had a thing
about being brothers and...

367
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:47,742
So my dad would sit me down
and he'd say,

368
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,571
"You know, you brother's too
small to get in that tree house.

369
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:54,270
You're gonna have to help him."
He used to say, "See this?

370
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:56,664
That one finger
right there,

371
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:59,580
you can just break it
really easy.

372
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,887
But two of them,

373
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:04,628
two of them together,
you can't break it.

374
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,153
You can't break it."

375
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:09,808
You understand?

376
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,333
So I still got a hand.

377
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,342
But I wish I could take you
to that tree house now.

378
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,779
Take you there,
away from all this.

379
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,306
You just did.

380
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,570
You have beautiful eyes.

381
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,761
Shit. Now what?

382
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:53,547
Aah! Snakes!

383
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:57,725
They're not snakes.
They're just big worms.

384
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,684
I say we go back now!

385
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,121
We can't
unless you have an elevator.

386
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,818
Then let's go down.

387
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,907
Get off of me.

388
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:33,021
Bryan, give me the canteen.

389
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,165
It's empty.

390
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,819
We can stop
and refill it.

391
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,909
No,
we've lost the stream.

392
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,519
We couldn't have.

393
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,869
I saw it this morning.Has it been that long?

394
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:01,354
So, what do you suggest
we do now?

395
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:03,356
He's got the right idea.

396
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,184
Maybe we should just get
some rest.

397
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:06,489
Too bad he can't find water.

398
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,972
Wait.
Baby want a drink?

399
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,756
Bryan, have you still got
his empty bottle?

400
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,411
Yeah.Give it to me, quick.

401
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:19,850
It's all gone.
There's no more.

402
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,678
No more.

403
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,552
Baby find his own.

404
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:26,857
Come on.

405
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:31,862
See? Hang on.

406
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:35,866
Maybe it's just a gopher.

407
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,781
Let's find out.
Bryan, let me have the knife.

408
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,783
And get it dirty?

409
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,742
Just hand it over.

410
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,404
What do you wanna do,
break the blade?

411
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,232
There's no water
under there, man.

412
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,538
It could be underground.I thought we were underground.

413
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:57,410
We're probably right under
the ocean by now.

414
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,892
Something's moving in there.

415
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,111
Maybe it is a gopher.

416
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,417
A big one.

417
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,464
No, it's warm. It's warm.

418
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:14,122
Aah! Aah!

419
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,996
Quick, Crystina, get a picture!

420
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,388
It's just steam!

421
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:21,434
Look!
It's turning into water!

422
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:22,696
We can drink it now!

423
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,176
Yeah!

424
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:04,868
Did you want
to say something?

425
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,783
You have the most dog
I've ever seen.

426
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,395
I mean, the nicest dog
I've ever seen.

427
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,397
He's not mine. I mean...

428
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:12,963
Yeah.

429
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:16,010
You...
You taught him, though?

430
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,882
I mean, how to be nice. I met him the day I met you.

431
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,797
So I know you both
about the same.

432
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:22,973
Can't you take a compliment?

433
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,507
Bryan, what is your brother
doing?

434
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,335
He's brushing his teeth.

435
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:38,554
Next.

436
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,126
What's that?

437
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,172
What's what?

438
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,912
I heard something.

439
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:58,400
I think you're just getting
used to the sound of my echo.

440
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:02,187
No. It was
prettier than that.

441
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:07,583
I hear it too.

442
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:12,588
I think we're just
imagining this.

443
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,637
Come on.

444
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:26,602
But we just got here.
I mean, it's nice.

445
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:30,911
You just gotta be careful now.

446
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,641
Right there. It's right here.

447
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:36,498
Let's have a rest.

448
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,686
Where's Bryan?

449
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:57,171
He's probably just reading
one of his comics again.

450
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:02,132
But he was right behind me.

451
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,136
Bryan.

452
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:11,707
Bryan?

453
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:19,715
Bryan!

454
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,371
Bryan!

455
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,917
Richard?

456
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,268
Bryan!

457
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,143
Richard!

458
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,797
Richard, Crystina!

459
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:10,826
Bryan!

460
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,613
Bryan!

461
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,179
Bryan!

462
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,357
There's something out there...

463
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,750
Richard, Crystina!

464
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,058
Bryan!

465
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:53,826
Who are you?

466
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,916
Ha-ha-ha, who are you?

467
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,136
Bryan!

468
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,575
We can't be sure.

469
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,409
Richard.

470
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,503
Red Leader, this is Red 7.
I found one.

471
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:21,288
Repeat, I found one. Richard! Richard!

472
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,508
Mom, Dad, Sara.

473
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:24,726
And the National Guard.

474
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,467
Where's Bryan?

475
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:29,296
That's a good question, Dad.

476
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,993
Bryan!

477
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,392
Bryan?

478
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:16,691
Visitors to Atlantis
are required to report

479
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,476
to the nearest
police checkpoint

480
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,260
upon their arrival.

481
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,871
Citizens of the great
city state of Atlantis

482
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:27,093
must be prepared to show
slack cards upon demand.

483
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:28,964
Lord Over has issued
a statement

484
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,053
which reminds citizens
of Atlantis

485
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:33,708
that there is no such thing
as a surface world,

486
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:37,756
and rumors of the actual
existence of aliens are wrong,

487
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,019
misleading
and counterproductive

488
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:43,065
to the future
of our great city state.

489
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,154
Anyone who thinks
they may have had contact

490
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:48,375
with an alien,
female or older male,

491
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,029
should report immediately

492
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:52,553
to General Rykov
at Government House.

493
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:55,556
There is a reward.

494
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,603
And finally, the statement
stresses once and for all,

495
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,561
aliens do not exist,

496
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,781
the surface world
does not exist,

497
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:07,960
and Wanda Saknussemm is a mere
figment of your imagination.

498
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:36,292
Hey, you. Wake up.

499
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,556
Wake up.

500
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,688
What are you?

501
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:45,127
More important question,
who are you?

502
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:46,607
I'm Bryan.

503
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:48,783
I'm Shank.
Heh.

504
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:52,352
Do you like my home?

505
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,009
Where am I?

506
00:42:57,183 --> 00:43:00,099
Where do you think you are?

507
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:02,318
If I knew,
I wouldn't be asking.

508
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:05,844
You're in Atlantis City.

509
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:08,324
Atlantis City.
Atlantis City.

510
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:09,674
New Jersey?

511
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,459
No.

512
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,853
In the center of the Earth.

513
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:21,468
What kind of alien is this?

514
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:26,212
Um, that's a dog.

515
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,783
Where did you say I am?

516
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:33,785
In the center of the Earth.

517
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,657
Center of the Earth. Right.

518
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,616
Um...

519
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,054
Look, you better explain this
to me real slow.

520
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,709
Yes. And then you can
tell me something

521
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:47,102
about the surface world.

522
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:23,573
Bryan?

523
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:36,108
Bryan!

524
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,218
Bryan!

525
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:06,747
Bryan.

526
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:09,141
Attention.

527
00:45:09,315 --> 00:45:13,798
You are in the Atlantis
wasteland restricted area.

528
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:17,627
All citizens are prohibited
from entering.

529
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:20,979
I repeat,
this is a restricted area.

530
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:24,983
Trespassers will be punished
by death

531
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,594
and a large fine.

532
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,469
A reminder to all employees
at Professor Galba's

533
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,210
transport to the surface
project.

534
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:37,082
Security wishes
to remind you

535
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:39,084
that any discussion
of the work being done here

536
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:41,956
is strictly forbidden
and punishable by death.

537
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,219
Thank you.
Have a good day.

538
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:49,268
Let me see if I can apply
a little bit

539
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:53,228
of light amplification
to make this stimulate...

540
00:45:55,883 --> 00:45:58,016
There you are,
professor.

541
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:08,156
You can save time

542
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,463
if you just do it my way,
professor.

543
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,639
It's the modern technique
for atomic recompilation.

544
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:17,122
Your style is outdated
and of the Stone Age variety.

545
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:19,211
I am an old cranky
professor,

546
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,343
and I work
in an old cranky way.

547
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:24,694
Are you implying your technique
and knowledge are superior

548
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:28,829
to our advanced
Atlantean science, professor?

549
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:31,049
I'm saying
that my method works,

550
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:34,966
but most of all
this is my project!

551
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:53,332
General Rykov.

552
00:46:53,506 --> 00:46:57,510
You honor us
with your presence.

553
00:46:57,684 --> 00:47:00,208
Is the progress on the transport
to the surface world

554
00:47:00,382 --> 00:47:01,644
going well, professor?

555
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,300
It's progressing, general.

556
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:07,041
Are we on schedule?

557
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:09,870
We could be
if Professor Galba would accept

558
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,654
modern scientific
atomic recompilation.

559
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,919
It's either my way
or no way.

560
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:17,095
Where's Consul Crassis?

561
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:20,141
He's in charge here.
I want to speak to him.

562
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:23,753
I don't like all these changes
and talks of schedules.

563
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,495
I never had an agreement
like that with him.

564
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:28,671
He promised me
freedom and funding.

565
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,717
Money is tight, professor.

566
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:33,328
The economy is sluggish.

567
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:36,462
And we cannot go on subsidizing
your research forever.

568
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:38,594
I want to talk
to Crassis.

569
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:41,293
You cannot see Crassis now.

570
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,904
He's having his hair done.

571
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:46,080
In Lemuria.

572
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,082
You'll have to deal
with me now.

573
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:50,258
Well, I don't like you.

574
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,652
And I certainly
detest him.

575
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:59,137
Why do you dislike us,
professor?

576
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,835
What have we done
to gain your animosity?

577
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:05,795
I think you're going to use
my transporter to the surface

578
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,496
to send your army to conquer
the surface of the earth.

579
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,194
Ridiculous. Heh-heh-heh. Ridiculous.

580
00:48:13,368 --> 00:48:15,936
Then why is he trying
to convince me

581
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:20,114
to make a cargo hold
for all their tanks?

582
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:23,988
It will be our gift
to the aliens, professor.

583
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:29,384
Now, I want this transporter
completed within one month.

584
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:32,561
Or else...

585
00:48:32,735 --> 00:48:36,261
General Rykov, this old man
will stun us both soon.

586
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:39,003
Because of the failure of his earlier news conference,

587
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:41,353
Lord Over has decided
to deliver his annual

588
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,790
state of the city speech
next week.

589
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:46,053
It's eagerly awaited
as a major announcement

590
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:47,881
concerning
the alien situation.

591
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,366
General, Lord Over
has moved up his speech.

592
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,803
Do you think he suspects
what we're up to?

593
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:59,240
No, I think the pressure
for an official response

594
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:01,634
to the rumors
is forcing this speech.

595
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:04,637
We have little time left,
Tola.

596
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:10,556
Do you have a good,
believable alien yet?

597
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,210
We're close, general.

598
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:14,690
Dangerously close.

599
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,435
Hello.

600
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:23,873
I think I'm a bit lost.

601
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:26,441
Have I wandered into your
amusement park or something?

602
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:31,838
You are an alien,
aren't you, dear?

603
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,579
Well, yeah, I suppose I am.

604
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:34,972
But I've got a work visa

605
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:36,321
coming from the embassy
next week,

606
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,714
so that'll be all right.

607
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,110
Or won't it?

608
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:45,373
Where on earth are we going?

609
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:47,332
None of this is necessary.

610
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:49,377
It's not very comfortable
either.

611
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:52,641
Just relax.

612
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:55,035
General, where do we take her?

613
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:56,384
General?

614
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,952
Take her to the warehouse,
Tola.

615
00:49:59,126 --> 00:50:00,823
I'll meet you there.

616
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,183
Well, Atlantis
does sound pretty weird.

617
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:15,403
It's getting very weird.

618
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:17,536
I would normally sell you.

619
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,712
Aliens were very valuable
in Atlantis

620
00:50:19,886 --> 00:50:21,453
a little while ago.

621
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:24,064
But now the government
arrests anyone

622
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:27,763
with any information
about aliens.

623
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:30,592
It's very dangerous
to have you with me.

624
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:35,945
So how come you're helping me
and Bernard out?

625
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,601
I don't know. I like things
from the surface world.

626
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:42,256
I collect them.

627
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,258
You can see my house.

628
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:46,826
I get many things
from your world.

629
00:50:53,702 --> 00:50:58,751
Fast Photo here again with yet
another marvelous product

630
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:03,756
from GovCo, the corporation
of your government.

631
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:07,325
We can love each other.

632
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:09,892
So hard that nothing
is gonna keep us apart.

633
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,416
Can we make a baby?

634
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:17,552
Possible existence
of aliens.

635
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:22,035
Can we go out
and look at your world?

636
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:26,431
I mean, as long as I'm here,
I'd like to see Atlantis.

637
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:28,172
No.

638
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:31,479
No, it's too dangerous.

639
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:33,699
What's that?

640
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:35,570
It's a beach.

641
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,052
It's so bright.

642
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:41,402
And all the fluid.

643
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:43,448
This is the surface world?

644
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:46,103
Yeah.

645
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:49,149
Sunrise brings a relaxing
moment for the natives

646
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:50,933
before the early morning planes arrive.

647
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:03,120
If I can help you find
your way home

648
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:05,252
to the surface,

649
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:08,777
will you take me home
with you, Bryan?

650
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:11,084
What, to my house?

651
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:17,264
Sure.

652
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:19,179
My parents are pretty cool
about that stuff.

653
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:23,618
I'll be right back.

654
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:26,578
I think I might be able
to find a way to get you home.

655
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:28,449
But don't move from here,
though.

656
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:32,497
It's very dangerous for you
in Atlantis.

657
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:36,892
The soldiers and the fat ladies
could easily find you.

658
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:39,330
Even you could have trouble
with the fat ladies, Bernard.

659
00:52:46,902 --> 00:52:49,122
- Let's see.
- Is it Professor Galba

660
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:51,080
who has the machine
to the surface?

661
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:16,802
You are in Sector 100.

662
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:18,804
Sector 100.

663
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:21,372
A reminder
that temp body converters

664
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:24,984
will be a must later today
as a ripple of low pressure

665
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:27,204
will travel through
the pressurized zone.

666
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:28,814
Sector 100.

667
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:30,990
Sector 100.

668
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:33,645
Attention,
citizens of Atlantis.

669
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:36,648
Lord Over has declared
martial law

670
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:39,564
due to unrest and anarchy
in the city.

671
00:53:39,738 --> 00:53:42,784
All rights and liberties
are suspended.

672
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:45,831
Speaking out against Lord Over
or the government

673
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:49,356
is punishable
by immediate death.

674
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:55,144
Citizens, General Rykov
and her police

675
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,712
request all citizens
with slab ID clearance

676
00:53:57,886 --> 00:54:00,019
to leave Sector 100.That way.

677
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:03,109
Please leave the area
at once.

678
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:06,678
Failure to do so will result
in your violent death.

679
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:09,071
Thank you
for your cooperation.

680
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:14,599
Tonight, we have
a lineup of wretches

681
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:18,472
which is sure to satisfy
your lust.

682
00:54:18,646 --> 00:54:20,344
Remember,

683
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:24,391
anything goes.

684
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,742
But only one walks out.

685
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,926
Barzine.
I've been looking for you.

686
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,364
Do you know
where Professor Galba

687
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:42,627
or Colonel Atway is?

688
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,150
No.

689
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:47,066
Excuse me, where exactly are we?

690
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,590
Executions will be the norm.

691
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:51,549
Do whatever the police
request of you,

692
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:53,290
or you will be killed.

693
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:56,423
Martial law
is now in effect.

694
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:07,042
Excuse me?

695
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:09,436
Visitors to Atlantis
are required to report

696
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:12,787
to the nearest police
checkpoint upon their arrival.

697
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,882
Citizens of the great
city state of Atlantis

698
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:25,496
must be prepared to show
slack cards upon demand.

699
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:29,587
Citizens visiting from Lemuria, Middle-earth, Hades, or Asgard

700
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:33,460
must report to Government House for visas.

701
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:36,376
And please take time to learn
the city's newest laws.

702
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,900
Your life
could depend on it.

703
00:55:39,074 --> 00:55:43,078
GovCo. We inform you of
what we know you need to know.

704
00:56:22,117 --> 00:56:23,989
All's well, general.

705
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,165
It seems that we have
three subjects

706
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:29,603
who are very close in every way
to the original alien,

707
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:31,257
Wanda Saknussemm.

708
00:56:31,431 --> 00:56:34,869
It may not be necessary at all,
supervisor.

709
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:36,958
But, general,
we've worked very hard

710
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:40,658
to create
a perfect duplicate.

711
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:45,053
But why duplicate
when we have a real alien?

712
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:46,881
She's not an alien.

713
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:49,667
She doesn't even look like one
to Saknussemm.

714
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:53,888
Nevertheless,
she is still an alien.

715
00:56:58,066 --> 00:57:00,199
You can meet me
at Government House.

716
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:04,682
I'll decide on my own how
I will be exposing Lord Over.

717
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:08,468
Go ahead, Tola.

718
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,213
Remember,
second-class citizens,

719
00:57:14,387 --> 00:57:18,522
trolls must not use respirators designated for humans.

720
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:20,959
This is punishable by death.

721
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:25,442
Thank you for your continued cooperation.

722
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:39,586
Martial law has been declared
by Lord Over.

723
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,371
The police
have absolute authority.

724
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:44,809
Civil liberties
are suspended.

725
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:48,290
Random unreasonable executions
will be the norm.

726
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,292
Do whatever the police
request of you,

727
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,946
or you will be killed.

728
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,036
Martial law is in effect.

729
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,738
Wow. I'm bummed.

730
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:03,523
Really? I'm from L.A.

731
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:05,090
Where are we? Malibu.

732
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:06,918
Things are so weird.
Bananas.

733
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:10,487
Are you bummed? I'm bummed, I'm bummed.

734
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:11,923
Wonderful.

735
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:14,447
It's so weird we've met.

736
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:22,281
Are you bummed? I'm really bummed.

737
00:58:22,455 --> 00:58:25,676
My dear, you have
such exquisite skin

738
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,547
and excellent follicles.

739
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,941
My lunar cut will look
simply smashing on you.

740
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:31,943
Now, there might be a slight
minor bit of pain

741
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,814
when I grip it to the hairpiece
to your skull.

742
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:35,599
But it will be awesome.I'm bummed.

743
00:58:35,773 --> 00:58:37,688
A bit of agony
and torture anyway.

744
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:39,603
It only hurts a little.

745
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:44,738
So, what are you trying
to do here?

746
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:47,524
Give her the tour.

747
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:51,876
Is it wise?It's on the way to her cell.

748
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:56,358
It's your pension, Tola.

749
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,969
Yes.

750
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:07,326
The applicants are sent here
by talent agents

751
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,241
from all over the city.

752
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:11,939
And we decide
whether they are suitable.

753
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:13,767
Suitable for what?

754
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:18,032
To become exact
Wanda Saknussemm replicas.

755
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,778
They are washed and...

756
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:30,218
dressed for
the transformation process.

757
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:35,006
Their skin is dyed
the perfect alien shade,

758
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,662
and they are stretched

759
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:42,753
to Wanda Saknussemm's
exact height.

760
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:49,847
And this is where we teach them
to think and speak

761
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:52,066
like Wanda Saknussemm.

762
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,593
Who's Wanda Saknussemm?

763
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:59,247
And why are these girls
being made to look like her?

764
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:03,687
They will be
Wanda Saknussemm.

765
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:06,472
Wanda was the first alien
ever to reach our world.

766
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,605
She became quite a tourist.

767
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:11,564
But why duplicate her?

768
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:15,046
Let's just say General Rykov
is planning to save Atlantis.

769
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,745
General Rykov didn't
exactly seem the type

770
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,573
to care about the welfare
of the citizens.

771
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:22,575
We all have our ambitions.

772
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:25,012
Yeah, I suppose so.

773
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:27,493
I have become
a bit muddled, though.

774
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,452
All I had to do
was take Bernard for a bath.

775
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,367
Now I find myself
in the center of the Earth,

776
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,805
and I haven't gotten a clue
where the dog is.

777
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:38,286
What's a dog?

778
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,680
They're pets.
They're small with big ears

779
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,551
and a lot of hair.

780
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:45,903
We have them here in Atlantis.
We call them trolls.

781
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:50,298
She's doing that all wrong.

782
01:00:50,472 --> 01:00:51,778
Am I?

783
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:54,172
Here.

784
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,391
General Rykov is...

785
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:00,134
See.

786
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,920
Like that.

787
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,144
Wow, I'm bummed.

788
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:11,842
Tell me more
about your world

789
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:14,583
and how you came
to be here.

790
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:18,239
Well, I was searching
for Bryan, this boy I met.

791
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:19,893
Well, the brother of the boy
I met actually.

792
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:21,982
He's your boyfriend?

793
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:25,333
No, just a rather strange
American teenager.

794
01:01:25,507 --> 01:01:27,814
I fell down a pit
looking for him.

795
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:30,208
I ended up here
in the center of the Earth.

796
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:33,080
Then you're not seeing anyone
right now?

797
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:34,778
No.

798
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:38,912
Why are you so interested? Research.

799
01:01:39,086 --> 01:01:42,002
Citizens, General Rykov
and her police

800
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,744
request all citizens
with slab ID clearance

801
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,920
to leave Sector 100.

802
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:49,531
Please leave the area
at once.

803
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,405
Failure to do so will result
in your violent death.

804
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:56,669
Thank you
for your cooperation.

805
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:59,803
Are you seeing anyone?

806
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:01,282
Only the general,

807
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:04,155
and she's too busy
planning conquests.

808
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,418
General Rykov wants
to conquer my world?

809
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:07,636
That's so silly.

810
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:09,987
There'll be a war.

811
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:16,645
Visitors to Atlantis
are required to report

812
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,430
to the nearest
police checkpoint

813
01:02:18,604 --> 01:02:22,260
upon their arrival.

814
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,741
Citizens of the great
city state of Atlantis

815
01:02:24,915 --> 01:02:29,093
must be prepared to show
slack cards upon demand.

816
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:33,488
Citizens visiting from Lemuria, Middle Earth, Hades, or Asgard

817
01:02:33,662 --> 01:02:36,709
must report to Government House for visas.

818
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:40,191
And please take time to learn
the city's newest laws.

819
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:42,628
Your life
could depend on it.

820
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:47,285
GovCo. We inform you of
what we know you need to know.

821
01:02:47,459 --> 01:02:49,113
Sector 100.

822
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:51,463
A reminder
that temp body converters

823
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:53,378
will be a must later today,

824
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:55,684
as a ripple of low pressure
will travel

825
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,251
through
the pressurized zone.

826
01:02:57,425 --> 01:02:59,036
Sector 100.

827
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,864
Sector 100.

828
01:03:01,038 --> 01:03:03,475
Attention all boys and girls

829
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:06,217
who suffer from annoying
hair lice.

830
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:09,263
Try Nice No Lice.

831
01:03:29,718 --> 01:03:31,633
I have found a friend
of yours.

832
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,723
A girl alien
named Crystina.

833
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,464
She's been captured
by General Rykov

834
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:37,770
and the government.

835
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:40,077
Crystina.

836
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,861
What about my brother,
Richard?

837
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,037
I know nothing about him.

838
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:46,692
You sure they didn't capture
a quasi-hunky guy,

839
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:50,043
not terribly bright, with
a real obnoxious personality?

840
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:52,741
No. No alien like that.
Just the girl.

841
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,788
I think
she's in great danger.

842
01:03:55,962 --> 01:03:57,181
Let's go.
Wait.

843
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:58,660
Where do you think
you're going?

844
01:03:58,835 --> 01:03:59,748
To save her.

845
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:03,143
Impossible.
Why?

846
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:06,277
She's being kept in a secret
warehouse by General Rykov

847
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:08,670
and these meanest
and toughest soldiers.

848
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,629
And they've got
many weapons.

849
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:37,961
There are too many rumors
about aliens existing.

850
01:04:38,135 --> 01:04:39,919
Somehow I must
put a stop to it.

851
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:42,052
Especially
since it seems one or two

852
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:43,575
may have actually
entered the city.

853
01:04:43,749 --> 01:04:46,099
I believe the aliens
are spies

854
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:48,928
being sent down to report
on our capabilities, Lord Over.

855
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:50,625
We must mobilize for war,

856
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,106
and we must launch
a massive retaliation.

857
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,108
Good.

858
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:57,937
I understand your paranoia,
General Rykov.

859
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,808
And you could be right.

860
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:02,507
But it's important
Atlantis not learn of the aliens

861
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:04,248
until the right time.

862
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:08,817
I will go on TV
and insist there are no aliens.

863
01:05:13,431 --> 01:05:16,782
And the smell
of freshly-cut grass

864
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:19,393
and the warmth
of the springtime sun.

865
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:23,397
That's what's waiting
on the surface.

866
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:25,095
Beauty and peace.

867
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:28,968
Hey, lady, are all people equal?
Trolls and humans?

868
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:31,014
In most of the world.

869
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:33,320
There are still places
where bad people still live,

870
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:35,322
but that's all changing.

871
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:40,545
And there are no wars
or fighting?

872
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:43,461
I'm afraid there's still
a bit of that too.

873
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:46,029
There's a lot of hope
in the future.

874
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:48,683
That's why you must come
to the surface in peace.

875
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:51,991
Start the relationship off
on the right foot.

876
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:54,341
There's much we can do
together.

877
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:55,995
Perhaps the general
is wrong.

878
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,695
Yes?

879
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:03,002
This is Moldine,
down at the cloning lab.

880
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:04,612
Sir, I think we have
a serious situation here.

881
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:06,701
Yes.

882
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,399
An alien is brainwashing Tola
and the others.

883
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:11,793
She's telling them
about the surface.

884
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,491
No.

885
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:14,840
About how peaceful
and beautiful it is.

886
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:16,798
No.

887
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,452
Better get down here
before it's too late.

888
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:22,587
What are the chances

889
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:24,676
of going back with you,
Crystina?

890
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,635
First, I've got to work out
how to get back up.

891
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,507
That's no problem.

892
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:32,989
Professor Galba's transporter
will get you out.

893
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,600
Who is going where, Tola?

894
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:40,474
What is going on here?

895
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:43,564
Crystina was just
teaching us

896
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:45,610
about the surface world,
general.

897
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:47,394
I have told you
everything you need to know

898
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:48,743
about the surface world.

899
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,963
You didn't tell us
about flowers

900
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:54,140
or sea breezes
or butterflies.

901
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:56,882
Or like, warm summer days.

902
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:58,188
Or the temptations.

903
01:06:58,362 --> 01:06:59,754
You certainly didn't tell us

904
01:06:59,928 --> 01:07:01,713
about the National
Basketball Association.

905
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:03,802
Enough.

906
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:08,154
I do not have to explain
everything.

907
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:10,200
I only give orders.

908
01:07:10,374 --> 01:07:12,376
Lord Over has moved
his speech up again.

909
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,508
Chain this alien and bring her
to the video chambers.

910
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:17,163
I'll use her to destroy
Lord Over

911
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:18,860
to take over Atlantis.

912
01:07:20,253 --> 01:07:21,515
No.

913
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:25,389
You're changing, Tola.

914
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:28,218
You're changing color.

915
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:30,394
Here, hold this.

916
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:36,530
Hey, Bryan, be careful.

917
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:39,098
This is not a problem.

918
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:45,061
You!

919
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:47,324
Execute Tola!

920
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:49,108
Now!

921
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:50,762
But why attack us?

922
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:52,677
The people from the surface
are peaceful.

923
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,905
Hyah! Hyah!

924
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:15,526
Hit it, Shank. Hit it.

925
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:27,859
Please stand by for an important news bulletin.

926
01:09:29,426 --> 01:09:30,992
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

927
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,516
live from the center
of the earth,

928
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,561
Consul Tritan Crassis,

929
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:37,042
who, with the retirement
of Lord Over, is the new...

930
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:39,218
What is he?

931
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:41,351
He's the new
lord-elect of Atlantis.

932
01:09:41,525 --> 01:09:44,005
Consul?

933
01:09:47,574 --> 01:09:50,751
We come to you in peace

934
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:55,016
and in the interest of tourism

935
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,932
and investment opportunities.

936
01:09:58,106 --> 01:10:02,023
We feel Atlantis
has much to offer you.

937
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,288
To open trade
and communications with you,

938
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:07,115
the people of the surface,

939
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,118
we, the people
of the center of the earth,

940
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:13,905
agree to accept
as your first ambassador

941
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:16,081
Wanda Saknussemm.

942
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,039
Thank you.

943
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:24,132
We'd also like to take
this opportunity to announce

944
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:27,397
that our national hero,
Lieutenant Tola,

945
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:30,008
and his bride, Crystina,

946
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:33,620
will be our first ambassadors
to your world.

947
01:10:39,452 --> 01:10:41,324
To commemorate this event,

948
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:43,761
we have invited
the most popular star

949
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:46,067
of our two worlds
to perform a song,

950
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:50,028
especially written
for the occasion.

951
01:10:50,202 --> 01:10:52,291
Ladies, gentlemen,

952
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:54,250
and trolls,

953
01:10:54,424 --> 01:10:56,948
Billy and the Wonders.
