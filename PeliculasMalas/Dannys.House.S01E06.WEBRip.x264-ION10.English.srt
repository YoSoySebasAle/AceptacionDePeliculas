1
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,094
Oh, hey.

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,305
Welcome to Danny's house.

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,386
I was just having the most
craziest vivid dream.

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,935
I was getting married,

5
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,226
and the reception got ruined
for some reason.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,480
I thought everybody
would be cool with it,

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,021
but they got pissed.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,571
So, I jumped out the window
to escape.

9
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:29,778
Then I started getting chased
by this gigantic spider.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,368
Then the spider's teeth
fell out,

11
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,115
which,
according to dream analysis,

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,946
that means he's insecure.

13
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,285
Then I got worried.

14
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,656
What if I was
in a spider's dream?

15
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,165
Man, what does
dream mean anyway?

16
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,666
Are we in a dream right now?

17
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,585
Are we always dreaming?

18
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,795
Probably not.

19
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,966
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

20
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,848
Whoa, that was crazy, man.

21
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,437
I just had a dream I was doing
the opening for my show,

22
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:02,225
and I had lobster claws
for hands.

23
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,567
More cheap props?!

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,987
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

25
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,458
I'm not doing this shit again.

26
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:42,226
Feed it to the cats.
<i>Oui, oui, oui!</i>

27
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,363
You never wrote jokes?

28
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:48,646
I never sat down and wrote.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,030
But you're going to put them
together in your head? Yeah.

30
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,237
Like Jay-Z?
Exactly.

31
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,447
I was just in jail dreaming
about jacking off.

32
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,328
A jack off within a jack off
within a jack off.

33
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,235
Within a jack off.
Damn.

34
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,583
Everybody has fun
at Danny's house.

35
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,636
Hey, what's up, Chef Hat?
You ever dream?

36
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,717
Ah, <i>bonjour,</i> Danny.

37
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,562
It has always been my dream
to be on the head

38
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:22,427
of the greatest chef in Europe,

39
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,934
but I realized,

40
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,225
I could be the greatest chef
in Europe,

41
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,815
so I got myself a chef hat.

42
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,026
My dream was to be
Chef Hat's chef hat.

43
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,237
Man, that's great.

44
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,818
I guess you guys <i>are</i> living
your dream then.

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,662
Chef, you got a favorite food?

46
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,290
Ah, I wish I had a favorite food
but alas,

47
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,827
I have no taste buds
and no stomach.

48
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,831
That does not sound healthy.

49
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,002
Oh, please, Danny,
tell me what food tastes like.

50
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,053
I mean...
Well, I guess some stuff good,

51
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:54,087
but some stuff, I don't like.

52
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,966
Ooh, that vague description

53
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,507
is making my mouth water,
Monsieur Danny.

54
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,096
Wait, wait.

55
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,177
I thought you said
you ain't had taste buds?

56
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,141
I...

57
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,685
I do not.

58
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,688
But if I could eat anything,

59
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,440
it would be a dish
from beautiful scenic Austria.

60
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,160
Well, I ain't never been
to Austria before.

61
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,485
Allow me to take you there

62
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,490
through your taste buds,
Monsieur.

63
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,833
What I have prepared
for you today

64
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:26,914
is the traditional
Vienna sausage.

65
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,575
Man, that just looked
like you opened up

66
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,586
a can of little sausages
and dumped them on a plate.

67
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,964
How **** dare you!

68
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,585
I slave in this kitchen
night and day,

69
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,841
and you just come over here

70
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,890
and act like you work for Zagat!

71
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,756
Do you know hard it was for me,

72
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,682
a chef hat without
any arms, or legs, or feet

73
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,976
to accomplish
this culinary feat?

74
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,186
You know, I could have been
a chef hat at P. Diddy's,

75
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,187
but I said, "No!

76
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,729
Let me go to Danny's house,"
and what do I get for it?

77
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,777
All manner of disrespect!

78
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,738
If you ever insult me or one
of my special cuisines again,

79
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,529
I will **** end you!

80
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,703
Okay! Okay, man!
I was wrong, man!

81
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:07,705
Oh!
You are too kind, Danny.

82
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,746
Save some for your first guest -

83
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,419
acclaimed comedian and actor,
the toast of Vienna,

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,504
Gilbert Gottfried!

85
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,091
Oh, look,
it's Gilbert Gottfried!

86
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,013
What's up?
Yes, yes.

87
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,182
How are you doing?

88
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:25,097
Oh, Gilbert Gottfried!

89
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,558
I love to prepare for him.

90
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,228
We've been talking about dreams.

91
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,147
Do you have any weird dreams?

92
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:34,936
Well, there's -
there's the obligatory

93
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,277
being somewhere
without your pants on dream.

94
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,196
All dreams are weird.

95
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,487
Do you have any wet dreams?

96
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,740
Uh, well, no.

97
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,284
Those I like
when I'm wide awake.

98
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,457
You think people
have wet dreams about you?

99
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,706
Constantly.

100
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,247
I-I think -

101
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,377
I think everybody
who watches me.

102
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,378
Do you ever have dreams about
you doing stand-up?

103
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,925
I'll have those classic
actor's dream,

104
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,886
where it's, like,
a full-packed house,

105
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,514
and they can't remember
any of their lines.

106
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,095
You know, that happened
to me in real life.

107
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,099
I actually went on stage
and ready to do my thing,

108
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,439
and once I got out there,

109
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,016
literally my whole brain
just went blank.

110
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,651
Couldn't think of one word.

111
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:17,316
Couldn't think of one song.

112
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,147
Has something like that
ever happened to you?

113
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,196
I used to smoke
whatever it's called.

114
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,527
In my day, it was grass,
they called it. Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,663
Yeah.
We call it dope.

116
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:27,117
Yeah.
Kush.

117
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,118
And - Yes, and - Fire pack.

118
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,497
Get loud.

119
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,707
So I used to smoke that.
Mm-hmm.

120
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,627
Sometimes I would smoke
and have a drink

121
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,458
before I got onstage.
Mm-hmm.

122
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,383
I would write a bunch
of real funny things.

123
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,051
You think you're great

124
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,890
no matter what
you're doing there.

125
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:48,137
Yeah.
Then you look at it onstage,

126
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,685
and it's like, "hat sandwich,"
and it's like, "What?"

127
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,312
So I quit that.

128
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,574
So, do you think, like, dreams
mean anything?

129
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,817
Do you remember
those little books

130
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,738
that would define your dreams?

131
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,239
You'd look up, "Oh, if you dream

132
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,160
a bug is on you,
it means this."

133
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,661
I guess the crazy dream
like that,

134
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,372
in some sense,
like, I don't know.

135
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,543
I have, like, a random baby mama
I ain't never seen before.

136
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:17,882
Yes, that happens to me
all the time.

137
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:19,878
Yeah.
Random baby mamas.

138
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,050
Yeah, I'd be like,
"I've never seen this person

139
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,667
in my life,"
but then we have kids.

140
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,344
In fact, in the book...
And we doing all type of shit.

141
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,680
...it said, "If you dream
about a random baby mama..."

142
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:28,758
Baby mama!
What does that mean?

143
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,224
It means you like
to go roller skating.

144
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,684
Yeah.

145
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,345
I thought you were about
to say go raw dog.

146
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,944
Like, sometimes you have, like,
dumb, simple dreams.

147
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:39,648
Like, you could just dream of...

148
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,359
I don't know, just, like,
a boat floating in the ocean

149
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,860
with, like,
a piece of shit on it.

150
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:49,950
Ah, yes.
Freud used to talk about that.

151
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,951
That one dream everyone has...

152
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,997
is a boat floating in the ocean

153
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,038
with a piece of shit on it.
Yeah.

154
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,883
Yeah, you need to shit
on a boat.

155
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,506
Do you have, like,
nightmares and stuff?

156
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,134
I do.

157
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,885
One dream I had as a kid.
Okay.

158
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,014
When I eat a pizza,

159
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,595
I wouldn't eat the crust,
for some reason.

160
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,601
I tossed the crust away.
Mm-hmm.

161
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,064
And then I had a dream
that I was -

162
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,185
I think I was walking
through the park,

163
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:26,695
and all these crusts
of pizza jumped...

164
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,656
Attack of the pizza crust?

165
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,488
Yes!
Oh, my God.

166
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,581
And they were like snakes.
They had eyes and mouths.

167
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:36,409
So, why would they want
to... with you

168
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,214
when you were saving them?
I know. It's...

169
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,538
See, this is why...

170
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,381
pizza crusts are
very unappreciative.

171
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,929
When I was a kid,
February was, like,

172
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,255
a real hard month for me.

173
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,177
That's because it was
Black History Month,

174
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,218
and I would be in school,
and they would always show us

175
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,722
these civil rights movies
and shit every day.

176
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,892
Every day, mother...
getting bit by dogs,

177
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,193
spraying them
with hoses and shit,

178
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:00,145
and I would go home,

179
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,556
and I had to sleep
in a bed with my mama

180
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,234
'cause I would have nightmares.

181
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,692
Why was
Martin Luther King's dream

182
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,026
my nightmare?!

183
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,279
Yeah, well, I...

184
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,452
Yeah, I think they should get
rid of Black History Month...

185
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,043
...for that because it's -

186
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:20,328
it's -
It gives people bad dreams.

187
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,003
What do you think people in jail
dream about?

188
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,041
Uh...

189
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,503
not being in jail?

190
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,102
You ever wrote a joke
in your dream?

191
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,601
Not a good one.
Oh.

192
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,602
So, in that way, jokes are...

193
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:46,692
in my dreams are like my jokes
in real life.

194
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,031
You ever wonder what
celebrities dream sometime?

195
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:50,909
I wonder about it all the time.

196
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,490
I want to play a game with you

197
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,910
where I'm going
to show you a picture,

198
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,080
and I want you to tell me
what you think

199
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:59,078
this celebrity dream about.
Okay.

200
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,959
Check out this guy right here!

201
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,416
What you think
he's dreaming about?

202
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,917
Mark Zuckerberg!

203
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,708
He's dreaming about
what it would be like

204
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:11,759
to have an actual skin color.

205
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,260
He has the look
of a total loser,

206
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,184
but that guy could get any woman
on the planet.

207
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,595
I think he just dream about
mayo sandwiches for some reason.

208
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,192
Yeah.
Just wake up out of bed...

209
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:27,649
Something with no substance.
...just grab a mayo sandwich,

210
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,990
and put salt and pepper
on the top of it.

211
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,396
Ha! Next!

212
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,615
We got Gene Simmons.

213
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,906
What do you think
Gene Simmons dream about?

214
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,830
All the things he could have
been doing with that tongue

215
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,499
if he wasn't stupid enough

216
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,748
to get married
and have a family.

217
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,420
You think a mother...
with a tongue like that

218
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,338
want to be eating pussy
all the time?

219
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,417
I - I think just to show
how good you are at it.

220
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,007
Man, he's getting old.

221
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,008
That neck ain't holding up no more.

222
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,179
He just can't be waggling
that mother... around.

223
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,889
For some reason,
I just think Gene Simmons

224
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,599
just think about just being
the only man on Earth.

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,229
That's what he dream about.

226
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,897
He don't want no other niggas
around his bitches.

227
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:07,016
Next up!

228
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,984
Oh, shit.
We've got this mother...

229
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,395
What you think he dream about?

230
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,029
Um...

231
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,320
You want me to take this one?

232
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,333
Yeah, yeah,
you can take this one.

233
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:21,695
I think he dreams about being
in a big-ass white house

234
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,123
with a whole bunch of grass,

235
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,209
and just a whole bunch
of big booty black bitches.

236
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,300
Yeah, I just think he dream
about being a slave master.

237
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:31,205
I've had that dreams
a few times.

238
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,049
Haven't we all?!

239
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,140
Goddamn it! I'm black,
and I dream about that shit.

240
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,176
Gilbert Gottfried,
that was a great time.

241
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,351
I had a lot of fun talking
about dreams, man.

242
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,976
Thank you, man.

243
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,186
Bam! Bam!
Oh, perfect.

244
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,517
Ha! Ha!

245
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,735
Why exactly am I going up
to your bedroom?

246
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,736
This is very frightening.

247
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,160
Sherm!

248
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,955
I ain't order no pizza.

249
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375
I know.

250
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,956
This is a surprise pizza
to celebrate

251
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,223
the 1-year anniversary
of the fourth time

252
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:16,835
I ever delivered pizza to you.

253
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,763
Most people don't
celebrate that.

254
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:22,097
Thank you, Danny.

255
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,308
So, because it's
a special occasion,

256
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,730
I made you your dream pizza.

257
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,648
Here it is -

258
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,027
a pepperoni, popcorn,
chicken nugget,

259
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,987
cookie center, T-bone steak

260
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,156
and Fruit Roll-Up crust pizza

261
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,447
with plastic army men on it
for decoration.

262
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,670
Sherm, that's got to be
the nastiest shit

263
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,916
I ever saw in my life.

264
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,755
Wow, Danny.

265
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,216
I appreciate the honesty.

266
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,008
Back to the old drawing board.

267
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,930
But please,
keep this dream pizza

268
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,471
as a souvenir of our friendship.

269
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,646
Maybe I should have
left the pepperonis off.

270
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,397
This pizza is nightmare.

271
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,443
Hold on, wait. No, wait.
Hold on, wait.

272
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,489
Oh, look who's here!
It's Quelle and Jean Grae.

273
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,699
Yoooooooo!

274
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,540
If you could jump in somebody's
dream, who would it be?

275
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,155
Oprah.
That's a good one.

276
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,502
That's a good one.

277
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,462
It's Quelle and Jean Grae!

278
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,796
- What the... up?
- Nothing.

279
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,341
- How are y'all doing, man?
- Hi.

280
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,101
Oh, this is my favorite
married hip-hop couple -

281
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:45,677
Quelle Chris and Jean Grae.

282
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,270
I will go to fish market

283
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,097
and find some delicious food
for them,

284
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,729
so I must bid them <i>adieu.</i>

285
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,770
We've been talking about dreams.
Mm-hmm.

286
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,784
And I've been having
a lot of weird dreams lately,

287
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,396
man, recurring ones.

288
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,653
Do your teeth fall out?
You ever had the...

289
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,952
My teeth did fall out.
...that old...

290
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:02,157
That's why I had
to get them fixed.

291
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,236
Why did I ask him?

292
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,289
You all have any nightmares?

293
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,367
My nightmares are all,
like, about mediocrity.

294
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,252
It's, like, I can fly,
but I can only get,

295
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,250
like, as high as,
like, street lamps.

296
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,302
It's lame flying. Like, she can't really...
It's very lame.

297
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:18,666
Like, you feel like
you're getting a discount dream,

298
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,513
and it's like, I want the full dream.
Yeah, and I feel very mediocre.

299
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:22,387
My shit just be, like, a snap.
A snap.

300
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:23,844
It's, like, a snap,
then I wake up.

301
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,385
It's daylight and shit,
like, damn,

302
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,056
I don't even ever remember
even going to bed,

303
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,726
and if I do dream,
it's me cooking pork chops

304
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:30,225
or some dumb shit like that.

305
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,436
How many pork chops?

306
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,977
No, it's, like, a whole pack.
Hold on.

307
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,362
You should lean back. I think we should
unpack this. Yeah! How about this -

308
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:40,649
Yeah, 'cause what does
the pork chop dream really mean?

309
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,281
So, where you get
these pork chops from?

310
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:43,870
I go to the...
I go to the grocery store.

311
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:45,775
Oh, that's all in the dream?
Yeah!

312
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,076
Danny, your dreams
are so boring.

313
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,657
Mm-hmm.

314
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,041
Like, have you had
any weird dreams

315
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,250
where you hooked up
with somebody weird,

316
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,459
like Hillary Clinton
or something?

317
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,710
There was a period of dreams
where there was,

318
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,712
like, a few, like,
Muppets, like...

319
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,173
You was hooking up with Muppets?

320
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,008
No, no, I wasn't hooking up,
but they...

321
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,509
I was like, we're about
to find out a lot today, man.

322
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,300
No, no, no.

323
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,894
There were a few Muppets that,
like, had a crush on me.

324
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:09,558
Which ones?
Think it was Miss Piggy.

325
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,226
You sure it wasn't Gonzo?

326
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:13,135
He... the shit out
of somebody with that nose.

327
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,686
I don't never had
no dream like that.

328
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,109
So, what's the last dream
you can remember,

329
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,524
besides your pork chop dream?

330
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,734
The last dream I -
What stays with you?

331
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,735
The last time
I think I had a dream

332
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,907
was just went to sleep,
and then I woke up.

333
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,906
There was a piece of shit
on the bed.

334
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,368
No, no. See, okay.

335
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,494
I mean, it's a dream.
It's a dream.

336
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,454
It's a dream, so it doesn't matter.
No, but it wasn't a dream.

337
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,955
Oh, this wasn't a dream.
I thought I was dreaming, but I woke up...

338
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,746
Oh, the shit was real.
...and the shit was real.

339
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,040
Mm-hmm. But it wasn't <i>my</i>
shit, and I was by myself,

340
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,420
so where the shit come from?
So you were by yourself -

341
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,711
They have a conspiracy theory
saying I might have

342
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,224
pulled my pants down
and just shit on the bed,

343
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,086
but I was wearing
a motocross suit, too.

344
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,513
It's a lot to get out
of motocross suits.

345
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,136
Yeah, but you...

346
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,305
But now it's to the point
where I have dreams of that.

347
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,926
Right. So I wake up, like,
always in a panic, like, aah...

348
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,521
So you're having, like, a...
...and I'm looking for the shit.

349
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,018
...post-traumatic
shit disorder, yeah.

350
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,649
Mm-hmm, yeah.

351
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,766
Damn, dog.

352
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,573
We've definitely been
talking about this shit

353
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:01,856
for too long.
Yeah, no.

354
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,154
So, Quelle and Jean Grae,

355
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,365
I want to play a little game
with you guys.

356
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,116
Okay. We're going to
figure out how much

357
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,988
y'all mother...
really know each other.

358
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,754
Y'all want to do this, or what?
Yeah, I don't want that shit.

359
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:15,286
Not particularly,
but we're gonna.

360
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,377
We're gonna.
So, Jean Grae,

361
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:19,165
I got this nice
little sleep mask...

362
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,877
Oh, my gosh.
...personalized for you right here.

363
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,587
Okay, I'm in.

364
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,838
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

365
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,800
Oh, no.

366
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,755
Quelle, you ready for this?
What up?

367
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,642
Who you think is
her celebrity dream crush?

368
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:35,976
Celebrity dream crush...

369
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,645
I feel like this one should be easy.
Damn, pass.

370
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,896
Let me get the next one. Let me
come back to it. No, you can't pass!

371
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,316
I can't... I mean, I'm-a come back to it.
You've got to answer something!

372
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,476
It's like -
It's like "Price is Right."

373
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,822
I'm-a come back to it.
You can't!

374
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:46,489
It's not the way
this game works, Quelle!

375
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,027
Oh, shit, I don't know.

376
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,530
I'm just going to say
Lionel Richie right now.

377
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,867
Lionel Richie?
Of course it's not.

378
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,738
I think she will be
very excited for that.

379
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,294
Lionel a cute mother...
He light-skinned and shit.

380
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,746
All right.

381
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,957
Who you think
her dream feature would be?

382
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,958
Like, who would she love
to collaborate and work with?

383
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,336
Um...

384
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,007
I'm having a brain fart
right now.

385
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,796
What's her name?
Used to play with like...

386
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,300
sing with Funkadelic
and all that?

387
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,261
Black chick, what's her name?

388
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,638
The... is her name?

389
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,348
What does she sing?

390
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,977
...it. Say...
Say old girl with the 'fro

391
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,687
that be doing
the funky-ass music.

392
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,067
Old girl with the 'fro that be
doing the funky-ass music.

393
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:24,315
That's a good answer.

394
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,937
Next!
Hit me.

395
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,031
What would her
four ingredients be

396
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,699
on her dream deli sandwich?

397
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,947
Shit, let's go with pastrami,

398
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,160
some mayo, some lettuce
and some, like,

399
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,122
a good, nice mustard
or something.

400
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,631
All right.
That was the last question.

401
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,125
Ain't going to lie.
It's a little sketchy.

402
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,956
We gonna see how this works out.

403
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,552
You ready for this
marriage counseling?

404
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:50,756
I feel like this is not
the show I signed up for.

405
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,600
I was like, "Shit,
I didn't come prepared."

406
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,005
No!

407
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,560
Should I be nervous?
Definitely.

408
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,176
Oh, God. All right.

409
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,642
So we're gonna
figure out how much

410
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,063
you mother...
know each other.

411
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:02,020
The first question was,

412
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,150
who is your dream celebrity crush?
Mm-hmm.

413
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,228
Jean, who you think
he said for you?

414
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,613
I always liked
the State Farm guy, Mayhem.

415
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,654
I said Lionel Richie.
He said Lionel Richie.

416
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,695
But I was just throwing
some shit out of there, yeah.

417
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,737
Oh, now you are!

418
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,534
All right.

419
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,115
Who would your dream feature be,

420
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,249
and who would you really love
to collaborate with?

421
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,288
Who do you think
he said for you?

422
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,581
It's Lionel Richie.

423
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,293
No, he said,
"Old girl with the afro

424
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,962
that do the funky shit."

425
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,463
You know who I'm talking about.

426
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,090
I was...
I was having a brain fart.

427
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,679
It's the truth.
We couldn't think of her name.

428
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,926
Old girl with the afro that...

429
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,886
Oh, my god.

430
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,598
The black lady.

431
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,228
Mad black ladies in the '70s
that got funky.

432
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,307
That is, like, every black woman...
No, no!

433
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,771
With the fro...
But I mean, I was thinking...

434
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,482
Oh, Betty Davis.
Betty Davis!

435
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,902
Betty Davis, okay.
Thank you, dog.

436
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:51,031
I mean, you guys are 0-2
right now, so...

437
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:52,946
All right.

438
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,697
Jean Grae,
what's the four ingredients

439
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,909
on your dream sandwich
from the deli?

440
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,410
Um, there's bacon.
Mm-hmm.

441
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,331
Pastrami, salami, a cheese,
maybe a pepper jack.

442
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,422
And you're just gonna eat that shit dry?
It's just meat and cheese.

443
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,627
It's just meat and cheese,
and maybe some mayo. Man!

444
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,458
You're gonna choke to death on this...
sandwich. Maybe some mayo.

445
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,508
Well, I said...
I did say, "pastrami,"

446
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,969
but then I said,
"A good mustard, a mayo,

447
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,471
lettuce or tomato
or some shit like that."

448
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,057
So just a pastrami sandwich,
pretty much.

449
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,188
Yeah, I mean, you gave me four ingredients,
shit. I guess our marriage is over.

450
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,265
You can't build a sandwich
with four pieces!

451
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,356
God damn.

452
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,857
You can't build a sandwich
with four pieces.

453
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,070
So many lies happened today.

454
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,780
And we're done... up people's
marriages...

455
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,781
...over sandwiches!

456
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,623
Oh, we're going to be talking
about this for a long time.

457
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:40,949
Yeah.

458
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,704
Thank you guys
for coming through, man!

459
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,705
Thanks.
It was so much fun.

460
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,826
Yeah!

461
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,464
All right, G. We'll see you.
All right, dawg. Peace.

462
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,044
I want you to...

463
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,295
I want you to work
through those dreams.

464
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,456
I am. I'm trying my best.
Yeah.

465
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,881
'Cause that one bothered me.

466
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,470
Yeah, that one was
kind of weird, right?

467
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,387
So how does shit get through
the motorcycle jacket?

468
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:58,215
It doesn't, babe.

469
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,930
He unzipped the whole thing,
and he shit on the bed.

470
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,475
Breathe easy.
Yeah.

471
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,646
Oh, yeah.
That's nice.

472
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,265
Ah-ha!...

473
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,359
I just need to run a couple
of bits by you.

474
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,266
How did you find me?

475
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:20,700
So, what did we learn today?

476
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,201
Well, if you're having
trouble sleeping,

477
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,831
you can just take a Xanax,

478
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,749
but you might wake up
with a turd in your bed

479
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,498
and diagnosed with
post-traumatic shit disorder.

480
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,501
Some people can
control their dreams,

481
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,879
and they have wild sex orgy
with celebrities,

482
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
but others can't,
so they just have boring dreams

483
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,592
about doing frying pork chops
in their underwear.

484
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,553
I'd like to give a shout-out
to my guests, Gilbert Gottfried,

485
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,142
Quelle Chris, and Jean Grae
for coming to the crib

486
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:45,350
and kicking it with me
and, remember,

487
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,141
wet dreams are better awake.

488
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,901
All right, y'all,
I'll see y'all later.

489
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,359
Hello?
Danny?

490
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,240
Hey, it's Calise.

491
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,079
We still meeting up so I can run
my new jokes by you, right?

492
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,447
Yeah, I'm actually in my car
right now heading to you.

493
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,414
How can you be in your car?

494
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,995
Didn't I call you
on your house phone?

495
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,749
I've got a house phone
in my car.

496
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,670
Come on, man.
Are you lying to me.

497
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,171
No, no! I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.

498
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,933
I can feel the lie
through the phone.

499
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,057
All right.
Fine.

500
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,532
Mr. Brown,
we're ready for you.

501
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,145
All right.
Right this way.

502
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,446
Ahhh.

503
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,034
It's feeling better, improved.

504
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,995
It's one of them knots -

505
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,115
Ah-ha!

506
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,956
I just need to run
a couple of bits by you.

507
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,327
All right?
Please, it's for tonight.

508
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,962
What the hell.
I have a show!

509
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:55,378
How did you find me?
I need a new joke for tonight.

510
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,049
Listen...
I'm just trying to get a massage.

511
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,877
You don't even know.
Like, Sunday, I almost died.

512
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,474
I was choking
on an avocado toast.

513
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:05,054
My boyfriend is white,
and he reacted so quickly.

514
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,925
He was like...

515
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,765
That's all he did,
but it was so quick,

516
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,151
and it was perfect because
he, like, let out a little yelp.

517
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,477
He was like.

518
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,692
It was just enough
for a real man

519
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,191
to overhear it and come save me.

520
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,566
Come on.
He's laughing!

521
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:24,031
Come on, man.
You're not helping, man.

522
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,785
Excuse me.

523
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,906
He's so sweet.
You should just relax a little.

524
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,542
I'm trying to relax lately.

525
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:33,917
My mom told me
that I should eat weed.

526
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,458
She doesn't want me
to take antidepressants,

527
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,921
and it's crazy to hear my mom
say that, right?

528
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,422
Because she's a retired
police lieutenant

529
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,591
and ex-D.A.R.E. cop,

530
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,892
but now that she found out that
weed has medicinal purposes,

531
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,716
she's using CBD oil
for her knees,

532
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,022
and she's furious
with the entire police force.

533
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,425
She's like, "All that time

534
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,102
we were locking up people
for marijuana.

535
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,939
I find out it's good
for my knees?"

536
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,057
Isn't that great?
She's 70 years old.

537
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,148
It's nice to watch her grow...

538
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,566
weed.

539
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,067
She's growing weed
in the basement

540
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,570
with my brother.
Mm.

541
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,615
He lives there still.
Does that feel good?

542
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,116
You know this is stressful, right?
I know, right?

543
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,538
That's why I need you to listen

544
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,455
so that I don't get uptight
for the show.

545
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,166
It's hard to do comedy.

546
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,997
If you could just relax,
you'll feel the humor.

547
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,342
Honestly, I need this.
I have a show tonight.

548
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:23,470
Could you let me have the rest
of this session?

549
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,847
I have a show tonight.

550
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,468
Can you let your chiropractor
touch me?
