00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:01,766
<i>It's how
every message ended.</i>

00:00:01,851 --> 00:00:03,375
<i>Previously, on</i>
"MacGyver"...

3
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:05,501
But who they are
remains a mystery.

4
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:07,609
<i>They call themselves Codex.</i>

5
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:10,203
<i>They've been around
a lot longer than we first thought.</i>

6
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:12,360
<i>There's nothing more dangerous
than people who do</i>

7
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,882
<i>the wrong things
for the right reasons.</i>

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,389
Tell him...

9
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:19,891
...about File 47.

10
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:21,218
47...

11
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:22,914
would plunge the
world into chaos.

12
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,406
What do you say?
A little breakfast with your dear old aunt?

13
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,940
Why do you refuse to see
what is actually happening here?

14
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,461
- And what is that?
- You're compromised.

15
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:31,235
Auntie Gwen got to you.

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm gonna try something,

17
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:33,796
but it means
risking everything,

18
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,531
<i>everyone I love.</i>

19
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:40,734
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,620
We're not gonna make it.

- jackass!
- Gwen, that was

26
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,963

30
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:06,480
There is a plan
in place.

31
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:07,619
Just take a deep breath.

32
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:09,979
- Okay, bossy.
- But if something happens to me,

33
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:11,635
There's something
you should know.

34
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,588
I'm gonna send File 47
to some friends in D.C.

35
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:16,745
Okay, that is a terrible plan.

36
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,166
It is a complex statistical
analysis of the climate crisis.

37
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:23,877
Indisputable scientific proof
that our planet is dying.

38
00:01:23,962 --> 00:01:26,457
File 47 posits a plan
to wipe out

39
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,418
a considerable amount
of the population

40
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:31,284
- in order to get the planet back on track.
- A theoretical plan.

41
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:32,894
You don't think that's
a little dangerous,

42
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,167
to put that in the hands
of the government?

43
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,901
Seeing it in print
might scare them into action.

44
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:37,705
Politicians only care
about power.

45
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,994
And you want to give
'em even more power

46
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,142
to play God and decide
who lives and who dies.

47
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,627
We know
what kind of planet

48
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:44,881
the next generation is going
to inherit.

49
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,033
We have to do something.

50
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:53,494
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no,

51
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,319
no, no, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

52
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:57,042
Oh, God. You know what,
I think you're right.

53
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:58,754
- We're not gonna make it to the hospital.
- Damn it, Ellie.

54
00:01:58,838 --> 00:01:59,950
You never listen to me!

55
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,370
- Pull over!
- Okay, okay, okay.

56
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,449
It's okay.
We-we can do this.

57
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,956
We-we can do this.
We've got five PhDs between us.

58
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,581
Right. Well, I've got three,
you've got two.

59
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,585
Okay, I don't see
how that's important right now!

60
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:13,063
Oh-oh, God.

61
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:20,033
Hey there, little guy.

62
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,309
Hi.

63
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,975
All right.

64
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:27,220
- Ready to cut the cord?
- Can you wait

65
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:29,353
Just a minute? I just feel like
the second we do,

66
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:32,088
he's gonna... float away.

67
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:34,583
Aw, you...

68
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:39,096
You deserve the world.

69
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,458
And the world

70
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:44,122
deserves you.

71
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,598
Oh, look at us.

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,011
- So you don't have a name?
- We couldn't decide.

73
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,643
But I'll-I'll think
of something.

Generator's not great,
but, thanks to you,

78
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:49,693
we don't have
to worry about power.

79

What do you mean,
thanks to us?

80
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:53,298
You brought us Shiva.

Spoiler alert:

82
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,196
not just a weapon.

83
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,111
It's also known as a god

84
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,112
they call
the Destroyer.

85
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,571
It's also named
after a goddess

86
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,368
associated with reincarnation,

87
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,540
rebirth.

88
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,931
In order
to be born again,

89
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,149
first, we have to die.

90
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,579
Shiva here's
a...

91
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,673
renewable
power source.

92
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,195
Be right back.

93
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:19,391
Your aunt must be really great
at dinner parties.

94
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,840
She thinks she's
saving the world.

95
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:21,931
Exactly.

96
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:23,572
Do you really think
we can change her mind

97
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:25,741
about this plan? We don't
even know what the plan is.

98
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:28,129
Yeah, I have a gut feeling
about this. Just...

99
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:31,407
deep down somewhere,
there's some humanity left.

100
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,298
- Somewhere.
- Hey.

101
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,225
I get it.

102
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,399
You feel connected to her,

103
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,915
to your mom.

104
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,829
But I need you
to clear your head, Mac.

105
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,141
We need to do
everything we can

106
00:04:42,226 --> 00:04:43,488
to figure out
what they're planning.

107
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:45,072
Yeah. You're absolutely right.

108
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:47,157
- Okay.
- Until then,

109
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:49,243
we need to look
like true believers.

110
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:50,371
Right.

111
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:53,499
That doesn't look good.

112
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,666
Your reputation as Artemis
precedes you, Ms. Davis.

113
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,581
You've got a lot
of fans around here.

114
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,737
Would you mind accompanying
me to our tech room?

115
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,120
Uh, like I said,
we're a package deal.

116
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,534
You and I have other
business to attend to.

117
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:12,823
We don't have a choice.

118
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:14,978
Right.

119
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,152
I'll s... I'll see you later.

120
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,011
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,245
You come with me.

122
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,753
And where are we off to?

123
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:29,213
To meet Leland.

124
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:30,916
What's a Leland?

125
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:34,087
He's the man who saved my life
when the CIA tried to kill me.

126
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:37,284
Uh, he paid 'em off,
had 'em declare me dead.

127
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:39,417
Who is he?

128
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:41,753
He<i> is</i> Codex.

129
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,737
The man behind the curtain?

130
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:45,855
Among others.

131
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,691
He's a genius.

132
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:50,495
Before Codex,
File 47 was just theory

133
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,894
and statistics
on paper.

134
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,683
Now it's a plan
to save the world.

135
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:55,214
He helped me
resurrect it.

136
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,503
He believes in me.

137
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:57,862
And now...

138
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,691
he has to believe in you.

139
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,722
And if he doesn't?

140
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,153
Roman,

141
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:12,448
isn't it about time
for your 4:00 feeding?

142
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:14,904
Let me guess. They drop a
live goat into your cage.

143
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,120
I'll take it from here.

144
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:18,832
- No, you won't.
- Leland wants you to get your team ready.

145
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:26,464
So, I will meet you in
an hour in the vehicle bay.

146
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:27,761
You'll be fine.

147
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,641
<i>Chopin's "Nocturne
in E-flat minor" playing...</i>

148
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:56,027
The years 1347 to 1351.

149
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,581
The Black Plague in Europe.

150
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,237
Over 100,000 million
people died.

151
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,259
And what happened
after that?

152
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,173
The Renaissance.

153
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,587
And?

154
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,947
Codex.

155
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,517
- Codex dates back to the 14th century?
- I know.

156
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:27,938
- It's hard to believe, huh?
- How is that

157
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:28,897
Even possible?

158
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,892
Well, a group of people
got together back then

159
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,087
with a singular purpose:

160
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,587
to protect the planet
from plague,

161
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,892
from famine,

162
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,228
and...
Excuse my French...

163
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,152
Dumbasses,

164
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:46,281
like the people
in power today.

165
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,251
A lot of amazing science
had just come out

166
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,461
of the Middle East,

167
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,322
but Westerners needed a...

168
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,572
bit of a push.

169
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,564
So we funded
a lot of the Enlightenment.

170
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:02,556
Things were really clipping
along for us.

171
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,861
And then,
of course,

172
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:05,321
things took a turn

173
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:08,056
for our dear Mother Earth.

174
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,275
The Industrial
Revolution.

175
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,368
Kid's good.

176
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,017
Everything went
all pear-shaped after that.

177
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,959
Plastics
were invented.

178
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,915
We were worried when
they started splitting the atom.

179
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:25,431
But we found

180
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:28,061
that chain reactions
do come in handy.

181
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,056
You remember
World War I?

182
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,523
'Course.

183
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,860
Franz Ferdinand.

184
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,193
Guess what.

185
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:44,517
He was Codex.

186
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,595
Is that a J.M.W. Turner?

187
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,759
Yes, it is.

188
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,392
Look at that sunset.

189
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:00,751
He was influenced by

190
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:03,837
the... 1814 eruption
of Mount Tambora.

191
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,892
Spewed gas and ash
up into the sky.

192
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,728
Volcanic particles
in the stratosphere

193
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,501
probably diffused the light.

194
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:11,775
Used to be
Mother Earth

195
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,665
could protect herself

196
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:15,150
with an eruption.

197
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:17,626
Cool the Earth back down
for the next couple

198
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:18,795
of years.

199
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,590
That's not the
case anymore.

200
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,751
Things have gotten out of hand.

201
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,423
There's just too damn many
of us.

202
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,952
Please,

203
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:36,830
tell me what I can do to help.

204
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:42,212
You got 20 people
on a lifeboat meant for ten.

205
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,136
You're sinking.

206
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,126
You're not gonna
make it to shore.

207
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,921
What do you do?

208
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:52,486
You throw the ten weakest out.

209
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:54,970
And the strong can row us
back to shore.

210
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,513
Very good, Angus.

211
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,064
Have a nice day.

212
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:17,478
You know...

213
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,947
...years ago,
a man that you know

214
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:27,163
answered that question
the exact same way.

215
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:31,572
Russ Taylor.

216
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:37,025
His mind and his resources
were a perfect fit for us.

217
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,939
But he refused our proposal.

218
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,017
Because he's weak.

219
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,572
<i>Friends...</i>

220
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,844
every single one of you

221
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:03,087
has made this day possible.

222
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:05,703
It's time to go to work.

223
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:06,913
- You okay?
- Hey. Yeah, fine.

224
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,157
Let's do it!

225
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,861
All right, for security reasons,

226
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,723
each team has a tablet

227
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,727
with instructions that will load
once you are on the road.

228
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,767
Everybody will be traveling
a different route

229
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:21,778
to attract
the least amount of attention.

230
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:24,165
I'll be directing the ops
from here in the bunker.

231
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,996
"What was is lost..."

232
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:29,587
"What was is lost..."

233
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,645
"...but from death comes life!"

234
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,236
"...but from death
comes life!"

235
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:35,220
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

236
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,594
Still think you
can change her mind?

237
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,931
Yeah, I think our
best bet right now

238
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,247
is just go along with this plan
and see if we can figure out

239
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,087
- a way to stop it.
- What plan, Mac?

240
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,089
We're flying blind.

241
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,806
Hey, thanks
for helping us out.

242
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:55,065
We can really use you
out there.

243
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,149
Sorry to...

244
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:57,871
keep you in the dark.

245
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,166
Don't suppose you could
let us know what we're in for?

246
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:03,931
This is how Leland does things,
but it's for our own good.

247
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,058
Right.

248
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:08,587
Come here.

249
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,425
Oh. I just wish
your mom was here.

250
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:20,009
All right,

251
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:21,525
let's do this.

252
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,665
Can you get in?
We need all the intel

253
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,611
- we can get.
- This thing is, like,

254
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,072
The Fort Knox of tablets.

255
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:37,656
Did Leland give you
any clues?

256
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,142
No, but I
did see something

257
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:40,395
in the vehicle bay.

258
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:43,187
Dosimeters.

259
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,050
The things
that measure radiation?

260
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,407
Yeah. So, the
question is,

261
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:48,451
what do they have, a...

262
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,048
- a dirty bomb, or...?
- Do they have

263
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,133
A nuke?

264
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,953
Any clues in the tech room?

265
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:56,556
No.
They just had me writing code.

266
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:01,276
There was something written
on the white board, though.

267
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,321
It's... it's weird...
It wasn't code,

268
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:05,990
it was like an equation,
with maybe six letters.

269
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:09,509
It didn't happen to have
an "f" over an "m," did it?

270
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:10,970
Yeah.

271
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,432
It did. Why?

272
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:16,001
It's an equation
for determining...

273
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,212
nuclear fission critical mass.

274
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:21,142
So they have a nuke.

275
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:23,165
That explains why they
wanted to hack NORAD.

276
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,835
Leland said something
about starting a chain reaction.

277
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,213
Maybe they're trying to start
World War III. If we can...

278
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:41,860
Well, well, well.

279
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:44,382
The fam's all here.

280
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:51,056
Get your gun out of my face!
We're trying to save everyone!

281
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,321
Oh, that's funny. So are we.

282
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,796
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

283
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,124
Okay, everybody needs
to calm down,

284
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,766
- and we'll be okay.
- You really want us to believe

285
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,175
You used Shiva to
infiltrate Codex?

286
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,531
Yes. So Mac could find out
what their master plan is.

287
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:02,806
Yeah, and we were making
a lot of progress

288
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,751
until you two showed up.
We do not have time for this.

289
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:06,447
- I'm not buying any of this.
- You gassed us, Mac.

290
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,289
I didn't have a choice!
You booted me out of the Phoenix!

291
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:10,049
Guys, I promise
we're on the same side here.

292
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,016
Yes, I seem to recall

293
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,212
You betraying
and lying to us

294
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:13,210
- as well, Riley.
- Betrayed<i> you?</i>

295
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:14,859
You guys dropped a freakin'
Hellfire missile on us.

296
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:16,445
- We tried to stop it.
- Oh, really? Now who's lying?

297
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,046
Codex has a nuke!

298
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,023
And every minute
that you keep

299
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,811
your guns trained on us,
it gets closer to going off,

300
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,814
and we get further away
from stopping it.

301
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,475
I've known Mac
longer than anyone.

302
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,640
He's telling the truth.

303
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:31,390
Desi, Taylor,

304
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:33,991
- take a breath.
- No, I'm bringing them in.

305
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:35,625
Mac, don't!

306
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,101
I am going to change this tire,

307
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,454
and we're gonna make
the rendezvous.

308
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,180
- We do not have time for this.
- Don't make me do this.

309
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:41,702
Taylor, stand down!

310
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:42,815
He's compromised, Matty.

311
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,524
Oh, really? I'm the one
who's compromised?

312
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,597
Hey, Matty, did Taylor
ever happen to mention to you

313
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,382
that Codex tried to recruit him?

314
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:54,772
What's he talking about, Russ?

315
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:57,054
Yeah, go ahead, tell 'em, Russ.

316
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,098
Tell them how Codex
approached you,

317
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,935
tried to bring you on board,
but you kept it a secret

318
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,187
because you didn't want
us to know

319
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:03,015
that you're the one
who's compromised.

320
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,421
Desi,

321
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,179
I want you
to put your weapon down

322
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:09,429
and put me on speaker.

323
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,257
Taylor, stand down!

324
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,445
I am not the one
who is compromised.

325
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,530
All right?

326
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:24,315
Three years ago, I was
approached by an organization

327
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:25,984
with considerable resources.

328
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:28,571
- Codex.
- Yes. I didn't know that at the time.

329
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:31,990
Spearhead Operations had a
contract with the U.S. military

330
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:33,476
to deliver the Hades prototype.

331
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,385
The bioweapon
we stopped in L.A.

332
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:36,952
The very same.

333
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:40,458
Codex offered me a large sum
to deliver it to them instead.

334
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,796
I, of course, refused.

335
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,321
So then they turned to Bishop.

336
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:45,976
Exactly.

337
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,757
Someone tried to eliminate
me, and they missed.

338
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:52,319
Instead, five of
my teammates...

339
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:56,473
my brothers in arms
for the last ten years,

340
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,772
were taken out by an IED,

341
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,655
which I later traced
back to Codex.

342
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,185
And I've been hunting
them ever since.

343
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,038
I'm sorry for your loss,
but does it justify this?

344
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:09,041
All of this...
Buying the Phoenix,

345
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:10,544
using us...

346
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,843
for your obsession, for revenge,

347
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,561
no matter the cost.

348
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:21,155
You're all the best
at what you do.

349
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,022
I needed you on my team.

350
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,305
Well, then why wouldn't
you trust me?

351
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,015
Because I can no longer
read you, Angus.

352
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,952
You fit no
discernible pattern.

353
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,952
For all appearances, you
crossed over to Codex.

354
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,414
Yeah. To stop you
from taking innocent lives.

355
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,375
To save you from yourself.

356
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:36,608
I just got a location

357
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,063
- For the rendezvous point.
- That could be

358
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,320
Where they're launching
the nuke from.

359
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:41,656
Okay,
here's what we're gonna do. Mac, Riley,

360
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,101
you're gonna keep your covers

361
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,770
and get
to that rendezvous point.

362
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:47,093
Taylor, Desi,
I want eyes on them,

363
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:48,836
and keep a low profile.

364
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,028
There's just
one little problem.

365
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:57,285
Thanks.

366
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,709
The last time
I changed a tire

367
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:04,412
was our camping trip
to Yosemite, remember?

368
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,066
Didn't leave our sleeping bags
for two days.

369
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,403
Hurry up.

370
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,366
Yeah, got it.

371
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,155
Good.

372
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:15,975
You know what?
I trusted you,

373
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,187
and you broke me down
and you got me to trust you

374
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:19,909
and let you in again and again,

375
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:22,428
and when things got tough,
you pushed me away.

376
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:25,967
Do you have any idea
what that did to me?

377
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,811
You're the last person
I wanted to hurt.

378
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,662
Tire's done.

379
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,209
Time to stop a nuke.

380
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:45,939
Everything okay?

381
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,748
No. No, definitely not.

382
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,209
Got it.

383
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,015
Coordinates say the
rendezvous should be right there.

384
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,233
We're in position.
We have eyes on Mac and Riley.

385
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,831
You're late.

386
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, we got a flat.

387
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:29,168
What are our instructions?

388
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,505
Standing by.
Nothing received yet.

389
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:33,723
Copy that.

390
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,780
What is this place?

391
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,662
Just empty trucks.
No nuke.

392
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:41,358
What the hell is
a Codex team doing here?

393
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,389
I don't know, and
I don't like it.

394
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:44,896
<i>This doesn't make sense.</i>

395
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:46,685
They're all
at the rendezvous point.

396
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:48,449
- Where's the payload?
- Gwendolyn.

397
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:51,335
Everything's on schedule.
We're just getting eyes

398
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,248
- on the payload.
- It's not there.

399
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,543
What do you mean?

400
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:59,006
Folks, give us the room
a sec, please.

401
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:03,936
Sit down.

402
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:15,334
When I first found you...

403
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,991
right after the crash,

404
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,537
I thought to myself,
I've never seen another human

405
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:23,389
shine more brightly.

406
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,557
I could read a book

407
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,233
by you on a
moonless night.

408
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:29,139
It's easy to shine
when you have purpose.

409
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:30,436
Yeah, but I've
always been in awe

410
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,438
of you, Gwen.

411
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,045
I'm in awe of your
mind and your loyalty.

412
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,351
Even your anger.

413
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,584
Justifiable anger.

414
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,006
They took
your sister.

415
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,633
Still here.

416
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,712
Thanks to you.

417
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:53,561
Leland, what is happening?

418
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:56,834
You've brought me...

419
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,201
so much joy over the years.

420
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,714
I hate to have to
bring you pain.

421
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:07,704
Your nephew Angus.

422
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,640
You've had such
high hopes for him.

423
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,819
But he's still a Phoenix man.

424
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,310
So I've put us all in jeopardy.

425
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,464
We're often blinded by
the love of our children.

426
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,831
As I've been by
you many times.

427
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,644
But now comes the hard part.

428
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:38,881
What?

429
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,544
What is this?

430
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,637
Guys, you've got a helicopter

431
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:47,863
- approaching from the south.
- Can a helicopter

432
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,284
Transport a nuke?

433
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:50,839
Not this one.

434
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,698
That's a Cobra
attack helicopter.

435
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,130
It's a trap.

436
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,292
What?

437
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:04,769
Everybody needs to run now.

438
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:06,184
- What are you talking about?
- They're gonna blow up the warehouse.

439
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:07,729
Everybody needs to
get out of here now.

440
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:08,896
Let's move! Let's go!

441
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,961
Go, go, go! Code red!

442
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,820
- Riles, over here.
- Come on!

443
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,008
It's gonna be loud!

444
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,607
Why?

445
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:41,526
Scarlett, Mr. MacGyver,

446
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:43,991
and Ms. Davis compromised

447
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:46,078
our security.
More importantly,

448
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:47,372
they compromised you.

449
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:49,889
These human connections

450
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:51,522
are holding you back.

451
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,225
Taylor, tell me you see them.

452
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,729
No. This fire's too big.

453
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:05,483
There's no way of getting in.

454
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,725
Returning to base.

455
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:23,912
It's too hot! Drop it!

456
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,034
We've got them, Matty.

457
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,393
Only you could've
survived this.

458
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:48,980
- You okay?
- Yeah.

459
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,523
Anyone else in there alive?

460
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,404
What have you done?

461
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:00,474
What Codex always does.

462
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,278
What was necessary.

463
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,075
These people were
your weakness.

464
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,441
I need your strength.

465
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,654
Need you to see
the big picture.

466
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,969
Now, I know it stings.

467
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,536
Even though he
betrayed you,

468
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:28,044
Angus is your family.

469
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,833
And Scarlett,
like a daughter.

470
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:35,841
Yeah, what am I gonna
tell her sister?

471
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,443
The truth.

472
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,574
Her sister died
for a greater good.

473
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:44,622
Is that what this is?

474
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:46,332
That's what it always is.

475
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:50,467
We're too close now for
these kind of mistakes.

476
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:52,865
Your nephew was dangerous.

477
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:56,169
And your attachment
to him even more so.

478
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:57,599
Hmm.

479
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:02,521
So, who's next?

480
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:07,154
The council and I
have complete trust

481
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,521
- in you.
- And yet you chose not to tell me

482
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:11,608
That you were gonna neutralize

483
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:13,622
- my entire team!
- To protect you.

484
00:24:13,707 --> 00:24:15,115
To protect your mind.

485
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,024
To protect your
natural leadership.

486
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,904
You are valued
beyond measure

487
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:22,857
because you know
the hard truth.

488
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:28,293
Some are worth
more than others.

489
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:39,482
You really think
Gwen iced her entire team?

490
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,073
No, I don't.

491
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,555
Everything about that
attack just feels off.

492
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,505
No, Angus. That's the true
face of your Aunt Gwen.

493
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,193
I'm not giving up on her.

494
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:50,873
Guys, there's movement

495
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,082
at the Codex Ranch House.

496
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,638
Small convoy just pulled out.

497
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:56,287
Looks like a five-ton truck with
two jeeps acting as the escort.

498
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:57,474
They're moving something big.

499
00:24:57,558 --> 00:24:59,549
Well,
that's got to be it. That's the nuke.

500
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,617
Closer!

501
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:51,245
Doing my best!

502
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:07,802
I'm inside.

503
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,304
Look for ID numbers.

504
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:10,722
I'll call up specs.

505
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,063
It wasn't me.

506
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:24,484
It was Leland's call.

507
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:25,785
He knew that you
would betray us.

508
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:27,284
He knew I would do
the right thing.

509
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,620
The ends will justify
what had to be done.

510
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:31,165
Who are you trying to convince?

511
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:33,948
Me? Or you?

512
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,519
Gwen,

513
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,200
it's not too late to
put a stop to this.

514
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:40,866
This couldn't be
what my mom wanted.

515
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:43,097
Nobody<i> wants</i> this, Angus.

516
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:44,433
It's what's necessary.

517
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:45,714
I can't believe that.

518
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,714
Sometimes you just have
to give people a chance.

519
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,698
We gave people a chance.

520
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:50,909
They failed.

521
00:26:50,994 --> 00:26:52,660
- The world is dying.
- Then give me

522
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,019
a chance to do it the right way.

523
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,428
It doesn't take the whole world.

524
00:26:56,513 --> 00:26:58,175
Sometimes you just need

525
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,470
that one person
that you can count on.

526
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,347
Who you trust.

527
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:04,691
And, together,
any problem can be solved.

528
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:08,777
I wish that were true.

529
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:10,862
You know it is.
I can see it.

530
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,730
This isn't who you are.

531
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:14,683
This isn't who
my mother hoped you'd become.

532
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,464
Not the place
I'd pick for a family reunion.

533
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,885
- I've got this, Roman.
- Got what, exactly?

534
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:28,370
Your supposed-to-be-dead nephew
hiding in the back of our truck?

535
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:48,111
No!

536
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:50,197
Angus!

537
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:52,992
- Mac!
- Take my hand.

538
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,501
I still believe in you.

539
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:10,779
No!

540
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:15,763
Mac!

541
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:20,729
Mac!

542
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,052
Get a little help here?

543
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,256
<i>It was a National Park Service logo</i>

544
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,092
<i>That said "Yellowstone" on it.</i>

545
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,567
Why would they pretend
to be forest rangers?

546
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:38,614
Volcanoes.

547
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:41,263
Leland had
a Turner painting of one.

548
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:42,467
He was talking
about them a lot.

549
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:44,417
Yeah, but that guy just
sounds buckets of crazy.

550
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:46,888
Right. But what's
under Yellowstone

551
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:48,432
is a supervolcano.

552
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:50,989
Did-did you just say
"supervolcano"?

553
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:53,638
Yeah. I think they're gonna use
the nuke to somehow set it off.

554
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,853
You know,
I actually did you a favor

555
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:06,950
because Leland
would've had me kill you.

556
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:08,896
It's a bumpy road.

557
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,025
I need to concentrate.

558
00:29:17,782 --> 00:29:19,752
Okay, so,
think of a volcanic eruption

559
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:22,165
like the, uh, popping
of a champagne bottle.

560
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,465
The cork blows out,

561
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:25,300
and then all of the gases
that are trapped inside,

562
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,427
they suddenly expand
and shoot out.

563
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:28,762
<i>And Codex is popping</i>

564
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:30,138
that cork
using a nuclear bomb?

565
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:31,556
Right. But now imagine

566
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:32,808
instead of liquid
shooting out,

567
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:35,185
it's the gases that have been
trapped inside of magma

568
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:37,462
for hundreds
of thousands of years,

569
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:40,977
expel ash and cover
the entire western hemisphere.

570
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:43,392
Summer would disappear
for possibly years.

571
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:45,852
Wait a second.
Just from one volcano?

572
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,744
Well, yes,
but not just any volcano.

573
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,924
A really, really big one.

574
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,784
The best I can tell, we've been
driving over this thing

575
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:52,423
for the past two hours.

576
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,831
Without sunlight,
the planet cools,

577
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:58,083
reversing the greenhouse effect,
which is good.

578
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:00,563
But it also destroys crops,
causing famine, disease.

579
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:01,946
It's basically a reset switch.

580
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:03,368
We need to find that nuke.

581
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,447
Matty, are you still tracking
that convoy?

582
00:30:05,532 --> 00:30:06,299
We're trying.

583
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:07,676
We haven't spotted them yet.

584
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,063
Actually, I know how to find it.

585
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:10,024
You do?

586
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,804
Yeah. Before I fell
out of that truck,

587
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:14,462
I managed to jam my phone
under the loading ramp.

588
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,431
Tracing the signal now.

589
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:17,644
It's good to have you back, Mac.

590
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:21,524
Sorry about the, uh...
gun in your face thing.

591
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:26,473
Eh, what's a gun in the face
between friends?

592
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:37,108
One lookout.
Truck's empty.

593
00:30:37,248 --> 00:30:38,832
They must have already moved
the bomb.

594
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:39,900
<i>The Park Service</i>

595
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:41,164
awarded a contract

596
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:43,545
to a construction company
to retrofit the dam.

597
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:45,203
It's been under
repair for a year.

598
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:47,251
And the president
of that company on paper?

599
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:49,011
Martin Bishop.

600
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:53,687
So Codex set up a dummy corp
to run the dam. But why?

601
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:56,358
I don't know,
but it has something to do with drilling.

602
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,515
Drilling. Wait,
what makes you say that?

603
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,644
Because at the same time

604
00:30:59,728 --> 00:31:01,547
Codex took over the dam,
they started buying up

605
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:03,758
a bunch of local,
heavy-duty drilling equipment.

606
00:31:04,147 --> 00:31:06,562
Riles, I need a USGS map

607
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:07,898
of Yellowstone.

608
00:31:09,257 --> 00:31:10,429
Right.

609
00:31:12,677 --> 00:31:13,868
Here you go.

610
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,263
Thanks.

611
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:19,435
I knew it. Okay, see there,
directly under the dam?

612
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,184
Mm-hmm.
- It's a side vent

613
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:22,615
to the volcano's
magma chamber.

614
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,002
It's a thousand feet
and some change down,

615
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:25,123
but it's right there.

616
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,942
They want to aim a nuke
at a river of lava?

617
00:31:27,027 --> 00:31:29,451
No, I think they're gonna blow
a hole where the dam is.

618
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,514
What they want is this river.
Massive amounts of water

619
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,600
flood into the hole
that they drilled,

620
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:34,829
right into the magma chamber.

621
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:36,288
Pressure builds, and boom.

622
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,028
Water triggers the
eruption. Thanks.

623
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:40,708
Good news is, I got a look
at the bomb. It's a B61.

624
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:42,731
- And you can disarm it?
- No chance.

625
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:44,651
But what I can do is
build a shaped charge

626
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,185
to interrupt the
chain reaction.

627
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,067
You want to blow up
a nuclear bomb?

628
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:50,569
Yup. But, hopefully,
we just get

629
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:52,053
a good old-fashioned,
run-of-the-mill explosion,

630
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:54,341
no nuke going off,
no mushroom cloud.

631
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:56,778
If I can find the
right materials, and

632
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:59,638
if we can find the nuke,
it should work.

633
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:02,052
I think. Follow me.

634
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,139
Well, if
you're sure.

635
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:34,639
No sign of the
nuke on these feeds.

636
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,921
Right. We'll cover more
ground searching if we split up.

637
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:38,967
Riley, you stay here,
keep watch.

638
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,154
Okay.

639
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:53,210
Hey, guys, I, uh, found some
of Codex's drilling equipment.

640
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,419
And, uh...

641
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,053
...everything I need
to finish my build.

642
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:02,381
<i>A nuclear explosion
is initiated</i>

643
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:04,801
<i>by a very precise
conventional explosion.</i>

644
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,240
<i>This pushes
the fusible material together</i>

645
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:08,443
<i>to start a chain reaction,</i>

646
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:12,186
<i>but if the material doesn't go
together in just the right way,</i>

647
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:14,064
<i>you might only get
a partial reaction</i>

648
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:16,482
<i>or even no nuclear explosion
at all.</i>

649
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,411
So how is...

650
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,967
whatever you're building
supposed to work?

651
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,686
Like a shotgun.

652
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:25,749
I'm gonna aim it directly at the
nuke, and it should interrupt

653
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:28,084
the chain reaction.
The time-delay fuse will

654
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:30,740
give us enough time to clear
the building before it goes off.

655
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,146
Hey, guys,

656
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:34,030
uh, something's happening.
Codex is bugging out.

657
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:35,631
- I don't know why.
- I do.

658
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:38,334
They're getting out of the blast zone.
They armed the nuke.

659
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:39,711
How do you know that?

660
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:42,296
Because I'm looking
right at it.

661
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,257
Right, coming at you, Mac.

662
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:47,842
Auntie Gwen, I presume.

663
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:50,295
Taylor, wait. Wait.

664
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:10,747
Dying just
ain't your thing, huh?

665
00:34:20,098 --> 00:34:21,836
You don't want to do this.

666
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:23,336
I don't want to shoot you...

667
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,249
but it's what has to be done.

668
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,328
That's what
you tell yourself, isn't it?

669
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:30,831
But I was wrong.

670
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,617
I saw the data, and

671
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:35,117
I lost hope that people
could change, that...

672
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:38,586
...that they could be better.

673
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:41,477
I know that Angus
showed you a better way.

674
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,195
He showed me, too.

675
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:45,055
He's my family.

676
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,531
I want to help him.

677
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,977
Killing me
doesn't stop this.

678
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:52,898
The only thing
that does that is helping Angus,

679
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:55,352
and you're not gonna
get to him in time.

680
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,340
- You all right?
- Yeah.

681
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,832
We have less than six minutes,
and it can't be disarmed.

682
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:35,135
I know.
That's not the plan.

683
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:39,395
Interrupt the
chain reaction.

684
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,898
Smart kid.

685
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,199
The time-delay fuse.

686
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:46,067
It must have broken
when he attacked me.

687
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:50,832
I'm gonna have
to set it off manually.

688
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:55,692
This is a one-way trip.

689
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:05,152
I need you guys to get

690
00:36:05,236 --> 00:36:07,154
as far away from here as
possible, as fast as you can.

691
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:09,115
The time delay won't work.
I'm gonna set it off myself.

692
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,599
- Mac!
- Don't think!

693
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:11,847
Just run.

694
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:13,908
Angus. Go.

695
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:17,688
I can do this.

696
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,060
What? No, I...

697
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,121
There's
no time. Let me do this.

698
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:23,375
Please.

699
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,244
For Ellen.

700
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:45,538
You connect this to, uh...

701
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:47,666
I know. I got it.

702
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,840
"You deserve the world.

703
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:01,268
And the world deserves you."

704
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:06,620
Go.

705
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,793
Run. Now!

706
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:10,378
Well done.

707
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,153
<i>We have a Nuclear
Emergency Support Team excavating</i>

708
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,340
the Dixon Dam site.

709
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:28,747
Although Gwen managed to stop
a full-scale nuclear explosion,

710
00:38:28,832 --> 00:38:31,488
we still need to sweep the area
for radiation.

711
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:33,025
Mac?

712
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,089
We're, uh...

713
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,939
We're sorry about your aunt.

714
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:39,332
Thanks.

715
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:44,144
So, what about Codex?

716
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:46,271
The bunker's empty.
Cleared out.

717
00:38:46,355 --> 00:38:48,732
Looks like Leland took the rest
of Codex into hiding.

718
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:50,359
We destroyed
their infrastructure

719
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:51,808
and their plan.

720
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:53,818
Oh.

721
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:55,839
Uh, one more thing.

722
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:57,532
Oh, bloody...

723
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,036
- Ow!
- Oh, bloody,

724
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:01,051
- Wanking...
- Is that supposed to be swearing?

725
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:02,787
No, no, it's all right.
No, no.

726
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:04,207
Thank you.

727
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:06,904
Your badges.

728
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:13,457
Welcome back to the Phoenix.

729
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:20,082
Hilarious.

730
00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:23,288
I'll get you new ones as soon
as possible. In the meantime,

731
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:28,247
I'm gonna be, uh, out of
action for a while, so, Mac,

732
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,910
you're going to have to
take over my duties, too.

733
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,793
There's a lot of work
to be done out there.

734
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,144
About that.

735
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:43,852
I think I know
just where to begin.

736
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,059
You ready for this?

737
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,735
Of course, yeah.
It'll be fine.

738
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,904
You're nervous.

739
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:20,300
I know you better
than you think.

740
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:22,864
Oh, yeah?
What am I thinking right now?

741
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:24,856
Third season of<i> Rick</i>
<i>and Morty</i> is the best,

742
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,455
you shouldn't have
had an espresso, and

743
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:28,900
you really want to fix that
broken light fixture over there.

744
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:33,332
It was Americano.

745
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,799
Ah.

746
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:39,223
Desi...

747
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:42,791
I... am...

748
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:45,221
Hey, let's not talk
about it, okay?

749
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:47,059
Yeah, right. Understood.

750
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,440
What I mean, egghead, is,

751
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,424
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

752
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:54,766
You can buy me a drink,
and we'll talk later.

753
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:56,908
You got it.

754
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:58,611
As long as I do
the drink ordering,

755
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:00,243
because your taste in
drinks is embarrassing.

756
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,307
It was one time.
I'd never seen a Bubblegum

757
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:03,533
Cosmotini Spritzer before.

758
00:41:03,618 --> 00:41:04,502
- I just wanted to try it out.
- You had two.

759
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,504
Hey, we're ready for you.

760
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:06,744
Yeah, of course.

761
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,549
- Uh...
- Yes.

762
00:41:13,134 --> 00:41:15,478
Thank you for joining us,
Mr. MacGyver.

763
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:17,481
We value your opinion.

764
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:19,267
Thank you very much.

765
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:24,766
But this is not
about opinions.

766
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,541
It's about science.

767
00:41:27,627 --> 00:41:30,352
Our planet is in trouble.

768
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,147
"Knowing isn't enough.

769
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:35,767
"We must apply.

770
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:37,358
"Being willing isn't enough.

771
00:41:37,443 --> 00:41:38,838
We must do."

772
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,306
Da Vinci said that.

773
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:45,408
And my mother.

Let's start with carbon pollution
due to fossil fuels.
