00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,784
What are you doing here?

3
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:26,752
Dreaming.

4
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,273
Well, welcome to paradise.

5
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,841
It's nice.

6
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:42,314
Paradise may be inhabited by nesting
animals and two years of dust.

7
00:08:42,348 --> 00:08:45,551
Well,
I'm not afraid of a little work.

8
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,186
It's why we're here, right?

9
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,821
Yeah.

10
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:50,956
It's nice.

11
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,858
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,003
Where's Josh?

13
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:09,475
<i>Josh...</i>

14
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:15,848
<i>Josh...</i>

15
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,922
Hey.
Are you coming in, bud?

16
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,030
I love how they look right onto the forest.

17
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:34,400
Makes it easier to see the bears
before they attack you.

18
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,874
Hey, Josh, you're in charge
of smores tonight.

19
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,476
Maybe later we'll get
the fire pit going, okay?

20
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:50,049
You remember where your room is?

21
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,216
This is my mom.

22
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:03,522
Oh, um,
she's very pretty, Josh.

23
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,278
Come here.

24
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,713
No.

25
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:30,616
I don't play.
I can dance...

26
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,455
- Okay.
- Yeah.

27
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,657
Okay, so we're
going to take this hand.

28
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,527
- Mm-hm.
- And put it right here.

29
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,295
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

30
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,665
Get ready, when I nod,
you press down, okay.

31
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,000
- Okay.
- So...

32
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,635
No, no.

33
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,303
That wasn't nodding.

34
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,572
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

35
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,113
Hey, I just want to say,

36
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:03,248
I'm so happy that...

37
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:04,349
Go have your own kid!

38
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:07,386
I'm so sorry.

39
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,555
He's killing me,
I'm going to go talk to him.

40
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,736
Um, no.

41
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,170
This is not a toy.

42
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,506
This stays downstairs,
okay, buddy?

43
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:37,216
Josh... you know Gail isn't
trying to replace Mom, right?

44
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:48,327
Okay.
Are you okay, by yourself?

45
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,095
You want me
to leave the light on?

46
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,032
- Josh?
- I'm not a baby.

47
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,300
Okay.

48
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,343
Goodnight.

49
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:28,166
It's kinda quiet, huh?

50
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,435
Peaceful, huh?

51
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:34,439
Well,
I was gonna say terrifying but...

52
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:46,351
You know, I just wanted to say

53
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:49,721
I know a lot
of women wouldn't...

54
00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:00,599
Thank you, for letting me
into your family.

55
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,067
Mm-hm.

56
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:07,105
<i>Josh... Josh... Josh...</i>

57
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:17,784
<i>Josh... Josh...</i>

58
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,652
<i>Josh...</i>

59
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,702
<i>Joshy?</i>

60
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,284
Joshy?

61
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:01,861
Hey, kiddo. It's me.

62
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:02,895
Mom?

63
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:07,265
Mom?

64
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:17,309
He's never had nightmares
before, not like this.

65
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:21,413
Mm... there is a theory
that suggests that we are

66
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:24,216
all the characters
in our dreams, so,

67
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:26,451
if Josh's mom is splitting,

68
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:31,423
then could be he's just leaving
behind past trauma, so...

69
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,392
Could be a really good thing.

70
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:38,363
If this is a good thing,
I don't want to know what a bad one is.

71
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,352
Hey!

72
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:03,555
Hey...

73
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,658
For some reason
this is the only place

74
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:09,394
you can get a single bar.

75
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,799
And... it's gone.

76
00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:15,768
Well, no news
is good news, right?

77
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,376
Well, he wants a new chorus

78
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:26,012
and he wants me
to make it more clever.

79
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:29,648
Alright, well, how about,
go and write your own song.

80
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:34,954
I'm staying here with my kid...
and my girlfriend. Hmm?

81
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:36,722
It's catchy but wordy.

82
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,427
Hey... we got you this.

83
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,329
It's just a present.

84
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:46,833
Josh helped me pick it out.

85
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,500
No, I didn't.

86
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,635
Thanks, Josh.

87
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,905
- I said, no, I didn't!
- Hey.

88
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:57,342
Look, I'm going to try
to make it back tonight.

89
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,946
But if I can't make it back,
are you two going to be okay?

90
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:03,015
We'll be fine... ish.

91
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:05,417
Ooh...

92
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,719
- See, now that's clever.
- Mm-hm.

93
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,255
We'll see you tonight.

94
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:42,387
It's okay, just forest sounds,
nothing to be afraid of.

95
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,056
How would you know?

96
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,458
Well, you're right actually.

97
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,829
Does Dad love you?

98
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,833
Well, I hope so.

99
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,835
It's not fair.

100
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:59,071
- What's not fair?
- She's dead and you're...

101
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:01,007
Go on. Why don't we...

102
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,944
Hey. Josh! Josh!

103
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:07,947
Hey! Hey!

104
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,683
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

105
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,418
Why'd you have to pick
our family?

106
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,888
Okay, this is not funny.
I'm going to count to three.

107
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:17,990
- Go have your own kid!
- Josh!

108
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:19,892
Oh, my God!

109
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:22,895
Oopsie.

110
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:28,100
Okay. Okay, that's...
that's not funny, get out.

111
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:30,368
Get up! Get up!

112
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,638
That is not funny!
Okay, do not do that again!

113
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:50,122
Hey, you know, I'm sorry
if I scared you before.

114
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:53,759
Josh, it's just
you really frightened me.

115
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,897
You can't take a joke.

116
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:13,712
Wow, this is pretty
awesome, huh?

117
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:18,084
Did you see
what happened to the trail?

118
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:22,487
Hey, Josh, maybe don't
go in there.

119
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,990
What does that say?

120
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,528
I don't know,
it looks like Dreamcatchers.

121
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:36,903
What's this?

122
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:40,438
I don't know,
some kind of crafty nonsense.

123
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:44,676
Well, we probably shouldn't be
here, this is somebody's place.

124
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:47,612
What do you think's in here?

125
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,181
- Tetanus?
- Nope.

126
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:52,184
There's no tetanus in here.

127
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:54,921
But lots of stuff for sale.

128
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:57,957
Some beautiful, some strange,

129
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,559
some a little bit scary,
some yummy.

130
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:05,197
Ms. Ruth's wild berry jam.

131
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:08,234
We're just looking for
the trail, actually.

132
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,568
Like what scary stuff?

133
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,839
Do I know you?

134
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:20,545
You got smart little jack rabbit
eyes, you a little jack rabbit?

135
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:23,515
My mom and dad used to
live around here.

136
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,117
My mom drowned in a pond.

137
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,554
We should probably go, Josh.

138
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:30,790
That was your mom?

139
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:37,595
Come on, we got spirit traps,
let me show ya.

140
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:41,000
Um, Josh, come on.

141
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,269
I'm not a baby.

142
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,037
No, you're not a baby.

143
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,539
And did you know
that the spirits

144
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:49,574
wander through these woods?

145
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:51,944
They like to linger
in old barns.

146
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,915
They visit you in your sleep.

147
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:57,817
In your dreams.

148
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,021
Do you have bad dreams?

149
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,090
Cause a spirit trap
will catch 'em!

150
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:07,659
Listen, shh.

151
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:10,262
Oh, my goodness!
They are in here right now!

152
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:11,931
They're trying
to tell you something.

153
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,934
Something very important.
They are saying,

154
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:20,006
"Buy Ms. Ruth's
Wild Berry Jam."

155
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,844
Ahh, come on.
I'm just playing with him.

156
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:26,746
Okay. Come on.

157
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,180
Trail picks up
right over there.

158
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:29,949
- Great, thank you.
- Yeah.

159
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:33,819
Hey, hey, hey!
Josh, is that your name?

160
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,553
See you around,
little jack rabbit.

161
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,273
Ms. Ruth was pretty cool.

162
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:57,575
Uh, well,
she's pretty something alright.

163
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,980
You don't believe that stuff
about spirit traps, do you?

164
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:02,782
You know that's nonsense.

165
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:06,852
She said they were real.
She said they catch your dreams.

166
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,788
You know how dreams work,
don't you?

167
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:10,222
Yeah, they scare
the shit out of you.

168
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:13,625
Hey, language.

169
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:18,197
Josh, dreams don't come
from out here, alright.

170
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,199
They come from in here.

171
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:23,769
It's just your mind's way
of figuring out stuff

172
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,204
that's going on in your life.

173
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:27,339
So if you're having
some bad dreams,

174
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:30,943
it means you're probably dealing
with some stuff that's difficult.

175
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:34,180
And you could talk about it.

176
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:37,016
You don't want to talk about it,
you could try drawing it up.

177
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,120
You know, if you can see it,
sometimes it makes it a little less scary.

178
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,623
Helps you understand it,

179
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,127
and maybe you can figure it out
in your real life.

180
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,330
- Does that make sense?
- I guess.

181
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:55,734
I want to tell you
something, this is a secret.

182
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:57,970
You're in control.

183
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,172
Okay, so when
you're falling asleep,

184
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,274
just think good thoughts
about your mom,

185
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:05,978
you know, think about some of
the good times that you guys had,

186
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,714
and I promise you,
it'll be better.

187
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:10,883
Okay?

188
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,653
- What did I say?
- I'm in control.

189
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:16,822
That's right.

190
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,024
Say it a little bit louder.

191
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:21,193
- I'm in control.
- Okay, scream it.

192
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:25,064
- I'm in control!
- Yes!

193
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,336
You are.
You're in control, Josh.

194
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:34,273
- Can I get a dreamcatcher?
- No way.

195
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:05,337
<i>You're looking at a man who's just
written 16 versions of the same chorus.</i>

196
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:08,407
Well, I'm not looking at him,
cause you're not here.

197
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,377
<i>Listen, I'm sorry. How's Josh?</i>

198
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,313
He's good. He's been talking about
Becky, which is good.

199
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:18,951
He's been expressing signs of
anger, so at least we're talking.

200
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:21,320
It's raw, but I actually
think it's good.

201
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:26,325
Luke? Luke...

202
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,042
<i>If you guys
want to come back to the city</i>

203
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:45,344
- <i>I can arrange for a car...</i>
- No, what I'm saying is

204
00:24:45,377 --> 00:24:47,146
I think it's good
if we stay here.

205
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,447
I think it's good for him.

206
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,224
Luke, can you tell me again,
how Becky drowned?

207
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:07,499
Joshy.

208
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:13,939
Hey, kiddo. I've come
to take you home with me.

209
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:18,310
<i>I told you, she was swimming
and her heart just stopped.</i>

210
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:20,512
- <i>Why does it matter?</i>
- Well, it's just something

211
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:24,016
that your neighbor Ruth said,
or maybe it's the way she said it.

212
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:26,151
<i>Oh, fuck, not Ruth.</i>

213
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:28,220
<i>Just do me a favor,
stay away from her.</i>

214
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:29,455
Don't be afraid.

215
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:32,458
I'm your mommy.

216
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:38,130
<i>Seriously, do not talk to...</i>

217
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:41,233
- <i>Gail... Gail...</i>
- Hello?

218
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:43,269
Luke?

219
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:14,166
Hey. Hey, Josh.

220
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,602
Hey, wake up.
Wake up, buddy.

221
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:20,539
Hey, hey. Hey.
It's okay.

222
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,909
It's just a bad dream.

223
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:27,112
Just a dream.

224
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:28,514
You okay?

225
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:44,930
You know it's okay
to be scared, don't you?

226
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,032
Hm?

227
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:06,051
Josh?

228
00:27:09,655 --> 00:27:10,656
Josh?

229
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:45,557
Hey, what are you doing here,
little jack rabbit?

230
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,430
Just trying to find
some spirit traps.

231
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:54,933
Maybe you better go home.

232
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,670
You come back
with the lady you were with.

233
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:01,440
Tell her Ms. Ruth
accepts cash only.

234
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,344
Will you please help me?

235
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,548
Are you okay?

236
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:12,651
Do all these catch bad dreams?

237
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:18,023
Uh, some do,
some catch evil spirits.

238
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:21,093
Some catch bad energy.
Some catch dreams.

239
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,730
Gail says we control
our own dreams.

240
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:26,733
She says all this stuff
is nonsense.

241
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:28,735
She does, does she?

242
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:32,404
She's a child psychologist.
She knows stuff like that.

243
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:36,141
- Yeah.
- Anyways, that's why she's trying to fix me.

244
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:43,449
- Are you broken?
- Sometimes.

245
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:48,120
You know what,
sometimes we're all broken.

246
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,591
Take off this pack.

247
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:54,460
Sit yourself down.

248
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:56,228
Here, put these on.

249
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:59,364
I'm going to show you
how to fix some stuff.

250
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,411
So, we use this,
then I won't hurt my fingers,

251
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:14,713
and I probably won't need to
wear gloves when I do it.

252
00:29:14,747 --> 00:29:17,583
Great job!
I betcha this one will sell.

253
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:19,351
What do you think?

254
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:22,154
Why'd you scratch out
the dreamcatchers on your sign?

255
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:27,659
Well, I don't make
dreamcatchers anymore.

256
00:29:27,693 --> 00:29:29,528
Just spirit traps...

257
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,396
Hey, Josh,

258
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,531
what are you doing here?

259
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,566
Can we please get one?

260
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,503
Okay, wait outside.

261
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,740
Go on.

262
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,112
Well, your little friend
sure wants something.

263
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:52,819
You know,
some people might find

264
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:56,355
this kind of thing offensive.

265
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:58,257
Misappropriating
other people's cultures.

266
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,360
Excuse me,
nobody's got the market cornered

267
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:03,195
on protecting themselves
from evil.

268
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:06,698
You know, all cultures
have a way to trap bad things.

269
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:10,602
This is called a Ojos de Dios.

270
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:14,406
Here's one from Scotland.
It's called a Rowan cross.

271
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:19,578
And I have a book to show you.
I know you like books.

272
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:23,448
People always find a way
to ward off what scares them.

273
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:26,184
And don't touch anything,
please.

274
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:29,388
Yeah...

275
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:13,358
You are nosy, aren't you?
Do you mind putting that back?

276
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:21,366
Is Noah your son?

277
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,268
Was my grandson.

278
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:26,873
He's dead, they're all dead!
Just like Josh's mother.

279
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,777
Josh's dad told me
about the accident.

280
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,178
Oh, is that what he called it?

281
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:35,614
Get out.

282
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:47,292
Never come back here again,
got it?

283
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:58,270
Alright.

284
00:32:58,303 --> 00:33:00,272
Are you okay with the light out?

285
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:04,710
Shut my door.

286
00:33:57,395 --> 00:34:03,002
Once upon a time, there was
a knight named Sir Josh,

287
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,536
and he had a sword.

288
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:08,507
Shh... shh... it's okay honey.

289
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,010
- It's okay now.
- No, no, no, no, no.

290
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:13,846
It always starts like this and
then it turns into a nightmare.

291
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,580
- No...
- And then you get all scary and...

292
00:34:15,614 --> 00:34:19,852
No, I'm not a nightmare,
not anymore.

293
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:24,723
Shh. Now that you have the
dreamcatcher, I can come home.

294
00:34:24,757 --> 00:34:25,992
Are you really here?

295
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:30,797
Not yet.
I'm just up here.

296
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:34,934
I'm not strong enough yet.

297
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,836
Are you hungry?
I'll go...

298
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,570
I'll just eat you.

299
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,929
Dad promised he'd be home.

300
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:05,932
Well, I know
he'll be back as soon as he can.

301
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:11,003
We could go hiking again.

302
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,673
Hiking's just walking.

303
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,512
How'd you sleep?

304
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,052
I saw my mom...
in my dream.

305
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:30,890
She read me a story.

306
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,529
I'm hungry.

307
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,968
Hey, I make a mean pancake.

308
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,141
So when you dreamed about your
mom last night, how was she?

309
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:50,743
She was normal.

310
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,012
She was pretty.

311
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,413
She was happy.

312
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:02,855
You know, I don't think
there's any pancake mix in here.

313
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,857
I mean,
there's a little mouse poop.

314
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:07,827
Ow! Ow...

315
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:11,998
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

316
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:14,767
- Leave this door open.
- I didn't do anything.

317
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,535
- Josh.
- I said I didn't do anything!

318
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,805
Hey, hey, hey, come back.

319
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,508
Josh, come on, let's...
let's do something fun.

320
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:05,550
Well, this is fun.

321
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,920
Dad says not to talk
while fishing.

322
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:11,456
My mom died here.

323
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:14,727
Who told you that?

324
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,995
My mom.

325
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,997
What do you mean?

326
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,732
In my dream.

327
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:22,802
She said that she was sorry
that she had to leave.

328
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:24,770
But she said
when she comes back,

329
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:27,639
she'll never ever
leave me again.

330
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:33,545
Do you want to talk about it?

331
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:36,215
It's like I know
she's always with me.

332
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:39,885
But I just feel different.

333
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,519
Is that normal?

334
00:37:44,824 --> 00:37:47,659
It's more than normal.

335
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:51,030
It's very healthy
and grown up.

336
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:54,800
You don't have to do that.

337
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:57,236
Do what?

338
00:37:58,304 --> 00:38:00,139
Act all cheerleadery.

339
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:03,876
Like you're my mom.
I don't need a mom.

340
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:08,080
Like I said, she'll always
be in here with me.

341
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:11,616
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Ow! Ow!

342
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:13,119
I'm sorry!

343
00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:16,688
Stop! Let's just pause
for a minute, okay.

344
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:18,623
Ow...

345
00:38:18,656 --> 00:38:20,259
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

346
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:23,062
Alright...

347
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:26,999
Does it hurt?

348
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:33,773
I'm sorry I hooked you.

349
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:36,042
That's okay, sweetie,
you didn't mean it.

350
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:41,713
That's good.
Ooh, thank you.

351
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:08,334
Look, this is not a joke,
mis...

352
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,459
Okay, bed time.
Turn it off.

353
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:09,261
When's Dad coming?

354
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:13,332
Josh, it's been a long day,
please just turn it off.

355
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:23,475
Why would you do that
with the photos?

356
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:26,078
- Do what?
- Don't lie to me, okay.

357
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,813
I swear, I didn't do anything.

358
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:29,448
Come on,
I thought we were friends.

359
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,716
I didn't do anything!

360
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:36,355
Door!

361
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:07,353
Josh, I said no iPad!

362
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:31,810
Josh... hey.

363
00:43:09,581 --> 00:43:12,351
Dad said Gail loves me.

364
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:19,124
<i>She wants to kill you.</i>

365
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:20,959
She does?

366
00:43:22,628 --> 00:43:25,164
<i>Honey, do you love me?</i>

367
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:27,032
Yes.

368
00:43:28,434 --> 00:43:30,502
<i>Don't you want to see me again?</i>

369
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:33,305
Yes.

370
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:37,443
When are you coming back...
for good?

371
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:39,878
<i>I'm not strong enough yet.</i>

372
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,081
<i>So I need you to help me.</i>

373
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,353
<i>You need to stop her.</i>

374
00:43:47,386 --> 00:43:50,255
But she's
nice, she took me fishing.

375
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:53,359
<i>You can only love one of us.</i>

376
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:55,461
<i>Those are
just the rules, Joshy.</i>

377
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:09,074
<i>Gail, I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.</i>

378
00:44:09,108 --> 00:44:10,676
<i>They're making me
stay another night.</i>

379
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:13,112
I'm telling you I'm just going
to walk right out of here.

380
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:27,326
How are you feeling?

381
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,596
Hmm?

382
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:34,266
I think it's going to rain later,
so it's probably an inside day.

383
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:38,170
You alright?

384
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:39,405
It's okay, don't move,

385
00:44:39,438 --> 00:44:41,106
I'll... I'll clean it up.

386
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,908
Don't walk on this.

387
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:54,686
Sorry, I just...
I'm so tired.

388
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:57,956
Whatcha been doing
this morning?

389
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,995
Just doing the pictures
like you told me.

390
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:04,363
Oh...

391
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:08,500
So, tell me, what's this?

392
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:11,069
That's Daddy, that's Mommy,
and that's me.

393
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:13,505
Oh, what's this one?

394
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:15,707
- This one?
- Yeah.

395
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:19,111
- That's you.
- Who's this?

396
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,047
That's your dead baby.

397
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:28,387
Just my mind
working through things.

398
00:45:30,155 --> 00:45:35,327
Um... I'm just going to go
get your sneakers, okay,

399
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,129
so don't move.

400
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:50,542
Mm, just can't find that extra
pink piece for this.

401
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:52,711
Does this one go there?

402
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,316
Mm... no.

403
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:01,253
You okay?

404
00:46:01,286 --> 00:46:03,489
Just a little bit tired.

405
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:09,261
Me too.

406
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:25,577
Me and my mom used to do this.

407
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:47,499
You alright?

408
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:53,071
Yeah. I think I need to go
upstairs to bed.

409
00:48:15,888 --> 00:48:17,289
Okay, Mommy.

410
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:54,593
Josh!

411
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:01,299
Josh!

412
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:04,737
Josh! Hey, Josh!

413
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:09,942
Josh!

414
00:49:11,744 --> 00:49:13,880
Sweetie?
Hey, hey, hey...

415
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:15,982
I saw my mommy!
She was killed!

416
00:49:16,015 --> 00:49:18,383
Hey, Josh.

417
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,519
Sweetie. Josh!

418
00:49:20,552 --> 00:49:24,891
Josh. Hey, hey, Josh! Josh.

419
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:27,994
Hey, you're dreaming.

420
00:49:28,027 --> 00:49:31,596
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm right here.

421
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,434
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

422
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:38,738
It's okay. It's okay.

423
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:46,371
Oh, my God!

424
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:54,981
Hey, how you doing?

425
00:50:55,815 --> 00:50:57,415
I'm in control.

426
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,684
Yeah, you are.

427
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:03,756
There's honey in here.

428
00:51:06,058 --> 00:51:07,093
Ruth?

429
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:08,728
Where is it?

430
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:09,962
- No, don't go!
- Hey! What?

431
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:11,429
- No, don't go!
- Hey, hey, hey,

432
00:51:11,463 --> 00:51:12,865
you can't just come
running in here.

433
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:14,633
No, he broke into my barn
and he took something!

434
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:15,968
- Josh?
- Josh!

435
00:51:22,574 --> 00:51:24,309
Don't go away again, Mommy!

436
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:29,381
Okay, Josh, did you take
something from Ms. Ruth's barn?

437
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,350
Okay, you need to give it back.

438
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:33,820
No, no!
I don't want it back.

439
00:51:33,853 --> 00:51:35,654
But you need to listen.

440
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:37,890
It was safe where it was,
but not anymore.

441
00:51:37,924 --> 00:51:39,959
You let it out,
and now you're both in danger.

442
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:42,028
You need to destroy it now!

443
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:48,433
I don't need it anymore.

444
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,971
You, stay here.

445
00:51:56,641 --> 00:51:58,577
Just tell me,
what happened to your family?

446
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,080
What happened to Becky,
what happened to Noah?

447
00:52:01,113 --> 00:52:03,481
- Just tell me.
- You're not hearing me, just...

448
00:52:03,515 --> 00:52:05,918
just throw it into the fire.
Burn it!

449
00:52:05,952 --> 00:52:08,587
Okay, fine!
I'll throw it in the fire.

450
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:18,965
Little Noah...

451
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:24,871
He was just
a regular little guy.

452
00:52:24,904 --> 00:52:28,174
He was smart, funny.

453
00:52:28,207 --> 00:52:32,144
Was a little bit quirky,
he liked odd things.

454
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:35,982
He had a collection that
he called his "special stuff"

455
00:52:36,015 --> 00:52:39,551
that had dead animal fur,

456
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:43,455
bones, dead bugs.

457
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:47,994
His father would say,
"Get rid of that junk!

458
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:52,697
Normal boys play sports
and they have friends."

459
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:58,004
I was his friend.

460
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:07,146
<i>It was Christmas,
and I wanted to find the perfect present,</i>

461
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:10,615
<i>and there was a yard sale
down the street,</i>

462
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:13,052
<i>and I found that thing.</i>

463
00:53:15,087 --> 00:53:19,658
<i>This crazy woman said to me,
"Whoever hangs it in their room</i>

464
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:23,561
<i>will be protected
from evil forever."</i>

465
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:27,499
<i>I thought, the perfect present.</i>

466
00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:30,903
Boy, was I wrong.

467
00:53:32,972 --> 00:53:34,941
Protect him from evil?

468
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,577
It was pure evil.

469
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,681
It devoured him,

470
00:53:42,714 --> 00:53:48,087
and then one day he followed
his parents into the woods,

471
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,793
and this little boy
hacked them to death.

472
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:57,529
<i>Came upon them
all hacked to pieces.</i>

473
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:01,834
<i>Except for Noah.</i>

474
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,502
<i>Suddenly, he... he just
leapt at me like a wild animal,</i>

475
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:07,873
<i>and he was waving this axe,
screaming at the top of his lungs.</i>

476
00:54:07,907 --> 00:54:10,709
<i>Make it get out!
Make it get out!</i>

477
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:17,149
And then he killed Josh's mom.

478
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:42,908
Once upon a time,
there was a boy named Josh,

479
00:54:42,942 --> 00:54:45,643
and he had a hatchet.

480
00:54:45,677 --> 00:54:47,880
As a psychotherapist,
I can tell you

481
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:51,951
that kids have issues, alright.

482
00:54:51,984 --> 00:54:54,253
And using science,

483
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:59,191
we just need to treat them
with therapy or with medicine,

484
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:02,862
and this voodoo bullshit
it doesn't help.

485
00:55:02,895 --> 00:55:04,230
It doesn't help anyone.

486
00:55:06,232 --> 00:55:09,035
And I'm just suggesting
that you just drop it.

487
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,607
Gail, help, I can't move!

488
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,077
Shh!

489
00:56:06,724 --> 00:56:08,828
Sorry.
Hey.

490
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:15,367
How could you just
leave us here?

491
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:18,003
I had to go to the city.

492
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:24,176
Why didn't you tell me
Becky was killed?

493
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:26,378
What are you talking about?

494
00:56:26,412 --> 00:56:28,314
I read an article, okay.

495
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:33,953
I don't... I don't like
thinking about that.

496
00:56:33,986 --> 00:56:35,287
Okay, well that's something

497
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:37,022
that you might
want to mention, alright.

498
00:56:37,056 --> 00:56:40,226
Yeah, I... I know.
I'm sorry, I should have told you.

499
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:43,628
Hey, hey, buddy!
I missed you.

500
00:56:45,297 --> 00:56:48,801
Uh, listen, Gail and I,
we have to talk for a minute,

501
00:56:48,834 --> 00:56:52,371
so, can you go in the kitchen and fix
me something to eat? I'm so hungry.

502
00:56:52,404 --> 00:56:53,873
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

503
00:56:58,477 --> 00:57:01,313
How was it, how's he been?

504
00:57:01,347 --> 00:57:04,049
Uh, not good.

505
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,384
He's been sleepwalking.

506
00:57:08,254 --> 00:57:10,422
Do you guys want some pie?!

507
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:12,458
Uh, yeah, buddy.

508
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:15,327
- Sleepwalk?
- Yeah, that's the least of his problems.

509
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:17,329
He left the cupboard door
open on purpose

510
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:19,999
so he could hit me
on the back of the head.

511
00:57:20,032 --> 00:57:22,935
He hooked me
with a fishing hook.

512
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:25,437
Well, I'm... I'm sorry
you had a couple of accidents.

513
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:28,440
It's not accidents.
I mean, I'm napping, I wake up,

514
00:57:28,474 --> 00:57:31,343
and I am covered
in a sea of Becky photos.

515
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:34,313
- I don't understand.
- He slashes the scarf that you gave me.

516
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:37,316
He breaks into Ruth's barn.
She comes here...

517
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:39,451
I... I told you
to stay away from her.

518
00:57:39,485 --> 00:57:42,288
And... and kids
pull pranks all the time.

519
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:46,492
When I was a kid, I... I pulled
pranks, I shoplifted once on a dare.

520
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:49,228
- This is not a prank.
- And I've slept walked before.

521
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:50,963
Here, actually.

522
00:57:50,996 --> 00:57:52,965
I woke up in the...
in the fucking woods.

523
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:54,934
Do you want me
to show you the scarf?

524
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:56,835
I don't need to see the scarf!

525
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:59,405
I just want to have a weekend,
with my son

526
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:02,474
with some quality time,
that's nice, where I can relax!

527
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:04,376
I understand.
What about me?

528
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:13,319
Oh, thanks, buddy.

529
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,487
Thank you, Josh.

530
00:58:17,856 --> 00:58:19,758
Can we go fishing tomorrow?

531
00:58:20,326 --> 00:58:21,961
Yeah, we'll see.

532
00:58:25,965 --> 00:58:29,235
Mmm, this is
pretty good pie, Joshy.

533
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:36,108
Well, I'm glad you like it,
'cause it's pretty much all we have left.

534
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:40,846
I'm sorry. It's just...

535
00:58:40,879 --> 00:58:43,215
It's just we've had a few
misadventures, haven't we, Josh?

536
00:58:45,284 --> 00:58:46,452
Haven't we?

537
00:58:52,391 --> 00:58:54,026
Are you okay?

538
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:55,261
Jesus Christ!

539
00:58:56,462 --> 00:58:58,297
- Did you do this!
- I didn't.

540
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,299
- Gail, come on.
- Answer me!

541
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:02,568
- I didn't.
- You tell me the truth.

542
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:04,103
Gail, for God's sake!

543
00:59:04,136 --> 00:59:06,305
I said I didn't!
She hates me!

544
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:09,074
Okay, we're so out of here.
Tonight!

545
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:28,894
Josh... did Gail tell you
about the pond?

546
00:59:29,595 --> 00:59:31,030
About mom?

547
00:59:31,063 --> 00:59:32,164
No.

548
00:59:32,965 --> 00:59:34,066
Josh?

549
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:37,936
I don't want to
get her in trouble.

550
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,406
Goddamnit.

551
00:59:40,439 --> 00:59:43,542
Dad, I didn't do the thing
with the broken glass.

552
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:46,245
I... I know you didn't, Joshy.

553
00:59:46,278 --> 00:59:53,319
Gail, she's just, uh...
She's just confused about a lot of things.

554
00:59:53,352 --> 00:59:55,921
She told me
not to dream about mom.

555
00:59:55,954 --> 00:59:57,056
What?

556
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:00,292
Said it was unhealthy.

557
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:02,428
And it showed
a sign of weakness.

558
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:08,200
You just get some sleep, pal.

559
01:00:20,646 --> 01:00:25,184
Josh needs help, Luke.
More than I can give him.

560
01:00:25,217 --> 01:00:27,619
Wait, do you...
you really think

561
01:00:27,653 --> 01:00:29,455
that he did this
to you on purpose?

562
01:00:29,488 --> 01:00:31,256
He broke a glass the other day,

563
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:34,059
he probably took the glass
out of the trash.

564
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:36,528
Yeah, what's... what's this?
Huh?

565
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:41,934
And you told him
not to dream about Becky?

566
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:44,036
No, I didn't tell him that.

567
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:45,637
Joshy said that you did.

568
01:00:45,671 --> 01:00:47,439
Joshy says that I did.
You're going to take

569
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:50,309
a child's word over mine?
'Cause I am telling you,

570
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:52,911
I'm telling you, professionally,
he needs help.

571
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:55,047
Kids have bad dreams.

572
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,417
Maybe he needs to spend
more quality time with me.

573
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,520
This is based on your years of experience
working with troubled children?

574
01:01:01,553 --> 01:01:03,589
Based on the fact
that he's my own goddamn son.

575
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:06,058
I'm telling you,
he's traumatized!

576
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:09,161
He's experiencing
latent violent tendencies,

577
01:01:09,194 --> 01:01:11,964
and you've got us
stuck here in this house

578
01:01:11,997 --> 01:01:14,600
where his mother was killed!
Are you fucking nuts?!

579
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:16,335
No, he's not troubled!

580
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:19,304
He's confused,
he's six years old.

581
01:01:19,338 --> 01:01:21,373
Oh, Jesus Christ,
he's not six.

582
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:24,176
- Yeah.
- No, he's not.

583
01:01:24,209 --> 01:01:26,545
No, I mean, I know...
I know he's not six.

584
01:01:26,578 --> 01:01:28,313
Because you would
like him to be six.

585
01:01:28,347 --> 01:01:29,681
No, no, no, no.
No, don't do this.

586
01:01:29,715 --> 01:01:31,250
Yeah. You would
like him to be six...

587
01:01:31,283 --> 01:01:32,985
Don't do this psychoanalytical
bullshit on me.

588
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:34,086
...because then he could
still be your little Joshy,

589
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:35,320
and Becky would still be alive.

590
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:37,055
I get it. I get it.

591
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:39,091
And we need to get
the fuck out of here.

592
01:01:39,124 --> 01:01:40,392
I'm not kidding!

593
01:02:08,755 --> 01:02:10,222
Honey...

594
01:02:11,657 --> 01:02:12,958
It's time.

595
01:02:15,627 --> 01:02:16,962
She's ready.

596
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:46,625
Go on.

597
01:02:46,658 --> 01:02:49,461
- I don't want to.
- She took my place.

598
01:02:49,495 --> 01:02:52,498
- Hey, you said you hated her.
- I don't, not really.

599
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:54,734
It's easy. Watch.

600
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:07,112
Why'd you do that?!

601
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:12,785
I didn't. You did.

602
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:14,253
No!

603
01:03:21,226 --> 01:03:22,528
Hi, Gail.

604
01:03:37,844 --> 01:03:39,378
Luke?

605
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:42,114
Luke?

606
01:03:58,865 --> 01:04:01,099
Hey, Luke.

607
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:02,701
What's going on?

608
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,704
What is this?

609
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:07,406
I was letting you sleep in.

610
01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:09,474
Because we're getting
on the road, right?

611
01:04:09,508 --> 01:04:11,510
Babe, he's fine.
You're fine, right?

612
01:04:11,543 --> 01:04:14,112
Dad's going to teach me
how to chop some wood.

613
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:15,848
We'll be careful,
we've got snacks.

614
01:04:15,882 --> 01:04:17,482
Listen, I want to
get out of here.

615
01:04:17,516 --> 01:04:19,551
As soon as we get reception,
I'm calling Dr. Fisher.

616
01:04:19,585 --> 01:04:23,288
I am going to spend
some time with my son.

617
01:04:25,257 --> 01:04:29,127
Twenty minutes,
and then we're out of here.

618
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:30,830
Are we going to chop
some wood now?

619
01:04:30,863 --> 01:04:33,833
Yeah, Josh, we're going to chop
the hell out of some wood now.

620
01:05:28,955 --> 01:05:32,190
- My turn.
- No, hey... Slow down.

621
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,693
Safety first. Come here.

622
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:36,896
Put both hands on it.

623
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:40,532
Okay.
Just little swings.

624
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:44,536
Nice and easy.
There you go. Okay?

625
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:48,306
There you go.

626
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,877
Nice and easy.
Good.

627
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:05,858
Now, Josh,
I said to use both hands, son.

628
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:14,332
Hey, Josh, I said...
I said use both hands.

629
01:06:14,366 --> 01:06:16,601
Why didn't you tell me
how Mom died?

630
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:19,739
- Okay...
- A little boy killed her.

631
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:21,506
Hand that over.

632
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,276
Okay, Josh, that's enough.

633
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:25,610
You give me that.

634
01:06:26,645 --> 01:06:28,848
Damn it!
Put that down, now!

635
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:31,683
He threw her body into a pond.

636
01:06:31,717 --> 01:06:35,822
Just a boy.
A boy like me.

637
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:40,026
Once upon a
time, there was a boy named Josh,

638
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:42,227
and he had a hatchet.

639
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:14,459
Where's your Dad?

640
01:07:27,672 --> 01:07:28,975
What's this?

641
01:07:46,993 --> 01:07:48,393
Josh...

642
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:51,530
Josh!

643
01:07:51,563 --> 01:07:53,365
Put that down!

644
01:07:53,398 --> 01:07:54,867
Josh!

645
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:57,737
Josh!

646
01:08:00,705 --> 01:08:02,875
Okay...

647
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:05,710
Remember... Can you remember
what we talked about?

648
01:08:05,745 --> 01:08:07,612
Okay, losing control?

649
01:08:12,584 --> 01:08:13,618
Josh?

650
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:30,468
No!

651
01:08:32,738 --> 01:08:35,875
No!

652
01:08:40,512 --> 01:08:44,116
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

653
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,752
What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

654
01:09:35,968 --> 01:09:37,602
What are you doing?

655
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:40,006
Don't interrupt me.
It's for our own good.

656
01:09:43,743 --> 01:09:45,644
- Josh.
- Josh is dead.

657
01:09:45,677 --> 01:09:48,881
Josh, wake up.
Wake up, buddy.

658
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,720
Josh! Your dad's coming back and
we're going to get out of here.

659
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:57,123
I don't think Daddy's coming.

660
01:09:57,156 --> 01:10:00,092
What are you talking about?

661
01:10:00,126 --> 01:10:02,694
<i>Daddy
wasn't safe with the hatchet.</i>

662
01:10:04,897 --> 01:10:06,531
It's not Josh.

663
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,502
It's this!

664
01:10:10,535 --> 01:10:13,839
It can't be destroyed,
there's something that is living in there.

665
01:10:13,873 --> 01:10:15,775
It is indestructible.

666
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:18,077
Josh. Josh!

667
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:25,751
I saw it.

668
01:10:25,785 --> 01:10:27,787
I saw it last night
in my sleep.

669
01:10:29,822 --> 01:10:31,757
And it was a woman.

670
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,226
A miserable hag.

671
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,529
Okay. Okay, Ruth.

672
01:10:37,562 --> 01:10:39,631
Now you can't possibly
believe this.

673
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:43,202
She has Noah's soul for
eternity, but now she has Josh.

674
01:10:44,804 --> 01:10:46,705
We have to kill him, Gail.

675
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:49,641
You have to kill him.

676
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:51,944
Or he's going to kill you.

677
01:10:51,978 --> 01:10:53,212
He's going to kill me.

678
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:55,181
He's going to kill
everybody around us,

679
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:58,550
and the evil is just going to
keep coming and coming and coming!

680
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:02,154
I understand. I understand.

681
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:05,157
I'm going to help you, alright.

682
01:11:05,191 --> 01:11:08,660
But I can't help you,
unless you untie me.

683
01:11:09,694 --> 01:11:10,763
What's happening?

684
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:14,233
Get away, I'm not going back in!

685
01:11:14,266 --> 01:11:15,267
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

686
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:17,803
Where is he?!
Where is he?

687
01:11:17,837 --> 01:11:19,671
Is he in there?
You know where he is.

688
01:11:19,704 --> 01:11:21,606
Is my Noah in there?
Is he in pain?

689
01:11:21,639 --> 01:11:25,277
Of course, he's in pain, can't you
see he's sick?! He needs a doctor!

690
01:11:25,311 --> 01:11:27,612
You think I'm trapped in that?

691
01:11:27,645 --> 01:11:29,749
That's my home,
we all live in there.

692
01:11:29,782 --> 01:11:32,051
- Waiting...
- Waiting for what?

693
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:35,620
For a place to play.
But we got Noah.

694
01:11:35,653 --> 01:11:38,190
What fun we had with him.

695
01:11:38,224 --> 01:11:41,227
You let him go!
Don't you hurt him anymore!

696
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,694
Fight it!

697
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:47,199
Gail. Gail, what's happening?

698
01:11:49,068 --> 01:11:51,904
I don't know.
I don't know, Joshy.

699
01:11:51,937 --> 01:11:55,908
But I'm here.
I'm right here with you, okay.

700
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:59,311
- Josh, is Noah in there?
- Just stop it!

701
01:11:59,345 --> 01:12:03,149
For God's sake!
What do you want?!

702
01:12:03,182 --> 01:12:05,918
It's not what I want, it's...
it's what that wants.

703
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:07,585
Little boys just don't
become monsters.

704
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:10,356
Oh, but they do...
they do, Ruth.

705
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:13,192
And I'm sorry, I don't know
what happened to Noah.

706
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:14,960
She knows what happened.

707
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:23,235
Noah?

708
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:26,704
At first it kinda tickles
when they're inside you.

709
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,707
But then they start eating you.

710
01:12:30,876 --> 01:12:32,745
It hurts so much.

711
01:12:32,778 --> 01:12:36,681
But when you let them play,
they don't feed on you.

712
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:39,151
It's why they need us.

713
01:12:41,253 --> 01:12:43,022
You figured that much out.

714
01:12:49,395 --> 01:12:52,064
I did. I did.

715
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,205
<i>Just when I thought that
my life was over he stopped.</i>

716
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:02,041
<i>I thought he was
going to hug me.</i>

717
01:13:02,074 --> 01:13:06,644
<i>But instead, he grabbed my wrist
and put the axe in my hand,</i>

718
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:10,682
<i>drew it across his own throat.</i>

719
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:12,684
<i>I watched him die, Gail.</i>

720
01:13:12,717 --> 01:13:14,887
I killed my own grandson.

721
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:20,993
I miss your hugs.

722
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:22,828
Do you mean it, sweetheart?

723
01:13:22,862 --> 01:13:24,864
God, I've missed you so much.

724
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:33,973
Josh! Sweetie, wake up!

725
01:13:34,006 --> 01:13:35,040
Oh...

726
01:13:42,414 --> 01:13:43,749
Holy fuck.

727
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,185
Josh. Josh.

728
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:47,853
You're in control, Josh!

729
01:13:47,887 --> 01:13:50,289
Stop! Please!

730
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:53,859
Josh, no!

731
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:03,302
Josh, stop.

732
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:05,137
Josh is dead!

733
01:14:08,207 --> 01:14:11,243
Sweetie... you're in control.

734
01:14:12,044 --> 01:14:14,480
Say it. Say it!

735
01:14:14,513 --> 01:14:16,749
I'm in control.

736
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:21,153
No, no... No, Joshy,
there's someone else inside of you.

737
01:14:21,187 --> 01:14:23,389
There's someone very sweet.

738
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:25,858
Somebody who your Daddy loves.

739
01:14:25,891 --> 01:14:30,329
Remember? Remember how much you
love your daddy and your mommy?

740
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:32,231
Sweetheart, they love you.

741
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:35,267
They love you so much.
I love you.

742
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:37,169
I love you! I love you!

743
01:14:37,203 --> 01:14:39,271
I just wanted to be your mommy!

744
01:14:40,406 --> 01:14:42,007
Mommy?

745
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:43,842
Mommy?

746
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:38,123
Hey, kid.

747
01:16:39,658 --> 01:16:41,160
You alright?

748
01:16:46,598 --> 01:16:49,134
Yeah, just a little tired.

749
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:45,255
