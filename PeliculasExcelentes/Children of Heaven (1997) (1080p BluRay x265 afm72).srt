That'll be 30 Toumans. Thank you.

00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,428
Here is your change.

12
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,976
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Good-bye.

13
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,105
Salt, salt for trade!

14
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,987
Hello, Akbar Aqa.
I need some potatoes.

15
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,496
Not those, kid.
Pick some down there.

16
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,180
Hello. How are you?

17
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,182
With your permission.

18
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,495
Good-bye.

19
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,139
- Sixty-five Toumans.
- My mom said to put it on our tab.

20
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,600
Tell her your account
has reached its limit.

21
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:30,144
She should come and pay
at least part of it.

22
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:32,229
All right.

23
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,383
What the hell are you doing?

24
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:05,596
Why did you spill these?
Are you crazy?

25
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:09,308
- My sister's shoes disappeared.
- Get lost. Beat it.

26
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:13,020
- I left my sister's shoes here.
- I said get lost.

27
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,113
What? You're still here?

28
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,589
You don't pay rent.

29
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,885
With all the water you use,
the yard will collapse!

30
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,054
What can I do?
The laundry is dirty!

31
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,473
I don't give a damn
if the laundry is dirty!

32
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,600
Don't you ever do your wash?

33
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,602
Why don't you wash
all the neighbors' carpets...

34
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,480
while you're at it?

35
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,861
But don't you ever
wash your clothes?

36
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,030
You damn people
are going to ruin me!

37
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,616
You haven't paid rent in five months.

38
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,743
Why do you pour so much water?

39
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,996
Don't you ever wash your clothes
during the year?

40
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:14,039
This is the last time,
I'm warning you!

41
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:18,836
Why don't you come here when
there are men to put you in your place?

42
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:23,924
Ali.

43
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,511
Tell Zahra to peel the potatoes
after she puts the baby to sleep.

44
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,243
Ali, did you get my shoes?

45
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,747
Mom said to peel the potatoes
if the baby is asleep.

46
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,249
- I said, did you get my shoes?
- Yes.

47
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,585
- Has he repaired them nicely?
- Yes.

48
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,387
- Where are you going?
- I want to see what they look like.

49
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,641
Your shoes are not there.

50
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,019
- Are you teasing me?
- No, I swear I'm telling the truth.

51
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,066
I went to the store,
and the shoes disappeared.

52
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:26,904
I looked all over,
but I couldn't find them.

53
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,281
You mean they're lost?

54
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,493
Don't say anything to Mom.
I'll find them.

55
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,205
How will I get to school tomorrow?

56
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,834
Don't cry. I'll go after them
right away. I'll find them.

57
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,087
But you said you looked all over.

58
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,089
Not all over.

59
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,008
Please, don't tell Mom anything.

60
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:06,276
Ali! Ali,
where are you going?

61
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,320
Help me fold the rug.
Where are you going?

62
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,755
Ali, we play against
Shahin tomorrow.

63
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,757
Where are you going?

64
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,018
What are you doing here again?

65
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,271
Didn't I tell you to stay away?
What a pain in the neck!

66
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,030
- Hello, Aqa Sayed.
- Hello, son. How are you?

67
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,033
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

68
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,368
Wait a minute.
I need a favor.

69
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,296
This is sugar
for next week's ceremony.

70
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,715
- Ask your dad to chop it.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,717
Stay well, son.

72
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,388
You have nothing to do
with the landlord.

73
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,474
It's my job to deal with him.

74
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,643
Why do you argue with him?

75
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:06,522
I'll teach him a lesson.
I'll break his neck.

76
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,400
I'll make him understand
where his place is.

77
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,363
Tell me why
you don't listen to me!

78
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,865
Didn't the doctor say
you shouldn't do work?

79
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:20,577
Don't get mad!
Why did you do all this wash?

80
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:23,789
That rug is heavy when it's wet!

81
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:26,041
You! Why didn't you help
your mother...

82
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,502
when she asked you to?

83
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,504
You should have been patient.

84
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:34,967
I would have come home
and taken care of it.

85
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:37,469
What is your duty in this house?

86
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,597
Eat, sleep and play?

87
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,100
You're not a kid anymore.
You're nine years old.

88
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:46,478
When I was nine years old,
I helped my parents.

89
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,481
Why do you make me mad?

90
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:53,193
Are you stupid? Are you dumb?
Don't you understand?

91
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:57,239
All right. Don't stress yourself.

92
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,077
They make me so mad.

93
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,447
I don't know why the baby
has been feeling bad all day.

94
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,870
Zahra, pour some tea
for your father.

95
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,685
Thank you, dear.

96
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,940
I serve tea all daylong
at the company,

97
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,860
but Zahra's tea
has a special taste.

98
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,529
Zahra, dear,
you didn't bring the sugar bowl.

99
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,698
There is all this sugar.

100
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,034
This belongs to the mosque.

101
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,995
It's been given us in trust.

102
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,831
Get some sugar candy from the pot.

103
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,959
Are we out of sugar?

104
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,253
I've been taking the coupons
to the grocer,

105
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:37,005
but the sugar hasn't arrived yet.

106
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,007
Forget about him.

107
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,134
He doesn't pay attention
to the news.

108
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,303
He distributes it when he decides.

109
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,305
You'd better give
the coupons to me.

110
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,182
I'll get the sugar
from the company store.

111
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,142
They're under the rug.

112
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,110
What's wrong, darling?

113
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,909
Ali...

114
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,665
how am I going...

115
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:16,503
to school...

116
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,384
without shoes...

117
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,470
tomorrow?

118
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,850
Go to your company store tomorrow.

119
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:33,770
We don't have any formula left.
Buy some for the baby.

120
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,607
Don't worry.

121
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,529
Rahim Aqa's wife
had a slipped disc.

122
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,990
Surgery made it worse.

123
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,118
You should learn to live with it.

124
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,497
What do you want me to do?
Do nothing all day?

125
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,625
Well, the doctor
has forbidden work.

126
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,798
You can go to school with slippers.

127
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:09,639
Kokab Khanom's sister
had surgery, and she's fine.

128
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:15,020
Don't even think about surgery.

129
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:19,649
I don't want you
to become crippled.

130
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:25,822
Ali, you really have some nerve.

131
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:31,870
You lost my shoes.

132
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,999
I'm going to tell Dad.

133
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,181
"Zahra, if you tell Dad,
he'll beat both of us...

134
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:54,851
because he doesn't have money
to buy you a pair of shoes."

135
00:14:55,352 --> 00:15:00,148
Then what should I do?

136
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:09,491
You can wear my sneakers.

137
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,870
I'll wear them...

138
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:18,834
when you're back from school.

139
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,392
This is for you.

140
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,079
Salt, salt, trade for dry bread.

141
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,540
Salt trade for plastic bags,
for old slippers!

142
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,702
Next.

143
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,164
You, Niloofar. You, Fereshteh.

144
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,019
Are you all right? Stay here.

145
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,899
Listen, kids.

146
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:53,238
Fereshteh couldn't jump well
because of her shoes.

147
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,949
One of the most
important things...

148
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,868
is sneakers.

149
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:03,456
And I see, unfortunately,
that some of you don't wear them,

150
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,209
but some of you are wearing them.

151
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,795
Okay, Bahareh, it's your turn.

152
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:11,756
Next.

153
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,690
Come on!

154
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,907
Hurry up!

155
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:24,287
- Why are you late?
- I'm not late. I ran all the way.

156
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,289
Take the sneakers off. I'm late.

157
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,420
Did you get to school on time?

158
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,173
I was late.
You have to come earlier.

159
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,383
I came right after the class.

160
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:04,721
- You didn't tell Mom, did you?
- When I say I won't tell, I won't.

161
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,809
The sneakers are very dirty.

162
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,521
- I'm ashamed to wear them.
- You're making excuses again.

163
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,232
No, it's true.
They are very dirty.

164
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,276
Well, we'll wash them.

165
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,300
- Ali, let's go to practice.
- I'm busy.

166
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,302
- Come on.
- I can't come.

167
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,847
- It won't take long.
- My mother is ill.

168
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,849
Get lost.

169
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:54,664
Today my dear girl
did all the housework...

170
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,667
and Ali helped her.

171
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,669
I bought bread and vegetables.

172
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:05,091
I swept the floor, washed
the vegetables and peeled potatoes.

173
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:07,093
Good girl.

174
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:12,265
I'll buy something nice for
both of them when I get a raise.

175
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:24,652
You look much better now...

176
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:30,033
after a couple of days rest.

177
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:34,203
If you don't use the stairs,
soon you'll be all right.

178
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,978
- What is it?
- Ali, it's raining.

179
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:03,983
The sneakers are getting wet.
I'm afraid to go outside.

180
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,814
Excuse me, ma'am.
What time is it?

181
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,235
There is still time
left to write. Go on.

182
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,679
Excuse me, ma'am. May I leave?

183
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:42,683
So you were just
in a hurry to leave?

184
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,939
Go.

185
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:21,449
What is it, little girl?
What happened, my dear?

186
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,951
My shoe fell in the water.
It's stuck under the bridge.

187
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,996
All right. Don't cry, dear.
I'll get it for you.

188
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,567
Run and catch it.

189
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:59,904
Catch that shoe, old man. Catch it.

190
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,709
Where were you?

191
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,088
Why are you late?

192
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:28,432
- Why is it wet?
- I won't wear these anymore.

193
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,852
- Why it is wet?
- It fell in the gutter.

194
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,854
How do I go to school
in a wet sneaker?

195
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,733
- They're big. They come off.
- That's a good one!

196
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:40,111
It's your fault.
You lost my shoes.

197
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:42,113
Find them or I'll tell Dad.

198
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,907
I'm not scared of getting a beating!

199
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,326
Dad has no money
until the end of the month,

200
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,996
so he has to borrow some.

201
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:08,139
I thought you understood that.

202
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,955
Wait a minute.

203
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,958
Come down here.

204
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,714
Where have you been?
Why are you so late?

205
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:44,050
Please, sir, I live far from here.

206
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,260
Or do you play on the way?

207
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:49,722
You were late yesterday as well.

208
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,641
Next time, I won't let you in.

209
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,393
Yes, sir.

210
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,315
Why are your shoes wet?

211
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,402
Please, sir, I fell in the gutter.

212
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,905
Why aren't your pants wet?

213
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,116
Please, sir, it was shallow.

214
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:11,202
Is that so?

215
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,543
Why aren't your socks wet?

216
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,343
Don't let it happen again.

217
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,804
- Go to your class.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,151
- Permission, sir?
- Sit down.

219
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,724
"We are playing against Shahin today."

220
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,990
"I can't come. My mom is ill."

221
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:40,791
It's the final match.

222
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,920
What's going on?

223
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,716
Can't you keep quiet
until I'm finished?

224
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:50,341
Sit up straight.

225
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,430
Sit down. Sit down!

226
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:02,521
Those who were laughing
will now cry.

227
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:05,649
Everybody failed,
except for 15 students.

228
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,987
However, three earned top grades.

229
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:12,323
Karim Nanva.

230
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:16,577
Ali Mandegar. Salman Najafi.

231
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,877
I want to talk to them after class.

232
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,154
Zahra, Zahra.

233
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,288
Why don't you wait
when I call you?

234
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:02,915
Where are you going?

235
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,961
I'm returning Kobra Khanom's
bowl of offering stew.

236
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:09,255
Are you mad at me?

237
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,519
- Isn't it nice?
- Where did you get it?

238
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,189
It's a prize from my teacher.
It's for you.

239
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,942
Take it.

240
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:34,655
- Really, for me?
- Yes.

241
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:37,032
I didn't tell Mom, you know?

242
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,619
- I knew you wouldn't.
- I'll be back soon.

243
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,850
Ali, dear, bring me that tray.

244
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:16,572
Take the bowl of soup
to Kokab Khanom.

245
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,128
- Who is it?
- It's me, Ali.

246
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,007
- I have some soup for Kokab Khanom.
- Come in, son.

247
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,927
- Hello.
- Hello, Ali, dear.

248
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,430
Thank you very much.

249
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:44,099
- How is your dad, son?
- He is fine. Thank you.

250
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:55,152
Ali, dear, it's very nice
of your mother.

251
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:57,446
- Don't mention it.
- How is your mom?

252
00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:00,282
She is fine. Not bad.

253
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,326
- Give her my regards.
- Yes, ma'am.

254
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:05,996
Ali, don't go now.
Wait a minute. It's not much.

255
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,652
- Here, take this.
- No, thank you.

256
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,508
Take it, son. God bless you.

257
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:19,468
Give my regards to your dad.

258
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:21,178
Arms up!

259
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:25,432
I am the flower of this country!

260
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,059
Attention.

261
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,021
Obedient to the leader.

262
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:35,693
Exams are coming up.
I have some suggestions for you.

263
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,238
Look, children,
during the exam period,

264
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:41,990
you want to see the result
of your labor.

265
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:47,496
So you should work harder.
You must organize your time.

266
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,125
I will talk to your parents
to make sure...

267
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,087
you can study
without problems at home.

268
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,298
You should not stay up late...

269
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,010
to watch TV series.

270
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:06,515
Set a limited time for a break
to watch the cartoons,

271
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,017
then all you do is study.

272
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:14,148
Ask your mothers to go over
the lessons with you...

273
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,359
to make sure you
understand them well.

274
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:24,575
I told you that you must
clip your fingernails regularly.

275
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:29,872
You have to clip them every Friday
when you have time...

276
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:35,461
so that on Saturday they're clean.

277
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,339
Why? Because bacteria...

278
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,552
collects under the nails...

279
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,304
and when you eat...

280
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,224
with your hands, you get sick.

281
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:54,605
All right, you may go to your classes.

282
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:08,869
In order, my dear.
Go in order, my girl.

283
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:15,083
First grade, second, third,
fourth and fifth.

284
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,643
The ducks...

285
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:42,110
started to fly...

286
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:52,112
and carried the turtle with them.

287
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,626
Hold your sheets up,
hold your sheets up.

288
00:38:58,126 --> 00:38:59,628
Hurry up, my dear.

289
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,630
Farrokhi, you collect
the papers on this side.

290
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,133
Keep your minds focused.
Use the break period properly.

291
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,262
Remember, the next class
is mathematics.

292
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:54,094
- Hi!
- Hello!

293
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:23,749
Why are you late this time?

294
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:26,960
You can't use
the wet-shoe excuse now.

295
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,298
Come down here. Come on.

296
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:43,143
Come on, get going. Come on.

297
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:51,026
I'm talking to you. Go home
and come back with your father.

298
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:54,029
Please, sir, my father is at work.

299
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,490
Tell him to come tomorrow.
Get going.

300
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:59,534
Please, sir, he goes to work
tomorrow too.

301
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:05,415
- So come back with your mother.
- Please, sir, my mother is ill.

302
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,958
I won't accept any excuses.

303
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,045
This is how we treat
an irresponsible student.

304
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,714
Out you go. Get out.

305
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,058
What happened, Ali?
What is it?

306
00:43:35,695 --> 00:43:37,072
Stay here.

307
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,785
Good morning.

308
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,800
He's a good student, very orderly.

309
00:43:56,883 --> 00:43:58,927
Mandegar, come here.

310
00:44:04,724 --> 00:44:07,727
This time I'll excuse you
for Mr. Jafari's sake.

311
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:09,604
Don't let it happen again.

312
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,233
Go to your class. Go!

313
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:18,238
- That was very kind of you.
- You're welcome.

314
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:37,841
There it is.
That's their house.

315
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,935
Roya?

316
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,688
Roya?

317
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,901
You little devil.
Playing games again?

318
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:59,738
Where are you, my love?

319
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:02,657
Little devil!

320
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:07,412
You naughty girl!

321
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:16,838
Do you need anything?

322
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,633
Roya! After you buy the bread,
come right back.

323
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,828
Come and serve the tea.
- Yes.

324
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,415
Let's go, Mustafa.

325
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:57,856
Are you sure you don't need these?

326
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,400
No. Don't worry.

327
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,777
- May Fatima Zahra reward you.
- Thank you.

328
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,577
Are you sure you can do the job?

329
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,204
Spraying a couple of trees...

330
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,206
and plowing the garden
is no big deal!

331
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,252
Besides, it costs nothing.
I got the equipment from Hosein.

332
00:47:19,377 --> 00:47:22,630
Sometimes he takes off from work...

333
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,843
and goes all the way uptown.

334
00:47:26,926 --> 00:47:31,389
Since he's been doing this,
he's even saved a little.

335
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:36,519
Tomorrow is Friday, so Ali and I
will go uptown and go around.

336
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:41,191
It's fun, and we might
make some money.

337
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,558
Let's go.

338
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:51,404
I'll ring the bells on this side,
and you take the other.

339
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,199
- What should I say?
- Ask them if they need a gardener.

340
00:49:59,537 --> 00:50:03,750
Listen to me and learn.
You do the same. Come here.

341
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:20,225
- Hello!
- It's me.

342
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,269
- Who is it?
- Karim, ma'am.

343
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:25,688
Karim? Who are you looking for?

344
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,775
- No one, ma'am.
- Who are you?

345
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:34,155
- I mean... We...
- Why do you bother people?

346
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,034
- Wait a minute!
- Parviz, go see who's bothering us!

347
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,287
- Run, Ali!
- Who is it?

348
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:43,915
Stay right there, if you're a man!

349
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,843
Get off, Ali.

350
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:03,476
What strange people!
What did I say wrong?

351
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,076
- Who is it?
- Good morning.

352
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,620
- May I help you?
- Yes, thanks.

353
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,748
- Who are you?
- My name is Karim.

354
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,875
Karim? Who are you looking for?

355
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:32,922
- I-I...
- We are gardeners, sir.

356
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,676
We spray the trees,
plow the garden...

357
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,804
prune the branches.

358
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:42,682
We don't need your services.

359
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:47,604
Bravo. You know a lot.

360
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,399
Let's go.

361
00:52:02,243 --> 00:52:05,079
- Do you need a gardener?
- No, we don't need one.

362
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,600
- Yes?
- Do you need a gardener?

363
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,101
No, thank you.

364
00:52:33,232 --> 00:52:35,526
Run, Ali, run.

365
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:41,676
- Dad, do you want some water?
- No, son.

366
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:46,347
Who is it? Who is it?

367
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,685
Hey, boy, why don't you answer?

368
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:57,275
- Are you gone?
- I'm here.

369
00:53:57,358 --> 00:53:59,277
Ask your dad
if you need any gardening.

370
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,487
- My dad isn't home.
- Ask your mom.

371
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,074
She's not home either.
It's only my grandpa and me.

372
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,493
Ask your grandpa
if you need a gardener.

373
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,621
- Are you a gardener?
- Not me, my dad.

374
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:13,875
- Where is your dad?
- Right here, in the street.

375
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:17,879
- Now will you ask your grandpa?
- Tell me your name first.

376
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:19,881
My name is Ali.

377
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:22,550
And my name is Alireza.

378
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,678
- What grade are you in?
- I'm in third grade.

379
00:54:25,928 --> 00:54:27,889
NOW Will you get your grandpa?

380
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,057
My grandpa is asleep.

381
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,518
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

382
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,437
Ali, let's go.

383
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,398
Ali, do you want to come in
and play with me?

384
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,609
I have to go. Bye.

385
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:43,196
Ali, wait!

386
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,143
I have some fertilizer
you can use.

387
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:18,231
After that,
you can spray the trees.

388
00:55:18,272 --> 00:55:20,316
Especially the cherry
and apricot trees.

389
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,194
I planted them myself.
I spray them every year.

390
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,697
One year I didn't spray them...

391
00:55:27,114 --> 00:55:30,243
and two of them died.

392
00:55:30,993 --> 00:55:34,413
- Okay.
- Ali, let's go play.

393
00:55:35,414 --> 00:55:37,375
Come on. Let's go.

394
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:40,253
Go on, son.
I'll stay with your father.

395
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,964
Go, dear.

396
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,075
Thank you very much.
Here you go.

397
00:56:53,492 --> 00:56:55,578
- Money is not important.
- Please.

398
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,042
- It is too much.
- It is not worthy of you.

399
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:05,046
- Thank you.
- You did all the work. I thank you.

400
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:07,715
Let's go.

401
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:17,850
When I come back here,
I'll call to see...

402
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,394
if you have work for me.

403
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:27,902
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

404
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:36,869
I could take a month of vacation,
and in the afternoons,

405
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:41,207
instead of working overtime,
I could work in this neighborhood.

406
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,918
We're gonna have a better life.

407
00:57:44,168 --> 00:57:46,212
We're gonna buy everything.

408
00:57:46,295 --> 00:57:50,216
I'll buy a motorcycle,
I'll buy a dresser,

409
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:52,593
an iron for your mother,

410
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,637
a big refrigerator.

411
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,184
We may even rent a larger house.

412
00:58:00,267 --> 00:58:03,270
- I'll buy everything!
- Buy a pair of shoes for Zahra.

413
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,399
That's nothing.
I'll buy a pair for you too.

414
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:10,820
- Buy a pair for Zahra first. Hers are torn.
- All right.

415
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,721
Ali, hold on tight!

416
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,682
- Dad, please stop!
- The brakes are gone. Hold tight!

417
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,767
Dad, stop!

418
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,104
Hold on tight!

419
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:48,899
Dad, please stop!

420
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,903
Hold on! Shit!

421
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,261
The landlord came by again
for the rent.

422
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:02,973
What an insolent man!

423
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:06,352
I went to see him
a couple of days ago.

424
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:11,398
I told him I'd pay him soon.

425
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,776
That man doesn't see reason.

426
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:17,071
He waited for you for two,
three hours in the yard.

427
01:00:17,154 --> 01:00:20,699
The idiot!
I'll go see him tomorrow.

428
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:23,994
- You can't go empty-handed.
- Trust in God.

429
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:28,207
- Don't worry.
- Can you go in this condition?

430
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,417
Nothing's wrong with me.

431
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,492
Hey, girl! Wait! Your pen!

432
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:46,076
Attention, students.
I'm talking to you boys.

433
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:53,000
There is a series of long-distance
races for kids of all ages...

434
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:55,961
being organized in this province.

435
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,924
The first round has been planned
for third and fourth graders.

436
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:05,971
Those interested in the race
should come and register...

437
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,307
for a preliminary selection.

438
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,643
The runners will be timed.

439
01:03:02,152 --> 01:03:04,280
Here, your pen.

440
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,533
You dropped it yesterday.

441
01:03:34,768 --> 01:03:38,272
Aga Davood,
see what this good man needs.

442
01:03:38,605 --> 01:03:40,816
- Hello.
- Good morning.

443
01:03:40,941 --> 01:03:44,236
- I hope you are well.
- Thank you. How can I help you?

444
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,656
I need a pair of girl's shoes
for a good price.

445
01:03:47,781 --> 01:03:51,076
- What size?
- I don't know the size,

446
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,120
but she's in first grade.

447
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,039
First grade.

448
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:05,674
Here you are. Two models.
Which do you want?

449
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,426
What color are they?

450
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:10,179
One pair is red with red trimming.

451
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:13,682
The other pair is violet
with red and yellow trimming.

452
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,102
- Red and yellow. Good price?
- We'll agree on something.

453
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:20,105
Yellow and red.
That's very good. Thank you.

454
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,776
Salt! Salt! Salt!

455
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:30,115
- Hello. Here you are.
- Hello.

456
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,951
- What do you want in exchange?
- A basket.

457
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,037
There you go.

458
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,033
- Hi.
- Hi.

459
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:17,830
Is your house that way?
So is our house.

460
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:22,543
Your shoes are pretty.
Did you just buy them?

461
01:05:22,626 --> 01:05:24,670
My dad bought them for me.

462
01:05:24,711 --> 01:05:27,047
What did you do
with your old shoes?

463
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,258
My mom threw them out.

464
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:30,968
She threw them out?

465
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:34,638
- Why? What for?
- They were torn.

466
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:49,027
When I get good grades,
my dad buys me something.

467
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,447
This time he bought me shoes.

468
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,857
Sir! My name is not there.

469
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,319
- Sir! Didn't I pass? I ran well!
- My name is not there either.

470
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,404
Why are you protesting?

471
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:16,532
You can't all be selected.

472
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,700
Only five or six students
from each school.

473
01:07:18,825 --> 01:07:20,702
God willing, you'll make it next time.

474
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,038
Move out of the way. Come on.

475
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:30,462
Aren't they lucky?
Two weeks in Ramsar. Good for them.

476
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,507
Taqizadeh is on the list.
Look, Hoseini.

477
01:07:39,846 --> 01:07:43,141
"First prize: Two weeks at a holiday
camp and a set of sport suits.

478
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,562
"Second prize: Two weeks at a
holiday camp and school supplies.

479
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:49,565
Third prize: One week at a holiday
camp and a pair of sneakers."

480
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,947
"A pair of sneakers."

481
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,203
- With permission, sir.
- Come in.

482
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,669
- What do you want?
- Sir, I want to be in the race.

483
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:14,506
Are you serious?
You are a little too late!

484
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:18,010
Where were you? Asleep?

485
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:20,137
Sir, I forgot.

486
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,016
You missed your chance.
Don't forget next time.

487
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:26,852
Sir, I want to be in this race.

488
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:29,396
- No way, my boy.
- Please, sir.

489
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:32,232
- I said no.
- Sir, I want so much to be in this race.

490
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,152
It is not up to you
to decide, my boy.

491
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:37,904
You missed the test,
and the deadline is up.

492
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,741
Sir, please do something.
Let me be part of the race.

493
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:43,619
You are really pigheaded.
When I say you can't, you can't.

494
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,203
Get out of here.

495
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,000
Please, sir, I promise to win.

496
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:53,045
Please, sir,
please register my name.

497
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:58,759
Please, sir, I can run very fast.

498
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:02,512
I'll leave everyone behind.
I promise to win.

499
01:09:09,102 --> 01:09:11,730
Please, sir, register my name.

500
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:57,275
- Zahra, I have good news.
- What news?

501
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,780
I was selected for the race.

502
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:05,575
- What race?
- Long-distance running.

503
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:09,830
The third-best runner
gets a pair of new sneakers.

504
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,832
Why the third?

505
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:15,961
The first and second prizes
are something else.

506
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:23,844
If I come in third,
I'll give you the sneakers.

507
01:10:25,595 --> 01:10:27,597
But those shoes are for boys.

508
01:10:28,014 --> 01:10:32,686
I'll exchange them. I'll get a pair
of girl's shoes for you.

509
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,189
What if you don't come in third?

510
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,567
I'll be third for sure.

511
01:11:36,082 --> 01:11:38,293
Help the boys get ready. It's late.

512
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,879
Get down! Hurry up!

513
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,049
Come on, boys. Come on.

514
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,552
Take off your clothes.

515
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:51,306
Come on. Hurry up.

516
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,781
Come on, boy. Hurry up.

517
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,309
Attention! Dear children,
the race is four kilometers.

518
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:40,647
The finish line is
on the other side of the lake.

519
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:44,568
Don't push the other runners.
Winning isn't everything.

520
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:48,864
The important thing is sportsmanship.
Good luck to you all.

521
01:12:49,197 --> 01:12:52,450
Now, ready, one, two...

522
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,894
<i>- Why are you late?
- I'm not late. Iran all the way.</i>

523
01:16:05,977 --> 01:16:08,730
Come <i>on. Give me the shoes.
I'm late for school.</i>

524
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:15,361
<i>The sneakers are very dirty.
I'm ashamed to wear them.</i>

525
01:16:18,406 --> 01:16:20,283
<i>I won't wear these anymore.</i>

526
01:16:20,366 --> 01:16:24,245
<i>It's all your fault. You lost my shoes.
Find them or I'll tell Dad.</i>

527
01:16:25,371 --> 01:16:28,249
<i>If I come in third,
I'll give you the sneakers.</i>

528
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,496
<i>What if you don't come in third?</i>

529
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:08,748
<i>I'll be third for sure.</i>

530
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,672
"70 Meters"

531
01:19:27,553 --> 01:19:29,472
"50 Meters"

532
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,233
"30 Meters"

533
01:20:18,354 --> 01:20:22,358
- Bravo, Ali! Bravo, Ali!
- Did I come in third, sir?

534
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:25,361
Why third, my dear?
You were first.

535
01:20:25,528 --> 01:20:27,405
Bravo! You won the race.

536
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,844
You'll win next time.

537
01:21:02,565 --> 01:21:04,025
Bring Ali.

538
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,335
Look this way, all of you.

539
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,130
Look here.

540
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,397
Please move away.
I want his picture alone.

541
01:21:45,858 --> 01:21:47,443
Hold your head high, champ.

542
01:21:48,569 --> 01:21:50,196
Hold your head up!

543
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:57,495
One more.

544
01:27:32,204 --> 01:27:35,291
