1
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:27,837
War began between Germany
and France on August 3rd 1914.

2
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,549
Five weeks later
the German army had smashed its way

3
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,885
to within 18 miles of Paris.

4
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,181
There, the battered French rallied
their forces at the Marne river

5
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,475
and, in a series of
unexpected counterattacks,

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,519
drove the Germans back.

7
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,355
The front was stabilised,
then shortly afterwards

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,942
developed into a continuous
line of heavily fortified trenches,

9
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,277
zigzagging their way 500 miles

10
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,155
from the English Channel
to the Swiss frontier.

11
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,202
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare,

12
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,330
the battle lines had changed very little.

13
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,834
Successful attacks were
measured in hundreds of yards,

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,045
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

15
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,384
General Bollard, sir.

16
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:19,055
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Paul. Wonderful seeing you again.

17
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,391
Well, this is splendid.

18
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,769
Superb!

19
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,731
I try to create a pleasant atmosphere
in which to work.

20
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,068
You've succeeded marvellously. I wish
I had your taste in carpets and pictures.

21
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,488
You're much too kind, George.
Sit down, George.

22
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,198
I haven't done very much.

23
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,660
The place is much the same
as it was when I moved in.

24
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,623
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

25
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,753
It's top-secret. It must go no further
than your Chief of Staff, and not to him,

26
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,797
- unless you can trust his discretion.
- Of course.

27
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,050
A group of armies is forming
on this front for an offensive very soon.

28
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,763
Headquarters is determined to make
a breakthrough. Why are you smiling?

29
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,141
I'm sorry. I thought for a moment
I knew what you were going to say.

30
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,559
Please go on.

31
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,605
I never knew you were a mind-reader.
What did you think I was about to say?

32
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,649
- Something about the Ant Hill.
- You are a mind-reader.

33
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,028
Well, it is a key position.
It's in my sector.

34
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,238
To be perfectly honest,
I've heard some talk.

35
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,592
You know there's nothing really
secret around headquarters.

36
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,658
Well, what do you think?

37
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,661
It's the key to the German position
in this sector.

38
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,663
They've held onto it for a year now.

39
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,208
And it looks as if
they'll hold onto it for another year.

40
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,252
Paul, I have formal orders to take
the Ant Hill no later than the 10th,

41
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,577
that's the day after tomorrow.

42
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,857
That comes pretty close to being
ridiculous, don't you think?

43
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,634
I don't imagine I would be here
if I really thought that.

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,640
Paul, if there's one man in this army
who can do this for me, it's you.

45
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,018
It's out of the question, George.
Absolutely out of the question.

46
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,062
My division was cut to pieces.

47
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,816
What's left of it is in no position
to hold the Ant Hill, let alone take it.

48
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,984
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

49
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,364
Well, Paul, there was something else
I wanted to tell you.

50
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,242
But you may misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

51
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,828
What was it?

52
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,121
You'd be bound to misunderstand.

53
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,708
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

54
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,545
- What are you trying to say, George?
- Paul...

55
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,173
the talk around headquarters is that you
are being considered for the 12th Corps.

56
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,218
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

57
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,886
I've pushed it all I can.

58
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,265
The 12th Corps needs a fighting
general and you're overdue another star.

59
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,685
We both know that your record is good
enough for you to refuse this assignment

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,603
on the grounds you've stated.

61
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,313
No one would question your opinion.

62
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,983
They'd simply get
someone else to do the job.

63
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,736
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion, Paul.

64
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,868
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks. Not before dinner.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,749
George, I'm responsible
for the lives of 8,000 men.

66
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,712
What is my ambition against that?

67
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,090
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

68
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,467
My men come first of all, George,

69
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,220
- and those men know it, too.
- I know that they do.

70
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,974
You see, George. Those men
know I would never let them down.

71
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,100
That goes without saying.

72
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,227
The life of one soldier means more to me

73
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,772
than all the stars and declarations
and honours in France.

74
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,108
So...

75
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,279
you think this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

76
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,531
I didn't say that, George.

77
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,328
Nothing is beyond those men
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

78
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,015
Paul, I don't want to push you
into it if you think it's ill-advised.

79
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,626
Don't worry, George.
You couldn't do that if you tried.

80
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,047
Of course, artillery would
make an enormous difference.

81
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,258
- What artillery support can you give me?
- I'll see.

82
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,503
- What about replacements?
- We'll see what we can do,

83
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,931
but I feel sure you can get along
with what you have.

84
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,307
We might just do it.

85
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,435
Paul, I knew that I was right
to come to you.

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,605
You are the man to take the Ant Hill.
Now, as for that star is concerned...

87
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,774
That had nothing
to do with my decision.

88
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,736
- If anything, it'd sway me the other way.
- I realise that perfectly.

89
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,032
- Now, when do you see this coming on?
- No later than the day after tomorrow.

90
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,700
We just might do it.

91
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,767
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

92
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,892
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,105
- What's your name, soldier?
- Sir, Private Ferol, Company A.

94
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,856
- Are you married?
- No, sir.

95
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,359
- Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,487
Well, carry on, Private.
And good luck to you.

97
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,656
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

98
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,915
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,250
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,713
Working over your rifle, I see. That's
the way. It's a soldier's best friend.

101
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,841
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

102
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,722
- Well, good luck to you, soldier.

103
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,306
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

104
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,085
Hello there, soldier.

105
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,254
Ready to kill more Germans?

106
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,592
Is everything all right, soldier?

107
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,554
- All right? Yes, sir. I'm all right.
- Ah-ha. Good fella.

108
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,808
- Are you married, soldier?
- Married? Me married?

109
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,644
Yes. Have you got a wife?

110
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,774
- A wife? Have I got a wife?
- Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

111
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,487
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

112
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,489
Have you got a wife, soldier?

113
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,325
My wife? My wife.

114
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,829
Yes, I have a wife. I'm never going to
see her again. I'm going to be killed.

115
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,766
Get a grip on yourself.
You're acting like a coward!

116
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,250
- I am a coward.
- Snap out of it, soldier!

117
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,463
Sergeant, arrange for the immediate
transfer of this baby out of my regiment!

118
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,132
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him!

119
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,384
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

120
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,809
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

121
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,120
You know General, I'm convinced
that these tours of yours

122
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,772
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men.

123
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,733
In think the fighting spirit
of the 701st derives from it.

124
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,736
No, Major, that spirit
was just born in them.

125
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,453
The general is coming, sir.

126
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,347
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
- I'm honoured, General.

127
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,143
Well, quite a neat little
spot you have here.

128
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,105
I'll reserve comment on
the neatness, sir, but it is little.

129
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,817
- Pretty shy on seating accommodation.
- More than enough for me.

130
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,154
Never got the habit of sitting.
Like to be on my feet.

131
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,031
- Keep on the move.
- I can vouch for that, Colonel.

132
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,368
I can hardly get the general behind a desk
long enough to sign an order.

133
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,537
That's the way I am, Dax.

134
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,540
I can't understand these armchair officers.

135
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,752
Fellas trying to fight a war from behind
a desk. Waving papers at the enemy!

136
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,006
Worrying whether a mouse is
going to run up their pants leg.

137
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,594
If I had the choice between mice and
Mausers, I'd take the mice every time.

138
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,805
You'll never make me believe that, Colonel.
Seriously, though,

139
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,059
if a man's a ninny, let him put on
a dress and hide under the bed.

140
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,062
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then by heavens, he's got to be one.

141
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:09,275
He's got to fight, and he can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

142
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,195
- That's my credo.
- I think I have to agree with you,

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,640
- presenting your case so convincingly, sir.
- You never fail to live up to it, sir.

144
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,384
I imagine you'd like a look around,
would you.

145
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,243
Yes, Colonel.

146
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,996
Here's something to see - the Ant Hill.

147
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,208
It's as good a view as you can get
without actually being there.

148
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,335
That won't be long now, will it?

149
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,551
Hm. Yeah.

150
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:40,431
Well, I've seen much more formidable
objectives. Much, much worse.

151
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:52,485
Not something we can grab and run
away with, but certainly pregnable.

152
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,279
- Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it?
- Why?

153
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,033
- Like something to do with giving birth.
- Oh, yes. Quite.

154
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,745
You're right on your toes this morning.
Even sharper than usual.

155
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,538
We mustn't forget the colonel was perhaps

156
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,667
the foremost criminal lawyer
in all France.

157
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,753
Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

158
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,215
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

159
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,218
We drew some artillery. 29 casualties, sir.

160
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,305
Yes, noticed it on the road in.
Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

161
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,017
All swarmed together like flies,
waiting for someone to swat them.

162
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:30,147
They never learn. They get in a tight spot
under heavy fire, gang up every time.

163
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,150
Herd instinct, I suppose.
Kind of a lower animal sort of thing.

164
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:37,113
A human sort of thing, it seems to me.
Don't you make a distinction, Major?

165
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,033
Yes, very regrettable, of course.
Very. Yes, indeed.

166
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,412
Major, would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes?

167
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,580
Yes, sir. Of course.

168
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,709
Colonel.

169
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,340
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

170
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,343
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Ant Hill.

171
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,264
Colonel, your regiment is going
to take the Ant Hill tomorrow.

172
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,977
- You know the condition of my men, sir.
- Men will have to be killed.

173
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,397
Possibly a lot of them.
They absorb bullets and shrapnel,

174
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,025
making it possible
for others to get through.

175
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,486
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

176
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,365
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

177
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,911
Say 5% killed by our own barrage.
That's a very generous allowance.

178
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,414
10% more in getting
through no-man's-land,

179
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,666
and 20% more getting through the wire.

180
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,670
That leaves 65%
with the worst part of the job over.

181
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,716
Let's say another 25%
in actually taking the Ant Hill.

182
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,927
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

183
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,889
You're saying that more than
half my men will be killed.

184
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:49,727
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel,
but we will have the Ant Hill.

185
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,981
- But will we, sir?
- I'm depending on you, Colonel.

186
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,150
All France is depending on you.

187
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,864
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

188
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,553
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need a flag
waving in front of me to get me to charge.

189
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,497
I don't like a comparison of the flag of
France to a bullfighter's cape.

190
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,665
I meant no disrespect to our flag.

191
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,125
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,

192
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,354
but show me a patriot
and I'll show you an honest man.

193
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,754
Everyone always thought so.

194
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,298
Samuel Johnson had something else
to say about patriotism.

195
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,759
And what was that, may I ask?

196
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,750
- Nothing, really.
- What do you mean, "nothing, really"?

197
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,222
Sir, nothing really important.

198
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,408
Colonel, when I ask a question,
it's always important.

199
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,684
- Now who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

200
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,479
What did he have to say about patriotism?

201
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:38,984
That it was the last refuge of a scoundrel,
sir. I'm sorry, I meant nothing personal.

202
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,279
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

203
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,740
It's you who are exhausted, not your men.

204
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,411
And it's my fault. I've given you
one impossible task after another.

205
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,454
- You need rest.
- I haven't said...

206
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,125
You never would, so you aren't
going to have any say-so about it, Colonel.

207
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,044
As from now, I'm ordering you
on indefinite furlough.

208
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,523
General, you can't take me away
from my men. You can't do that to me, Sir.

209
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,632
Not to you, Dax. For you.

210
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,302
- For your good and the good of your men.
- The good of my men, sir?

211
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,181
If a commanding officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

212
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,394
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you,
but I must have your enthusiastic support.

213
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,189
Not once have you said
that your men can take the Ant Hill.

214
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,110
We'll take the Ant Hill.

215
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,198
If any soldiers in the world can take it,

216
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,534
we'll take the Ant Hill.

217
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,871
And when you do, your men will
be relieved and get a long rest.

218
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,015
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune
reporting, sir.

219
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,310
- You took your time about it.
- We prepared as quick as we could, sir.

220
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,147
- We had to alert the sentries.
- All right. You men at ease.

221
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,066
This is a reconnaissance patrol.
German wire,

222
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,861
machine-gun posts,
identification of bodies.

223
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,531
There will only be the three of us.
We're to avoid a fight if we can.

224
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,204
We go out to the left and we come
back through post six on the right.

225
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,707
- Is everything all clear at post six?
- All the sentries have been warned.

226
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,085
Number six will send up flares
at 10-minute intervals starting at 04:00.

227
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,838
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I told them that, sir.

228
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,007
The sergeant says
every five minutes is too much.

229
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,028
- He says it's certain to draw artillery.
- Quite a strategist, this sergeant.

230
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,971
- What's his name?
- I don't know, sir.

231
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,601
All right. You men wait outside.
I'll join you in a minute.

232
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,895
Would you mind telling us the password,
sir?

233
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,064
- Calais.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,326
- He's fortifying himself.
- It smelled like heaven.

235
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,454
I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

236
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,582
At least he could have
passed it around, the pig.

237
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,544
What's he got against you, anyway?

238
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,255
We went to school together
before the war.

239
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,175
He thinks I don't have enough
respect for him. He's right.

240
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,012
If you gentlemen are ready.

241
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,642
Colonel.

242
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,563
- Everything clear and understood?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:25,484
The lane through our Wire's in front here.
Machine gun's pointing at the opening.

244
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,570
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.

245
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,738
All right, men. Let's go.

246
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,815
- What's that?
- I don't know.

247
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,195
Lejeune, move out and look
that over. We'll cover you.

248
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,698
Split up a night patrol?

249
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,991
Move out, Lejeune.

250
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:07,080
- I don't like this. Let's get outta here.
- We haven't given him enough time.

251
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:16,757
- If we wait any longer, they'll get us too.
- We've gotta wait for him.

252
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,971
He must be dead! Where is he?

253
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,449
- Well!
- Surprised, Lieutenant?

254
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,995
Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

255
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,457
- You didn't wait to find out, did you?
- Look here, what do you mean?

256
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,836
I mean you ran like a rabbit
after you killed Lejeune.

257
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,548
Killed Lejeune?
What are you talking about?

258
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,050
I don't think I like your tone.

259
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,012
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

260
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,848
Well, I must be mistaken, then, sir.

261
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,434
An officer wouldn't do that.

262
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,897
A man wouldn't do it. Only a thing would.

263
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,775
A sneaky, booze-guzzling,
yellow-bellied rat

264
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,320
with a bottle for a brain
and a streak of spit...

265
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,115
- That's enough, Corporal.
- You've got yourself into a mess.

266
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,201
I have, have I?
You've got yourself in a worse one.

267
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:13,165
First, general insubordination.
Second, threatening your superior officer.

268
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,586
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

269
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,172
How do you think those charges
will look on paper?

270
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,466
Not half as bad as these:

271
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,012
endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness, drunk on duty,

272
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,556
wanton murder of one of your own men,

273
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,142
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

274
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:39,358
Phillip, have you ever tried to bring
charges against an officer?

275
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,069
It's my word against yours, you know.

276
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,821
Whose word do you think
they're gonna believe?

277
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:49,242
Let me put it another way. Whose word
do you think they're going to accept?

278
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,912
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

279
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,998
S0 far, all I have written in this report

280
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,585
is that you and Lejeune
were killed while out on patrol.

281
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,963
I'll fix this to read
that you made your way back

282
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,090
after becoming separated
during the skirmish.

283
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,215
That'll end the matter...

284
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,059
You killed Lejeune.
You know that, don't you?

285
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,970
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

286
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,515
I'd give anything in the world if it
hadn't happened and that's the truth.

287
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,186
Honestly, I know you don't like me, but
what kind of a man do you think I am?

288
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,565
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

289
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,168
I've been waiting for your report,
Lieutenant.

290
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,194
Well, I think we found out a thing or two.

291
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,990
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

292
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,301
- How did it happen?
- It's all right here in the report, sir.

293
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,286
- Let's have it.
- It isn't quite finished yet, sir.

294
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,539
That's all, Corporal.
You did a good night's work.

295
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,124
Should feel very proud of yourself.

296
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,127
- Go get some sleep.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,051
- How did you lose Lejeune?
- Machine-gun fire, sir.

298
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,846
He coughed. Almost got us all killed.

299
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,683
Finish that report
and get it to me immediately.

300
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,852
Yes, sir.

301
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,984
The artillery starts at 05:15.

302
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,863
The 1st Battalion will move out at 05:30.

303
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,158
When the leading elements
have cleared the German wires,

304
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,743
the second wave consisting of-

305
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:17,456
the 2nd and 3rd Battalions minus
two companies in reserve - will move out,

306
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,083
in no case later than 05:40.

307
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,337
That's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

308
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:29,092
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery
preparation all that we can expect?

309
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:33,597
The feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organised.

310
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,808
What's weather supposed
to be like tomorrow, sir?

311
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,604
- Too good.
- No chance of rain or fog?

312
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,316
The forecast is for sun all day.

313
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,862
If... Perhaps I should say
when we take the Ant Hill

314
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,491
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

315
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,203
General Mireau, who will be
personally observing the attack,

316
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,247
has promised support from
the 72nd by sundown tomorrow,

317
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,918
which means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

318
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,297
Are there any more questions?

319
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,970
Well, gentlemen, good luck. I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

320
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,764
Let's get some sleep.

321
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,727
I'm not afraid of dying tomorrow,
only of getting killed.

322
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,022
- That's as clear as mud.
- Which would you rather be done in by?

323
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,733
- A bayonet or a machine gun?
- A machine gun.

324
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,445
That's just my point. They're both
pieces of steel ripping into you,

325
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,698
only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful.

326
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,885
- What does that prove?
- It proves that most of us are more afraid

327
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,495
of getting hurt than of getting killed.

328
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,999
Look at Bernard. He panics when it comes
to gas. Gas doesn't bother me a bit.

329
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,545
He's seen photos of gas cases -
doesn't mean anything to me.

330
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,923
But I'll tell you something. I'd hate
like the devil to be without my tin hat.

331
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,801
But I don't mind
not having a tin hat for my tail.

332
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:57,722
Why? Because I know a wound in the
head would hurt more than one in the tail.

333
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,851
The tail is just meat.
But the head is all bone.

334
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,145
- Speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

335
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,730
Aside from the bayonet,
what are you most afraid of?

336
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,567
- High explosives.
- Exactly! It's the same with me,

337
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,212
because I know that it can chew
you up worse than anything else.

338
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,755
Look, it's what I'm trying to tell you.

339
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,965
If you're really afraid of dying,

340
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,883
you'd be living in a funk
all the rest of your life

341
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,118
because you know
you've got to go someday, anyday.

342
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,956
And if it's death you're afraid of, why
should you care about what kills you?

343
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:27,335
You're too smart for me, professor.
All I know is, nobody wants to die.

344
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,598
Through to Division, sir.
Through to Polygon.

345
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,143
Everything quiet.
All units report themselves ready.

346
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,312
Zero minus two.

347
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,107
- May I offer you gentlemen some cognac?
- Thank you, sir.

348
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,322
After you, sir.

349
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,409
To France.

350
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,763
Minus 15... 14... 13...

351
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,145
10, 9, 8, 7,

352
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,316
6, 5, 4, 3,

353
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,943
2, 1... zero!

354
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,124
- Sergeant, where's B Company?
- I don't know, sir.

355
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,215
- Where in heaven's name are they?
- On the left...

356
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,426
Where are the rest? Zero plus one,
and they're still in the trenches.

357
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,844
Now they're advancing.

358
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,347
Miserable cowards.
They're not advancing!

359
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,350
The barrage is getting away from them!
They're still in the trenches!

360
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,476
Yes, sir.

361
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,606
- Captain Nichols.
- Yes, sir?

362
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,819
Order the 75s to commence
firing on our own positions.

363
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,324
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

364
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,743
No, sir, but... I respectfully ask to...

365
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,121
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

366
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,248
No, sir.

367
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,334
- Then carry it out, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,259
Hello, Polygon? This is Division.

369
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,138
Batteries 1 and 2 commence firing...

370
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:59,185
on coordinates 32-58-78.

371
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:06,943
Batteries 1 and 2 to commence
firing on coordinates 32-58-78. Over.

372
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,788
General, the battery commander reports
those are our own positions.

373
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:23,167
- He says it must be a mistake.
- Confirm the order, Captain.

374
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,461
The order is confirmed.

375
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,424
Battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order

376
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,261
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general. Over.

377
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,347
Battery commander respectfully reports

378
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,672
he cannot execute
such an order unless it is in writing,

379
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,020
- and signed by the general.
- Give me that phone!

380
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,819
- General Mireau speaking!
- Battery commander speaking.

381
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,363
The troops are mutinying,
refusing to advance.

382
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,324
Fire as ordered until further notice!

383
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,036
With all respect, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men

384
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,706
unless you are willing to take
full and undivided responsibility for it.

385
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,250
Captain Rousseau,
will you obey my order?

386
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,046
I must have a written order before
I can execute such a command, sir.

387
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,381
Supposing you're killed. Where will I be?

388
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,968
In front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning, that's where you'll be!

389
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,514
Hand over your command and report
yourself under arrest to my headquarters.

390
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:34,489
Roget! Lieutenant Roget,
why are your men still in here?

391
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,868
- It's impossible, sir. Major Vignon is dead.
- Get these men out of the trenches!

392
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,996
Come on! Let's get ready for another try.

393
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,792
- Get these men outta here!
- I tried three times.

394
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,628
All right! Let's give it another try!

395
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,589
Come on! Let's give it another try!

396
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,645
It's impossible, sir.
All the men are falling back.

397
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,483
Sir, I respectfully
submit to the colonel...

398
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:15,905
Pardon me. Your remarks to me
were very unfair, sir.

399
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,701
It's just impossible.
It's just impossible.

400
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,371
According to reports,
the attack has failed all along the line.

401
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,207
The men are falling back
to our own trenches.

402
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:31,003
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for the
immediate relief of the 701st Regiment.

403
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,966
Have them sent to the Château de I'Aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to me.

404
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,094
Major Couderc, assemble
a general court martial.

405
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,763
Have it ready to meet at 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.

406
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,767
If those little sweethearts won't face
German bullets, they'll face French ones!

407
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,615
I ordered an attack.
Your troops refused to attack.

408
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,118
The troops did attack, sir,
but they could make no headway.

409
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,789
Because they didn't try. I saw it myself.
Half of your men never left the trenches.

410
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,751
A third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense.

411
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,878
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

412
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,257
The fact remains that a good part of
your men never left their own trenches.

413
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:20,178
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men
from each company in your regiment

414
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,181
tried under penalty of death
for cowardice.

415
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,641
- Penalty of death...?
- For cowardice!

416
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,927
They have skimmed milk in their veins
instead of blood.

417
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,438
It's the reddest milk I've ever seen.
My trenches...

418
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,024
- That's enough...
- I'm not gonna mince words...

419
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,869
Colonel Dax,
if you continue in this manner,

420
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,736
I shall have to place you under arrest.

421
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,448
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it bluntly.

422
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,367
This is not a trial,
but it does bear certain aspects of one.

423
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:46,704
Colonel Dax technically is cast in the role
of the defence.

424
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,931
In view of the gravity of the charges,

425
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,292
a court of law would grant him all
possible latitude in presenting his case.

426
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,796
Latitude is one thing,
insubordination another.

427
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:59,509
I am merely offering an opinion. Please
do not feel constrained to accept it.

428
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,970
I'm perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

429
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,682
I'm sorry, sir. I certainly
didn't intend to be insubordinate.

430
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,976
My only aim is
to remind you of the heroism

431
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,813
these men have shown
on every occasion in the past.

432
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,857
We're not talking about the past,
we're talking about the present.

433
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,236
Don't you see, sir, they're not cowards.
If some didn't leave the trenches,

434
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,738
it must have been
because it was impossible.

435
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:25,159
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

436
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:29,038
We can't leave it up to the men to decide
when an order is possible or not.

437
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:34,877
If it was impossible, the only proof would
be their dead bodies lying in the trenches.

438
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,631
They're scum, Colonel.
The whole rotten regiment.

439
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,884
A pack of sneaking,
whining, tail-dragging curs.

440
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,430
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

441
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,725
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

442
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,103
Then why not shoot the entire regiment?

443
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,271
I'm perfectly serious.

444
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,606
Now, Colonel,
you're missing the point entirely.

445
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,485
We don't want to slaughter the French
army. All we want to do is set an example.

446
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,238
- If it's an example you want, take me.
- Take you?

447
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,992
Yes, sir. If it's an example you want,
one man will do as well as a 100.

448
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,496
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

449
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:16,460
Now, Colonel, I think you're overwrought.
This is not a question of officers.

450
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,881
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

451
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,550
Suppose we just make it a dozen?

452
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,595
I was talking of 100 men.
Now we're down to 12.

453
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,014
Let's not haggle over this thing anymore.

454
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:32,643
Let's get it settled once and for all
so that we can all live with it.

455
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:38,190
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see properjustice meted out.

456
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,401
I've spent my entire life in the army.

457
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,904
I've always tried
to be true to my principles.

458
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,115
That's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

459
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:51,454
I'll settle for this: have the company
commanders select one man

460
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,624
from each company
in the first wave - three in all.

461
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,168
That's very reasonable of you, Paul.

462
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,671
The court martial will meet at the chateau
at three o'clock this afternoon.

463
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,925
- Will that be convenient for you?
- I won't be there, Paul.

464
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,638
- You won't be there?
- I think it best that you handle this matter.

465
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,764
Probably so.

466
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:15,353
General Mireau, if possible, I'd like to
be appointed counsellor for the accused.

467
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,273
- I'll take the matter under consideration.
- We can permit that, Paul.

468
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,193
- Consider it settled, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

469
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,031
Noon straight up. I hope
you can stay for lunch, Colonel.

470
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,034
George, I'm afraid
the colonel won't have time.

471
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,995
Don't deny it, Paul.
You've been hiding this man.

472
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,623
Keeping him for your own.
I think that was very selfish of you.

473
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,934
Thank you for your courtesy,
General

474
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,710
but I'm afraid there isn't much time
between now and three o'clock.

475
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:44,715
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

476
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,777
Yes, Captain?

477
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,989
They ordered me to report
to you here. Captain Rousseau.

478
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,699
Yes, of course.

479
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,577
I wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short.

480
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,830
I haven't time to go into it now.

481
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,125
Report back to your command
until further orders.

482
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,922
- Bad stuff. Demoralises the men.
- I quite agree with you.

483
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,717
The best solution is to shelve him
to another outfit.

484
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,736
A court of inquiry
ought to roast him a bit first.

485
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,390
In cases like this, shells falling short,
I always try to avoid an inquiry.

486
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,977
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

487
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,271
Shelving would be the best discipline
in my opinion.

488
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,189
Well, perhaps you're right.

489
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,774
Would you excuse me for a moment?

490
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,377
A regimental matter
I want to mention to the colonel.

491
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,530
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

492
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,241
That'll be Captain Sancy,
Captain Renoir and Lieutenant Roget...

493
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,366
Yes, sir.

494
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,595
...to meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour.

495
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,455
- Yes, sir!
- Colonel Dax!

496
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,665
Yes, General?

497
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,460
- I'd like a word with you.
- Certainly, sir.

498
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,213
Best be sensible about this.

499
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,799
Sensible, sir?

500
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:13,387
Listen to me, Dax. Give up
this fancy talk with me, you understand?

501
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:17,266
Colonel Broulard seems
to think you're funny. I don't.

502
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:21,562
- I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon, sir, is that an order?

503
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,441
Colonel Dax, when this mess
is cleaned up, I'll break you.

504
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,861
I'll find an excuse and
break through the ranks. I'll ruin you!

505
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:34,075
It'll be just what you deserve, showing so
little loyalty to your commanding officer.

506
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,452
That's all, Colonel.

507
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,819
General Mireau feels that the attack
on the Ant Hill yesterday morning

508
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,815
failed because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the 1st Battalion.

509
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,069
Each of you is to select one man from
your company, place him under arrest,

510
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,422
and have him ready to appear
before a general court martial

511
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,824
no later than 15:00 hours this afternoon.

512
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,243
The charge is cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

513
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,371
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

514
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,893
Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune
on that patrol

515
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,247
and then blackmailed me into
keeping quiet about the whole thing!

516
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,564
That's why he picked me.

517
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,857
I understand your feelings,

518
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,585
but that has nothing to do
with these charges you're being tried for.

519
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,445
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do.

520
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,158
But who else will?
You've got no witnesses.

521
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:01,203
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonise the court.

522
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,832
When this is over, I'm going
into the story of that patrol again.

523
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,752
Sir, in my case, Captain Renoir
had the sergeant draw lots.

524
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,172
I was picked purely by chance.

525
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,424
You're lucky. Look at me.

526
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,970
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

527
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,389
Me, a social undesirable.

528
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,975
- I didn't act like a coward!
- Neither did I!

529
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,188
Gentlemen, you must understand that
the reason you were picked is immaterial.

530
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,733
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

531
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:39,867
Stick to the stories you've told me. Don't
let the prosecutor shake you out of it.

532
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,329
You'll be soldiers in
the presence of superior officers,

533
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,332
so act like what you are - soldiers.

534
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,793
And brave ones at that.

535
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:53,297
I've been in the room you'll be sitting in.
The afternoon sun will be in your faces,

536
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:58,886
so don't let it seem as if you're dropping
your eyes in a hangdog manner.

537
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,222
When you answer questions,
look the judges in the eye.

538
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,391
Don't whine, plead or
make speeches - that's my job.

539
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:08,562
Simple statements - short, but make them
so they can be heard all over the room.

540
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:12,608
Try not to repeat yourselves.
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

541
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,733
We haven't much time.

542
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,947
The court martial begins in an hour
and I've got notes to look at.

543
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,408
Good luck.

544
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,577
Thank you, sir.

545
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,955
The court martial is open.
The prisoners may be seated.

546
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:19,174
This is a general court martial, so we shall
dispense with unnecessary formalities.

547
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,886
These men are charged with
cowardice in the face of the enemy,

548
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,848
and will be tried for that offence.

549
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:30,019
- Mr. Prosecutor?
- Call the accused. Private Ferol.

550
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,981
Mr. President, will the prosecutor
question the witnesses

551
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,150
without even reading the indictment?

552
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,611
Please don't take up
the court's time with technicalities.

553
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,490
The indictment is lengthy,
and there's no point in reading it.

554
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,451
The defence has a right
to know the exact...

555
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,619
the indictment is that the accused
showed cowardice

556
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,457
in the face of the enemy
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

557
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,209
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

558
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,671
Call the accused, Private Ferol.

559
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,099
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,936
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Ant Hill?

561
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,229
Yes, sir.

562
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,358
- Did you refuse to advance?
- No, sir.

563
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,611
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

564
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:26,075
- How far did you advance?
- To about the middle of no-man's-land, sir.

565
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,994
Then what did you do?

566
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,540
- There were machine-gun bullets...
- Answer the question. What did you do?

567
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,961
Well... I saw that me and Meyer...

568
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,130
I didn't ask you what you saw.

569
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:44,218
The court has no concern
with your visual experiences.

570
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,386
My what, sir?

571
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:49,390
- The prisoner will reply to the question.
- Yes, sir. What question was it?

572
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:53,352
You advanced to the middle of
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

573
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,230
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

574
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,940
I went back, sir.

575
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,442
In other words, Private Ferol,

576
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,029
you retreated.

577
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,156
Yes, sir.

578
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,410
That's all.
The accused may return to his seat.

579
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,495
Just a minute.

580
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,666
Mr. President, I'd like
to question the witness, if I may.

581
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,293
- Proceed, Colonel.
- Thank you.

582
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:24,049
Private, when you reached no-man's-land,
were you alone with Private Meyer?

583
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,509
Yes, sir.

584
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,845
What happened to
the rest of your company?

585
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,097
I don't know, sir.

586
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,349
I guess they had been killed or wounded.

587
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:36,186
You found yourself in the middle of
no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

588
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,311
Yes, sir.

589
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,399
Why didn't you attack
the Ant Hill single-handed?

590
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,864
Why didn't you storm the Ant Hill alone?

591
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,033
Just me and Meyer? You're kidding, sir.

592
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,329
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.
Thank you. That's all.

593
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,166
I don't see the point
of this line of questioning?

594
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,294
I'm attempting to indicate, sir,
the utter absurdity

595
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,589
of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

596
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,549
Mr. Prosecutor.

597
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,970
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated.

598
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,723
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

599
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,142
I knew we should have took Ant Hill

600
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,561
but we came on back.

601
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,398
That's all.

602
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,943
The accused may return to his seat.

603
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,664
Private Arnaud.

604
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,083
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

605
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,921
Until I was ordered back
to the trenches by Captain Renoir.

606
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:48,091
- How far did you advance?
- Into the wire, sir.

607
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:52,012
The... enemy wire, I suppose?

608
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,181
No, sir. It was our wire.

609
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,812
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

610
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,857
No, sir, I didn't.

611
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:07,653
How far would you say that was?
How many metres?

612
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,364
I advanced as far as I could.

613
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,868
- How many metres?
- Not many.

614
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,997
Not many.

615
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,418
Now, Private Arnaud.

616
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:30,801
Before you were ordered back, did you
urge your fellow soldiers forward?

617
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,427
Most of them were dead or wounded

618
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,433
before they got three steps
beyond the trenches.

619
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,475
- Reply to the question.
- I didn't urge them on. No, sir.

620
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,231
Thank you.

621
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,406
Private Arnaud.

622
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,575
At ease, please.

623
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,871
Aside from your sad failure
to give throat to spirited battle cries,

624
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,375
did your behaviour differ from
that of other men in your company?

625
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,003
Objection.
That's a matter of conjecture.

626
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,338
Sustained.

627
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,136
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

628
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,762
No, sir.

629
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,931
Is it true that you've
been designated a coward

630
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,892
simply and purely because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

631
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,937
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see that that's significant.

632
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,608
It's accepted practice in the French army
to pick examples by lot.

633
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,360
And since this entire company
advanced only a few metres,

634
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,363
picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case.

635
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,617
I'd like to point out that this soldier
has distinguished himself

636
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,911
in some of the bloodiest battles
of the war.

637
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,914
With court permission,
I'll read citations for bravery

638
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,335
that he's already earned
on two occasions.

639
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,796
First, citations in the orders in the army
for bravery...

640
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,256
That's immaterial, Colonel.

641
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,719
The accused is not being tried for former
bravery, but for his recent cowardice.

642
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,888
Medals are no defence.

643
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:05,020
- May I call witnesses to his character?
- You may not.

644
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:10,233
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

645
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,236
Mr. President, no one
in the entire regiment

646
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:16,573
got anywhere near the German wire,
including myself.

647
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,451
Call the next accused...

648
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,079
if you're through, Colonel.

649
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,373
Thank you.

650
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,750
The prisoner may return to his seat.

651
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,344
S0 you never even left the trenches?

652
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,182
- No, sir.
- That's all.

653
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:47,437
Corporal Paris, why didn't
you leave the trenches?

654
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,776
Major Vignon was shot and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

655
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:57,322
Were you lying unconscious in
the trenches during the entire attack?

656
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,448
Yes, sir.

657
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,243
That's all.

658
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,787
Have you any witnesses to that?

659
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,957
No, sir. I guess everybody
was too busy to notice me,

660
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,084
and there were so many others
lying dead anyway.

661
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:13,338
- But you have no witnesses?
- No, sir.

662
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,341
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

663
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,970
That could have been self-inflicted later.

664
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,639
Thank you. You may stand down.

665
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,022
Mr. Prosecutor,
you can make your plea now.

666
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,405
Gentlemen of the court,

667
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,409
this case speaks for itself.

668
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:46,663
All of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

669
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,877
And I submit that that attack

670
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,839
was a stain on the flag of France,

671
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:02,304
a blot on the honour of every man,
woman and child in the French nation.

672
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:13,182
It is to us that the sad,
distressing, repellent duty falls.

673
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:16,818
Gentlemen, I ask this court

674
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,614
to find the accused guilty,

675
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,663
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the code of military justice.

676
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,877
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

677
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,714
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

678
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,850
Gentlemen of the court,

679
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,937
there are times when I'm ashamed
to be a member of the human race,

680
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,105
and this is one such occasion.

681
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,153
It's impossible for me to summarise
the case for the defence,

682
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,780
since the court never allowed me

683
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,074
a reasonable opportunity
to present my case.

684
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,869
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

685
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:14,793
Yes, sir. I protest against being
prevented from introducing evidence

686
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,754
that I consider vital to the defence.

687
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,799
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

688
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:25,595
There has never been a written indictment
of charges made against the defendants.

689
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,431
And lastly, I protest against the fact

690
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:32,269
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

691
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:45,657
The attack yesterday morning
is no stain on the honour of France,

692
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,954
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

693
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:56,126
But this court martial
is such a stain, and such a disgrace.

694
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:00,380
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

695
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,885
Gentlemen of the court,
to find these men guilty

696
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:11,308
will be a crime to haunt each of you
till the day you die.

697
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,441
I can't believe that
the noblest impulse of man,

698
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,362
his compassion for another,
can be completely dead here.

699
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,366
Therefore, I humbly beg you,

700
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,579
show mercy to these men.

701
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,965
The accused will be escorted back to
the guardroom. The hearing is closed.

702
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,593
The court will now retire to deliberate.

703
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:50,513
There will be a guard of six men
under arms. Rifles loaded, bayonets fixed.

704
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,015
Two men to each prisoner.

705
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,851
Any sign of trouble,
the prisoners will be instantly covered.

706
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:58,605
If the trouble doesn't subside at once,
the prisoner will be shot on the spot.

707
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,192
Everything must all go off without a hitch
and with the least possible delay.

708
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,946
It shouldn't be hurried,
but there must be no fumbling around.

709
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,115
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible

710
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,243
for any lack of order, or for any mistakes.

711
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:17,499
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame, and with interest,

712
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,085
to any one of you who fails in his duties.

713
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,089
Execution will take place at seven o'clock,

714
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,217
according to the verdict
of the court martial.

715
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,596
Detail, attention! Dismissed!

716
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,696
This is compliments of General Mireau.

717
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,906
- Duck.
- Well, tell him thanks!

718
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,742
Don't blame me, soldier.

719
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,078
Are we supposed to eat
this with our fingers?

720
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:59,040
The guard says you can't
have any knives or forks.

721
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,251
Is this supposed to be our last meal
or something?

722
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,921
It isn't supposed to be our last meal.
It is our last meal.

723
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,549
This duck is terrific.

724
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,010
Do you suppose they put
anything in the food?

725
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,804
First they poison us, then they shoot us?

726
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,310
- I think they put something in it.
- Like what?

727
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:23,565
Like, uh... something
to make us groggy or something.

728
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,859
What would be wrong
with that if they did?

729
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,070
Maybe nothing for you,
but I'm gonna get out of this somehow,

730
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,864
and I don't wanna be drugged.

731
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,951
How are you gonna get out?
Chew your way through that stone wall?

732
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,871
I don't know. Colonel Dax.
He'll see us through.

733
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,083
Listen, we gotta get outta here.

734
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,853
They're gonna kill us in a few hours
if we don't.

735
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,213
- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's gotta be a way.

736
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,759
How many guards
do you think they've got out there?

737
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,054
They may have a couple of squads.
That's what it sounded like this morning.

738
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,557
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the 3rd Battalion.

739
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,810
Anyway, right now we have no friends.

740
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,897
Why kid yourself?
We're not gonna get out of this.

741
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,109
Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

742
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,237
See that cockroach?

743
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,407
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

744
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,620
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

745
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,581
I'll be nothing and it'll be alive.

746
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,750
Now you've got the edge on him.

747
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,800
Good evening, my sons. I'm Father Dupré.

748
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,013
Is there any news?

749
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,141
I'm afraid I bring you very bad news.

750
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,452
You must prepare yourselves
for the worst.

751
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,229
- Colonel Dax asked me to tell you.
- Oh, mercy, no!

752
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,273
He's been in telephone contact
with army headquarters,

753
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:51,402
but unable to speak to General Broulard
or for that matter to anyone in authority.

754
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,489
The same way at Division.
No one wants to be found.

755
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,950
- How much time do we have?
- You have plenty of time yet.

756
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,537
Certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves.

757
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:05,792
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

758
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,877
Amen.

759
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,930
Father, will you take this letter
for me, please?

760
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,098
Of course, my son.

761
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:24,102
It's to my wife. She won't understand
this, and I tried to explain it to her.

762
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:29,274
I'll see that she gets it.
Do you want me to hear your confession?

763
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:33,444
Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

764
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,156
I know you're trying to help
and I appreciate it,

765
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,284
but if I started praying now
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

766
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,913
That's an error, my son. God is
always ready to listen to your prayers.

767
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,461
All right, Father.
Will you please hear my confession now?

768
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,881
Yes.

769
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:57,760
Have faith in your Creator, my son.
Death comes to us all.

770
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,263
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

771
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:03,057
That's really deep,
"Death comes to us all".

772
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,351
That really is deep.

773
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:08,438
Say Ferol, what's the matter?
Afraid your luck isn't going to hold out?

774
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:12,817
Well, look. This is my religion.
O great bottle, forgive me my sins,

775
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,446
for now I lay me down to sleep.
May I drink you first? Thank you. Amen.

776
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,867
I understand your anguish, my son,
but you must not let it harden your heart.

777
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,203
May I tell you something, Father?

778
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,538
Back in my home town,
there was a certain little café

779
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,749
with an amusing sign over the bar.

780
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:33,379
It read "Do not be afraid to ask for credit
for our way of refusing is very polite."

781
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:37,383
- Come on, Arnaud. Sit down, you're drunk.
- Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

782
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,470
Get out of here with
your sanctimonious pat answers!

783
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,406
What are you hanging around here for,
to torture us?

784
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,890
No, to help you with all my power.

785
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,059
Your power, you have no power!

786
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,645
- God has power.
- Does he? What a laugh!

787
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,522
- You can be saved.
- Saved? I'll be saved?

788
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,903
Cut it out, Arnaud!

789
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,947
Arnaud!

790
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,032
Arnaud.

791
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,374
Father, get a doctor. Quick.

792
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,261
That should keep him quiet long enough.

793
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,305
That's a nasty skull fracture, though.
He may not live out the night.

794
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,934
- What are we supposed to do with him?
- My advice is to tie him to a stretcher

795
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,103
so he won't slip
when you tilt him vertically.

796
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,147
Surely they won't execute
a man in that condition?

797
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,292
I'm sorry, Father.
The sentence will be carried out.

798
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,610
I've already checked with the general.

799
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,404
If he's still alive in the morning,

800
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,966
pinch his cheeks a couple of times
before you take him out on the field.

801
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,710
It may make him open his eyes.
The general wants him to be conscious.

802
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,912
Yes?

803
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,793
- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in.

804
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,547
Sergeant Boulanger
said you wanted to see me, sir.

805
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,299
Yes, Lieutenant.

806
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,552
Looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant
thing on our hands in a few hours.

807
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,888
- You mean the execution, sir.
- Yes, I mean the execution.

808
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:09,309
- Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.
- "Very unfortunate."

809
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:13,521
- That's just how I feel about it.
- None of us are happy about it, sir.

810
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,566
How did you happen
to pick Corporal Paris?

811
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,319
Well, I had to pick somebody, sir.

812
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,528
That's right, you did.

813
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,156
Of course you had no personal motive
in picking Paris, did you?

814
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,033
Oh, no, sir.

815
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,411
You picked him because
he was a coward, didn't you?

816
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,081
Did you or didn't you?

817
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,250
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

818
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,755
Like you say, somebody had to be picked.

819
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,465
It was quite a problem, sir.

820
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,259
Yes, I had the same kind of problem.
I have to pick someone

821
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,345
to be in charge of
the firing squad tomorrow.

822
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,598
Do you have any objections
to taking the job?

823
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,434
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

824
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,938
What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

825
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,983
No... Yeah, I feel all right, sir.
It's just that I...

826
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,862
- Would you like me to open a window?
- No, sir.

827
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:08,201
Well, it's... just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

828
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:13,748
Oh, there's nothing to it. First, you help
the sergeant tie the men to the posts.

829
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:18,878
Of course, you offer the men blindfolds
and... if they want them, you tie them on.

830
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:24,509
You take your position with the firing
squad, raise your sword - ready, aim, fire.

831
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,429
Then you draw your revolver out,
you walk forward,

832
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,015
and put a bullet through each man's head.

833
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,603
Sir, I request that I be
excused from this duty.

834
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,356
- Request denied.
- Colonel...

835
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,943
You've got the job. It's all yours.
That's all, Lieutenant.

836
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,112
- Colonel, if you could...
- That's all, lieutenant!

837
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,739
- Yes?

838
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:50,076
- Excuse me, sir. Colonel Dax?
- Yes?

839
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,745
My name is Rousseau, sir.
Captain of artillery.

840
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,123
What is it, Captain?

841
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:05,258
I have something to tell you, sir, that may
have a great bearing on the court martial.

842
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,009
Come in, Captain.

843
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,150
- Colonel, good evening!
- Good evening, sir.

844
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:07,361
- Good evening. Come and sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

845
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,256
I'm really sorry to intrude
on you in this way.

846
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,508
Not at all. I'm always delighted
to see you, colonel Dax.

847
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:14,243
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you, sir.

848
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,747
- Well, I...
- I think you'll find it delicious.

849
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,601
I apologise for not inviting you
to join the party downstairs tonight,

850
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,836
but I'm afraid that it's a dress affair.

851
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:29,258
Thank you, sir, but I must confess
that this is not entirely a social visit.

852
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:33,304
Oh, come, Dax, let's not go
over all that ground again.

853
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:38,518
I must admit that judging
from the casualties,

854
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,621
the efforts of your regiment
must have been considerable.

855
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:44,482
How can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

856
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,068
Colonel, you're choosing to take
a rather simple view of this.

857
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,278
The attack was impossible from the start.

858
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:52,740
The general staff
must have known that.

859
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,827
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing
a good job running the war.

860
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,539
You must be aware of the fact
that the general staff is subject

861
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:03,251
to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians.

862
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,170
Maybe the attack against
the Ant Hill was impossible.

863
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,549
Perhaps it was an error of judgement
on our part. On the other hand,

864
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:13,844
if your men had been a little more daring,
they might have taken it. Who knows?

865
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,263
In any case,

866
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:19,141
why should we have to bear any more
criticism for the failure than we have to?

867
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,185
Aside from the inescapable fact

868
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,038
that a good many of your men
never left the trenches,

869
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,374
there's the question of the troops' morale,
don't forget that.

870
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,149
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

871
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,194
These executions will be
a tonic for the division.

872
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,155
There are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating

873
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:34,699
than seeing someone else die.

874
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,075
I never thought of that, sir.

875
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,077
You see, colonel, troops are like children.

876
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:42,498
Just as a child wants his father to
be firm, troops crave discipline.

877
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:46,294
One way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

878
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:52,049
May I ask... do you sincerely believe
all the things you've just said?

879
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:02,518
It's been a pleasure discussing this with
you, but I'd better get back to my guests.

880
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,730
Forgive me for having
kept you from your party.

881
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:11,152
By the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau

882
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,530
ordered his own battery
commander, Captain Rousseau,

883
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:17,908
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

884
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,624
Of course, the captain refused
without a written order.

885
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:28,919
But General Mireau demanded that
he commence firing on our own trenches.

886
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,464
Rousseau refused
without an order in writing,

887
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:37,678
but again he was ordered, and again
he refused... all in front of witnesses.

888
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,514
Do you actually believe
this fantastic story?

889
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,644
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

890
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,522
Battery Commander Rousseau,
Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter,

891
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:52,401
the telephone clerk, and, uh...
my own deposition.

892
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:56,614
What has all this got to do with the charge
against the condemned prisoners?

893
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,284
A general in a tantrum
over the failure of an impossible attack

894
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,162
orders his artillery to
fire on his own men.

895
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:06,791
Now, the same officer on the same day

896
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:12,046
orders a court martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

897
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:16,967
General, what would your newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

898
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,805
Colonel Dax,
are you trying to blackmail me?

899
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,892
Sir, that's an ugly word,
but you are in a difficult position.

900
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:29,730
Too much has happened. Someone's
got to be hurt. The only question is who.

901
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,318
General Mireau's assault
on the Ant Hill failed.

902
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,321
His order to fire on
his own troops was refused,

903
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:42,618
but his attempt to murder three innocent
men to protect his own reputation

904
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:45,162
will be prevented by the general staff.

905
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:56,674
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax?
I've been rude to my guests too long.

906
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,246
Detail, halt!

907
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,583
Order arms!

908
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,294
Fall out.

909
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,905
Courage, my sons. The worst is over.

910
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,544
Morning, Paris.

911
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,963
Morning, Sergeant.

912
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,508
- How are you today?
- Not too bad.

913
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,719
How are you?

914
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,807
You missed some good chow
in here last night.

915
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,184
What'd you have?

916
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,356
Have you got a drink for us?

917
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,900
Take a swig of this.

918
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,656
It just occurred to me... a funny thing.

919
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:49,870
I haven't had one sexual thought since the
court martial. It's extraordinary, isn't it?

920
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,542
Pull yourself together. Act like a man.

921
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:58,003
Listen, Paris, are you listening to me?

922
01:10:58,128 --> 01:10:59,981
There'll be a lot of dignitaries
and newspaper men out there.

923
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,883
You've got a wife and family.
How do you wanna be remembered?

924
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,301
I don't wanna die.

925
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,012
Many of us'll be joining you
before this war's over.

926
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,515
I don't care. I don't wanna die.

927
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,812
- Please save me, Sergeant.
- I can't save you. No one can now.

928
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,483
This is the last decision
you'll have a chance to make on earth.

929
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,211
You can pull yourself together
and act like a man,

930
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,820
or we'll have to drag you out of here.

931
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,990
In the end, it'll all be the same.
It's up to you.

932
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:47,386
Let's get busy. You and Ferol, take your
coats off. It's no use hanging around here.

933
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,157
With the help of thy grace, to do penance,

934
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,326
and to amend my life.

935
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,544
Why do I have to die, Father?

936
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,675
Why do I have to die, Father?
I didn't do anything.

937
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,845
We do not question
the will of God, my son.

938
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:34,224
But I fought, I fought!
I fought on the battlefield.

939
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:38,103
Why don't they die?
Why don't you put them to death?

940
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:42,316
You showed courage in the face of the
enemy. Show it before your own troops.

941
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,777
But I'm scared, I'm scared.

942
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,156
Oh, Father, I'm scared.

943
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:52,660
Courage. Brace yourself, man.

944
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:04,338
He said "This day thou shalt
be with me in paradise."

945
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,757
- Really, Father?
- Yes.

946
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,301
Really, Father?

947
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,513
I'll never see my wife again.

948
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,394
I'll never see nobody again, Father.

949
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,938
Courage, man. Brace yourself.

950
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,732
- I can't help it!
- Brace yourself.

951
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:26,527
I can't help it, Father.

952
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,531
Oh, Christ, Christ.

953
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,410
Strengthen me, God.
Please strengthen me.

954
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,605
Secure prisoners!

955
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,360
Detail, attention!

956
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:10,529
Forward... march!

957
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,623
Detail...

958
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,585
halt!

959
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,754
Left... face!

960
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,207
In the name of the French people,

961
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:10,005
Corporal Phillip Paris, Private Maurice
Ferol, and Private Pierre Arnaud

962
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,549
of the 701st Regiment,

963
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:16,637
having been found guilty of cowardice
in the face of the enemy,

964
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:21,100
are to be executed
by rifle fire immediately,

965
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:25,187
in accordance with the judgement
of the military court martial.

966
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,986
Right face!

967
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,406
Forward march!

968
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:57,594
Do you want a blindfold?

969
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,681
Yes, Lieutenant, please.

970
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,855
I don't wanna die.

971
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,495
Do... do you want a blindfold?

972
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,123
No.

973
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,293
I'm sorry.

974
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,291
Ready!

975
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:12,836
Aim!

976
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,090
Fire!

977
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,638
I'm awfully glad you could be there,
George.

978
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:27,684
This sort of thing is always rather grim,
but this one had a kind of splendour to it.

979
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:30,979
I have never seen an affair
of this sort handled any better.

980
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:33,148
The men died wonderfully.

981
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:34,358
There's always that chance

982
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,794
that one of them will do something
that would leave a bad taste.

983
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:40,781
This time you couldn't ask for better.

984
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,532
Yes?

985
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,286
- Yes, Colonel?
- You wanted to see me, sir.

986
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:49,623
Oh, yes, yes!
Come in, Colonel, and sit down.

987
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,002
Colonel Dax. Your men died very well.

988
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,634
- Would you like some coffee, Colonel?
- No, thank you, sir.

989
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,971
By the way, I've been told
that you ordered your artillery

990
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:07,975
to fire on your own men
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

991
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:12,104
I did what? Who told you that?

992
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,315
Colonel Dax came to me
last night with the story.

993
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:21,780
Colonel Dax, I've always known
that you were a disloyal officer,

994
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:25,284
but I never dreamed that you
would stoop to anything so low as this.

995
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:29,705
General, I have sworn statements from
Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter,

996
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,416
Captain Rousseau, the battery commander
who refused your order.

997
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,876
I think it's infamous. Absolutely infamous.

998
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:37,438
Then there's no truth at all in the charge
made by colonel Dax?

999
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:39,715
I don't see how you can even ask me that.

1000
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,050
You cannot imagine
how glad I am to hear that, Paul.

1001
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,845
I'm certain that
you'll come through it all right.

1002
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,431
- I'll come through what?
- There'll have to be an inquiry.

1003
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,765
An inquiry?

1004
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,618
It won't amount to much,
those things never do.

1005
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:52,352
- The public forgets.
- Public?

1006
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,021
You have the right to clear your name.

1007
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:58,817
You cannot allow such violent insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

1008
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,820
So that's it.

1009
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,740
You're making me the goat -

1010
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:08,535
the only completely innocent man
in this whole affair.

1011
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:15,709
I have only one last thing
to say to you, George.

1012
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,171
The man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier.

1013
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:32,768
Well... It had to be done.

1014
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:36,313
France cannot afford to have
fools guiding her military destiny.

1015
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,566
I'm grateful to you for bringing
the matter to my attention.

1016
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:43,153
Colonel Dax, how would you like
General Mireau's job?

1017
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,282
- His what, sir?
- His job.

1018
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,786
Let me get this straight, sir.

1019
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,789
You're offering me
General Mireau's command?

1020
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,666
Come, Colonel Dax,
don't overdo the surprise.

1021
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:01,088
You've been after the job from the start.
We all know that, my boy.

1022
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:04,132
I may be many things, sir,
but I'm not your boy.

1023
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:07,135
Well, I certainly didn't mean to imply
any biological relationship.

1024
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,655
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- Are you trying to provoke me, Colonel?

1025
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,782
Why should I want to do that?

1026
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,451
Exactly. It would be a pity to lose
your promotion before you get it.

1027
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,770
A promotion you have
so very carefully planned for.

1028
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:22,651
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

1029
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,027
Colonel Dax!

1030
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:28,365
You will apologise at once, or else
you'll be placed under arrest!

1031
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:32,327
I apologise for not being
entirely honest with you.

1032
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:36,164
I apologise for not
revealing my true feelings.

1033
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:41,420
I apologise for not telling you sooner that
you are a degenerate, sadistic old man.

1034
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:45,507
And you can go to hell before
I apologise to you now or ever again!

1035
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,845
Colonel Dax,

1036
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,222
you're a disappointment to me.

1037
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:56,351
You have spoiled the keenness of
your mind by wallowing in sentimentality.

1038
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:58,562
You really did want to save those men,

1039
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,398
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

1040
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:05,193
You're an idealist, and I pity you,
as I would the village idiot.

1041
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,737
We're fighting a war,
a war we've got to win.

1042
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,948
Those men didn't fight, so they were shot.

1043
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:14,453
You bring charges against General
Mireau, so I insist that he answer them.

1044
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,038
Wherein have I done wrong?

1045
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,919
Because you don't know
the answer to that question...

1046
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,756
I pity you.

1047
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:54,993
Thank you.

1048
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:58,747
Gentlemen, we have a little
special entertainment for you.

1049
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,170
Sort of a little
diversion, as it were.

1050
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:09,966
As my wife always says, what
is life without a little diversion?

1051
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:16,556
Now, gentlemen, I give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy.

1052
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:22,395
From Germany, the land of the Hun.

1053
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:52,592
Gentlemen, a little pearl, washed
ashore by the tide of the war.

1054
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:59,766
Sag den Herrschaften guten Tag.

1055
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:02,102
Guten Tag.

1056
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:05,272
Hey, talk in a civilised language!

1057
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,234
It's true, the little lady
has her limitations.

1058
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:12,487
As a matter of fact,
she has absolutely no talent at all.

1059
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:16,616
Except, that is...
Well, maybe a little natural talent.

1060
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,374
The little lady can't dance,
she can't tell any jokes,

1061
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,544
and she can't balance
rubber balls on her little nose.

1062
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,045
Ah!

1063
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:32,924
But she can sing like a bird.
She has a throat of gold.

1064
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,177
Come on, honey!
Sing us a song! Come on!

1065
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:57,198

We have orders to move back
to the front immediately.

1082
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,674
- Well, give the men a few minutes more.
- Yes, sir.
