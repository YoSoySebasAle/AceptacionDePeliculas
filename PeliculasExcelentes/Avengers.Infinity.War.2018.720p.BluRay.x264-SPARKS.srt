1
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,137
<i>This is the Asgardian</i>

2
00:00:28,177 --> 00:00:30,567
<i>refugee vessel Statesman.</i>

3
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:34,786
<i>We are under assault.</i>

4
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,955
<i>I repeat, we are under assault.</i>

5
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:39,786
<i>The engines are dead,
life support failing.</i>

6
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:43,908
<i>Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.</i>

7
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,831
<i>We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.</i>

8
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,593
<i>Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.</i>

9
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:52,266
<i>We have very few soldiers here.</i>

10
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,222
<i>This is not a warcraft.</i>

11
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,307
<i>I repeat, this is not a warcraft.</i>

12
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,782
Hear me and rejoice.

13
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,333
You have had the privilege,

14
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,583
of being saved by the Great Titan.

15
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,481
You may think this is suffering.

16
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:28,965
No.

17
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,680
It is salvation.

18
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:39,934
Universal scales tip toward balance,

19
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:41,688
because of your sacrifice.

20
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,496
Smile.

21
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,464
Or even in death,

22
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,695
you have become Children of Thanos.

23
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,171
I know what it's like to lose.

24
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,934
To feel so desperately
that you're right,

25
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,208
yet to fail,

26
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:16,485
nonetheless.

27
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,140
It's frightening.

28
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,763
Turns the legs to jelly.

29
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,901
But I ask you, to what end?

30
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,551
Dread it,

31
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:38,214
run from it,

32
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,335
destiny arrives all the same.

33
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,456
And now, it's here.

34
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,738
Or should I say,

35
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,598
I am.

36
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:56,893
You talk too much.

37
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,514
The Tesseract.

38
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,764
Or your brother's head.

39
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,493
I assume you have a preference.

40
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,330
I do.

41
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:14,986
Kill away.

42
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,462
Alright, stop!

43
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,886
We don't have the Tesseract.

44
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,970
It was destroyed on Asgard.

45
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,800
You really are the worst brother.

46
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:59,038
I assure you brother,

47
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,701
the sun will shine on us again.

48
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,540
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

49
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,139
Well, for one thing,

50
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,639
I'm not Asgardian.

51
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,303
And for another,

52
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,757
we have a Hulk.

53
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:29,854
Let him have his fun.

54
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,524
Allfathers,

55
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,746
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

56
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,665
time.

57
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,808
That was a mistake.

58
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,522
No!

59
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,284
You're going to die for that.

60
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,297
My humble personage,

61
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,141
bows before your grandeur.

62
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,575
No other being,

63
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,557
has ever had the might,

64
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,601
nay the nobility,

65
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,716
to wield not one,

66
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:36,428
but two Infinity Stones.

67
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,475
The universe...

68
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:44,483
lies within your grasp.

69
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,370
There are two more stones on Earth.

70
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,536
Find them my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

71
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,497
Father, we will not fail you.

72
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,405
If I might,

73
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,825
interject.

74
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,413
If you're going to Earth,

75
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:39,378
you might want a guide.

76
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,723
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

77
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,529
If you consider failure experience.

78
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,119
I consider experience experience.

79
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,930
Almighty Thanos,

80
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,359
I...

81
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:53,623
Loki,

82
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:56,113
prince of Asgard,

83
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:00,831
Odinson,

84
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,737
the rightful king of Jotunheim,

85
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,302
god of mischief,

86
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,040
do hereby pledge to you,

87
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,967
my undying...

88
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:16,816
fidelity.

89
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,139
Undying?

90
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,433
You should choose your words
more carefully.

91
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:57,955
You,

92
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,666
will never be...

93
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,462
a god.

94
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,806
No!

95
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,138
No resurrections this time.

96
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,534
No.

97
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,092
Loki.

98
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,668
Seriously, you don't have any money?

99
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,048
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

100
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,438
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

101
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,641
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

102
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:50,279
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200 dollars?

103
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,153
Rupees.
Which is?

104
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:54,155
Buck and a half.

105
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,272
What do you want?

106
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,326
I would not say no to a tuna melt.

107
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,284
Thanos is coming.

108
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,414
He's coming.

109
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,576
Who?

110
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:29,990
Slow down, slow down.

111
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:31,192
I'll spell it out for you.
You're totally rambling.

112
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:32,159
No, I'm not.
You lost me.

113
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,697
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

114
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:34,902
and in the dream you got to pee.

115
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,038
Yeah.
Ok.

116
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,144
And then you're like, Oh my God.

117
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,918
Oh there is no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

118
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,616
Oh someone's watching.
Right.

119
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,079
I'm gonna go in my pants.
And then you wake up,

120
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,912
and in real life you actually have to pee.

121
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:43,996
Yes.
Yeah.

122
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,206
Ok.
Everybody has that.

123
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:46,940
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

124
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,395
Apropos of that,

125
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:51,421
last night, I dreamt, we had a kid.

126
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:52,984
It was so real.

127
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:55,242
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

128
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:56,142
What was his name?

129
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,140
Right.
Morgan!

130
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,241
Morgan.

131
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,221
So you woke up...
Naturally.

132
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,972
And thought that we were,

133
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,224
Expecting.
Yeah.

134
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:04,350
Yes?
No.

135
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,953
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

136
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,311
If you wanted to have a kid,

137
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,397
you would not have done that.

138
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,106
I'm glad you brought this up,
because it's nothing.

139
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,788
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

140
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:15,016
You're not helping your case, ok?

141
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:16,634
No, this is detachable. It's not a...

142
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,854
You don't need that.

143
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,416
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us,

144
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,490
and future usses and that's it.

145
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,292
Just in case there is a monster
in the closet.

146
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,560
Instead of, you know.
Shirts.

147
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,037
You know me so well.

148
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,357
God.
You finish all my sentences.

149
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,422
You should have shirts in your closet.

150
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:35,798
Yeah.

151
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,593
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

152
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:40,028
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

153
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,661
Show off this Harry Winston.

154
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,504
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

155
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,599
I should promise you.

156
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,059
Yes.
I will.

157
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,388
Thank you.

158
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,559
Tony Stark.

159
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,676
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.

160
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,292
I need you to come with me.

161
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,442
Congratulations on the wedding,
by the way.

162
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,615
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

163
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:02,945
We need your help.

164
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,494
It's not overselling it to say that

165
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,039
the fate of the universe is at stake.

166
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,409
And who's we?

167
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,500
Hey, Tony.

168
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:12,467
Bruce.

169
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:13,770
Pepper.

170
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,188
Hi.

171
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,423
You ok?

172
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,572
At the dawn of the universe,

173
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,419
there was nothing.

174
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,216
Then...

175
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,807
Boom.

176
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,686
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals,

177
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,336
hurtling across the virgin universe.

178
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,275
These Infinity Stones

179
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:39,005
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

180
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,405
Space.

181
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,699
Reality.

182
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,494
Power.

183
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,871
Soul.

184
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,165
Mind.

185
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,335
And Time.

186
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,179
Tell me his name again.

187
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,152
Thanos.

188
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,932
He's a plague, Tony.

189
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,963
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

190
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,118
He wipes out half the population.

191
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,507
He sent Loki.

192
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,277
The attack on New York, that's him.

193
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,318
This is it.

194
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,487
What's our timeline?

195
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,460
No telling.

196
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,026
He has the Power and Space Stones.

197
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,886
That already makes him the strongest
creature in the whole universe.

198
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:30,079
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony,

199
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:33,517
He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

200
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:35,727
Did you seriously just say
hitherto undreamt of?

201
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:37,914
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

202
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,572
Is that what it is?

203
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,664
I'm going to allow that.

204
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,776
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

205
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,292
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

206
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,250
No can do.

207
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:53,209
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

208
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,476
And I swore off dairy,

209
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:57,064
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me, so...

210
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,607
Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
Not bad.

211
00:14:58,774 --> 00:14:59,964
A bit chalky.

212
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:02,012
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

213
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,153
That's a thing?
Whatever.

214
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:04,519
Point is, things change.

215
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,408
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

216
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,421
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

217
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:12,668
Yeah, so conversely it may
also be his best chance against us.

218
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,288
So if we don't do our jobs.

219
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,372
What is your job exactly?

220
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,001
Besides making balloon animals.

221
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,471
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

222
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,489
Ok, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

223
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,392
The fact is we have this stone.

224
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:26,831
We know where it is.

225
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,535
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone,

226
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,630
and we have to find him now.

227
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:33,707
Yeah, that's the thing.

228
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:34,766
What do you mean?

229
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,097
2 weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

230
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:38,188
He's offline.

231
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,251
What?
Yeah.

232
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,692
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

233
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:44,088
I didn't lose him.
He's more than that. He's evolving.

234
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,654
Who could find Vision then?

235
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,524
Shit.

236
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,491
Probably Steve Rogers.

237
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,431
Great.

238
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,880
Maybe.

239
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,678
But...

240
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,403
Call him.

241
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,324
It's not that easy.

242
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,549
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

243
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,395
No.

244
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,299
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

245
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,095
Broke up?

246
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,974
Like a band?
Like, Like the Beatles?

247
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,641
Cap and I fell out hard.

248
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:18,324
We're not on speaking terms.

249
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,431
Tony,

250
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:21,784
listen to me.

251
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:24,294
Thor's gone.

252
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:27,435
Thanos is coming.

253
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:29,277
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

254
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:47,383
Flip phone.

255
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,872
Say Doc, you would not happen
to be moving your hair, would ya?

256
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,907
Not at the moment, no.

257
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:47,841
You ok?

258
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,024
Help him!
Banner!

259
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,531
Wong! Look alive!
Go, go! We got it!

260
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,858
Friday, what am I looking at?

261
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,194
<i>Not sure.
I'm working on it.</i>

262
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,369
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

263
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:58,371
in your back pocket, Doc!

264
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,038
Might wanna use it.

265
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:28,740
Ned, hey.

266
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,127
I need you to cause a distraction.

267
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:31,236
Holy shit.

268
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,955
We're all gonna die!

269
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,401
There's a spaceship!

270
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,325
What's going on?
Oh my God!

271
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,882
What's the matter with you kids?

272
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:47,909
You never seen a spaceship before?

273
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,715
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

274
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:03,948
Notify first responders.

275
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,897
<i>Will do.</i>

276
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,817
Hear me and rejoice.

277
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:39,114
You are about to die

278
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:41,160
at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

279
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,377
Be thankful,

280
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,894
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing,

281
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,454
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

282
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,550
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

283
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,735
Stonekeeper.

284
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,030
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

285
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,056
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

286
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,963
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

287
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,308
He means get lost, Squidward.

288
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,581
He exhausts me.

289
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:07,708
Bring me the stone.

290
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,523
Banner, you want a piece?

291
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,307
No, not really.

292
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,751
But when do I ever get what I want?

293
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:15,664
That's right.

294
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,759
Ok. Push!

295
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:18,980
It's been a while.

296
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:20,929
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

297
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:21,788
Ok.

298
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,933
Let me just, I need
to concentrate here for a second.

299
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,351
Come on, come on, man.

300
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,729
God!

301
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:30,801
Where's your guy?

302
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,066
I don't know.
We've sorta been having a thing.

303
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,329
It's no time for a thing.
I know.

304
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:36,753
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

305
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,286
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

306
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,674
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

307
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:48,463
It's ok.
I know.

308
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,897
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

309
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,252
I have him.
Damn it.

310
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,261
Where'd that come from?

311
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:22,864
<i>It's nanotech.
You like it?</i>

312
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,018
<i>A little something I,</i>

313
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,251
Doctor Banner,

314
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,346
if the rest of your green friend
won't be joining us,

315
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:42,046
<i>Gotta get that stone outta here, now.</i>

316
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:43,301
It stays with me.

317
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,258
Exactly. Bye.

318
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,190
Tony, you ok?

319
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,317
How we doing? Good? Bad?
<i>Really, really good.</i>

320
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,961
<i>Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?</i>

321
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:00,255
I'm trying. He won't come out.

322
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,948
<i>Hammer.</i>

323
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,583
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

324
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,877
Come out! Come out! Come out!

325
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,255
No!

326
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,804
What do you mean, no?

327
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,425
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

328
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,810
<i>Kid, where'd you come from?</i>

329
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:34,272
A field trip to MoMA.

330
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,268
What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

331
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,943
He's from space.

332
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,987
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

333
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,474
Your powers are quaint.

334
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,467
You must be popular with children.

335
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,251
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

336
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:19,295
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

337
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,376
You'll find removing...

338
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:36,040
a dead man's spell...

339
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,608
troublesome.

340
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,600
You'll only wish you were dead.

341
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:50,430
No!

342
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,103
<i>Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.</i>

343
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:56,847
On it!

344
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,264
Not cool.

345
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,868
Gotcha!

346
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:13,891
Wait!

347
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:24,589
Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

348
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:26,025
<i>Hang on, kid.</i>

349
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,450
<i>Wong, you're invited to my wedding.</i>

350
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,807
Give me a little juice, Friday.

351
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,984
Unlock 17:A.

352
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,655
Pete, you got to let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

353
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:23,255
But you said save the wizard!

354
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,313
I can't breathe.

355
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,203
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

356
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,323
Yeah. That makes sense.

357
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,508
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

358
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:51,718
<i>Happy trails, kid.</i>

359
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,220
<i>Friday, send him home.
Yep.</i>

360
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,639
Come on!

361
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,659
<i>Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.</i>

362
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:07,234
<i>Tony? Oh my God.</i>

363
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:08,596
<i>Are you alright?
What's going on?</i>

364
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:09,851
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. I just think</i>

365
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:11,492
<i>we might have to push our 8:30 res.</i>

366
00:26:11,494 --> 00:26:12,322
<i>Why?</i>

367
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,907
<i>Just because I'll probably...</i>

368
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,480
<i>not make it back for a while.</i>

369
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,892
<i>Tell me you're not on that ship.</i>

370
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:18,828
Yeah.

371
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,667
<i>God, no.</i>

372
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:21,619
<i>Please tell me you're not on the ship.</i>
Honey, I'm sorry.

373
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,565
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
<i>Come back here.</i>

374
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,903
<i>Tony. I swear to God.</i>
Pep?

375
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:26,654
<i>Come back here right now.</i>

376
00:26:27,076 --> 00:26:28,077
<i>Come back.</i>

377
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,893
<i>Boss, we're losing her.</i>

378
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,052
<i>I'm going too.</i>

379
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,370
Oh my God!

380
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,109
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

381
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,328
Where you going?

382
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,412
The Time Stone's been taken.

383
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,302
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

384
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:10,208
What will you do?

385
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,715
I'm gonna make a call.

386
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,591
Sing it, Drax!

387
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,656
Why are we doing this again?

388
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,357
It's a distress signal, Rocket.

389
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:11,684
Someone could be dying.

390
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,823
I get that, but why are we doing it?

391
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,044
Because we're nice.

392
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,903
And maybe whoever it is

393
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,726
will give us a little cheddar
cheese for our effort.

394
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:21,076
Which isn't the point.
Which isn't the point.

395
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,117
I mean, if he doesn't pony up,

396
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:24,232
We take his ship.

397
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,188
Exactly!
Bingo!

398
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,316
Alright!

399
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,836
We are arriving.

400
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,254
Alright, Guardians,

401
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:34,888
don't forget this might be dangerous,

402
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,681
so let's put on our mean faces.

403
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,804
Groot, put that thing away, now.

404
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:44,966
I don't wanna tell you again.

405
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:46,094
Groot.

406
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,310
I am Groot!

407
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,611
Language!

408
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:49,335
Hey!

409
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,854
You got some acorns on you, kid.

410
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,400
Ever since you got a little sap,

411
00:28:53,402 --> 00:28:54,403
you're a total d-hole.

412
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:58,550
Now keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

413
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,973
What happened?

414
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,544
Oh my God.

415
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:20,032
Looks like we're not getting paid.

416
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,183
Wipers! Wipers!

417
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,172
Get it off.

418
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,787
How the hell is this dude still alive?

419
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,943
He is not a dude.

420
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,252
You're a dude.

421
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:39,692
This.

422
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,527
This is a man.

423
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,731
A handsome,

424
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:45,161
muscular man.

425
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,327
I'm muscular.

426
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:47,420
But who are you kidding, Quill?

427
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:49,008
You're one sandwich away from fat.

428
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:49,956
Yeah, right.

429
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,973
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

430
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:52,498
What?

431
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,432
Gamora, do you think I'm...

432
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:00,707
He is anxious,

433
00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:02,486
angry.

434
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,680
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

435
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,309
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

436
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,437
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Ok.

437
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,315
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

438
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,642
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

439
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:18,203
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

440
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:19,319
It's like his muscles

441
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:21,314
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

442
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,198
Stop massaging his muscles.

443
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:25,992
Wake him up.

444
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,079
Wake.

445
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,248
Who the hell are you guys?

446
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,897
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

447
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,233
To bring balance to the universe

448
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,010
by wiping out half of all life.

449
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,230
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

450
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:05,063
massacre by massacre.

451
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,527
Including my own.

452
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,733
If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

453
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:10,974
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

454
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,947
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

455
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:15,507
Gamora,

456
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:18,420
is the daughter of Thanos.

457
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,551
Your father killed my brother.

458
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:25,918
Boy.

459
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,282
Stepfather, technically.

460
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:29,824
And she hates him
as much as you do.

461
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:34,978
Families can be tough.

462
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,852
Before my father died,

463
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,721
he told me that I had a half-sister,

464
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:40,336
that he imprisoned in Hel.

465
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,399
And then she returned home,

466
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,318
and stabbed me in the eye.

467
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,642
So I had to kill her.

468
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,393
That's life though, isn't it I guess.

469
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,158
Goes round and round and,

470
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:50,994
I feel your pain.

471
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,454
I feel your pain as well, because,

472
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,861
I mean, it's not a competition,

473
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,249
but I've been through a lot.

474
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,981
My father killed my mother.

475
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,281
And then I had to kill my father.

476
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:00,784
That was hard.

477
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:03,345
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

478
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,001
Plus I...

479
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,139
came out with both
my eyes, which was,

480
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,396
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

481
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,699
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of...

482
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,061
A 4-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

483
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,265
 what are you doing?
Taking your pod.

484
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,026
No, you're not.

485
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:28,774
You will not be
taking our pod, today sir.

486
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:33,191
Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

487
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,124
No.
You are.

488
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,119
You're imitating the god-man.

489
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,396
It's weird.
No, I'm not.

490
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:43,289
He just did it again!
This is my voice.

491
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,053
Are you mocking me?

492
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,431
Are you mocking me?
Stop it. You did it again.

493
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:56,216
He's trying to copy me.
I need you to stop doing that.

494
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:57,972
Enough!
He's doing it first.

495
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,597
We need to stop Thanos.

496
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:02,067
Which means we need to find out
where he's going next.

497
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,111
Knowhere.

498
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,494
He must be going somewhere.

499
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:07,406
No, no. Knowhere?

500
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,908
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

501
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,810
Excuse me, that's our food.
Not anymore.

502
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,326
Thor,

503
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:16,486
why would he go to Knowhere?

504
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,914
Because for years,

505
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,425
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

506
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:21,751
with a man called the Collector.

507
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,895
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

508
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,492
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

509
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,054
Or a genius.
How do you know,

510
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,048
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

511
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,857
There are six stones out there.

512
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:34,851
Thanos already has the Power Stone,

513
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,017
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

514
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,377
He stole the Space Stone from me,

515
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,356
when he destroyed my ship
and slaughtered half my people.

516
00:33:43,718 --> 00:33:45,665
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

517
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:46,479
They're with the Avengers.

518
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,820
The Avengers?
Earth's mightiest heroes.

519
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:49,996
Like Kevin Bacon?

520
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,679
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

521
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
I haven't been there in a while.

522
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:55,333
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

523
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:56,828
No one even knows where it is.

524
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,746
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

525
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:00,378
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

526
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:02,614
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

527
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,085
You're welcome.

528
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:05,598
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

529
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,493
Wrong.

530
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,431
Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

531
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,757
That's a made-up word.
All words are made up.

532
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,680
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

533
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,515
That place is a legend.

534
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:18,438
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

535
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,029
to ever torment the universe.

536
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:22,315
I would very much
like to go there, please.

537
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:23,473
The rabbit is correct

538
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:25,172
and clearly the smartest among you.

539
00:34:25,174 --> 00:34:25,763
Rabbit?

540
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:28,017
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

541
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,012
I assume you're the captain, sir.

542
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:31,015
You're very perceptive.

543
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,322
You seem like a noble leader.

544
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:34,121
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

545
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,655
Let me just ask the captain.

546
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,080
Wait a second, it's me!

547
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,870
Yeah. I'll go.
Wonderful!

548
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,646
Except for that I'm the captain.

549
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:41,122
Quiet.

550
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:43,002
That's my backpack.
Go sit down.

551
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,709
Look, this is my ship.

552
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,462
And I'm not going to...

553
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,879
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talking about here?

554
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,318
The Thanos-killing kind.

555
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,793
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

556
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:55,976
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

557
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:56,929
Your bodies would crumble

558
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,386
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

559
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,363
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

560
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:01,318
A little bit, yeah.

561
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,097
If we don't go to Knowhere,

562
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,852
and Thanos retrieves another stone,

563
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,397
he'll be too powerful to stop.

564
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,817
He already is.
I got it figured out.

565
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,445
We got two ships

566
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:12,210
and a large assortment of morons.

567
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,932
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

568
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,882
And the morons will go to Knowhere

569
00:35:16,884 --> 00:35:18,228
to try to stop Thanos.

570
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,649
Cool? Cool.
So cool.

571
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:21,923
For the record,

572
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,123
I know that you're going with him,

573
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,405
because it's where Thanos isn't.

574
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,959
You know, you really should not

575
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,308
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

576
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:31,464
Come on, Groot.

577
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,448
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

578
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,813
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

579
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:42,247
Bye.

580
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,157
Vis?

581
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,827
Is it the stone again?

582
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,620
It's as if it's speaking to me.

583
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,449
What does it say?

584
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,415
I don't, I don't know, but something.

585
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,671
Hey.

586
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,089
Tell me what you feel.

587
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:33,031
I just feel you.

588
00:36:41,814 --> 00:36:43,889
So there is a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow,

589
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:46,094
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

590
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,372
What if I miss that train?

591
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,791
There's an 11:00.

592
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:50,724
What if I missed all the trains?

593
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,463
What if this time I didn't go back?

594
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,215
But you gave Stark your word.

595
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:57,385
I'd rather give it to you.

596
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,747
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

597
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:00,928
We both made promises.

598
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:02,381
Not to each other.

599
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:04,331
Wanda.

600
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,614
For 2 years,
we've stolen these moments,

601
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:09,388
trying to see if this could work and...

602
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,480
I don't know. I beleiv... as...

603
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,441
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

604
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,377
I... I... I think I...

605
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,630
I... I think...
It works. It works.

606
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:17,619
It works.
It works.

607
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:21,590
Stay.

608
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,095
Stay with me.

609
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,921
Or not. If I'm overstepping,

610
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:40,917
What are they?

611
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,752
What the stone was warning me about.

612
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,127
I have to go.

613
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,649
No, Vision.

614
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,711
Vision, if that's true then...

615
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:01,275
maybe going isn't the best idea.

616
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,202
Wanda I...

617
00:38:03,832 --> 00:38:04,805
Vision!

618
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:34,504
The blade,

619
00:38:34,951 --> 00:38:36,306
it stopped me from phasing.

620
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:39,597
Is that even possible?
It isn't supposed to be.

621
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,871
My systems are failing.

622
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,450
I'm beginning to think,

623
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:45,931
we should have stayed in bed.

624
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,932
Vis!

625
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,100
Give up the stone,

626
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,078
and she lives.

627
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:40,854
Hands off.

628
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,022
Come on. Come on.

629
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,750
Come on, you got to get up.

630
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,497
You got to get up.
Come on.

631
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,091
Hey.

632
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:04,862
Hey. We have to go.

633
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:09,079
Please. Please leave.

634
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:10,779
You asked me to stay.

635
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,704
I'm staying.
Please.

636
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,478
Get up.
I can't.

637
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:29,072
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

638
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,621
You'll never get the chance again.

639
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:48,936
Can you stand?

640
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,514
Thank you, Captain.

641
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,526
Let's get you on the jet.

642
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:06,608
Now, I thought we had a deal.

643
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,222
Stay close, check in,

644
00:42:09,631 --> 00:42:11,114
don't take any chances.

645
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,261
I'm sorry.

646
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,368
We just wanted time.

647
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,537
Where to, Cap?

648
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:22,208
Home.

649
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:28,485
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

650
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:54,418
<i>Zehobereians.</i>

651
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,118
Mother!

652
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:56,260
Where's my mother?

653
00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:57,652
<i>Choose a side or die.</i>

654
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,480
Mother!

655
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:01,497
<i>One side is a revelation,</i>

656
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,708
<i>the other an honor
known only to a few.</i>

657
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:07,132
What's wrong, little one?

658
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:08,857
My mother.

659
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:11,144
Where is my mother?

660
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,137
What's your name?

661
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,347
Gamora.

662
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,652
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

663
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,189
Come.

664
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:26,876
Let me help you.

665
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:41,087
Look.

666
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,128
Pretty, isn't it?

667
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:48,868
Perfectly balanced,

668
00:43:49,034 --> 00:43:50,593
as all things should be.

669
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:52,749
Too much to one side,

670
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:54,881
or the other,

671
00:43:58,804 --> 00:43:59,705
Here.

672
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:01,609
You try.

673
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:08,897
<i>Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.</i>

674
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:14,973
Concentrate.

675
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,035
There. You've got it.

676
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:31,473
Gamora.

677
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:33,873
Do you know if these grenades

678
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:36,305
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

679
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,964
Because I was thinking about hanging
a couple on my belt right here.

680
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:40,189
But I don't want to...

681
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,593
I need to ask a favor.

682
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,506
Yeah, sure.

683
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:46,422
One way or another,

684
00:44:46,424 --> 00:44:48,545
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

685
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,197
Which is what the grenades are for.

686
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:55,489
Yeah. I'm sorry.
What's the. What's the favor?

687
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,844
If things go wrong,

688
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:01,904
If Thanos gets me,

689
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,499
I want you to promise me,

690
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,959
you'll kill me.

691
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,711
What?

692
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,819
I know something he doesn't.

693
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:22,394
And if he finds it out,

694
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:25,091
the entire universe could be at risk.

695
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:26,219
What do you know?

696
00:45:26,392 --> 00:45:28,050
If I tell you, you'd know too.

697
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,169
If it's so important,

698
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:34,483
should not I?

699
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:35,818
Only if you wanna die.

700
00:45:35,843 --> 00:45:37,963
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

701
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:39,988
Just...

702
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:43,327
Trust me.

703
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,412
And possibly kill me.

704
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,360
I mean,

705
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:48,078
I'd like to.

706
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,507
I really would. But you...

707
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,071
Swear to me.

708
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:56,405
Swear to me on your mother.

709
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:05,097
Ok.

710
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,193
Ok.

711
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:29,580
Dude.

712
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:31,206
How long have you been
standing there?

713
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:32,333
An hour.

714
00:46:32,896 --> 00:46:33,817
An hour?

715
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:35,809
Are you serious?

716
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:37,731
I've mastered the ability...

717
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:40,852
of standing so incredibly still,

718
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:44,312
that I become invisible to the eye.

719
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:46,430
Watch.

720
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:51,817
You're eating a zarg-nut.

721
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:53,712
But my movement,

722
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,134
was so slow,

723
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,727
that it's imperceptible.

724
00:46:59,304 --> 00:47:00,110
No.

725
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,717
I'm sure I'm invisible.

726
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,989
Hi, Drax.

727
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:07,353
Damn it.

728
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:28,966
This place looks deserted.

729
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:32,142
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

730
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:33,893
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

731
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:36,983
Let's put down right here.

732
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,410
I don't have it.

733
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:54,248
Everyone in the galaxy knows

734
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:55,671
you'd sell your own brother,

735
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,156
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket,

736
00:47:58,157 --> 00:47:59,763
to your pathetic collection.

737
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:10,066
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

738
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:14,268
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

739
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:18,803
I told you.

740
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:20,899
I sold it.

741
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,779
Why would I lie?

742
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:28,156
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

743
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,533
Like suicide.

744
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:32,586
You do understand.

745
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,232
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

746
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,033
I didn't know what it was.

747
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,714
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

748
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:41,980
It's him.

749
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:43,546
Last chance, charlatan.

750
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,930
Where's the stone?

751
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:48,510
Today,

752
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,012
Drax. Drax.

753
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,062
He pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

754
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,313
Drax, wait.

755
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,144
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

756
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:57,249
Drax.

757
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,384
Drax, Drax, Drax.

758
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:03,610
Listen to me.

759
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:05,561
He doesn't have the stone yet.

760
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,239
If we get it, then we can stop him.

761
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,406
We have to get the stone first.

762
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,612
Yeah.

763
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:12,777
No.

764
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:16,288
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

765
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,040
Sleep.

766
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:30,969
Ok.

767
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:35,223
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

768
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,851
The other right.

769
00:50:02,284 --> 00:50:03,434
Why?

770
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,218
Why you, daughter?

771
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,738
That was quick.

772
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,563
Magnificent!

773
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:46,320
Magnificent!

774
00:50:46,735 --> 00:50:48,392
Magnificent!

775
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,301
<i>Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?</i>

776
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,932
<i>In my heart, I knew you still cared.</i>

777
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:08,746
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

778
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,193
<i>Reality is often disappointing.</i>

779
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,737
That is, it was.

780
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:29,921
Now,

781
00:51:32,628 --> 00:51:35,260
reality can be whatever I want.

782
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,190
You knew I'd come.

783
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,056
I counted on it.

784
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,399
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

785
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,005
Thanos!

786
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:58,742
No!

787
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,815
Let her go, Grimace.

788
00:52:05,376 --> 00:52:06,257
Peter.

789
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:08,987
I told you to go right.

790
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:10,876
Now? Really?

791
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,296
You let her go!

792
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,549
Ah, the boyfriend.

793
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:15,448
No.

794
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:16,937
Like to think of myself

795
00:52:16,939 --> 00:52:19,670
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

796
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:21,807
Let her go.
Peter.

797
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:26,601
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

798
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,246
Not him.

799
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:40,395
You promised.

800
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,431
You promised.

801
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:48,231
Daughter.

802
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,817
You expect too much from him.

803
00:52:54,983 --> 00:52:56,568
She's asked, hasn't she?

804
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:01,289
Do it.

805
00:53:07,628 --> 00:53:08,911
Do it!

806
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,362
I told you to go right.

807
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,851
I love you more than anything.

808
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:26,757
I love you too.

809
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:42,355
I like him.

810
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,777
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

811
00:54:15,045 --> 00:54:17,672
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

812
00:54:17,784 --> 00:54:19,341
<i>On a stolen Quinjet</i>

813
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:21,320
<i>with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.</i>

814
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:23,456
You know they're only criminals because,

815
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:25,065
you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

816
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,085
<i>Oh my God, Rhodes.</i>

817
00:54:26,087 --> 00:54:29,642
<i>Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.</i>

818
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:30,864
If it weren't for those Accords,

819
00:54:30,866 --> 00:54:32,425
Vision would have been right here.

820
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:36,165
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

821
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:37,643
That's right.

822
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:41,571
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

823
00:54:41,808 --> 00:54:43,018
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

824
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,592
Not anymore.

825
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:51,918
Mr. Secretary.

826
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:58,463
<i>You got some nerve.</i>

827
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,414
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

828
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:02,500
You could use some of that right now.

829
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,468
<i>The world's on fire.</i>

830
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:09,861
<i>And you think all is forgiven?</i>

831
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:11,825
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

832
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:14,180
And I'm way past asking permission.

833
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:17,880
Earth just lost her best defender.

834
00:55:18,817 --> 00:55:20,026
So we're here to fight.

835
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,211
And if you wanna stand in our way,

836
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:25,791
we'll fight you too.

837
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:31,110
<i>Arrest them.</i>

838
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:32,924
All over it.

839
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:39,879
That's a court-martial.

840
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:43,740
It's great to see you, Cap.

841
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:45,541
You too, Rhodey.

842
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:47,030
Hey.

843
00:55:49,086 --> 00:55:49,741
Well...

844
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:51,065
You guys...

845
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,107
really look like crap.

846
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,520
Must've been a rough couple years.

847
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:58,356
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

848
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:00,767
I think you look great.

849
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:09,349
Yeah, I'm back.

850
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:12,787
Hi, Bruce.

851
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:19,227
Nat.

852
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:24,299
This is awkward.

853
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,641
So we got to assume
they're coming back, right?

854
00:56:28,644 --> 00:56:29,812
And they can clearly find us.

855
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:31,817
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

856
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,808
After the whole Accords situation,

857
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,450
he and Scott took a deal.

858
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,282
It was too tough on their families.
They're on house arrest.

859
00:56:37,283 --> 00:56:38,483
Who's Scott?
Ant-Man.

860
00:56:38,605 --> 00:56:40,339
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

861
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:41,898
Ok, look.

862
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:45,206
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe,

863
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:47,784
and he is not gonna stop until...

864
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,680
he gets...

865
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:51,651
Vision's stone.

866
00:56:51,653 --> 00:56:52,904
Then we have to protect it.

867
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,746
No, we have to destroy it.

868
00:56:56,977 --> 00:56:59,558
I've been giving a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.

869
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,236
About its nature.

870
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:03,750
But also its composition.

871
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,611
I think if it were exposed...

872
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:07,988
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source,

873
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:11,674
something very similar
to its own signature, perhaps...

874
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:15,517
its molecular integrity could fail.

875
00:57:16,176 --> 00:57:17,898
Yeah and you with it.

876
00:57:18,926 --> 00:57:20,386
We're not having this conversation.

877
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,586
Eliminating the stone is the only way

878
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:24,609
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

879
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:27,448
That's too high a price.

880
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:34,388
Only you have the power to pay it.

881
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,431
Thanos threatens half the universe.

882
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,987
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

883
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:44,496
But it should.

884
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,464
We don't trade lives, Vision.

885
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:51,048
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life,

886
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,705
to save how many millions of people?

887
00:57:52,707 --> 00:57:54,750
Tell me, why is this any different?

888
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:57,350
Because you might have a choice.

889
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:00,059
Your mind is made up

890
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,603
of a complex construct of overlays.

891
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:06,192
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

892
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:08,111
All of them mixed together,

893
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,895
all of them learning from one another.

894
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:11,876
You're saying Vision
isn't just the stone?

895
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,873
I'm saying that if we take out the stone,

896
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:16,883
there is still a whole lot of Vision left.

897
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:18,344
Perhaps the best parts.

898
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:19,600
Can we do that?

899
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:21,742
Not me, not here.

900
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,169
Well, you better find someone

901
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:25,525
and somewhere fast.

902
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,256
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys
have your old rooms back.

903
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,323
I know somewhere.

904
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,340
The Kingsguard and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

905
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,714
And the Border Tribe?

906
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:53,498
Those that are left.

907
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,080
Send word to the Jabari as well.

908
00:58:56,547 --> 00:58:58,490
M'Baku likes a good fight.

909
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:02,049
And what of this one?

910
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:05,194
This one may be tired of war.

911
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:08,542
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

912
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:32,570
Where's the fight?

913
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:34,946
On its way.

914
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:56,161
In all the time I've served Thanos,

915
00:59:58,137 --> 00:59:59,708
I have never failed him.

916
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:07,909
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan,

917
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,066
with the Time Stone still attached

918
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:12,237
to your vaguely irritating person,

919
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:14,646
there would be judgment.

920
01:00:23,709 --> 01:00:24,920
Give me...

921
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:30,292
the stone.

922
01:00:43,187 --> 01:00:45,415
You're a seriously loyal piece
of outerwear, aren't you?

923
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:47,095
Yeah, speaking of loyalty...

924
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:48,813
What the...

925
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,738
I know what you're gonna say.
You should not be here.

926
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,106
I was gonna go home.
I don't wanna hear it.

927
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,399
But it was such a long way down
and I just thought

928
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:54,526
about you on the way...
And now I got to hear it.

929
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:55,694
And kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

930
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:56,544
And this suit is...

931
01:00:57,132 --> 01:00:58,822
ridiculously intuitive, by the way.
God damn it.

932
01:00:58,824 --> 01:01:01,177
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

933
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,567
What did you just say?
I take that back.

934
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:05,215
And, and now, I'm here in space.
Yeah.

935
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:07,069
Rght where I didn't want you to be.

936
01:01:08,025 --> 01:01:09,902
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

937
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:11,155
This is a one-way ticket.

938
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:12,076
You hear me?

939
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:13,458
Don't pretend you thought this through.
No, I did...

940
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:13,955
I know you did.

941
01:01:13,956 --> 01:01:15,124
You could not have
No, I did think this through.

942
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:15,876
Possibly thought this through.

943
01:01:15,877 --> 01:01:17,536
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man,

944
01:01:17,538 --> 01:01:18,688
if there is no neighborhood.

945
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:22,195
Ok, that didn't really make sense,

946
01:01:22,197 --> 01:01:23,597
but you know what I'm trying to say.

947
01:01:26,681 --> 01:01:27,990
Come on. We got a situation.

948
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:30,824
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

949
01:01:30,826 --> 01:01:31,526
What's your plan?

950
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:32,608
Go.

951
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:34,452
Ok, ok...

952
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,963
Ok. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?

953
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:44,123
Painful, aren't they?

954
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:47,738
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

955
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,137
And any one of them,

956
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,174
could end your friend's life in an instant.

957
01:01:58,586 --> 01:02:00,177
<i>I got to tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i>

958
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,066
<i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i>

959
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:06,263
You've saved nothing.

960
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:09,644
Your powers are inconsequential

961
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:10,780
compared to mine.

962
01:02:11,354 --> 01:02:12,980
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

963
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:27,784
Yes!

964
01:02:28,297 --> 01:02:29,518
Wait. What are those?

965
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,681
Hey, we haven't officially met.

966
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:49,058
Cool.

967
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,520
We got to turn this ship around.

968
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:54,955
Yeah, now he wants to run.
Great plan.

969
01:02:54,957 --> 01:02:56,232
No, I want to protect the stone.

970
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:57,608
And I want you to thank me.

971
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,111
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

972
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,140
For what?

973
01:03:00,497 --> 01:03:02,072
Nearly blasting me into space?

974
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:04,005
Who just saved your magical ass?

975
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:04,639
Me.

976
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:05,658
I seriously don't know,

977
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,187
how you fit your head into that helmet.

978
01:03:07,189 --> 01:03:09,373
Admit it, you should have
ducked out when I told you to.

979
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,162
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

980
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:13,364
Unlike everyone else in your life,
I don't work for you.

981
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:14,834
And due to that fact,

982
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,268
we're now in a flying doughnut,

983
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:18,139
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

984
01:03:18,254 --> 01:03:20,173
I'm backup.
No, you're a stowaway.

985
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,340
The adults are talking.

986
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:24,428
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

987
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,051
What is he, your ward?

988
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:27,054
No.

989
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:29,479
I'm Peter, by the way.
Doctor Strange.

990
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,309
You're using our made-up names.

991
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:33,478
I'm Spider-Man, then...

992
01:03:34,452 --> 01:03:36,338
This ship is self-correcting its course.

993
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,341
Thing's on autopilot.

994
01:03:37,423 --> 01:03:38,451
Can we control it?

995
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,098
Fly us home?

996
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:44,989
Stark?
Yeah.

997
01:03:45,014 --> 01:03:46,407
Can you get us home?

998
01:03:46,574 --> 01:03:47,656
Yeah, I heard you.

999
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:51,448
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

1000
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:53,857
Under no circumstances

1001
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:56,062
can we bring the Time Stone
to Thanos.

1002
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,862
I don't think you quite understand

1003
01:03:57,863 --> 01:03:58,951
what's at stake here.
What? No.

1004
01:03:59,147 --> 01:04:01,462
It's you who doesn't understand,

1005
01:04:01,526 --> 01:04:04,279
that Thanos has been
inside my head for 6 years.

1006
01:04:04,312 --> 01:04:05,897
Since he sent an army to New York

1007
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:07,126
and now he's back.

1008
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:09,028
And I don't know what to do.

1009
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:11,096
So I'm not so sure

1010
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,234
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his,

1011
01:04:13,236 --> 01:04:16,132
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1012
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:18,769
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1013
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:21,268
So I say we take the fight to him.

1014
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:23,152
Doctor.

1015
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,111
Do you concur?

1016
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:30,137
Alright, Stark.

1017
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,578
We go to him.

1018
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:34,011
But you have to understand,

1019
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,480
if it comes to saving you,

1020
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:37,663
or the kid,

1021
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,086
or the Time Stone,

1022
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:42,088
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1023
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:43,782
I can't,

1024
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,593
because the universe depends on it.

1025
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:47,911
Nice.

1026
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:50,006
Good, moral compass.

1027
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:52,336
We're straight.

1028
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:54,599
Alright. Kid?

1029
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:57,893
You're an Avenger now.

1030
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,017
I thought you might be hungry.

1031
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,452
I always hated that chair.

1032
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:52,404
So I've been told.

1033
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:54,202
Even so,

1034
01:05:55,175 --> 01:05:57,025
I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

1035
01:05:57,955 --> 01:05:59,260
I hated this room.

1036
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,540
This ship.

1037
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,209
I hated my life.

1038
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:09,682
You told me that too.

1039
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:14,605
Every day.

1040
01:06:17,642 --> 01:06:19,602
For almost 20 years.

1041
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,223
I was a child when you took me.

1042
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:26,734
I saved you.

1043
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:31,006
No.

1044
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:33,388
No.

1045
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:36,144
We were happy on my home planet.

1046
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:37,620
Going to bed hungry,

1047
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,830
scrounging for scraps.

1048
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:42,761
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1049
01:06:42,902 --> 01:06:44,764
I'm the one who stopped that.

1050
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:47,380
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1051
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:48,996
The children born,

1052
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:50,953
have known nothing,

1053
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,490
but full bellies and clear skies.

1054
01:06:53,492 --> 01:06:55,044
It's a paradise.

1055
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,404
Because you murdered half the planet.

1056
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:02,284
A small price to pay for salvation.

1057
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:03,400
You're insane.

1058
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:05,481
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

1059
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:08,667
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1060
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:12,947
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1061
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:14,576
It needs correction.

1062
01:07:14,578 --> 01:07:16,227
You don't know that!

1063
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,900
I'm the only one who knows that.

1064
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:22,116
At least, I'm the only one,

1065
01:07:22,531 --> 01:07:24,466
with the will to act on it.

1066
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:27,595
For a time,

1067
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:30,724
you,

1068
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,052
had that same will,

1069
01:07:35,826 --> 01:07:38,002
as you fought by my side.

1070
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:39,909
Daughter.

1071
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:42,275
I'm not your daughter.

1072
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:47,548
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1073
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:49,801
And in doing so,

1074
01:07:49,892 --> 01:07:52,248
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1075
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,872
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1076
01:08:01,412 --> 01:08:03,500
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1077
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:07,018
I am disappointed.

1078
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,421
But not because you didn't find it.

1079
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:15,760
But because you did.

1080
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,561
And you lied.

1081
01:08:36,258 --> 01:08:37,232
Nebula.

1082
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:45,580
Don't do this.

1083
01:08:46,037 --> 01:08:47,175
Some time ago,

1084
01:08:47,177 --> 01:08:49,888
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1085
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:51,303
Please don't do this.

1086
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:53,536
And very nearly succeeded.

1087
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:55,633
So I brought her here.

1088
01:08:57,176 --> 01:08:58,427
To talk.

1089
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:06,797
Stop it.

1090
01:09:07,493 --> 01:09:08,429
Stop it.

1091
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:16,508
I swear to you on my life.

1092
01:09:17,016 --> 01:09:19,310
I never found the Soul Stone.

1093
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:25,204
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

1094
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:26,705
<i>You know what he's about to do.</i>

1095
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,458
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

1096
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,305
<i>All of them.
He can never get them all.</i>

1097
01:09:31,306 --> 01:09:31,877
<i>He will!</i>

1098
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:33,732
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

1099
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,423
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone,</i>

1100
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,385
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

1101
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,225
You're strong.

1102
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:49,164
Me.

1103
01:09:51,856 --> 01:09:53,440
You're generous.

1104
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:55,776
Me.

1105
01:09:57,778 --> 01:10:00,012
But I never taught you to lie.

1106
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:02,852
That's why you're so bad at it.

1107
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:09,982
Where is the Soul Stone?

1108
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:28,726
Vormir!

1109
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:47,932
The stone is on Vormir.

1110
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:52,658
Show me.

1111
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:56,795
I am Groot.

1112
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:58,088
Tinkle in the cup.

1113
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,404
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1114
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:01,842
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig before.

1115
01:11:01,981 --> 01:11:02,989
I am Groot.

1116
01:11:03,024 --> 01:11:05,906
Tree, pour what's in the cup out
into space and go in the cup again.

1117
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,331
You speak Groot?

1118
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:09,516
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1119
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:10,559
I am Groot.

1120
01:11:10,726 --> 01:11:12,518
You'll know when we're close.

1121
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:14,561
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1122
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:16,774
the blazing power of a neutron star.

1123
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:21,369
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

1124
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:23,542
It's truly awesome.

1125
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:30,981
Ok,

1126
01:11:31,545 --> 01:11:33,015
time to be the captain.

1127
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,540
So, dead brother?

1128
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:42,099
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1129
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,330
Well, he's been dead before.

1130
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,681
But, no this time I think
it really might be true.

1131
01:11:49,193 --> 01:11:51,529
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1132
01:11:51,642 --> 01:11:52,460
Both dead.

1133
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,229
But still got a mom, though?

1134
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:57,106
Killed by a dark elf.

1135
01:11:57,216 --> 01:11:58,217
A best friend?

1136
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,655
Stabbed through the heart.

1137
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:05,820
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1138
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:09,677
Absolutely.

1139
01:12:10,105 --> 01:12:13,633
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret,

1140
01:12:13,635 --> 01:12:15,317
they're all tremendous motivators.

1141
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:16,558
They really clear the mind.

1142
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,186
So I'm good to go.

1143
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:21,503
Yeah, but I mean this Thanos
we're talking about,

1144
01:12:21,656 --> 01:12:23,627
he's the toughest there is.

1145
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:25,968
Well, he's never fought me.
Yeah, he has.

1146
01:12:26,064 --> 01:12:27,607
He's never fought me twice.

1147
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:30,150
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1148
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:32,240
It better be some hammer.

1149
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:38,740
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1150
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,692
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1151
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,032
And every one of them
would have rather killed me,

1152
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:45,187
but none succeeded.

1153
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:48,134
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1154
01:12:48,657 --> 01:12:51,806
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards,

1155
01:12:51,808 --> 01:12:53,495
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1156
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:55,173
Fate wills it so.

1157
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:58,363
And what if you're wrong?

1158
01:13:02,228 --> 01:13:03,570
If I'm wrong then...

1159
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:06,532
what more could I lose?

1160
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:21,758
I could lose a lot.

1161
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:23,488
Me personally, I could lose a lot.

1162
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:28,906
Ok.

1163
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:31,126
Well...

1164
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,193
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

1165
01:13:34,195 --> 01:13:36,035
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1166
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:36,925
What's this?

1167
01:13:36,927 --> 01:13:38,124
What's it look like?

1168
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,876
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1169
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,294
He gave you his eye?

1170
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:43,703
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1171
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:46,525
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1172
01:13:48,774 --> 01:13:50,025
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1173
01:13:58,185 --> 01:13:59,719
I would have washed that.

1174
01:14:00,938 --> 01:14:03,398
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1175
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:05,419
Hey, we're here!

1176
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,103
I don't think this thing works.

1177
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,324
Everything seems dark.

1178
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:16,136
It ain't the eye.

1179
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:31,218
Something's wrong.

1180
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,554
The star's gone out.

1181
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,104
And the rings are frozen.

1182
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,660
I hope these dwarves are better

1183
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,414
at forging than they are cleaning.

1184
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:06,769
Maybe they realized,

1185
01:15:06,771 --> 01:15:08,940
that they live in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1186
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:11,460
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1187
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:17,044
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1188
01:15:17,065 --> 01:15:18,233
Yes, why?

1189
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:20,142
It look anything like that?

1190
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,314
I am Groot.

1191
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:26,907
Go back to the pod.

1192
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:32,487
Eitri, wait!

1193
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:34,239
Stop!

1194
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:36,158
Stop.

1195
01:15:37,085 --> 01:15:38,086
Thor?

1196
01:15:41,205 --> 01:15:42,412
What happened here?

1197
01:15:43,036 --> 01:15:45,330
You were supposed to protect us.

1198
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,930
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1199
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:51,215
Asgard is destroyed.

1200
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:54,373
Eitri?

1201
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:56,911
The glove, what did you do?

1202
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:12,846
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1203
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:17,366
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1204
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:21,328
I made what he wanted.

1205
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:24,190
A device,

1206
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:27,250
capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1207
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:30,322
Then he...

1208
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:33,888
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1209
01:16:36,655 --> 01:16:38,054
All except me.

1210
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:41,480
Your life is yours, he said.

1211
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:43,844
But your hands,

1212
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:46,604
your hands are mine alone.

1213
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,564
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1214
01:16:50,558 --> 01:16:52,380
Every weapon you've ever designed,

1215
01:16:52,382 --> 01:16:54,113
every axe, hammer, sword,

1216
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:56,048
it's all inside your head.

1217
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,114
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1218
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:00,186
Trust me, I know.

1219
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:02,170
But together,

1220
01:17:02,172 --> 01:17:03,907
you and I,

1221
01:17:04,081 --> 01:17:05,747
we can kill Thanos.

1222
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,484
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1223
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,693
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1224
01:17:57,549 --> 01:17:58,807
Hey, what's going on?

1225
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,052
I think we're here.

1226
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:02,227
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1227
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:06,031
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1228
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:07,349
Close those around it.

1229
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:08,639
Alright. Ok.

1230
01:18:08,694 --> 01:18:09,630
You made it?
Yep, got it.

1231
01:18:09,632 --> 01:18:10,913
This was meant for one big guy,

1232
01:18:10,915 --> 01:18:12,220
so we got to move at the same time.

1233
01:18:12,222 --> 01:18:12,930
Ok, ok. Ready.

1234
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:18,818
We might wanna turn.

1235
01:18:18,983 --> 01:18:20,235
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1236
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:50,736
You alright?

1237
01:18:52,976 --> 01:18:54,061
That was close.

1238
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:56,900
I owe you one.

1239
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,073
Let me just say, if aliens...

1240
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,569
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something,

1241
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,850
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1242
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,285
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1243
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:06,922
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1244
01:19:06,924 --> 01:19:08,512
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1245
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:16,837
Thanos!

1246
01:19:38,178 --> 01:19:39,443
Please don't put your eggs in me!

1247
01:19:41,856 --> 01:19:43,098
Stay down, clown.

1248
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:50,912
Die, blanket of death!

1249
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:59,754
Everybody stay where you are.
Chill the eff out.

1250
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:02,683
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1251
01:20:03,717 --> 01:20:04,968
Where is Gamora?

1252
01:20:05,017 --> 01:20:07,519
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1253
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:09,569
I'll do you one better.

1254
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:10,889
Why is Gamora?

1255
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:12,127
Tell me where the girl is,

1256
01:20:12,129 --> 01:20:14,160
or I swear to you I'm gonna
French fry this little freak.

1257
01:20:14,162 --> 01:20:16,962
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1258
01:20:17,947 --> 01:20:18,891
Do it, Quill!

1259
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,318
I can take it.

1260
01:20:20,374 --> 01:20:22,376
No, he can't take it!
She's right. You can't.

1261
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,164
Yeah?
You don't wanna tell me where she is?

1262
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:24,861
That's fine.

1263
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:27,909
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1264
01:20:28,014 --> 01:20:29,015
Starting with you.

1265
01:20:29,017 --> 01:20:30,102
Wait, what, Thanos?

1266
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,329
Alright, let me ask you this one time.

1267
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:34,623
What master do you serve?

1268
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:35,916
What master do I serve?

1269
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:37,596
What am I supposed to say,
Jesus?

1270
01:20:38,716 --> 01:20:39,459
You're from Earth.

1271
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:40,628
I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1272
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:41,995
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1273
01:20:41,997 --> 01:20:43,157
What are you hassling us for?

1274
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:44,810
So you're not with Thanos?

1275
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:47,272
With Thanos?

1276
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:50,461
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1277
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:52,331
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1278
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:54,889
We're the Avengers, man.

1279
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,479
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1280
01:20:57,646 --> 01:20:58,652
You know Thor?

1281
01:20:58,980 --> 01:20:59,712
Yeah.

1282
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:02,609
Tall guy, not that good-looking,
needed saving.

1283
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:03,833
Where is he now?

1284
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,501
This is the plan?
We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1285
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:22,712
It's a mold.

1286
01:21:23,621 --> 01:21:24,845
A king's weapon.

1287
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,801
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1288
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:30,967
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1289
01:21:31,384 --> 01:21:32,729
Did it have a name?

1290
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,484
Stormbreaker.

1291
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:37,036
That's a bit much.

1292
01:21:38,979 --> 01:21:40,128
So how do we make it?

1293
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:44,109
You'll have to restart the forge.

1294
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:47,279
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1295
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,534
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1296
01:21:55,992 --> 01:21:57,952
The hell happened to this planet?

1297
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:00,040
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1298
01:22:00,137 --> 01:22:02,436
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1299
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:06,392
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1300
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:08,642
We'll use it.

1301
01:22:08,945 --> 01:22:10,237
Alright, I have a plan.

1302
01:22:10,475 --> 01:22:11,622
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1303
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,080
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1304
01:22:13,082 --> 01:22:14,322
pin him down, get what we need.

1305
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:16,194
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1306
01:22:16,196 --> 01:22:17,239
We just want the gauntlet.

1307
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:19,178
Are you yawning?

1308
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,191
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

1309
01:22:22,803 --> 01:22:23,804
Did you hear what I said?

1310
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,617
I stopped listening after
you said, We need a plan.

1311
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,181
Ok, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1312
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:30,736
See, not winging it isn't really what they do.

1313
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,781
What exactly is it that they do?

1314
01:22:32,882 --> 01:22:34,574
Kick names, take ass.

1315
01:22:34,576 --> 01:22:35,827
Yeah, that's right.

1316
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:43,942
Alright, just get over here, please.

1317
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,377
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1318
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:48,184
Mr. Lord. Star-Lord is fine.

1319
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:52,295
We got to coalesce.

1320
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,580
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude,

1321
01:22:54,582 --> 01:22:54,995
Dude,

1322
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,790
don't call us plucky.

1323
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,328
We don't know what it means.

1324
01:22:58,698 --> 01:23:01,284
Alright, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan.

1325
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:03,858
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan,

1326
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,857
and that way it might be really good.

1327
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,984
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1328
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:09,045
What dance-off?

1329
01:23:09,047 --> 01:23:10,334
It's no. It's nothing.

1330
01:23:10,336 --> 01:23:11,616
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1331
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:12,762
Exactly like Footloose.

1332
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:15,348
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1333
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:16,283
It never was.

1334
01:23:16,494 --> 01:23:17,935
Don't encourage this, alright?
Ok.

1335
01:23:17,937 --> 01:23:19,755
We're getting no help
from Flash Gordon here.

1336
01:23:19,757 --> 01:23:20,589
Flash Gordon?

1337
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:22,182
By the way, that's a compliment.

1338
01:23:22,516 --> 01:23:24,071
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1339
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:25,854
So that 50% of me that's stupid,

1340
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:28,002
that's 100% you.

1341
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,407
Your math is blowing my mind.

1342
01:23:29,409 --> 01:23:30,702
Excuse me.

1343
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:33,152
But does your friend...

1344
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:35,054
often do that?

1345
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:38,494
Strange, we alright?

1346
01:23:48,875 --> 01:23:49,899
You're back. You're alright.

1347
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:50,811
Hi.

1348
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:52,369
Hey, what was that?

1349
01:23:52,487 --> 01:23:53,692
I went forward in time...

1350
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:56,468
to view alternate futures.

1351
01:23:57,033 --> 01:24:00,108
To see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.

1352
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:02,483
How many did you see?

1353
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,810
14,000,605.

1354
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:07,773
How many did we win?

1355
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:13,819
One.

1356
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:38,096
The stone had better be up there.

1357
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:42,672
For your sister's sake.

1358
01:25:03,819 --> 01:25:05,967
Welcome, Thanos,

1359
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:08,624
son of Alars.

1360
01:25:10,565 --> 01:25:11,888
Gamora,

1361
01:25:12,054 --> 01:25:13,983
daughter of Thanos.

1362
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:15,153
You know us?

1363
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,866
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1364
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,035
Where is the Soul Stone?

1365
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:24,412
You should know,

1366
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:28,208
it extracts a terrible price.

1367
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,127
I am prepared.

1368
01:25:33,588 --> 01:25:36,007
We all think that at first.

1369
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:42,684
We are all wrong.

1370
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:56,653
How is it you know this place so well?

1371
01:25:56,945 --> 01:25:58,910
A lifetime ago,

1372
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,283
I too, sought the stones.

1373
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:04,014
I even held one in my hand.

1374
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:06,265
But it cast me out,

1375
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:08,408
banished me here.

1376
01:26:08,832 --> 01:26:12,877
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1377
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:22,672
What you seek,

1378
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,404
lies in front of you.

1379
01:26:25,473 --> 01:26:27,123
As does what you fear.

1380
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:29,500
What's this?

1381
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:31,365
The price.

1382
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:36,502
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1383
01:26:37,652 --> 01:26:41,687
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1384
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:44,951
Tell me what it needs.

1385
01:26:45,176 --> 01:26:48,531
To ensure that whoever possesses it,

1386
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,012
understands its power,

1387
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:55,898
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1388
01:26:56,347 --> 01:26:57,231
Of what?

1389
01:26:58,214 --> 01:27:00,174
In order to take the stone,

1390
01:27:00,176 --> 01:27:02,595
you must lose that which you love.

1391
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:06,890
A soul,

1392
01:27:07,557 --> 01:27:08,808
for a soul.

1393
01:27:24,532 --> 01:27:25,921
All my life,

1394
01:27:25,923 --> 01:27:27,413
I dreamed of a day,

1395
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:29,203
a moment,

1396
01:27:30,538 --> 01:27:32,449
when you got what you deserved.

1397
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:36,835
And I was always so disappointed.

1398
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:41,822
But now,

1399
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:49,223
You kill and torture,

1400
01:27:51,184 --> 01:27:52,738
and you call it mercy.

1401
01:27:57,273 --> 01:27:59,087
The universe has judged you.

1402
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:02,742
You asked it for a prize,

1403
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:05,165
and it told you no.

1404
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,037
You failed.

1405
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,393
And do you wanna know why?

1406
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:14,499
Because you love nothing.

1407
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,399
No one.

1408
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:23,633
No.

1409
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:29,263
Really?

1410
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:31,391
Tears?

1411
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:33,729
They're not for him.

1412
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:49,328
No.

1413
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:52,432
This isn't love.

1414
01:28:53,507 --> 01:28:56,176
I ignored my destiny once.

1415
01:28:58,543 --> 01:29:00,354
I cannot do that again.

1416
01:29:01,212 --> 01:29:02,174
Even...

1417
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,099
for you.

1418
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:30,757
I'm sorry, little one.

1419
01:29:34,996 --> 01:29:36,247
No!

1420
01:31:13,376 --> 01:31:15,926
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1421
01:31:16,441 --> 01:31:17,969
I hope you're right about this.

1422
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:20,443
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1423
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:38,548
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

1424
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:39,724
to the rest of the world,

1425
01:31:39,726 --> 01:31:41,632
this is not what I imagined.

1426
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,551
And what did you imagine?

1427
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:45,209
The Olympics.

1428
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:47,128
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1429
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,727
Should we bow?

1430
01:32:02,894 --> 01:32:04,145
Yeah, he's a king.

1431
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,480
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1432
01:32:08,457 --> 01:32:09,417
What are you doing?

1433
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:11,907
We don't do that here.

1434
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:14,445
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1435
01:32:14,744 --> 01:32:17,541
Sir, sir I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

1436
01:32:17,554 --> 01:32:18,555
How we looking?

1437
01:32:18,592 --> 01:32:20,020
You will have my Kingsguard,

1438
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,555
the Border Tribe,

1439
01:32:21,768 --> 01:32:23,792
the Dora Milaje and...

1440
01:32:24,665 --> 01:32:26,957
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1441
01:32:30,424 --> 01:32:31,592
How you been, Buck?

1442
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:32,724
not bad,

1443
01:32:33,202 --> 01:32:34,457
for the end of the world.

1444
01:32:48,192 --> 01:32:50,191
The structure is polymorphic.

1445
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,831
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1446
01:32:53,945 --> 01:32:55,780
Why didn't you just reprogram

1447
01:32:55,782 --> 01:32:57,909
the synapses to work collectively?

1448
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:02,104
Because we didn't think of it.

1449
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:04,084
I'm sure you did your best.

1450
01:33:04,205 --> 01:33:05,414
Can you do it?

1451
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:09,428
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

1452
01:33:09,794 --> 01:33:12,785
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1453
01:33:13,581 --> 01:33:14,665
It will take time, brother.

1454
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,176
How long?

1455
01:33:17,178 --> 01:33:18,490
As long as you can give me.

1456
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,015
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1457
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:44,291
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1458
01:33:54,005 --> 01:33:55,840
God, I love this place.

1459
01:33:56,007 --> 01:33:57,633
<i>Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.</i>

1460
01:33:57,635 --> 01:33:59,670
<i>We got more incoming
outside the dome.</i>

1461
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,220
It's too late.

1462
01:34:21,075 --> 01:34:22,696
We need to destroy the stone now.

1463
01:34:22,825 --> 01:34:24,452
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1464
01:34:24,618 --> 01:34:25,953
We will hold them off.

1465
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:27,087
Wanda,

1466
01:34:27,409 --> 01:34:29,414
as soon as that
stone's out of his head,

1467
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:30,921
you blow it to hell.

1468
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:32,021
I will.

1469
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:33,521
Evacuate the city.

1470
01:34:33,928 --> 01:34:35,394
Engage all defenses.

1471
01:34:36,108 --> 01:34:37,568
And get this man a shield.

1472
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,136
<i>I don't think
you get the scientifics here.</i>

1473
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:52,170
<i>These rings are gigantic.</i>

1474
01:34:52,188 --> 01:34:53,320
<i>You wanna get them moving,</i>

1475
01:34:53,322 --> 01:34:55,399
<i>you're gonna need something
a lot bigger to yank them loose.</i>

1476
01:34:55,566 --> 01:34:57,610
Leave that to me.
<i>Leave it to you?</i>

1477
01:34:57,777 --> 01:35:00,905
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1478
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:10,331
<i>Fire the engines!</i>

1479
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:30,559
More power, rabbit!

1480
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:03,801
Well done, boy.

1481
01:36:05,594 --> 01:36:07,513
That's Nidavellir.

1482
01:36:27,754 --> 01:36:28,755
Damn it.

1483
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:30,536
Damn it? What's damn it?

1484
01:36:30,703 --> 01:36:32,121
<i>The mechanism is crippled.</i>

1485
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:33,704
What?
With the iris closed,

1486
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:34,907
I can't heat the metal.

1487
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:36,545
How long will it take to heat it?

1488
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:38,930
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1489
01:36:41,163 --> 01:36:42,206
I'm gonna hold it open.

1490
01:36:42,256 --> 01:36:43,461
That's suicide.

1491
01:36:43,687 --> 01:36:45,923
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1492
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:56,812
How we looking, Bruce?

1493
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:58,647
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1494
01:37:01,942 --> 01:37:04,028
This is amazing, man.

1495
01:37:04,111 --> 01:37:06,030
It's like being the Hulk without actually,

1496
01:37:09,867 --> 01:37:10,642
<i>I'm ok.</i>

1497
01:37:10,995 --> 01:37:12,027
<i>I'm ok.</i>

1498
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:14,699
I've got two heat signatures

1499
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,784
breaking through the tree line.

1500
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,320
Thank you for standing with us.

1501
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:47,585
Of course, brother.

1502
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,927
Where's your other friend?

1503
01:38:10,678 --> 01:38:13,055
You will pay for his life with yours.

1504
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:16,225
Thanos will have that stone.

1505
01:38:17,017 --> 01:38:18,477
That's not gonna happen.

1506
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:20,464
You are in Wakanda now.

1507
01:38:21,105 --> 01:38:24,567
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1508
01:38:25,725 --> 01:38:26,752
We...

1509
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,698
have blood to spare.

1510
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:42,463
They surrender?

1511
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,461
Not exactly.

1512
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,906
What the hell?

1513
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:17,494
Looks like we pissed her off.

1514
01:39:28,255 --> 01:39:29,798
They're killing themselves.

1515
01:40:06,206 --> 01:40:07,791
You see the teeth on those things?

1516
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:08,794
Alright, back up, Sam.

1517
01:40:08,796 --> 01:40:10,046
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1518
01:40:22,309 --> 01:40:24,073
<i>Cap, if these things circle the perimeter</i>

1519
01:40:24,075 --> 01:40:25,018
<i>and get in behind us,</i>

1520
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,814
<i>there is nothing
between them and Vision.</i>

1521
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:28,941
Then we better keep them
in front of us.

1522
01:40:29,149 --> 01:40:30,484
How do we do that?

1523
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:34,121
We open the barrier.

1524
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,078
On my signal,

1525
01:40:38,482 --> 01:40:40,870
open North-West, section eventeen.

1526
01:40:41,203 --> 01:40:43,080
<i>Requesting confirmation, My King.</i>

1527
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:44,771
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1528
01:40:44,998 --> 01:40:46,208
On my signal.

1529
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,335
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1530
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:53,090
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1531
01:41:05,936 --> 01:41:07,521
Wakanda forever!

1532
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:20,951
Now!

1533
01:41:51,273 --> 01:41:52,691
How much longer, Shuri?

1534
01:41:52,858 --> 01:41:54,401
I've barely begun, brother.

1535
01:41:54,568 --> 01:41:56,086
You might want to pick up the pace.

1536
01:42:03,452 --> 01:42:05,329
Allfathers, give me strength.

1537
01:42:05,496 --> 01:42:07,289
You understand, boy?

1538
01:42:07,456 --> 01:42:10,459
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

1539
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:12,836
It'll kill you.

1540
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,020
Only if I die.

1541
01:42:16,006 --> 01:42:17,007
Yes.

1542
01:42:17,508 --> 01:42:20,260
That's what killing you means.

1543
01:42:48,247 --> 01:42:50,165
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1544
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:42,820
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1545
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:44,579
Thor, you ok?

1546
01:43:50,183 --> 01:43:51,476
I think he's dying.

1547
01:43:51,643 --> 01:43:53,604
He needs the axe!

1548
01:43:55,063 --> 01:43:56,516
Where's the handle?

1549
01:43:59,443 --> 01:44:02,279
Tree, help me find the handle!

1550
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,215
There's too many of them!

1551
01:45:40,592 --> 01:45:42,671
You guys are so screwed now!

1552
01:45:46,049 --> 01:45:48,051
Bring me Thanos!

1553
01:46:21,073 --> 01:46:21,718
Yeah.

1554
01:46:25,422 --> 01:46:27,424
You're much more of a Thanos.

1555
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,481
I take it the Maw is dead.

1556
01:46:34,147 --> 01:46:36,492
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1557
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:40,562
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1558
01:46:41,021 --> 01:46:42,522
You may regret that.

1559
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:46,234
He brought you face-to-face
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1560
01:46:49,404 --> 01:46:51,227
And where do you think
he brought you?

1561
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:54,181
Let me guess.

1562
01:46:54,854 --> 01:46:55,900
Your home?

1563
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:01,190
It was.

1564
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:05,504
And it was beautiful.

1565
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:10,043
Titan was like most planets.

1566
01:47:10,759 --> 01:47:13,425
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1567
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:16,940
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1568
01:47:18,058 --> 01:47:19,267
Genocide.

1569
01:47:19,976 --> 01:47:21,040
But random,

1570
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,864
dispassionate, fair to rich
and poor alike.

1571
01:47:25,398 --> 01:47:27,196
They called me a madman.

1572
01:47:28,276 --> 01:47:30,320
And what I predicted came to pass.

1573
01:47:33,310 --> 01:47:35,460
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1574
01:47:35,826 --> 01:47:37,035
I'm a survivor.

1575
01:47:37,202 --> 01:47:39,101
Who wants to murder trillions.

1576
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:43,188
With all six stones,
I could simply snap my fingers.

1577
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:46,603
They would all cease to exist.
I call that...

1578
01:47:47,574 --> 01:47:48,525
mercy.

1579
01:47:50,632 --> 01:47:51,688
And then what?

1580
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:54,970
I'd finally rest,

1581
01:47:55,762 --> 01:47:58,677
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1582
01:48:00,259 --> 01:48:03,196
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1583
01:48:04,437 --> 01:48:06,306
I think you'll find our will...

1584
01:48:06,623 --> 01:48:09,152
equal to yours.

1585
01:48:10,569 --> 01:48:11,570
Our?

1586
01:48:17,907 --> 01:48:18,967
Piece of cake, Quill.

1587
01:48:19,445 --> 01:48:21,496
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1588
01:48:59,659 --> 01:49:00,669
Boom!

1589
01:49:02,016 --> 01:49:03,327
Don't let him close his fist.

1590
01:49:08,043 --> 01:49:09,044
Magic.

1591
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:10,670
More magic.

1592
01:49:11,504 --> 01:49:12,505
Magic with a kick.

1593
01:49:13,131 --> 01:49:14,132
Magic with a...

1594
01:49:15,467 --> 01:49:16,475
Insect!

1595
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:55,463
Well, well.

1596
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:56,673
You should have killed me.

1597
01:49:56,894 --> 01:49:58,604
It would have been a waste of parts!

1598
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:05,141
Where's Gamora?

1599
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:47,682
<i>Is he under?
Don't let up.</i>

1600
01:50:47,684 --> 01:50:50,523
Be quick. He is very strong.

1601
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:51,864
Parker, help!

1602
01:50:52,296 --> 01:50:53,072
Get over here.

1603
01:50:53,087 --> 01:50:54,801
<i>She can't hold him much longer.
Let's go.</i>

1604
01:51:00,488 --> 01:51:01,655
We got to open his fingers to get it off.

1605
01:51:01,656 --> 01:51:02,936
I thought you'd be hard to catch.

1606
01:51:02,937 --> 01:51:04,217
For the record, this was my plan.

1607
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:06,882
You're not so strong now?

1608
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:09,072
Where is Gamora?

1609
01:51:10,351 --> 01:51:11,589
My Gamora.

1610
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:13,634
No, bullshit!

1611
01:51:13,918 --> 01:51:15,211
Where is she?

1612
01:51:16,296 --> 01:51:17,826
He is in anguish.

1613
01:51:18,298 --> 01:51:19,170
Good.

1614
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:22,719
He, He mourns.

1615
01:51:23,261 --> 01:51:26,890
What does this monster have to mourn?

1616
01:51:27,918 --> 01:51:29,002
Gamora.

1617
01:51:32,562 --> 01:51:33,563
What?

1618
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:35,482
He took her to Vormir.

1619
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:37,978
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1620
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:40,362
But she didn't.

1621
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:45,255
Ok, Quill, you got to cool it
right now. You understand?

1622
01:51:46,326 --> 01:51:49,712
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1623
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:52,510
Tell me she's lying.

1624
01:51:54,501 --> 01:51:55,691
Asshole,

1625
01:51:55,907 --> 01:51:57,296
tell me you didn't do it!

1626
01:51:58,755 --> 01:52:02,000
I had to.

1627
01:52:02,926 --> 01:52:04,009
No, you didn't.

1628
01:52:04,903 --> 01:52:05,914
No, you didn't.

1629
01:52:10,058 --> 01:52:11,393
No, you didn't!
Quill!

1630
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:13,353
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

1631
01:52:14,062 --> 01:52:15,063
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

1632
01:52:15,188 --> 01:52:17,023
It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!

1633
01:52:20,652 --> 01:52:21,653
God.

1634
01:53:20,989 --> 01:53:23,214
Come and get some, space dogs!

1635
01:53:26,551 --> 01:53:29,137
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1636
01:53:29,304 --> 01:53:31,222
Come on! Get some!

1637
01:53:31,613 --> 01:53:33,656
How much for the gun?
Not for sale.

1638
01:53:34,142 --> 01:53:36,019
Ok. How much for the arm?

1639
01:53:37,896 --> 01:53:39,376
I'll get that arm.

1640
01:53:48,781 --> 01:53:49,782
New haircut?

1641
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:51,451
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1642
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:55,830
By the way, this is a friend
of mine, Tree.

1643
01:53:56,748 --> 01:53:58,450
I am Groot.

1644
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:00,948
I am Steve Rogers.

1645
01:54:21,189 --> 01:54:23,358
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1646
01:54:32,784 --> 01:54:34,494
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1647
01:54:35,078 --> 01:54:36,204
I'm doing it.

1648
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:01,729
Why was she up there all this time?

1649
01:55:02,689 --> 01:55:04,775
She's on the field. Take it.

1650
01:55:37,181 --> 01:55:39,309
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1651
01:55:42,061 --> 01:55:43,389
Somebody get to Vision!

1652
01:55:44,188 --> 01:55:45,982
<i>I got him!</i>
On my way.

1653
01:55:51,362 --> 01:55:53,895
He'll die alone. As will you.

1654
01:55:54,365 --> 01:55:55,658
She's not alone.

1655
01:56:21,893 --> 01:56:23,603
<i>Oh no! Oh no, you don't.</i>

1656
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:25,445
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1657
01:56:25,447 --> 01:56:27,789
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

1658
01:56:27,857 --> 01:56:28,858
<i>What? No! No!</i>

1659
01:56:32,612 --> 01:56:35,323
<i>Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!</i>

1660
01:56:37,325 --> 01:56:38,490
Hulk? Hulk,

1661
01:56:38,993 --> 01:56:40,917
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1662
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:41,955
Well this is it, man.

1663
01:56:41,957 --> 01:56:43,644
This is the last, last, last second.

1664
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:49,884
Hulk! Hulk!

1665
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:51,862
Hulk!

1666
01:56:53,148 --> 01:56:54,054
No!

1667
01:56:55,184 --> 01:56:58,111
Screw you, you big, green asshole!

1668
01:56:58,113 --> 01:56:59,376
I'll do it myself!

1669
01:57:00,139 --> 01:57:01,974
<i>Come on! Yeah!</i>

1670
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:15,639
<i>See ya!</i>

1671
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:29,521
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1672
01:57:41,114 --> 01:57:43,095
I thought you were formidable,
machine.

1673
01:57:43,850 --> 01:57:46,394
But you're dying, like any man.

1674
01:57:54,986 --> 01:57:56,237
Get outta here!

1675
01:57:59,657 --> 01:58:00,508
Go!

1676
01:58:19,427 --> 01:58:20,810
That was really gross.

1677
01:58:48,247 --> 01:58:49,457
I thought I told you to go.

1678
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:52,585
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1679
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,700
I got you. I got you.

1680
01:59:06,432 --> 01:59:08,434
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1681
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:55,461
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1682
01:59:56,912 --> 01:59:57,274
No!

1683
01:59:57,275 --> 02:00:00,194
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1684
02:00:03,769 --> 02:00:04,770
A fake.

1685
02:00:12,582 --> 02:00:14,206
You throw another moon at me,

1686
02:00:14,727 --> 02:00:16,044
and I'm gonna lose it.

1687
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,378
Stark.

1688
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:18,754
You know me?

1689
02:00:19,255 --> 02:00:20,213
I do.

1690
02:00:20,789 --> 02:00:23,520
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1691
02:00:24,969 --> 02:00:26,141
My only curse is you.

1692
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:29,891
Come on!

1693
02:00:57,678 --> 02:00:59,638
All that for a drop of blood.

1694
02:01:43,925 --> 02:01:45,719
You have my respect, Stark.

1695
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:50,513
When I'm done,
half of humanity will still be alive.

1696
02:01:56,018 --> 02:01:57,802
I hope they remember you.

1697
02:02:07,967 --> 02:02:09,093
Stop.

1698
02:02:15,602 --> 02:02:16,723
Spare his life,

1699
02:02:18,007 --> 02:02:19,585
and I will give you the stone.

1700
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:24,714
No tricks.

1701
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,511
Don't.

1702
02:03:21,937 --> 02:03:23,406
One to go.

1703
02:03:33,532 --> 02:03:34,590
Where is he?

1704
02:03:43,918 --> 02:03:45,294
Did we just lose?

1705
02:03:49,215 --> 02:03:50,480
Why would you do that?

1706
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,204
We're in the endgame now.

1707
02:04:22,682 --> 02:04:23,506
Are you ok?

1708
02:04:25,975 --> 02:04:27,628
What? What is it?

1709
02:04:29,964 --> 02:04:31,090
He's here.

1710
02:04:42,101 --> 02:04:43,411
Everyone, on my position.

1711
02:04:43,858 --> 02:04:45,047
We have incoming.

1712
02:04:47,898 --> 02:04:49,311
What the hell?

1713
02:05:15,384 --> 02:05:16,385
Cap.

1714
02:05:17,136 --> 02:05:18,258
That's him.

1715
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:21,483
Eyes up.

1716
02:05:22,188 --> 02:05:23,288
Stay sharp.

1717
02:05:47,708 --> 02:05:48,792
Wanda.

1718
02:05:49,835 --> 02:05:50,878
It's time.

1719
02:05:51,295 --> 02:05:52,077
No.

1720
02:05:52,463 --> 02:05:54,472
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1721
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:55,720
Look at me.

1722
02:05:56,284 --> 02:05:57,844
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

1723
02:05:57,986 --> 02:05:59,720
Don't.
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1724
02:06:01,889 --> 02:06:04,308
We are out of time.

1725
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:06,209
I can't.

1726
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,701
Yes, you can.

1727
02:06:08,646 --> 02:06:09,438
You can.

1728
02:06:11,398 --> 02:06:13,813
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1729
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:17,085
It's not fair.

1730
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:20,475
It should not be you, but it is.

1731
02:06:22,326 --> 02:06:23,369
It's alright.

1732
02:06:25,204 --> 02:06:26,564
You could never hurt me.

1733
02:06:35,965 --> 02:06:37,252
I just feel you.

1734
02:08:00,883 --> 02:08:02,009
It's alright.

1735
02:08:11,935 --> 02:08:13,270
It's alright.

1736
02:08:17,608 --> 02:08:18,692
I love you.

1737
02:08:48,013 --> 02:08:50,140
I understand, my child.

1738
02:08:51,683 --> 02:08:53,310
Better than anyone.

1739
02:08:54,978 --> 02:08:56,666
You could never.

1740
02:09:01,735 --> 02:09:04,466
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1741
02:09:06,532 --> 02:09:08,563
But now is no time to mourn.

1742
02:09:11,216 --> 02:09:12,151
Now...

1743
02:09:13,208 --> 02:09:15,225
is no time at all.

1744
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:39,731
No!

1745
02:10:37,706 --> 02:10:39,166
I told you,

1746
02:10:40,542 --> 02:10:42,377
you'd die for that.

1747
02:10:56,725 --> 02:10:58,477
You should have...

1748
02:11:01,104 --> 02:11:02,564
You should...

1749
02:11:05,067 --> 02:11:08,120
You should have gone for the head.

1750
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:11,240
No!

1751
02:11:44,648 --> 02:11:45,542
Daughter?

1752
02:11:53,490 --> 02:11:54,866
Did you do it?

1753
02:11:56,785 --> 02:11:57,645
Yes.

1754
02:12:06,211 --> 02:12:07,622
What did it cost?

1755
02:12:11,508 --> 02:12:12,640
Everything.

1756
02:12:23,457 --> 02:12:24,590
What did you do?

1757
02:12:26,064 --> 02:12:27,240
What'd you do?

1758
02:12:41,204 --> 02:12:42,235
Where'd he go?

1759
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:46,585
Thor.

1760
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:50,903
Where'd he go?

1761
02:12:51,673 --> 02:12:52,441
Steve?

1762
02:13:27,751 --> 02:13:28,759
Up, General.

1763
02:13:29,289 --> 02:13:29,974
Up!

1764
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:32,047
This is no place to die.

1765
02:13:47,104 --> 02:13:48,689
I am Groot.

1766
02:13:51,191 --> 02:13:53,754
No, no, no. No!

1767
02:13:54,228 --> 02:13:54,939
Groot.

1768
02:13:55,946 --> 02:13:56,658
No.

1769
02:14:10,377 --> 02:14:11,172
Sam!

1770
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:16,968
Sam, where you at?

1771
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,292
Something's happening.

1772
02:14:40,907 --> 02:14:41,848
Quill?

1773
02:14:49,458 --> 02:14:50,500
Steady, Quill.

1774
02:14:50,751 --> 02:14:51,918
Man.

1775
02:14:56,089 --> 02:14:57,090
Tony.

1776
02:15:00,635 --> 02:15:02,479
There was no other way.

1777
02:15:09,011 --> 02:15:10,012
Mr. Stark?

1778
02:15:14,232 --> 02:15:15,567
I don't feel so good.

1779
02:15:17,652 --> 02:15:18,653
You're alright.

1780
02:15:18,655 --> 02:15:20,128
I don't, I don't know what's happening.

1781
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:21,559
I don't... please...

1782
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,284
I don't want to go.

1783
02:15:24,367 --> 02:15:25,981
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

1784
02:15:26,244 --> 02:15:27,550
Please, I don't want to go.

1785
02:15:27,552 --> 02:15:28,803
I don't want to go.

1786
02:15:33,502 --> 02:15:34,569
I'm sorry.

1787
02:15:49,851 --> 02:15:50,950
He did it.

1788
02:16:16,086 --> 02:16:17,207
What is this?

1789
02:16:17,771 --> 02:16:18,946
What the hell is happening?

1790
02:16:36,189 --> 02:16:37,110
Oh God.

1791
02:17:28,867 --> 02:17:31,895

<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections May 2020</i></font>

1792
02:27:34,222 --> 02:27:35,657
Still no word from Stark?

1793
02:27:35,723 --> 02:27:36,974
No, not yet.

1794
02:27:37,141 --> 02:27:38,516
We're watching every satellite

1795
02:27:38,518 --> 02:27:40,394
on both hemispheres, but still nothing.

1796
02:27:41,507 --> 02:27:42,438
What is it?

1797
02:27:42,479 --> 02:27:44,815
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1798
02:27:45,107 --> 02:27:46,863
Same energy signature as New York?

1799
02:27:47,193 --> 02:27:48,424
Ten times bigger.

1800
02:27:49,998 --> 02:27:51,238
Tell Klein we'll meet him at...

1801
02:27:51,239 --> 02:27:52,281
Nick! Nick!

1802
02:28:05,865 --> 02:28:06,870
They ok?

1803
02:28:08,214 --> 02:28:09,417
There's no one here.

1804
02:28:19,517 --> 02:28:20,762
Call Control.

1805
02:28:21,769 --> 02:28:22,729
Code red.

1806
02:28:23,729 --> 02:28:24,590
Nick.

1807
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:27,400
Hill.

1808
02:28:42,850 --> 02:28:43,499
No.

1809
02:28:45,126 --> 02:28:45,870
Mother.
