This is Dora Bailey,
ladies and gentlemen...

7
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:45,421
talking to you from the front of
the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.

8
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,966
What a night, ladies and
gentlemen. What a night.

9
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,279
Every star in Hollywood is here to

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,595
make Monumental
Pictures' premiere...

11
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:58,684
of The Royal Rascal, the
outstanding event of 1927.

12
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:00,769
Everyone breathlessly awaits...

13
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,815
the arrival of Lina
Lamont and Don Lockwood.

14
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,817
Look who's arriving now.

15
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,653
It's that famous "zip"
girl of the screen...

16
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:11,905
the darling of the flapper set...

17
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:14,116
Zelda Zanders.

18
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,953
Zelda. Zelda.

19
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:22,458
Her new red-hot pash, J.
Cumberland Spendrill III...

20
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,711
that well-known eligible bachelor.

21
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:31,091
Zelda's had so much unhappiness, I
hope this time it's really love.

22
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:36,180
And here comes that
exotic star, Olga Mara.

23
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,432
Ooh.

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,312
And her new husband, the Baron
de la Bonnet de la Toulon.

25
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:46,160
They've been married
two months already,

26
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,150
but still as happy as newlyweds.

27
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:53,322
Well, well, well.
It's Cosmo Brown.

28
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,955
Cosmo is Don's best friend.

29
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,500
He plays the piano on the
set for Don and Lina...

30
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,212
to get them into those
romantic moods.

31
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,631
Oh, folks, this is it. This is it.

32
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,098
The stars of tonight's
picture, those

33
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,017
romantic lovers of the screen...

34
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,853
Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont.

35
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,279
Ladies and gentlemen, when you
look at this gorgeous couple...

36
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:38,033
it's no wonder they're a household
name all over the world.

37
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:40,369
Like "bacon and eggs."

38
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,872
"Lockwood and Lamont."

39
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,586
Don, tell me confidentially,
are these rumours true...

40
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,422
that wedding bells are soon
to ring for you and Lina?

41
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:55,759
Lina and I have no statement
to make at the present time.

42
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,219
We're just good friends.

43
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:01,431
You've come a long way together.
Won't you tell us how it happened?

44
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:04,893
Lina and I have made a number
of pictures together...

45
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:08,522
Oh, no, no, Don. I want your
story from the beginning.

46
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:11,692
Dora, not in front
of all these people.

47
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,906
The story of your success
is an inspiration...

48
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,409
to young people all
over the world.

49
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,035
Please.

50
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,208
Well, to begin with, any
story of my career...

51
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,254
would have to include my
lifelong friend, Cosmo Brown.

52
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:35,299
We were kids together, grew
up together, worked together.

53
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,466
Yes?

54
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:42,222
Well, Dora, I've had one motto
which I've always lived by:

55
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,767
"Dignity. Always dignity."

56
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:50,606
This was instilled in me by Mum
and Dad from the very beginning.

57
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,109
They sent me to the finest
schools, including dancing school.

58
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,445
That's where I first met Cosmo.

59
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:00,949
And with him, I used to perform
for Mum and Dad's society friends.

60
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,293
They used to make
such a fuss over me.

61
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,889
If I was very good,
I was allowed to

62
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,298
accompany Mum and
Dad to the theatre.

63
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,550
They brought me up on Shaw...

64
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,595
Molière, the finest
of the classics.

65
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,974
To this was added rigorous
musical training...

66
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:28,352
at the Conservatory of Fine Arts.

67
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,028
We rounded out our apprenticeship
at an exclusive dramatics academy.

68
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,073
And at all times...

69
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,991
the motto remained...

70
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:44,534
"Dignity.

71
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:46,703
Always dignity."

72
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:52,751
In a few years, we were ready to
embark on a dance concert tour.

73
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,089
We played the finest symphonic
halls in the country.

Get out of here.

89
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,315
Finally we decided to
come to sunny California.

90
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:41,860
We were stranded... We were
staying here, resting up...

91
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:45,197
when offers from the movie
studios started pouring in.

92
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:49,826
We sorted them out and decided
to favour Monumental Pictures.

93
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:53,705
Lina, you hate him. Resist him.
Keep that mood music going.

94
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:56,208
Now, Phil, you come
in. Keep on grinding.

95
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,795
Now you see her. Now
here's the bit,

96
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,004
Bert, where you get it on the jaw.

97
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,881
Cut.

98
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,008
No, no. That wasn't right.

99
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,488
You were supposed to
go over the bar and

100
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,554
crash into the
glasses. Try it again.

101
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:11,640
Okay, Bert? Bert.

102
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,934
Oh, that's swell, just swell.

103
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,144
Take him away, fellas.

104
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:20,023
You'll be all right. We've lost
more stuntmen on these pictures...

105
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:23,151
It'll take hours to get a new
one from Central Casting.

106
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,320
Mr Dexter, I can do that.

107
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,323
- You? You're a musician.
- That's a moot point.

108
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,325
No kidding. What's your name?

109
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,161
Don Lockwood, but the
fellas call me "Donald."

110
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,081
Wise guy, huh? Okay, I'll try you.

111
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,166
Get this guy into Bert's suit.

112
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:40,733
And remember, Lockwood,
you might be

113
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,963
trading that fiddle in for a harp.

114
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:46,258
Camera.

115
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,011
Phil, come in. Now you
see him. That's it.

116
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,722
Now, here's where you get
it right on the jaw.

117
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:55,725
Cut.

118
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,394
That was wonderful.

119
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,314
Got any more little
chores you want done?

120
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:02,691
Plenty.

121
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,321
Okay.

122
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:32,220
My roles in these
films were urbane...

123
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,805
sophisticated...

124
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:34,973
suave.

125
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,729
And of course, all through
those pictures...

126
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:44,399
Lina was, as always,
an inspiration to me.

127
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,359
Warm and helpful.

128
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,361
A real lady.

129
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,744
Hello, Miss Lamont. I'm Don
Lockwood, the stuntman.

130
00:09:57,872 --> 00:10:00,499
It was a thrill working
with you, Miss Lamont.

131
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,958
Hey, Don.

132
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,086
Meet the producer of the
picture, R.F. Simpson.

133
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:09,090
I just saw some rushes and asked
Dexter who the stuntmen were.

134
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,532
He said they were all
you. I'm putting

135
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,553
you and Lina together
in a picture.

136
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:16,181
Come to my office. We'll
discuss a contract.

137
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,183
Thanks, Mr Simpson.

138
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:25,106
Are you doing anything
tonight, Miss Lamont?

139
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,276
That's funny.

140
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,778
I'm busy.

141
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:39,120
Lina and I have had the same
wonderful relationship ever since.

142
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:43,291
But most important of all, I
continue living up to my motto:

143
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:44,960
"Dignity.

144
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,379
Always dignity."

145
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:49,965
Thank you, Don.

146
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,718
And I'm sure you and
Lina will continue

147
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,719
making movie history tonight...

148
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:59,724
in your greatest picture,
The Royal Rascal.

149
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:04,854
Get enough, boys?

150
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:21,871
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

151
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,977
She's so refined...

152
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:46,563
I think I'll kill myself.

153
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:29,898
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

154
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,070
We're thrilled at your
response to The Royal Rascal.

155
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,616
We had fun making it, and we hope
you had fun seeing it tonight.

156
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:46,831
We screen actors aren't much
good at speaking in public.

157
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,417
So we'll just act out our thanks.

158
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:03,014
- Hot diggity. It's a smash.
- Don, Lina, you were gorgeous.

159
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,141
Lina, you looked pretty
good for a girl.

160
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,060
What's the big idea?

161
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:11,231
Can't a girl get a word in
edgewise? They're my public too.

162
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,982
The publicity department...

163
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,861
thought it'd be better if Don made
all the speeches for the team.

164
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,029
Why?

165
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:21,366
You're beautiful. Audiences
think you got a voice to match.

166
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:24,452
We got to keep our stars from
looking ridiculous at any cost.

167
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,643
No one's got that much money.

168
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,957
What's wrong with the way I talk?

169
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,168
Am I dumb or something?

170
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,338
No, it's just that Don's had
so much more experience...

171
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,050
Next time, write me out a
speech. I could memorise it.

172
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:42,470
Sure. Why don't you recite
the Gettysburg Address?

173
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,225
What do you know about it, you
piano player? Are you anybody?

174
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:51,688
Donnie, how can you let him talk
to me like that, your fiancée?

175
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,273
My fia...

176
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,110
Lina, you've been reading
those fan magazines again.

177
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:00,530
Look, you shouldn't believe
all that banana oil...

178
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,907
that Dora Bailey dishes out.

179
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:07,120
Now, try to get this straight:
There is nothing between us.

180
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:09,914
There has never been
anything between us.

181
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:13,376
- Just air.
- Oh, Donnie, you don't mean that.

182
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,545
We'll be late for R.F.'s party.

183
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:19,424
Better go in separate cars to
break up the mobs. Come on, honey.

184
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,385
Ta-ta, Donnie. See you there.

185
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,679
"Donnie."

186
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:27,515
Can't that girl
take a gentle hint?

187
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:31,019
Haven't you heard? She's
irresistible. She told me so.

188
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,564
I can't get her out of my hair.
This romance for publicity...

189
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:37,275
The price of fame.
You've got the glory.

190
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,360
The little heartaches go with it.

191
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:43,323
Look at me. I got no glory. I
got no fame. I got no mansions.

192
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:46,075
I got no money. But I've got...

193
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,745
- What have I got?
- I don't know.

194
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,580
I got to get out of here.

195
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,549
Don't tell me. It's a flat tire.

196
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,969
This car hasn't given me
trouble in nearly six hours.

197
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,846
Hey, there's Don Lockwood.

198
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,973
Hey, give me an autograph.

199
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,602
- Give me your autograph.
- I want a souvenir.

200
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,479
I want a souvenir too.

201
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,066
Hey. You're playing rough
here. You're tearing my...

202
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:21,152
Hey, Cos, do something.
Call me a cab.

203
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:22,487
You're a cab.

204
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,572
Thanks a lot.

205
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,588
- Lady, keep driving.
- Get out.

206
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,508
- Everything's all right.
- I'll call a policeman.

207
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:45,426
- Just a few blocks.
- Don't hurt me.

208
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,846
- I'm not a criminal.
- I don't care...

209
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:51,683
You are a criminal. I've seen
that face. You're a gangster.

210
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:55,311
I've seen your picture in the
paper or in the post office.

211
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,521
Officer.

212
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,650
- This man jumped in my car and...
- Why, it's Don Lockwood.

213
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:03,611
- Don Lockwood?
- How are you? Out for a joy ride?

214
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:07,156
Just a lift. My car broke
down. I got surrounded by...

215
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:09,278
You're a lucky lady.
Anything wrong?

216
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,279
Why, no.

217
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,161
No, I should think
not. Good night.

218
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:14,038
Good night, officer.

219
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:19,460
Well, thanks for saving my
life. I'll get out now.

220
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,630
I'm driving to Beverly Hills.
Can I drop you some place?

221
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,123
I'd like to get out
of this suit if

222
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,343
you're going by Camden and Sunset.

223
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,970
Yes, I am.

224
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:36,019
I'd like to know whose
hospitality I'm enjoying.

225
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,021
Selden. Kathy Selden.

226
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,231
Enchanted, Miss Selden.

227
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,358
I'm sorry I frightened you.

228
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,820
I was getting a little too
much love from my fans.

229
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,740
Oh, that's what you
were running away from.

230
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:51,951
They did that to you?
That's terrible.

231
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:57,290
Yes. Yes, it is, isn't it?

232
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,042
It is terrible.

233
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,503
Well, we movie stars
get the glory...

234
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:06,341
I guess we have to take the little
heartaches that go with it.

235
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:10,762
People think we lead lives
of glamour and romance...

236
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,847
but we're really lonely.

237
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,391
Terribly lonely.

238
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,895
I really can't tell
you how sorry I

239
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:20,188
am about taking you
for a criminal.

240
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:22,468
But it was understandable,
under the

241
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,484
circumstances. I
knew I'd seen you.

242
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:27,195
Which of my pictures
have you seen?

243
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,446
I don't remember.

244
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,448
I saw one once.

245
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,993
- You saw one once?
- I think you were duelling.

246
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:36,204
And there was a girl. Lina Lamont.

247
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,247
I don't go to the movies much.

248
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,542
If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

249
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:43,711
Thank you.

250
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,129
No offence.

251
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,465
Movies are entertaining
for the masses...

252
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:50,760
but the personalities on the
screen don't impress me.

253
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:54,639
They don't talk or act. They
just make a lot of dumb show.

254
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,307
Well, you know.

255
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
Like that.

256
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,771
You mean, like what I do.

257
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:03,856
Well, yes.

258
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:07,026
Here we are, Sunset and Camden.

259
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,280
Wait, you mean I'm not an actor?

260
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,950
- Pantomime isn't acting?
- Of course not.

261
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:17,745
Acting means great parts,
wonderful lines, glorious words.

262
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,122
Shakespeare. Ibsen.

263
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:21,249
What's your lofty
mission in life...

264
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,794
that lets you sneer at
my humble profession?

265
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,754
I'm an actress. On the stage.

266
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,506
Oh, on the stage.

267
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,134
I'd like to see you.
What're you in now?

268
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:34,595
I could brush up on my English
or bring an interpreter.

269
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,681
That's if they'd let
in a movie actor.

270
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:39,767
I'm not in a play now. But
I'm going to New York...

271
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:42,320
You're going to New
York, and someday

272
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,355
we'll all hear of you, won't we?

273
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,942
Kathy Selden as Juliet, as
Lady Macbeth, as King Lear.

274
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,569
You'll have to wear a beard.

275
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,281
Laugh if you want, but the stage
is a dignified profession.

276
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,408
Why are you so conceited?

277
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,612
You're nothing but a shadow on
film. You're not flesh and blood.

278
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:00,613
Stop.

279
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:02,331
What can I do? I'm only a shadow.

280
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,461
Keep away from me. Just because
you're a big movie star...

281
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,423
you expect every girl to faint
at your feet. Don't touch me.

282
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:13,134
Fear not, sweet lady. I
will not molest you.

283
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:18,347
I am but a humble jester. And
you? You are too far above me.

284
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,641
Farewell, Ethel Barrymore.

285
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,978
I must tear myself from your side.

286
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:39,952
Is this R.F. Simpson's house? I'm
one of the Coconut Grove girls.

287
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:42,836
Yes, the floor show.
Around the back.

288
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,415
Oh, I see. Thank you.

289
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,982
- Nice little party, R.F.
- Thanks, Roscoe.

290
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:13,236
Do you really think you
can get me in the movies?

291
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,488
- I should think so.
- Really?

292
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,092
The picture's great.

293
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:19,367
There's Don. I loved the picture.

294
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,653
Did you come by way of Australia?

295
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,037
Hello, Cos. Excuse me.

296
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,165
Cos, tell me the truth.
Am I a good actor?

297
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,043
As long as I work for Monumental,
you're the greatest.

298
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,629
No kidding. You're my
pal. You can tell me.

299
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,048
What's the matter? Of
course, you're good.

300
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:38,010
Keep telling me from time to
time. I feel a little shaken.

301
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:39,762
- The new Don Lockwood.
- Don.

302
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,389
Hi, R.F.

303
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,558
It's colossal. Where
have you been?

304
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,477
There you are. Where
were you? I was lonely.

305
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,645
Hello, Lina.

306
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,397
Okay, fellas. Hold it.

307
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,359
Together again, my two
little stars, Don and Lina.

308
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:55,736
No kidding, folks,
aren't they great?

309
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,158
All right, open that screen.

310
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:02,312
A movie? We just saw one.

311
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:04,495
Gotta show one at a
party. It's a law.

312
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:07,415
Everybody, I've got a
few surprises for you.

313
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:09,792
All right, sit down, sit down.

314
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,627
This'll make you laugh.

315
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,214
There's a madman coming into
my office for months, and...

316
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,259
- You got that gadget working?
- All set.

317
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:20,344
Okay, let her go.

318
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:27,727
Hello.

319
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,690
This is a demonstration
of a talking picture.

320
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:37,945
Notice, it is a picture
of me and I am talking.

321
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:42,325
Note how my lips and the
sound issuing from them...

322
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,994
are synchronised together...

323
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:47,997
in perfect unison.

324
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,490
Who's that?

325
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,751
Somebody's talking
behind that screen.

326
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,337
Come out from behind
that screen, Mr Simpson.

327
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,214
Oh, no. I'm right here.

328
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:02,762
My voice has been
recorded on a record.

329
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,056
A talking picture.

330
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:07,099
Thank you.

331
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:08,476
Goodbye.

332
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:13,105
Well?

333
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,192
- It's just a toy.
- It's a scream.

334
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:19,403
- It's vulgar.
- You think they'll ever use it?

335
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:23,616
I doubt it. Warners is making a
picture with it, The Jazz Singer.

336
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:27,119
- They'll lose their shirts.
- It'll never amount to a thing.

337
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,121
They said that about the
horseless carriage.

338
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,499
Let's get on with the
show. Okay, boys.

339
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,751
Come on, my little starlets.

340
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,504
I have a surprise. A
very special cake.

341
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:39,382
I want you kiddies to
have the first piece.

342
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,848
Well. If it isn't Ethel Barrymore.

343
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,451
I do hope you'll favour
us with something

344
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:58,818
special. Say,
Hamlet's soliloquy...

345
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:02,154
or a scene from Romeo and
Juliet? Don't be shy.

346
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:06,284
You make about the prettiest
Juliet I've ever seen. Really.

359
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,013
I had to tell you
how good you were.

360
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:16,028
Excuse me.

361
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,398
Now that I know where you live,
I'd like to see you home.

362
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:23,110
- Listen, Mr Lockwood...
- Say, who is this dame anyway?

363
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,155
Someone lofty and
far above us all.

364
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:30,743
She couldn't learn anything from
the movies. She's a stage actress.

365
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:34,121
Here's one thing I've
learnt from the movies.

366
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,170
- I'll kill her.
- Lina, she was aiming at me.

367
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:43,923
- You never looked lovelier.
- It was an accident.

368
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:46,217
It happens to me five
or six times a day.

369
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:47,718
Where is she?

370
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,637
Donnie?

371
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,725
Excuse me. Where'd Miss Selden go?

372
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:58,521
She grabbed her things and
bolted. Anything I can do?

373
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,399
Sorry. I don't have
time to find out.

374
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:05,653
Kathy.

375
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:07,154
Hey, Kathy.

376
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:10,491
Hey.

377
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:39,562
Keep that action going.
More steam in the kettle.

378
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:41,981
More action, boys. A
little more rhythm.

379
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:43,941
More steam and more water.

380
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:45,943
- Hi, Maxie.
- Hi, Don.

381
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,863
- Good morning, fellas.
- Hiya, Don.

382
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,823
Did you read Variety today?

383
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:53,057
"First talking picture,
The Jazz Singer.

384
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,785
All-time smash end of first week."

385
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:57,955
- All-time flop end of the second.
- We start today.

386
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,290
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

387
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:03,127
I'm now Count Pierre de Bataille,
known as the Duelling Cavalier.

388
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:05,963
- What's it about?
- It's a French Revolution story.

389
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:07,923
You're a French aristocrat.

390
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:11,594
She's a simple girl of the people
and won't even give you a tumble.

391
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,637
Well, it's a living.

392
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:15,723
Good morning.

393
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:18,476
Keep the background
moving. Hit him.

394
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,060
Come on. Knock him down.

395
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,813
Get up there and hit
him again. Hurry up.

396
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:26,358
Why bother to shoot this? Release
the old one under a new title.

397
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,944
You've seen one,
you've seen them all.

398
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:31,238
- Why'd you say that?
- What's the matter?

399
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:34,241
That's what that Kathy Selden
said to me that night.

400
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:37,620
That's three weeks ago. You
still thinking about that?

401
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,499
- I can't get her out of my mind.
- How could you?

402
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,960
She's the first dame who hasn't
fallen for you since you were 4.

403
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,587
She's on my conscience.

404
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,672
It's not your fault
she lost her job.

405
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:51,175
- I've got to find her.
- You've been trying to.

406
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:53,677
Short of sending out
bloodhounds and a posse.

407
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,471
Come on, now. Snap out of it.

408
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,473
You can't let this get you down.

409
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:01,101
You're Donald Lockwood. Donald
Lockwood's an actor, isn't he?

410
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:03,187
What's the first thing
an actor learns?

411
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:05,775
"The show must go on, come rain,

412
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:08,526

snow, come sleet."

413
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:13,697

- All set.
- Here we go again.

462
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:01,771
We have another
smash on our hands.

463
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:02,786
I hope so.

464
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,011
You're darn tooting we have.

465
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,847
- Where's Lina?
- Here she is, Mr Dexter.

466
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,017
Well. Here comes our
lovely leading lady now.

467
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:13,520
This wig weighs a tonne. What
dope'd wear a thing like this?

468
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,022
Everybody wore them.

469
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,857
Then everybody was a dope.

470
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,942
- You look beautiful.
- You look great.

471
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,028
Let's get into the set.

472
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:22,738
Thanks, Joe.

473
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,825
I looked for you at Wally
Ray's party. Where were you?

474
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:28,577
I've been busy.

475
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:31,872
And I know what you've been
busy at. Looking for that girl.

476
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,291
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Why?

477
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:35,793
I've been worried about her.

478
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:37,961
You should've been
worried about me.

479
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:41,089
I'm the one who got the
whipped cream in the kisser.

480
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:43,759
Yes, but you didn't lose
your job, and she did.

481
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,970
Darn tooting she
did. I arranged it.

482
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,138
What?

483
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:51,725
They weren't gonna fire her,
so I told them they better.

484
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,644
- Why...
- Don, now remember.

485
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:57,606
You're madly in love with her and
you have to overcome her shyness.

486
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,651
Cosmo, mood music.

487
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:03,779
Roll them.

488
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,740
Okay, Don.

489
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,158
Now enter.

490
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,494
You see her.

491
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:12,329
Run to her.

492
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:20,879
Why, you rattlesnake, you.
You got that poor kid fired.

493
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:25,092
That's not all I'm gonna do if
I ever get my hands on her.

494
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,719
I never heard of anything so low.

495
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:29,388
Fine. Fine. Looks great.

496
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:31,765
What did you do it for?

497
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,102
Because you liked
her. I could tell.

498
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:36,770
So that's it.

499
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:41,233
Believe me, I don't like her
half as much as I hate you.

500
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:42,985
You reptile.

501
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:45,988
Sticks and stones
may break my bones.

502
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,282
I'd like to break every
bone in your body.

503
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:50,784
You and who else, you big lummox?

504
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,452
Now kiss her, Don.

505
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:56,164
That's it. More.

506
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,667
Great. Cut.

507
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:02,064
You couldn't kiss me
like that and not

508
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,006
mean it just a teensy-weensy bit.

509
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,384
Meet the world's greatest actor.
I'd rather kiss a tarantula.

510
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,511
- You don't mean that.
- I don't...?

511
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:11,972
Joe, bring me a
tarantula. Now listen...

512
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:14,892
Stop that chitchat, you lovebirds.
Let's get another take.

513
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,101
Hold it.

514
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,145
- Hold it, Dexter.
- Hello, Mr Simpson.

515
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:19,521
We're really rolling.

516
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:22,024
Well, you can stop
rolling at once.

517
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,984
All right, everybody. Save it.

518
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:26,862
Save it? Tell them to go
home. We're shutting down.

519
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,655
Don't stand there. Tell them.

520
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,491
Go home until further
notice. What is this?

521
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:32,659
What's the matter?

522
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,995
The Jazz Singer, that's
what's the matter.

523
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:38,498
♪ Oh, my darling little
mammy down in Alabamy ♪

524
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:42,169
This is no joke. It's a sensation.
The public's screaming for more.

525
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:44,713
- More what?
- Talking pictures.

526
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:48,091
- It's just a freak.
- We should have such a freak.

527
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:51,678
I said talking pictures were a
menace, but no one would listen.

528
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:56,224
We're going to make The Duelling
Cavalier into a talking picture.

529
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,185
That means I'm out of a job.

530
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:00,187
I can start suffering and
write that symphony.

531
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,106
We'll put you in as head
of the music department.

532
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:06,318
Thanks. I can stop suffering
and write that symphony.

533
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:09,279
Wait a second. Talking
pictures. You should wait...

534
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,823
Every studio's jumping
on the bandwagon.

535
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:14,576
All the theatres are putting
in sound equipment.

536
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:16,286
We know nothing about it.

537
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,080
What do you have to know?

538
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,416
You do what you always did.
You just add talking to it.

539
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,543
Believe me, it'll be a sensation.

540
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,838
"Lamont and Lockwood. They talk."

541
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:30,217

Kathy, come here.

This will start a trend
in musical pictures.

609
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:55,190
Mr Simpson's thinking about
casting you as Zelda's sister.

610
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,691
That's wonderful.

611
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,151
Hey, Kathy.

612
00:38:58,486 --> 00:38:59,736
That's Kathy Selden.

613
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,488
Thanks anyway. It was nice of you.

614
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,615
- Wait a minute.
- That's all right.

615
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:06,743
Before Mr Lockwood refreshes your
memory, you may as well know...

616
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:09,496
I'm the girl who hit
Miss Lamont with

617
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:11,998
a cake. It was meant
for Mr Lockwood.

618
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,251
Goodbye. I'm sorry. I
should've told you.

619
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:16,544
Wait a minute. What's
this all about?

620
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:20,090
We were gonna use her, but if
it'd make you and Lina unhappy...

621
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:22,050
Unhappy? It's wonderful.

622
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,802
He's been looking for her.

623
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:25,553
Are you speaking for Lina also?

624
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,807
The owner of the Coconut Grove
may do what Lina tells him...

625
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,098
but you're the head
of this studio.

626
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:32,110
Yes, I am.

627
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:34,729
She's hired. Don't let Lina
know she's on the lot.

628
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:35,897
Take care of that.

629
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:37,190
Thank you, Mr Simpson.

630
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:41,194
I'm glad you turned up. We've been
looking inside every cake in town.

631
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,948
Is it all right for you
to be seen with me?

632
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:47,826
You mean, lofty star
with humble player?

633
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:50,344
Not exactly. But for
lunch, don't you

634
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:52,372
tear a pheasant with Miss Lamont?

635
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:56,668
Look, Kathy. All that stuff about
Lina and me is sheer publicity.

636
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:59,462
Oh? Certainly seems
more than that...

637
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:02,924
from what I've read in all those
articles in the fan magazines.

638
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:07,679
You read the fan magazines?

639
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,141
I pick them up in the beauty
parlour or the dentist's office...

640
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,059
just like anybody.

641
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:14,477
Honest?

642
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:17,856
I buy four or five a month.

643
00:40:18,107 --> 00:40:19,566
You buy four or five...?

644
00:40:20,943 --> 00:40:22,819
To get back to the main point...

645
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,947
you achieve a kind of intimacy
in all your pictures...

646
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,867
Did you say all my pictures?

647
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:34,122
Now that I think of it, I've
seen eight or nine of them.

648
00:40:34,373 --> 00:40:35,373
Eight or nine.

649
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:38,293
It seems to me I
remember someone saying:

650
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:41,796
"If you've seen one,
you've seen them all."

651
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,593
I did say some awful things
that night, didn't I?

652
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:49,512
No, I deserved them.

653
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:53,266
Of course, I must admit I was
pretty much upset by them.

654
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,340
So upset that I
haven't been able to

655
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:58,897
think of anything
but you ever since.

656
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:01,107
Honest?

657
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:03,693
Honest.

658
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:08,281
Well, I've been pretty upset too.

659
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:09,824
Kathy...

660
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,868
Kathy, look, I...

661
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,746
Kathy, seeing you
again now that I...

662
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:21,628
I'm trying to say something
to you, but I...

663
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,505
I'm such a ham.

664
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,466
I guess I'm not able to
without the proper setting.

665
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:27,634
What do you mean?

666
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,135
Well...

667
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:31,846
Come here.

668
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,273
This is the proper setting.

669
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:45,193
Why, it's just an empty stage.

670
00:41:45,444 --> 00:41:46,986
At first glance, yes.

671
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,738
But wait a second.

672
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:52,909
A beautiful sunset.

673
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:58,748
Mist from the distant mountains.

674
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:03,169
Coloured lights in a garden.

675
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:10,427
Milady is standing on her balcony,
in a rose-trellised bower...

676
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,099
flooded with moonlight.

677
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,727
We add 500,000
kilowatts of stardust.

678
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,442
A soft summer breeze.

679
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,111
And...

680
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:31,448
You sure look lovely
in the moonlight.

681
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:36,911
Now that you have the proper
setting, can you say it?

682
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,081

No, no, Miss Lamont...

710
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:41,948
round tones, round tones.

711
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,284
Now let me hear you
read your line.

712
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,830
"And I can't stand him."

713
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:51,874
And I can't stand him.

714
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:55,294
"And I can't stand him."

715
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:56,963
"Can't."

716
00:46:57,256 --> 00:46:58,506
Can't.

717
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:01,551
"Can't."

718
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,845
Can't.

719
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,556
Can't. Can't.

720
00:47:06,765 --> 00:47:08,015
Very good.

721
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:11,394
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."

722
00:47:11,645 --> 00:47:13,229
"Around the rocks the rugged..."

723
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,773
No, no. "Rocks." "Rocks."

724
00:47:16,024 --> 00:47:18,359
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."

725
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,527
Very good.

726
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:20,737
Hi, Don.

727
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,822
- Shall I continue?
- Don't mind me.

728
00:47:23,031 --> 00:47:26,367
Now. "Sinful Caesar

"Sipped his snifter."

00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:36,836
Oh, thank you.

735
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,342

Roll them.

773
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:38,744
Oh, Pierre. You
shouldn't have come.

774
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:42,873
She's got to talk into the
mike. I can't pick it up.

It's Lina.

00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,257
Look, Lina, don't you
remember? I told you.

779
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,260
There's a microphone
right there...

780
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,846
- in the bush.
- Yeah.

781
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:58,931
You have to talk into it.

782
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,559
I was talking. Wasn't
I, Miss Dinsmore?

783
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:05,813
Yes, my dear. But please
remember, round tones.

784
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:09,316
"Pierre, you shouldn't have come."

785
00:52:09,568 --> 00:52:11,861
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

786
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:13,279
That's much better...

787
00:52:13,488 --> 00:52:15,197
Hold it a second.

788
00:52:15,407 --> 00:52:17,116
Now, Lina, look.

789
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:18,534
Here's the mike.

790
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:21,037
Right here in the bush.

791
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,246
Yeah.

792
00:52:22,414 --> 00:52:23,914
Now, you talk towards it.

793
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:27,168
The sound goes through
the cable to the box.

794
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:31,047
A man records it on a
big record in wax...

795
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:34,967
but you have to talk
into the mike first.

796
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:36,469
In the bush.

797
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,012
Now try it again.

798
00:52:38,305 --> 00:52:39,346
Gee, this is dumb.

799
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,640
She'll get it,
Dexter. Don't worry.

800
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,019
We're all nervous the first
day. Everything will be okay.

801
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:47,813
By the way. You know the
scene coming up where I say:

802
00:52:48,023 --> 00:52:49,940
"Imperious princess of the night"?

803
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,021
I don't like those
lines. Is it all

804
00:52:52,022 --> 00:52:53,736
right if I say what I always do?

805
00:52:53,945 --> 00:52:56,447
"I love you. I love
you. I love you."

806
00:52:56,698 --> 00:52:58,949
Sure. Any way it's comfortable.

807
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,701
But into the bush.

808
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:01,911
Okay.

809
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,120
Again.

810
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,663
Quiet.

811
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,415
Roll them.

812
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:13,214
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

813
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,012
Cut.

814
00:53:20,472 --> 00:53:22,556
We're missing every other word.

815
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:25,059
You've got to talk into the mike.

816
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:27,728
Well, I can't make love to a bush.

817
00:53:27,979 --> 00:53:30,022
All right, all right.

818
00:53:30,649 --> 00:53:34,026
We'll have to think
of something else.

819
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:40,908
What are you doing?

820
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:43,619
- You're being wired for sound.
- What?

821
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:47,748
Watch out for those dentalised
D's and T's and those flat A's.

822
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,126
Everybody's picking on me.

823
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,377
Okay, Lina.

824
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:53,796
Now look at this flower, see?

825
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,881
The mike is in there.

826
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:57,800
That's it.

827
00:53:58,009 --> 00:54:00,719
The sound will run from it...

828
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,764
through this wire,
onto the record.

829
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,100
It'll catch whatever you say.

830
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,478
Now let's hear how
it sounds, Lina.

831
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:12,148
Okay, quiet.

832
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:13,774
Roll them.

833
00:54:16,611 --> 00:54:18,696
Oh, Pierre, you
shouldn't have come.

834
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:22,408
You're flirting with danger.

835
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,660
What's that noise?

836
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:26,662
It's picking up her heartbeat.

837
00:54:26,913 --> 00:54:28,414
Swell.

838
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:30,416
Cut.

839
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:36,964
That's right. That should do it.

840
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:38,632
Now, don't forget.

841
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,843
The mike is on your shoulder.

842
00:54:41,094 --> 00:54:44,722
And whatever you say goes through
the wire onto the record.

843
00:54:44,973 --> 00:54:48,017
Now, please, Lina,
talk into the mike.

844
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:51,562
Don't make any quick movements
or you might disconnect it.

845
00:54:51,813 --> 00:54:53,272
Okay, let's go.

846
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,441
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

847
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:57,234
Roll them.

848
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:04,533
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have
come. You're flirting with danger.

849
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,119
What's this wire doing
here? It's dangerous.

850
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:23,510
You'd better not go in together.

851
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:26,639
Lina's probably waiting
right inside the door.

852
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,724
- Oh, how I wish...
- Don't worry.

853
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:32,478
I'll lead the cheering section
in the balcony. Good luck.

854
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:39,610
- Mr Lockwood.
- Hello.

855
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,807
What's that? The storm outside?

856
00:56:10,058 --> 00:56:12,518
It's those pearls, Mr Simpson.

857
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:22,111
I am the noblest lady of the
court, second only to the queen.

858
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:26,031
Yet I am the saddest
of mortals in France.

859
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:28,117
What is the matter, milady?

860
00:56:28,368 --> 00:56:30,536
I'm so downhearted, Theresa.

861
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:34,081
My father has me betrothed to
the Baron de Landsfield...

862
00:56:34,332 --> 00:56:35,791
and I can't stand him.

863
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,585
Oh, but he's such a catch.

864
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:42,423
All the ladies of the court
wish they were in your shoes.

865
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:45,301
My heart belongs to another...

866
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:47,970
Pierre de Bataille.

867
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:52,141
Ever since I met him, I can't
get him out of my mind.

868
00:56:52,434 --> 00:56:54,893
Sounds good and loud, huh?

869
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,361
Oh, Pierre.

870
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,907
You shouldn't have come.
You're flirting with danger.

871
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,410
They will surely find you out.

872
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:14,455
Your head is much too valuable.

873
00:57:14,706 --> 00:57:17,916
She never could remember
where the microphone was.

874
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:20,794
'Tis Cupid himself
that called me here...

875
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:22,421
and I...

876
00:57:22,756 --> 00:57:25,382
smitten by his arrow,
must fly to your side...

877
00:57:27,427 --> 00:57:30,262
despite the threats
of Madame Guillotine.

878
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:33,932
But the night is
full of our enemies.

879
00:57:37,562 --> 00:57:39,813
What you hitting him
with, a blackjack?

880
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:43,233
Imperious princess of the night...

881
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:44,777
I love you.

882
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,612
Oh, Pierre.

883
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:48,447
I love you.

884
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:52,910
I love you, I love you, I love
you, I love you, I love you.

885
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,289
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

886
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,627
Did somebody get paid
for writing that?

887
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:06,256
Sounds like a comedy.

888
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:08,967
- It's a Lockwood-Lamont talkie.
- What?

889
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:10,636
This is terrible.

890
00:58:13,014 --> 00:58:14,640
[DIALOGUE DISTORTED]

891
00:58:17,936 --> 00:58:18,977
What's that?

892
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,438
The sound. It's out
of synchronisation.

893
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:22,940
Tell them to fix it.

894
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:24,650
Yes, sir.

895
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:27,486
What's this? Yvonne?

896
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:31,115
Captured by Rouge Noir
of the Purple Terror?

897
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:33,826
Oh, my sword.

898
00:58:34,035 --> 00:58:36,495
I must fly to her side.

899
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,831
Yvonne, Yvonne...

900
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:40,666
my own.

901
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:44,628
Pierre will save me. Pierre.

902
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:47,965
Pierre is miles away, you witch.

903
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,259
No, no, no.

904
00:58:50,468 --> 00:58:52,511
Yes, yes, yes.

905
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:54,346
No, no, no.

906
00:58:54,556 --> 00:58:57,349
Yes, yes, yes.

907
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:05,065
This is a scream.

908
00:59:05,316 --> 00:59:06,692
Give me The Jazz Singer.

909
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:09,069
"I love you, I love
you, I love you"...

910
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:14,658
- We're all ruined.
- You can't release this.

911
00:59:14,868 --> 00:59:18,078
We're booked to open in six
weeks all over the country.

912
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:21,331
But you're such big
stars, we might get by.

913
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:23,500
I never wanna see Lockwood
and Lamont again.

914
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:24,710
Wasn't it awful?

915
00:59:24,919 --> 00:59:27,379
This is the worst
picture ever made.

916
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:29,339
I liked it.

917
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:39,892
Well, take a last look at it.

918
00:59:40,185 --> 00:59:42,227
It'll be up for auction
in the morning.

919
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:43,854
You're out of your mind.

920
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:46,815
It's Saturday. No bank will
foreclose until Monday.

921
00:59:47,066 --> 00:59:49,526
- It wasn't so bad.
- That's what I told him.

922
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:51,570
There's no use kidding myself.

923
00:59:51,863 --> 00:59:54,081
Once they release The
Duelling Cavalier,

924
00:59:54,082 --> 00:59:55,866
Lockwood and Lamont are through.

925
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:57,868
The picture's a museum piece.

926
00:59:58,077 --> 00:59:59,453
I'm a museum piece.

927
00:59:59,704 --> 01:00:02,372
Things went wrong with the
sound. Get the technical...

928
01:00:02,582 --> 01:00:03,707
No, it wasn't that.

929
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:06,376
This is sweet of both
of you, but I...

930
01:00:07,587 --> 01:00:10,130
Something happened to me tonight.

931
01:00:10,381 --> 01:00:12,633
Everything you said
about me is true.

932
01:00:12,926 --> 01:00:14,343
I'm no actor.

933
01:00:14,594 --> 01:00:17,221
I never was. Just a
lot of dumb show.

934
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,097
I know that now.

935
01:00:19,766 --> 01:00:22,434
Well, at least you're
taking it lying down.

936
01:00:22,644 --> 01:00:23,936
No kidding, Cosmo.

937
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:26,980
Did you ever see anything as
idiotic as me on that screen?

938
01:00:27,273 --> 01:00:28,815
Yeah. How about Lina?

939
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:31,401
Heh. I ran her a close second.

940
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:34,363
Maybe it was a photo
finish. I'm through.

941
01:00:34,614 --> 01:00:35,906
You're not through.

942
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:37,574
Why, of course not.

943
01:00:37,784 --> 01:00:40,118

- What?

01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:00,514

01:06:21,419 --> 01:06:22,419
That's wonderful.

1039
01:06:22,628 --> 01:06:25,130
- I couldn't let you do it, Kathy.
- Why not?

1040
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:28,133
You wouldn't be seen. You'd
throw away your career.

1041
01:06:28,342 --> 01:06:30,312
It has nothing to
do with my career.

1042
01:06:30,313 --> 01:06:31,803
It's only for this picture.

1043
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:34,306
The important thing is to
save The Duelling Cavalier...

1044
01:06:34,515 --> 01:06:37,100
- save Lockwood and Lamont.
- Yeah.

1045
01:06:37,977 --> 01:06:42,147
Well, all right, if it's only
for this one picture, but...

1046
01:06:43,441 --> 01:06:45,442
- You think it'll get by?
- Of course.

1047
01:06:45,651 --> 01:06:47,444
It's simple to work the numbers.

1048
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:50,947
Just dance around Lina and
teach her how to take a bow.

1049
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:53,658
We'll spring it on
R.F. in the morning.

1050
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:55,952
Don, you're a genius.

1051
01:06:56,537 --> 01:06:58,288
I'm glad you thought of it.

1052
01:06:58,497 --> 01:06:59,998
Oh, Cosmo.

1053
01:07:08,674 --> 01:07:11,051
Good night, Kathy.
See you tomorrow.

1054
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:14,387
Good night, Don. Take
care of that throat.

1055
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,641
You're a big singing
star now, remember?

1056
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:21,019
This California dew is just a
little heavier than usual.

1057
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,646
Really?

1058
01:07:23,356 --> 01:07:27,400
From where I stand, the sun is
shining all over the place.

1059

Why, that's wonderful.

1083
01:11:57,588 --> 01:12:00,048
We'll keep it secret until
we're ready to release...

1084
01:12:00,299 --> 01:12:03,801
just in case it doesn't come
off. I'm worried about Lina.

1085
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:06,262
She doesn't like Miss Selden.
There might be fireworks.

1086
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:08,973
Lina won't even know
she's on the lot.

1087
01:12:09,141 --> 01:12:10,642
Boys, this is great.

1088
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:13,353
The Duelling Cavalier
can be saved.

1089
01:12:13,604 --> 01:12:14,604
Now, let's see.

1090
01:12:14,813 --> 01:12:17,315
The Duelling Cavalier with music.

1091
01:12:17,483 --> 01:12:18,983
The title.

1092
01:12:19,276 --> 01:12:22,695
The title's not right. We
need a musical title. Cosmo?

1093
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:29,160
Hey. The Duelling Mammy.

1094
01:12:29,954 --> 01:12:31,079
No.

1095
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,667
I've got it.

1096
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,961
No.

1097
01:12:40,506 --> 01:12:41,673
The Dancing Cavalier.

1098
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:43,675
That's it. The Dancing Cavalier.

1099
01:12:43,968 --> 01:12:46,079
Remind me to make
you a scriptwriter.

1100
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,345
Thanks. Have a cigar.

1101
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:48,805
Thanks.

1102
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:53,184
Now, what about the story?

1103
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:56,312
We need modern musical numbers.

1104
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:02,527
We throw a modern section into it.

1105
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,487
The hero's a hoofer on Broadway.

1106
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:06,114
He sings and he dances.

1107
01:13:06,323 --> 01:13:09,033
One night, backstage, he's
reading The Tale of Two Cities.

1108
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:10,535
A sandbag hits his head.

1109
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:12,704
He dreams he's back during
the French Revolution.

1110
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:15,373
This way, we get in the
modern dancing numbers.

1111
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,834
But in the dream, we can
still use the costumes.

1112
01:13:18,043 --> 01:13:20,878
Sensational. Cosmo, remind
me to give you a raise.

1113
01:13:21,046 --> 01:13:22,964
- Oh, R.F.
- Yes?

1114
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:24,507

Perfect. That Selden

1138
01:15:15,494 --> 01:15:17,954
I'm gonna give her a big build-up.

1139
01:15:18,163 --> 01:15:19,997
- Swell.
- How much is there left to do?

1140
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:21,958
- One scene and a number.
- What number?

1141
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:24,377
It's a new one. It's
for the modern part.

1142
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,170
It's called "Broadway Melody."

1143
01:15:27,005 --> 01:15:30,133
It's the story of a young
hoofer who comes to New York.

1144
01:15:30,342 --> 01:15:32,510
First, we set the
stage with a song.

1145
01:15:32,803 --> 01:15:33,970

1185
01:28:51,768 --> 01:28:54,645
I can't visualise it. I'll
have to see it on film first.

1186
01:28:54,812 --> 01:28:57,314
- On film, it'll be better yet.
- Don't forget.

1187
01:28:57,565 --> 01:29:00,067
Have Selden re-record
all of Lina's dialogue.

1188
01:29:00,276 --> 01:29:02,152
- It's all set up.
- And remember...

1189
01:29:02,445 --> 01:29:04,947
don't let Lina know about it.

1190
01:29:07,533 --> 01:29:08,951
All set in there?

1191
01:29:09,869 --> 01:29:11,161
Right.

1192
01:29:11,788 --> 01:29:14,206
Nothing can keep us apart.

1193
01:29:14,457 --> 01:29:18,460
Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.

1194
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:20,879
All right, Kathy. Go ahead.

1195
01:29:21,839 --> 01:29:24,174
Nothing can keep us apart.

1196
01:29:24,384 --> 01:29:28,220
Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.

1197
01:29:28,638 --> 01:29:30,597
That's great. Perfect. Cut.

1198
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:35,894
Till the stars turn cold.

1199
01:29:36,521 --> 01:29:38,647
Oh, Kathy, I love you.

1200
01:29:40,817 --> 01:29:43,026
I can't wait till this
picture's finished.

1201
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,697
No more secrecy. I'm gonna
let Lina and everyone know.

1202
01:29:46,906 --> 01:29:49,491
Your fans will be
bitterly disappointed.

1203
01:29:49,701 --> 01:29:53,412
From now on, there's only
one fan I'm worried about.

1204
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:57,874
There.

1205
01:29:58,042 --> 01:29:59,208
What did I tell you?

1206
01:29:59,209 --> 01:30:01,169
Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.

1207
01:30:01,379 --> 01:30:05,340
I want that girl off the lot at
once. She ain't gonna be my voice.

1208
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,134
Zelda told me everything.

1209
01:30:07,385 --> 01:30:09,319
Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.

1210
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,378
Anytime, Don.

1211
01:30:10,388 --> 01:30:11,638

1212
01:30:11,889 --> 01:30:14,558
Don. Don't you dare call him Don.

1213
01:30:14,767 --> 01:30:17,769
I was calling him Don
before you were born.

1214
01:30:18,021 --> 01:30:19,730
I mean... You were kissing him.

1215
01:30:20,023 --> 01:30:23,442
I was kissing her. I happen
to be in love with her.

1216
01:30:23,693 --> 01:30:27,738
That's ridiculous. Everybody
knows you're in love with me.

1217
01:30:27,905 --> 01:30:32,034
Ha, ha. Now look, Lina.
Try and understand this.

1218
01:30:32,243 --> 01:30:33,910
I'm going to marry her.

1219
01:30:34,203 --> 01:30:36,872
Silly boy. She ain't
the marrying kind.

1220
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:39,916
She's a flirt trying to
get ahead by using you.

1221
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:42,265
Well, I'll put a stop to that. I'm

1222
01:30:42,266 --> 01:30:44,546
gonna go up and see
R.F. right now.

1223
01:30:44,756 --> 01:30:46,256
A little late. The
picture's finished.

1224
01:30:46,424 --> 01:30:48,759
If she weren't in it,
you'd be finished too.

1225
01:30:48,968 --> 01:30:51,928
As far as I can see, she's
the only one who's finished.

1226
01:30:52,221 --> 01:30:53,221
Who'll hear of her?

1227
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:56,600
Everybody. Why do you think
Zelda's in such a sweat?

1228
01:30:56,809 --> 01:30:58,602
Kathy nearly stole the
picture from her.

1229
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:00,812
She's only doing you a favour
in The Dancing Cavalier.

1230
01:31:01,105 --> 01:31:04,107
And she's getting full
screen credit for it too.

1231
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,111
It'll say on the screen that I
don't talk and sing for myself?

1232
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:10,197
Of course. What do you think?

1233
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:12,449
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.

1234
01:31:12,742 --> 01:31:14,993
There's a whole publicity
campaign planned.

1235
01:31:15,286 --> 01:31:16,703
Publicity?

1236
01:31:16,954 --> 01:31:18,789
They can't make a fool out of me.

1237
01:31:18,998 --> 01:31:21,625
They can't make a laughing
stock out of Lina Lamont.

1238
01:31:21,918 --> 01:31:24,795
What do they think I
am, dumb or something?

1239
01:31:25,088 --> 01:31:27,339
Why, I make more money...

1240
01:31:28,132 --> 01:31:30,008
than Calvin Coolidge...

1241
01:31:30,259 --> 01:31:32,094
put together.

1242
01:31:34,138 --> 01:31:38,850
"Monumental Pictures enthusiastic
over Lina's singing and dancing."

1243
01:31:39,102 --> 01:31:40,143
I never said that.

1244
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:44,314
"Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont, big musical talent."

1245
01:31:44,524 --> 01:31:47,651
You can't pull a switch like this
on the publicity department.

1246
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,986
We were prepared for
the Selden campaign.

1247
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,322
Now you do this. At
least keep us informed.

1248
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:55,283
Wait a minute. I don't
know anything about this.

1249
01:31:55,493 --> 01:31:56,743
What are we gonna do?

1250
01:31:56,953 --> 01:31:57,953
Nothing.

1251
01:31:58,955 --> 01:32:01,498
Absolutely nothing.

1252
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:04,835
You wouldn't wanna call the
papers and say Lina Lamont...

1253
01:32:05,044 --> 01:32:07,337
is a big fat liar.

1254
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,172
Did you send this stuff out?

1255
01:32:09,465 --> 01:32:12,801
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

1256
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:15,178
You'll never get away
with it. Call the papers.

1257
01:32:15,388 --> 01:32:17,180
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1258
01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:19,474
Don't tell me what to do, Lina.

1259
01:32:19,684 --> 01:32:23,186
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

1260
01:32:23,396 --> 01:32:26,523
I had my lawyer go
over my contract.

1261
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:27,858
Contract?

1262
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:30,694
And I control my
publicity, not you.

1263
01:32:30,862 --> 01:32:32,070
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1264
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,282
The studio is responsible for
every word printed about me.

1265
01:32:35,491 --> 01:32:38,577
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1266
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:39,911
What?

1267
01:32:40,163 --> 01:32:42,372
I can sue.

1268
01:32:42,582 --> 01:32:45,542
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

1269
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:50,505
it would be "detrimental and
deleterious" to my career.

1270
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:54,301
I could sue you for
the whole studio.

1271
01:32:54,552 --> 01:32:56,803
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so.

1272
01:32:57,054 --> 01:32:58,430
Right here.

1273
01:32:58,723 --> 01:33:00,663
Contract dated June 8, 1925,

1274
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:03,226
paragraph 34,
subdivision letter A.

1275
01:33:03,394 --> 01:33:05,437
"The party of the first part..."

1276
01:33:05,688 --> 01:33:07,522
- That's me.
- You win, Lina.

1277
01:33:07,732 --> 01:33:10,358
We better take Kathy's
credit card off the screen.

1278
01:33:10,568 --> 01:33:11,902
All right, go ahead.

1279
01:33:12,111 --> 01:33:14,321
Let's just get this
premiere over with.

1280
01:33:14,572 --> 01:33:15,906
Satisfied?

1281
01:33:16,115 --> 01:33:18,617
There's just one
little thing more.

1282
01:33:19,076 --> 01:33:20,983
You want me to change the name of

1283
01:33:20,984 --> 01:33:23,121
the studio to Lamont
Pictures, Inc?

1284
01:33:23,414 --> 01:33:25,373
R.F., you're cute.

1285
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,417
Now, I was just thinking.

1286
01:33:27,627 --> 01:33:30,128
You've given her a part
in Zelda's picture...

1287
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:32,923
and you'll give her a
bigger one in the next.

1288
01:33:33,216 --> 01:33:34,716
So, what?

1289
01:33:34,926 --> 01:33:37,636
If she's done such a grand
job doubling for my voice...

1290
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:41,223
don't you think she ought
to go on doing just that?

1291
01:33:41,432 --> 01:33:43,725
- And nothing else.
- You're out of your mind.

1292
01:33:43,935 --> 01:33:46,978
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

1293
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:48,980
I wouldn't do that to
her in a million years.

1294
01:33:49,232 --> 01:33:52,734
You'd take her career away.
People don't do things like that.

1295
01:33:52,944 --> 01:33:54,486
People?

1296
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:56,613
I ain't people.

1297
01:33:56,906 --> 01:33:58,657
I am a...

1298
01:34:02,078 --> 01:34:06,456
"A shimmering, glowing star
in the cinema firmament."

1299
01:34:06,624 --> 01:34:08,458
It says so...

1300
01:34:08,793 --> 01:34:10,126
right there.

1301
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,477
Oh, Pierre, Pierre, my darling.
At last, I've found you.

1302
01:34:27,645 --> 01:34:28,687
Oh, Pierre.

1303
01:34:28,938 --> 01:34:32,691
Pierre, you're hurt. Speak

Lockwood's a sensation.

1310
01:34:56,507 --> 01:35:00,176
Yes, but Lamont. What a
voice. Isn't she marvellous?

1311
01:35:00,469 --> 01:35:02,346
It's going over
wonderfully, isn't it?

1312
01:35:02,347 --> 01:35:03,371
Yeah.

1313
01:35:03,372 --> 01:35:07,517

Congratulations. We owe you a lot.

1320
01:35:56,104 --> 01:35:57,104
Thank you.

1321
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,235
- Kathy, we made it.
- It's a miracle.

1322
01:35:59,528 --> 01:36:01,279
It's great, Don. Just great.

1323
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:04,407
You were fabulous. You sang
as well as Kathy Selden.

1324
01:36:04,617 --> 01:36:07,577
And I'm gonna for a long time.

1325
01:36:07,745 --> 01:36:08,745
What do you mean?

1326
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:12,248
I mean she's gonna go
right on singing for me.

1327
01:36:12,541 --> 01:36:13,625
Listen, Lina.

1328
01:36:13,918 --> 01:36:17,587
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls.

1329
01:36:17,797 --> 01:36:20,924
Kathy has her own career. She
only did this for this picture.

1330
01:36:21,217 --> 01:36:22,592
That's what you think.

1331
01:36:22,802 --> 01:36:24,427
Come on, come on.

1332
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,930
- Lina's getting carried away.
- Yeah, she is.

1333
01:36:27,223 --> 01:36:28,598
Listen, you boa constrictor.

1334
01:36:28,891 --> 01:36:31,643
Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her.

1335
01:36:31,936 --> 01:36:34,270
Never mind, R.F. Listen
to that applause.

1336
01:36:34,563 --> 01:36:36,147
Wait till the money rolls in.

1337
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:40,318
You won't give all that up because
a nobody don't wanna be my voice.

1338
01:36:40,611 --> 01:36:42,529
She's got something.
It's a gold mine.

1339
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,906
Part of that choice is mine.

1340
01:36:45,116 --> 01:36:46,408
And I just won't do it.

1341
01:36:46,617 --> 01:36:50,245
You've got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.

1342
01:36:50,454 --> 01:36:52,956
What's the matter? Why
don't you tell her off?

1343
01:36:53,165 --> 01:36:55,041
I'm confused. This
thing is so big...

1344
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:58,461
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.

1345
01:36:58,671 --> 01:37:00,964
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

1346
01:37:01,132 --> 01:37:04,467
Listen. I'm an avalanche.
Selden, you're stuck.

1347
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,971
If this happens, get a new
boy. I won't stand for it.

1348
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:11,599
Who needs you? They'd come to see
me if I played opposite a monkey.

1349
01:37:11,809 --> 01:37:13,143
Don's a smash too.

1350
01:37:13,436 --> 01:37:15,979
I'll say a few words. I'm
still running the studio.

1351
01:37:16,188 --> 01:37:17,647
I'm not so sure.

1352
01:37:17,857 --> 01:37:21,151
You're Mr Producer, always
running things, running me.

1353
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,821
From now on, as far as I'm
concerned, I'm running things.

1354
01:37:25,114 --> 01:37:27,407
- Lina Lamont Pictures, Inc., huh?
- Yeah.

1355
01:37:27,616 --> 01:37:29,325
You've gone a little too far.

1356
01:37:29,577 --> 01:37:31,828
- They're yelling for a speech.
- A speech?

1357
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:34,956
Yeah, everybody's always
making speeches for me.

1358
01:37:35,166 --> 01:37:37,034
Tonight, I'm gonna do my own

1359
01:37:37,035 --> 01:37:39,502
talking. I'm gonna
make the speech.

1360
01:37:39,795 --> 01:37:42,672
- No, please.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1361
01:37:42,965 --> 01:37:46,843
This is Lina's big night and she's
entitled to do the talking.

1362
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:50,346
- Right?
- Right.

1363
01:37:55,227 --> 01:37:57,312
Ladies and gentlemen.

1364
01:37:57,521 --> 01:37:58,605
I can't tell you...

1365
01:37:58,814 --> 01:38:00,982
how thrilled we are
at your reception...

1366
01:38:01,192 --> 01:38:05,195
for The Dancing Cavalier, our
first musical picture together.

1367
01:38:05,488 --> 01:38:09,741
If we bring a little joy
into your humdrum lives...

1368
01:38:10,034 --> 01:38:12,243
it makes us feel as
though our hard work...

1369
01:38:12,536 --> 01:38:14,996
ain't been in vain for nothing.

1370
01:38:16,123 --> 01:38:17,832
Bless you all.

1371
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:19,751
She didn't sound that
way in the picture.

1372
01:38:20,044 --> 01:38:21,628
Cut the talk, Lina. Sing.

1373
01:38:22,671 --> 01:38:25,465
Sing us a song, Lina. Sing to us.

1374
01:38:25,633 --> 01:38:28,092
- Please.
- Come on, Lina, sing.

1375
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,887
I got an idea. Come here.

1376
01:38:31,096 --> 01:38:32,138
Now, listen.

1377
01:38:36,352 --> 01:38:38,353
What am I gonna do?

1378
01:38:38,562 --> 01:38:41,523
We've got it. Get a mike set
up back of that curtain.

1379
01:38:41,732 --> 01:38:45,068
Kathy, come here. Kathy will
stand back of there and sing.

1380
01:38:45,277 --> 01:38:48,738
She'll be back of the curtain
singing, and I'll be in front...

1381
01:38:48,948 --> 01:38:50,657
- Like in the picture?
- Right.

1382
01:38:50,908 --> 01:38:52,742
You've got to do it.
This is too big.

1383
01:38:52,952 --> 01:38:56,913
She's got a five-year contract
with me. Get over to that mike.

1384
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,415
You heard him, Kathy. Now do it.

1385
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:00,875
I'll do it, Don.

1386
01:39:01,085 --> 01:39:02,919
But I never want to
see you again...

1387
01:39:03,212 --> 01:39:05,088
on or off the screen.

1388
01:39:05,256 --> 01:39:06,923
Now, come on, Lina.

1389
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:13,221
What are you gonna sing?

1390
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:19,184
Singing in the Rain.

1391
01:39:20,167 --> 01:39:22,167

1392
01:39:23,274 --> 01:39:24,399
