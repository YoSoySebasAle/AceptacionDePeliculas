1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,320
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,880
All persons who have
anything to do before my lords,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,880
the queen's justices of oyer and
terminer and general jail delivery

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,200
for the jurisdiction
of the Central Criminal Court

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,760
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,320
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

7
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,320
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate
the sunshine. Is there a draught?

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,200
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

9
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,720
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,040
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

11
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,600
We've been flat on our back
for two months, we'd better be careful.

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,280
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the Inns of Court.

13
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,840
How lucky you lawyers are.

14
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,360
I almost married a lawyer.
I was in attendance for his appendectomy

15
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,080
and we became engaged
as soon as he could sit up.

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,120
And then peritonitis set in
and he went like that.

17
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,200
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

18
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,320
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

19
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,480
Oh, shut up!

20
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,560
Williams, my cane.

21
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,520
Here he comes!

22
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,160
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.

23
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

25
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,880
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,040
Nothing. I'm just happy
that you're your old self again.

27
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,200
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

28
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,760
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know,

29
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,120
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

30
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,680
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

31
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,160
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

32
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,040
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.

33
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,320
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

34
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

35
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,560
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

36
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,360
If anything happened to you,
what would happen to me, after 37 years?

37
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,440
37 years! Has it been all that long?

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,360
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

39
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,200
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

40
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,120
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.

41
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,880
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,960
Right here.

43
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,840
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,720
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.

45
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,400
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.

46
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
What's all this?

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,760
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

48
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,200
Of course. The solicitors
have been breaking down our doors.

49
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,920
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

50
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,480
Divorce case, a tax appeal,
and an important marine insurance claim.

51
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

52
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

53
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,560
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,
tobacco, female companionship.

54
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,200
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

55
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Sorry, sir.

56
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

57
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,720
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

58
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,960
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,
get undressed and lie down.

59
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,680
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

60
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,240
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,

61
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,560
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

62
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,400
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

63
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,440
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

64
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,400
For four months this alleged
angel of mercy has pored, probed,

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,480
punctured, pillaged and plundered
my helpless body

66
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,560
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip of baby talk.

67
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.

68
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,040
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

69
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,440
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

70
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,840
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

71
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,640
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

72
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,920
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy
all over the place.

73
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,720
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,880
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,280
No. Upstairs.

76
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,120
A few puffs after meals? Please.

77
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,320
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

78
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,200
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.

79
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,520
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

80
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

81
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,400
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

82
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,120
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.

83
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,920
Here you are. Simply press this button
for up and this one for down.

84
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,000
Carter, I warn you,
if this contraption should collapse,

85
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,240
if the barrister
should fall off the bannister...

86
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.

87
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,760
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

88
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,800
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

89
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,560
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

90
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,240
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

91
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

92
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,040
Serious criminal matter.

93
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,280
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

94
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,400
He can't accept anything
of an overstimulating nature.

95
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,560
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.

96
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,160
Hello. Distressing news about your health.

97
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,800
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

98
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,640
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

99
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,000
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

101
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,800
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

102
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,000
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

103
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,120
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

104
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,240
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.

105
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,960
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.

106
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,080
Mayhew! Mayhew!

107
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,360
Don't worry, we won't take the brief,
but an old friend needs help.

109
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,240
Surely I can give him a word of advice.

110
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,120
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

111
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,840
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
You go ahead. Start it without me.

113
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,400
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.

114
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,080
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

115
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

116
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,760
Seems silly to me,
but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

117
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

118
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,880
Well, for murder.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,480
Oh!

120
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,160
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.

121
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,960
Middle-aged widow, well-off,
living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

122
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,160
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

123
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,080
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

124
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,360
struck on the back of the head
and killed.

125
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,560
Vole seems caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence.

126
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,360
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

127
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,960
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

128
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,960
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

129
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,240
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

130
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,400
The defence may turn on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

131
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,040
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

132
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,760
This will take all our cunning.

133
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,240
Young man!

134
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
Come here, please.

135
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,400
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

136
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,560
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

137
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

138
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,160
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

139
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,080
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

140
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,520
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

141
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,920
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face
if she saw me now?

142
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,200
Then let's make absolutely sure
that she doesn't.

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,240
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

144
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,080
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

145
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,760
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

146
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,520
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

147
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,800
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.

148
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

149
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

150
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,720
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

151
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,000
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

152
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,120
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

153
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,160
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

154
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,880
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,840
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

156
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,640
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

157
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,560
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

158
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,120
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement

159
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,480
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

160
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,680
Well, it can't be helped now.

161
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,040
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

162
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,880
He thinks that he made a statement
and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

163
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,680
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

164
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

165
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,240
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

166
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,880
We try not to make a habit of it.

167
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,440
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?

168
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,000
Of course. There was that case of
that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

169
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,240
In jail for years and they
suddenly found it was another chap.

170
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,840
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,120
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

172
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,840
That's all right for him. What if
it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,080
How would they have restored him
to his normal life then?

174
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

175
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,400
It's just when you say these things
are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

176
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,040
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

177
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,600
Let's get this straight. I may have done
something highly unethical.

178
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,160
I've taken your cigar
but I'm not taking your case. I can't.

179
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

180
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,160
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

181
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,960
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

182
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,440
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

183
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,480
Hold this.

184
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,760
Carter?

185
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,680
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

186
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

187
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,920
Not even as a nurse during the war.

188
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,680
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

189
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,960
You'll like Brogan-Moore,
he's had excellent training. Under me.

190
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,880
This morning I had no lawyers at all
and now suddenly I have three.

191
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
We should explain
that I have very little money.

192
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

193
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,360
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.

194
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,480
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

195
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,520
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

196
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,880
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,200
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

198
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,440
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

199
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,280
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

200
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,960
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

201
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,520
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

202
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,040
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

203
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,760
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

204
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,320
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

205
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,040
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.

206
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,560
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

207
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,600
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

208
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

209
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,320
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

210
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,640
But my best is really this eggbeater.

211
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,080
It not only beats,
it also separates the yolk from the white.

212
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,480
Is that really desirable?

213
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,080
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

214
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,320
The trouble is, I need money
for manufacturing and promotion.

215
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,320
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

216
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,600
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

217
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,360
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

218
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,200
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,

219
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,080
daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,
if I had any money.

220
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

221
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,720
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

222
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,120
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

223
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,000
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

224
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,400
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

225
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,680
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

226
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,760
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

227
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,240
You buy that hat. I insist.

228
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,680
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

229
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

230
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,480
Go on, please.

231
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

232
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.

233
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,680
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

234
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,240
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

235
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,680
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

236
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,080
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

237
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,440
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

238
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,720
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

239
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,920
Thank you. It's such a bother
taking it off and putting it back on again.

240
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,880
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

241
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,400
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

242
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,200
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

243
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,440
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

244
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,600
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

245
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,240
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

246
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,240
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

247
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,400
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.

248
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,200
All I knew was she seemed to be
very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

249
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,000
She and her husband
lived abroad in British Nigeria.

250
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,520
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

251
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,800
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.

252
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

253
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,440
and after we left the movie
she invited me to her house for tea.

254
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,000
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

255
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,080
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

256
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,160
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

257
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,200
It must be cen-trifugal
or centrifugal, which is it?

258
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,840
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

259
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

260
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,480
We must have one. Is it expensive?

261
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,920
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

262
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,880
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

263
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,440
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,560
Ha!

265
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,600
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

266
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,680
Why not?

267
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,360
This is a charming room.

268
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,600
Hubert and I collected all these things
when we lived in Africa.

269
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,880
Hubert was my husband.

270
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,560
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

271
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,080
That's the mask of the witch doctor.

272
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

273
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,320
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.

274
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,440
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

275
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,680
Oh, here's tea.

276
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,560
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

277
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,560
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

278
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,040
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

279
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,120
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

280
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,400
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

281
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,320
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

282
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,120
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

283
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,640
Oh, is she? I thought
she came with the collection.

284
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,480
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.

285
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,280
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

286
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,920
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

287
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,960
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

288
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,200
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

289
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,480
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

290
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,960
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

291
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,040
and unsanitary.

292
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,120
Tell Sir Wilfrid about
the evening of the murder.

293
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,360
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

294
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,320
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.

295
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,360
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

296
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,440
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

297
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,120
How much money did you get
from Mrs French?

298
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

299
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,960
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

300
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,040
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

301
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,080
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

302
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

303
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,160
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

304
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,040
- Because...
- Because what?

305
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,600
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

306
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,040
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

307
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,960
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

308
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,360
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

309
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,720
Because she was rich,
and you were after her money.

310
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Well, yes, in a way.

311
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,080
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

312
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,360
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?

313
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,560
You knew it was
the housekeeper's day off?

314
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,280
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

315
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,840
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

316
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,600
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

317
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,480
with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.

318
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,160
Perhaps you turned up
the volume to drown her cries.

319
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,720
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

320
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,640
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

321
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
I didn't do it. No matter
how bad things look, I didn't do it!

322
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,240
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

323
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,240
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

324
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,720
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

325
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,040
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

326
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,920
As for things looking bad, they
don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

327
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,200
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

328
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,520
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

329
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,560
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

330
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,640
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

331
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,400
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

332
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,760
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.

333
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,920
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

334
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,680
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?

335
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,600
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

336
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,360
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

337
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,160
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

338
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,960
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

339
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,360
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

340
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,760
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.

341
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,760
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

342
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

343
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

344
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,360
You will agree that we can rule out
a crime of passion, hm?

345
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,160
That leaves us with a murder for profit.

346
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,240
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

347
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,800
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

348
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,840
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

349
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,120
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

350
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,440
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

351
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,800
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

352
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh, we'll simply put a lean
on Mr Vole's $80,000.

353
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,960
- What $80,000?
- The $80,000 Mrs French left you.

354
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,200
Left me?

355
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,280
They opened Mrs French's
bank vault today and found her will.

356
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,240
- Congratulations.
- $80,000!

357
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,800
And I was worried about a couple
of hundred for that silly eggbeater.

358
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,880
I must call Christine.

359
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,240
Oh.

360
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,240
This doesn't make things
look any better for me, does it?

361
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,680
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

362
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,120
They will indeed. $80,000 makes for
a very handsome motive.

363
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,800
I thought you were crazy
but now they will arrest me!

364
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,880
It's not unlikely.

365
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,200
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

366
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,680
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

367
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,040
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

368
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,520
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

369
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,160
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

370
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,840
You're getting the de luxe treatment.

371
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,120
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

372
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,840
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police

373
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,640
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

374
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,120
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.

375
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,640
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

376
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,320
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

377
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,920
I have a warrant for your arrest
on the charge of murdering Emily French.

378
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,840
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

379
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,800
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?

380
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,320
That won't be necessary, sir.

381
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,840
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

382
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,640
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

383
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,920
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

384
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,040
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

385
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,280
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.

386
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,200
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

387
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,960
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

388
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,760
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

389
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,280
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

390
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,240
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

391
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,320
Good day, sir.

392
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Makes a very nice impression,
doesn't he?

393
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,640
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

394
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,160
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

395
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,960
Of course. The prosecution will
blast in with their heaviest artillery.

396
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,440
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

397
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

398
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,520
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

399
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,320
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

400
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,680
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

401
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

402
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,400
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

403
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,480
For my first day this has already
been rather hectic. I should be in bed.

404
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,120
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

405
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,200
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

406
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,200
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

407
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,480
Take me, I'm yours.

408
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,120
Oh!

409
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,640
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

410
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,320
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

411
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

412
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,960
I do not think
that will be necessary.

413
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,360
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,

414
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,160
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

415
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,680
I'm Christine Vole.

416
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,320
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

417
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,400
How do you do?

418
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,440
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

419
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,360
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

420
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,280
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

421
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,840
Leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder. Is that it?

422
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,280
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

423
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,920
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.

424
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,000
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

425
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,080
Your husband will have
to stand trial, I'm afraid.

426
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

427
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,640
Oh?

428
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,480
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

429
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,080
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

430
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,440
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

431
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,280
Is it, perhaps,
that this cause is too hopeless?

432
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,840
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It
was a mistake to let you come back here.

433
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,480
I should have taken you
to a rest-home or a resort.

434
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,960
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.

435
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,920
Shut up. You just want
to see me in those nasty shorts.

436
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,200
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

437
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,160
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

438
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,240
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

439
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,280
After your rest
we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.

440
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,360
Then perhaps
we'll have a walk around the square.

441
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,040
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

442
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,520
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

443
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,120
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

444
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,640
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

445
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,520
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

446
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,960
All right. Hop in!

447
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,320
Sir Wilfrid?

448
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,680
Sir Wilfrid!

449
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,520
Come back!

450
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,440
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

451
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,680
Go on.

452
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,400
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

453
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,600
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.

454
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,560
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

455
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,760
and the socks were two sizes too large,

456
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,480
but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure.

457
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,560
Leonard has a way with women.

458
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,240
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

459
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,200
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

460
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Yes. A lot of money.

461
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,120
Of course, your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest?

462
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,400
Is that what he told you?

463
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,920
Surely you're not suggesting different?

464
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,920
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.

465
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,680
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

466
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,960
You think Mrs French looked
upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

467
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,600
I do. An entirely natural
and understandable relationship.

468
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,960
What hypocrites you are in this country.

469
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,960
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

470
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,520
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

471
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,520
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

472
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,920
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

473
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,000
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

474
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,840
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

475
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,640
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

476
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
I assume you want to help your husband?

477
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,880
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

478
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,960
There. Isn't that
more comfortable for you?

479
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,720
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.

480
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,600
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9.30. Correct?

481
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,000
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

482
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,000
Isn't it the truth?

483
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,920
Of course.

484
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,840
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

485
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,040
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

486
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,360
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

487
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,640
we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian

488
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,280
and who must have an interpreter.

489
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,560
We accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

490
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,960
as long as they tell the truth.

491
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,320
You're aware that when you're
in the witness box you will be sworn

492
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,400
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

493
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,240
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

494
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,320
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. Is that better?

495
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,720
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

496
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,440
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

497
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,760
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

498
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,760
you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband?

499
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,000
How very convenient.

500
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,200
We are dealing with a capital crime.

501
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,960
The prosecution
will try to hang your husband.

502
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,560
He is not my husband.

503
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,040
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

504
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,920
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

505
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,840
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

506
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,920
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.

507
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,560
But he did marry you
and brought you safely here.

508
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,880
Don't you think you should be grateful?

509
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,040
One can get very tired of gratitude.

510
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,760
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

511
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,040
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.

512
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,280
And you?

513
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,680
You want to know too much.

514
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,160
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.

515
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,400
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

516
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,040
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

517
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,960
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely. "

518
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,800
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.

519
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,200
And you're satisfied, I hope?

520
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,880
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

521
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,440
That woman's up to something. But what?

522
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,440
The prosecution will break her down
in no time when she's in the witness box.

523
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,920
This case is going to be rather
like the charge of the Light Brigade

524
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,680
or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.

525
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,120
With the odds all on the other side.

526
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,680
I haven't got much to go on, have I?

527
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,280
The fact is, I've got nothing.

528
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,440
Let me ask you something.

529
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,920
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?

530
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,720
Do you?

531
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,360
Do you?

532
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,440
I'm not sure.

533
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

534
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,800
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

535
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,480
I'll take it from here.

536
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,560
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

537
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,040
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

538
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,080
Did you hear me? A match!

539
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,320
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

540
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,600
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

541
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,240
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

542
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,520
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

543
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,600
This is what you were wearing that night.

544
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,480
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

545
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,960
Over here against the wall, please.

546
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,120
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.

547
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,640
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

548
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,360
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

549
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,240
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.

550
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,560
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.

551
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,640
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

552
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,160
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

553
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,800
Mayhew, give me the reports.

554
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,960
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

555
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:28,000
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

556
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,320
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

557
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,480
particularly her income tax returns. "

558
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,400
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms
are very complicated.

559
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,680
There's also a hint you may
have helped her draft her new will.

560
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,680
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

561
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,400
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

562
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,480
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

563
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,200
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?

564
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,880
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.

565
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,440
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

566
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,640
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

567
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,640
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

568
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,120
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

569
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,120
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.

570
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,400
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

571
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,480
In Germany in 1945.

572
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,000
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

573
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,720
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
With an RAF maintenance unit.

574
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,160
I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a Weekend pass.

575
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,400
Come on!

576
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,040
Join the party

577
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,080
Have a hearty glass of rum

578
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,680
Don't ever think about tomorrow

579
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,760
For tomorrow may never come

580
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,040
When I find me a happy place

581
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,080
That's where I wanna stay

582
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,840
Time is nothing
as long as I'm living it up this way

583
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,560
I may never go home any more

584
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,960
Dim the lights
and start locking the door

585
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,240
Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me

586
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,800
After all that's what sailors are for

587
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,720
I've got kisses and kisses galore

588
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,000
That have never been tasted before

589
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,240
If you treat me right
This could be the night

590
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,880
I may never go home

591
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,520
I may never go home

592
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,360
I may never go home

593
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,040
I may never go home

594
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,520
I may never go home any more

595
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,800
I may never go home any more

596
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Hey, Fräulein, show us some legs.

597
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,080
They rob you blind
and then throw you a ruddy sailor!

598
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,560
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

599
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,360
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!

600
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,720
All right, Fräulein,
if you won't show 'em, I will.

601
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,600
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

602
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Come on.

603
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,400
Bring him round to the other truck.

604
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,240
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

605
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,120
Gesundheit.

606
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,320
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

607
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,400
Oh, let me help you.

608
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,360
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

609
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,320
I'm terribly sorry.

610
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,680
You better go. We've had trouble enough.

611
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,680
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

612
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,000
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

613
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,480
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

614
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,600
Cigarette? Gum?

615
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,400
You're burning my nose.

616
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,880
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

617
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,480
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

618
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,080
How much?

619
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,240
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?

620
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,160
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

621
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,280
Got any hot water at your place?

622
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,680
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

623
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,360
Nearby.

624
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,920
Come.

625
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,120
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

626
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,680
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemütlich sort of way.

627
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,280
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.

628
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,600
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

629
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,400
She has a Ford automobile.

630
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,480
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

631
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,720
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.

632
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,280
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

633
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,720
You'd better sit down on the cot.

634
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,480
The cot?

635
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,960
Getting more gemütlich all the time.
Are you married?

636
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,920
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

637
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,600
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

638
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,480
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.

639
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,120
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

640
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,400
But it's getting better.

641
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,040
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.

642
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,080
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

643
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,520
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

644
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,640
Very fair.

645
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,640
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

646
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,720
I would.

647
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,120
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

648
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,960
Milk?

649
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,840
Sure.

650
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,640
Milk. Sugar.

651
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,080
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

652
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah.

653
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,720
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,

654
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,200
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

655
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,280
Don't worry, we'll work out something,
like an instalment plan.

656
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,760
I may never go home any more

657
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,520
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

658
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,400
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

659
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,800
Ooh.

660
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,880
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

661
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,200
Maybe I can fix it.

662
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,280
I'm good at it.

663
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,960
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

664
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,760
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

665
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,040
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

666
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,840
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.

667
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,360
First time she saw it, she was so happy
she broke down and cried.

668
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,000
Naturally. She had a solid roof
over her head and a British passport.

669
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,480
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

670
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,320
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.

671
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,160
You're not? Why not?

672
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,880
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar
with the subtleties of our language.

673
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,320
The prosecution could easily trip her up.

674
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,440
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.

675
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,600
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

676
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,080
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

677
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,680
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

678
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,440
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

679
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,120
Let us wish each other luck.

680
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,800
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

681
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,440
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.

682
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,320
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

683
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,200
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

684
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,280
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

685
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,200
murdered Emily Jane French.

686
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,920
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

687
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,000
Are you guilty or not guilty?

688
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,480
Not guilty.

689
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,400
Members of the jury,

690
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,120
the prisoner stands indicted for that he,
on the 14th day of October,

691
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,000
murdered Emily Jane French.

692
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,720
To this indictment
he has pleaded not guilty.

693
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,480
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

694
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,480
whether he be guilty or not.

695
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,800
Members of the jury,
by the oath which you have just taken,

696
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,320
you have sworn
to try this case on the evidence.

697
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,960
You must shut out
from your minds everything

698
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,520
except what will take place in this court.

699
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,040
You may proceed
for the prosecution, Mr Myers.

700
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,560
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

701
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,240
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

702
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,120
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

703
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,200
appear for the defence.

704
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,280
I trust we are not to be deprived

705
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,200
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

706
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,480
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

707
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,680
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

708
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,760
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

709
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,080
You may, Mr Myers. You may also
proceed with the case for the prosecution.

710
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,360
Thank you, my lord.

711
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,280
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

712
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,360
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

713
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,000
a woman of 56.

714
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,360
How he was treated by her
with kindness and even affection.

715
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,960
On the night of October 14 last,

716
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,920
between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

717
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,400
Medical testimony
will be introduced to prove

718
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,720
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

719
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,360
and it is the case for the prosecution

720
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,560
that the blow was dealt
by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

721
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,640
That's not true! I didn't do it!

722
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,840
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

723
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,640
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

724
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,440
and from the medical
and laboratory experts,

725
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,000
and the evidence of the murdered
woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.

726
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,760
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

727
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,600
- New Scotland Yard.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

728
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,680
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

729
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,360
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

730
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,040
240 above 130.
You shouldn't be here at all.

731
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,160
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

732
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,600
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

733
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,400
It may interest you to know
that I am descended from a warrior family

734
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,680
which traces its brave past
back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

735
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,080
You're to have a calcium injection daily,

736
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,920
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

737
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,880
Any pain or shortness of breath,
pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets

738
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,640
under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...

739
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,840
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.

740
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,360
Carter, I'd better take
that Thermos of cocoa with me.

741
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,200
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

742
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,480
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

743
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,040
It is cocoa. So sorry.

744
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,080
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

745
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,760
Take care of this, Carter.

746
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,880
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

747
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,360
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

748
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,080
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.

749
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,560
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

750
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,640
Come along, Carter.

751
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,640
From the body temperature
and other factors,

752
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,360
we placed the time of death
at between 9.30 and 10pm,

753
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,760
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

754
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,760
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

755
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,960
Were there any signs of a struggle?

756
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,320
None. Just the one blow.

757
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,240
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

758
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,520
My lord, I must object.

759
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,840
My learned friend refers
to the assailant as "the murderer".

760
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,400
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

761
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,360
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

762
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,200
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

763
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,400
Please rephrase your question.

764
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:52,320
Yes, my lord. Inspector,
is it your opinion that the assailant,

765
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,440
whether he, she or it,
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

766
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,680
My lord, I am taken by surprise

767
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,480
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

768
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,400
Quite so. You'll have
to do better than that, Mr Myers.

769
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,760
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.

770
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,440
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

771
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,840
Silence! Silence!

772
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Very well, Inspector,
let us proceed with the facts.

773
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,160
After establishing the cause and the time
of death, what did you then do?

774
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,960
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

775
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,080
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

776
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,480
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

777
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,720
- No others?
- No others.

778
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:48,440
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

779
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:53,720
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

780
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,680
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

781
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:03,040
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

782
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:09,600
You're saying that someone made it look
as if it had been forced from the outside?

783
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,920
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

784
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,840
After all, if he insists
on answering his own questions,

785
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,240
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

786
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,720
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?

787
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,800
Yes, my lord.

788
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,240
Inspector,

789
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,840
did you ascertain if any of the murdered
woman's property was missing?

790
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,920
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

791
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:39,440
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

792
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,320
break into a house,
do they leave without taking anything?

793
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,520
No, sir.

794
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,440
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

795
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,720
Is that the jacket?

796
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,480
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

797
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,560
Where did you find this, Inspector?

798
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,160
That is the jacket
found in the prisoner's flat,

799
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,680
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

800
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,160
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

801
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,760
Though an attempt
had been made to wash them out.

802
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,680
What tests were made?

803
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,840
First to determine
if the stains were human blood,

804
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,280
then to classify it by group or type.

805
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,960
And was the blood
of a particular group or type?

806
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,880
Yes, sir. It is type O.

807
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,160
And did you subsequently
test the blood of the dead woman?

808
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,520
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

809
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,200
The same. Type O.

810
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,960
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

811
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,920
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

812
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,360
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

813
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,240
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

814
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,640
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

815
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,000
So the absence
of fingerprints in a robbery

816
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,240
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

817
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:59,200
Can't we surmise the burglar might have
entered a presumably empty house,

818
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,920
suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her,

819
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,240
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

820
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,840
I submit, my lord,
that it is entirely impossible

821
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,360
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

822
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,640
With or without gloves.

823
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,520
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

824
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,840
Inspector, when you questioned
the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

825
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,840
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar on his wrist,

826
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,520
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

827
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,280
And were you not told
the same thing by his wife?

828
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,120
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

829
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,520
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife

830
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,520
and tell you that her husband
had cut his wrist while slicing bread?

831
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,080
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

832
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,640
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

833
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,600
You agree that the point
and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?

834
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,080
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

835
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,120
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

836
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,400
Yes, sir, it might.

837
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,440
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

838
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,320
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

839
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,800
- That is correct.
- However,

840
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,240
if the prisoner's blood
were also of this same group,

841
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,960
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

842
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,680
from the household accident
he described to you.

843
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,120
Yes, sir.

844
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,880
Did you examine
the prisoner's blood, Inspector?

845
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,480
No, sir.

846
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,880
I have here a certificate

847
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,120
stating that Leonard Stephen Vole
is a blood donor

848
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,440
at the North London Hospital.

849
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,840
And that his blood is group O.

850
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,680
Thank you, Inspector.

851
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:07,040
Inspector, granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that knife,

852
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,120
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

853
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,160
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

854
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,960
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

855
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,440
You may stand down.

856
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,080
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

857
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,960
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

858
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,000
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence...

859
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,640
.. the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

860
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,840
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.

861
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,320
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

862
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,240
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

863
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,680
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

864
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,400
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

865
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,640
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

866
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,800
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

867
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,080
poor feckless bodies, afraid
of a bit of honest domestic work.

868
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,200
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

869
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,320
Aye. Ten years I was with her
and looked after her.

870
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,000
She knew me and she trusted me.

871
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,880
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.

872
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,680
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

873
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,240
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

874
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:54,640
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

875
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,840
I promised to take her
a dress pattern that she admired.

876
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,440
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

877
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,800
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

878
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,440
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

879
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,200
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

880
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,600
So after supper I slipped
back to get it as it was no distance.

881
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,880
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.

882
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,240
I let myself in
and went upstairs to my room.

883
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,360
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

884
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,440
No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!

885
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,520
Talking and laughing they were.

886
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,040
But it was no business of mine,
so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

887
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,440
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.

888
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,320
You say that you
re-entered the house at 25 past 9?

889
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,680
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

890
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,080
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

891
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,960
I went back to my niece. Och,
she was delighted with the pattern. Si...

892
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:07,840
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

893
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,600
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

894
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,680
before she went to bed.

895
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,160
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.

896
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,080
Did you really think
that a burglary had been committed?

897
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,160
My lord, I must protest!

898
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,280
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

899
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,160
Miss McKenzie, were you aware
that Leonard Vole was a married man?

900
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,040
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.

901
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,120
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

902
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,000
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

903
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,720
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

904
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,200
that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?

905
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,680
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

906
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,480
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

907
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,480
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

908
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,120
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

909
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,760
Why?

910
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,880
Members of the jury, it is possible
for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli

911
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,960
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

912
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,400
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

913
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,880
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

914
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,320
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

915
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,280
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

916
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,080
You heard Mrs French
and the prisoner discussing her new will?

917
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,920
Yes. He was to have all her money,
she told him,

918
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:43,280
as she had no near relations nor anybody
that meant to her what he did.

919
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,680
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

920
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,960
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

921
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,200
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.

922
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,640
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

923
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,720
Would you...? Thank you.

924
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,040
Miss McKenzie, you have
given evidence about two wills.

925
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,120
In the old will, that which was revoked,

926
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,920
were you not to receive
the bulk of Mrs French's estate?

927
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,200
That's so.

928
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,440
Whereas in the new will, except for
a bequest to you of a small annuity,

929
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,080
the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

930
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,840
It'll be a wicked injustice
if he ever touches a penny of that money.

931
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,120
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.

932
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,720
I'm not antagonistic to him.

933
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,680
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

934
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,640
I suggest you formed this opinion

935
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,400
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

936
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,520
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

937
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,240
Now. On the night of October 14

938
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,520
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

939
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,960
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

940
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,520
You mean you only heard the voices?

941
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,360
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

942
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,480
What makes you say
the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?

943
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,800
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

944
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,240
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

945
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,160
so you probably walked
quickly past the closed door,

946
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,880
yet you are sure
you heard Leonard Vole's voice?

947
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,680
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

948
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,760
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

949
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,320
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

950
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,560
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

951
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,600
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

952
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,600
Yes. She was fond
of a talk or a good play.

953
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,840
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

954
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,040
what you really heard was the television

955
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,640
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

956
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,040
There was a play called Lover's Leap
on the television that night.

957
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,400
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

958
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,360
Because the television was away
being repaired that week, that's why.

959
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,360
Silence! Silence!

960
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Odd. It's not time yet.

961
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,040
If my learned friend has no further
questions, I'd like...

962
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,120
I have not quite finished.

963
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:29,680
You are registered, are you not,
under the National Health Insurance Act?

964
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,400
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.

965
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,440
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

966
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,360
I am sure that many agree with you.

967
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:45,640
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

968
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,240
- .. a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

969
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,240
I protest against the way
in which this question was put!

970
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,320
I will repeat the question, my lord.

971
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:01,160
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

972
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,960
did you apply to the National Health
Insurance for a hearing aid?

973
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,080
Yes, I did.

974
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,520
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

975
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,720
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

976
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,920
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

977
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,000
that you could distinguish the voice of...

978
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,240
.. the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

979
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,320
Who? Who?

980
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,440
No further questions.

981
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,000
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.

982
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,040
Six months ago I applied for
my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

983
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,920
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering
the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

984
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,880
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

985
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,560
Call Police Constable Jeffries.

986
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,800
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

987
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,640
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

988
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,640
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

989
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,120
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?

990
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:33,040
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

991
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,800
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

992
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,920
Christine.

993
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,920
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

994
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,520
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

995
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,160
My lord, I have the most serious objection

996
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,200
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

997
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,320
I call my learned friend's attention

998
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,800
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

999
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,840
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1000
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,440
And you have been living
as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1001
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,120
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1002
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,120
No.

1003
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,560
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1004
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,200
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1005
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,640
There is proof of a marriage
between the witness and the prisoner,

1006
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,600
but is there any proof
of a so-called previous marriage?

1007
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:51,120
My lord, the so-called previous marriage
is, in fact, well-documented.

1008
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:57,000
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1009
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,640
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1010
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,480
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.

1011
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:10,280
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1012
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,680
You're willing to give evidence against the
man you've been calling your husband?

1013
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,200
Yes.

1014
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,440
You stated to the police that on the night
that Mrs French was murdered,

1015
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,600
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1016
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,240
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?

1017
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,880
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.

1018
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:41,480
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1019
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,960
Silence!

1020
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,040
I must have silence.

1021
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,280
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1022
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,240
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1023
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,320
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1024
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,840
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1025
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,560
He threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves.

1026
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,800
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1027
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,000
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1028
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,000
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1029
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,280
He said "I've killed her. "

1030
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,720
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1031
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,840
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1032
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,280
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1033
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,440
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself.

1034
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,160
My lord is most gracious,
but pray let the witness continue.

1035
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,360
We are all of us caught up
in the suspense of this horror fiction.

1036
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,200
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1037
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,120
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1038
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,840
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1039
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,720
It was that woman
he had been seeing so often.

1040
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,360
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1041
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,760
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1042
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,880
But you've changed your story now. Why?

1043
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,120
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1044
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,440
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1045
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,240
He married me
and brought me to this country.

1046
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,240
What he has asked me to do I have
because I was grateful.

1047
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,280
It was not because
he was your husband and you loved him?

1048
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,360
I never loved him.

1049
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,880
It was gratitude, then,
that prompted you to give him an alibi

1050
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,360
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1051
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,880
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1052
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
That woman, she was a harmless old fool,

1053
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,600
and he makes of me
an accomplice to the murder.

1054
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,560
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1055
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,280
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1056
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,520
Then this is the truth?

1057
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,040
That Leonard Vole returned
that night at ten minutes past ten,

1058
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,160
he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,

1059
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,280
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

1060
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,520
That is the truth.

1061
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,720
That is the truth, before God?

1062
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,840
That is the truth.

1063
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,280
Thank you.

1064
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,680
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,
which do you prefer to be called?

1065
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,760
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1066
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,800
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1067
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,880
However, it would appear that when
you first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1068
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,320
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

1069
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,440
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1070
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,480
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1071
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,600
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1072
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,520
I, um, did not tell the truth
to the authorities.

1073
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,760
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1074
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,120
And in the ceremony, when you swore
to love, honour and cherish your husband,

1075
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,600
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1076
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,880
And when the police questioned you
about this wretched man

1077
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,280
who believed himself married and loved,

1078
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,800
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1079
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,600
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1080
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,880
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1081
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,200
And when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1082
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,000
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1083
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,480
The question is, Frau Helm,
were you lying then, are you lying now?

1084
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,200
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

1085
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,880
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.

1086
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,160
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1087
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,360
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1088
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,440
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1089
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,920
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1090
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,800
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1091
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,680
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1092
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,400
when she was sworn here today.

1093
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:04,640
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1094
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,800
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1095
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,840
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1096
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:19,400
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.

1097
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,520
It means to swear falsely under oath.

1098
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,400
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1099
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,280
that the penalty in this country for perjury
is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1100
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,760
Yes, I'm aware.

1101
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,400
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1102
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,000
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1103
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,040
So help me, God.

1104
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:46,360
Then that, my lord,
is the case for the prosecution.

1105
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,120
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1106
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,760
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1107
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:12,760
Silence.

1108
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,480
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?

1109
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,200
My lord, members of the jury,

1110
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,280
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1111
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,640
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1112
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,120
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief Inspector Hearne,

1113
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:42,120
who has given his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner, as he always does.

1114
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,960
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1115
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,880
Whether it is theory
or actual fact, however,

1116
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,480
you will decide for yourselves.

1117
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,440
And then you have heard
the evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1118
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,600
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1119
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,920
One, the death of her beloved mistress

1120
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:09,520
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of $80,000,

1121
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,320
which she'd fully expected to receive.

1122
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,120
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1123
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,960
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her

1124
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,840
in both these... mishaps.

1125
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:30,240
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1126
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,800
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1127
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,480
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1128
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,200
I objected to her testimony
because a wife cannot give evidence

1129
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,680
harmful to her husband.

1130
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:52,240
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1131
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:58,280
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it.

1132
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,160
For what it is worth.

1133
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,960
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.

1134
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,000
We could present, on behalf of
the prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1135
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,880
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1136
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,520
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1137
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,400
on this tragic riddle.

1138
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,400
The prisoner himself.

1139
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,840
Members of the jury,

1140
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,440
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1141
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,120
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give will be the truth,

1142
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,280
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

1143
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,440
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1144
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,520
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1145
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,720
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did
you not on the night of October 14 last,

1146
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,000
murder Emily Jane French?

1147
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,320
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1148
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,680
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1149
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,880
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1150
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,400
The defence feels
his faculties should be spared

1151
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,960
for the cross-examination
by my learned friend for the prosecution.

1152
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,840
This is not a plea for any indulgence.

1153
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,880
I am confident that
no matter how searching this may be,

1154
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,760
the prisoner will withstand it.

1155
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,720
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1156
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,800
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1157
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,920
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1158
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:54,800
No.

1159
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,040
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1160
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:01,880
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of $80,000?

1161
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,160
No, I didn't.

1162
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,960
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1163
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,240
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat?

1164
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,680
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1165
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,240
Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,360
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1167
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,600
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1168
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,800
who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own

1169
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,400
at the times that he has stated.

1170
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,840
Apparently, this splendid effort
was without results.

1171
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,240
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1172
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,440
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1173
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:46,040
and that the prisoner had been
seen wearing this coat and this hat.

1174
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:51,360
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1175
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,600
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1176
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,600
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1177
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,880
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?

1178
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,960
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1179
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:11,920
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1180
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:17,080
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1181
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,520
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1182
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,280
My lord, the lady was so described to me.

1183
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,680
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1184
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,680
Oh.

1185
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,800
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1186
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,000
How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

1187
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,240
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1188
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:43,560
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1189
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,960
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1190
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,040
And in the afternoon,
you started plans to dispose of it.

1191
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,280
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1192
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,440
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1193
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,600
We had a drink and walked out together.

1194
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:02,520
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1195
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:07,720
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

1196
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,560
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1197
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,960
Anyway, it irritated me,
so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,

1198
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,440
all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,
but it was just an act!

1199
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,560
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit $80,000!

1200
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:27,040
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but...

1201
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,400
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

1202
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,320
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1203
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,800
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1204
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,320
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1205
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,120
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1206
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,840
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1207
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,480
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1208
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:58,920
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1209
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,480
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1210
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,520
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.

1211
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,440
And the fact, Mr Vole,
is that we've only your word for it.

1212
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,360
That you left Mrs French's house
at the time you say,

1213
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:16,080
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1214
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,240
Somebody must have seen me
in the street or going in the house!

1215
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,560
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1216
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,840
says it was ten past ten
and that you had blood on your hands.

1217
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,840
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1218
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,920
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1219
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,840
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.

1220
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,080
You came home at ten past ten!

1221
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:41,400
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1222
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,640
You killed Emily French!

1223
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,000
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1224
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,840
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!

1225
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:54,360
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1226
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,160
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1227
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,440
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1228
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,680
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1229
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,640
What?

1230
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,120
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1231
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:20,120
It'll all be over by the afternoon,
and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1232
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,520
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1233
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:28,000
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath
and your calcium injection.

1234
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,960
And there's a lot more packing to be done.

1235
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:36,520
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1236
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:40,800
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1237
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,240
I watched when Frau Helm
was on the stand. They didn't like her.

1238
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:50,440
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1239
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,680
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1240
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,600
No.

1241
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,400
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1242
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,800
I'm not sure.

1243
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,520
I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
Meineid or perjury, she lied.

1244
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:07,480
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1245
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:13,000
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1246
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,920
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1247
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,440
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1248
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,160
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1249
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,960
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.

1250
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,840
He's entitled to the best that I can do.

1251
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,840
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal
for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1252
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:38,120
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

1253
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:48,640
- Yes?
- This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?

1254
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,040
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.

1255
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:56,360
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.

1256
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,880
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?

1257
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,160
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1258
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,480
Well, really, madam!

1259
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,480
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

1260
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,160
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1261
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,440
It's about that German Wife.

1262
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,960
I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.

1263
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:22,440
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

1264
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,800
Well, hello, ducky.

1265
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,720
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1266
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,560
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and White.

1267
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,520
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1268
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:38,000
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

1269
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,400
I'll be here for 30 minutes
because that's when me train leaves.

1270
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,680
If you want the lowdown on
that German bag, get yourself here.

1271
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,240
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1272
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,440
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

1273
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:53,640
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

1274
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,440
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

1275
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:04,800
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

1276
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:09,280
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

1277
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,160
Balderdash.

1278
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:16,520
I'm too old and too sick
to go on a wild-goose chase.

1279
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,400
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

1280
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,480
Euston Station, where do you think?

1281
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,960
Now, sir?

1282
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,840
Shortly.

1283
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,200
Cigar!

1284
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,040
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

1285
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:37,680
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

1286
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,760
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1287
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,600
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

1288
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,280
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

1289
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,640
Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.

1290
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,200
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

1291
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,240
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1292
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:25,600
No need for mine. If I did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

1293
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:29,800
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'Imen friends.

1294
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,400
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1295
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:36,800
You realise that you're duty-bound
to give any evidence that you might have?

1296
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,360
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1297
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,800
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1298
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,560
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1299
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:54,440
Poor bleeder, he's been took in
by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.

1300
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,520
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1301
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,280
Well, I don't expect you...

1302
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:09,240
Well, as I say, I don't expect you
to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1303
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,720
If these letters get the boy off,
it's $100 for me, right?

1304
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,520
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer $10.

1305
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:21,920
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1306
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,760
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1307
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,920
If these help prove my client's innocence,

1308
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,440
$20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1309
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,480
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.

1310
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,880
- $40.
- All right, blast yer.

1311
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,760
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.

1312
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,840
How do we know
these are from Mrs Vole?

1313
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,120
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1314
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,360
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.

1315
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,880
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1316
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,360
Good heavens, look at this.

1317
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,800
Juicy, ain't they?

1318
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,720
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1319
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,800
What's the difference
so long as she gets what's coming?

1320
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,960
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1321
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,360
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1322
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,760
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1323
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,040
Ha!

1324
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:27,960
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1325
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:32,840
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1326
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,760
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1327
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:43,080
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1328
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:47,400
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1329
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:53,040
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im
away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

1330
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,880
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.

1331
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,080
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another $5 for the letters.

1332
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,360
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1333
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,920
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

1334
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,280
Unbelievable.

1335
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:19,520
We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1336
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,560
Miss, um...

1337
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,480
Where is she?

1338
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:34,800
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1339
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,080
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1340
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,160
Good idea.

1341
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,240
Silence!

1342
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,400
Be upstanding in court.

1343
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,000
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

1344
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,160
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer

1345
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:03,120
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

1346
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:07,400
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

1347
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,840
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1348
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,280
it has the right to be heard last.

1349
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:32,440
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1350
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,760
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1351
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,400
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1352
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,800
that a verdict of guilty
must be the only possible conclusion.

1353
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,960
I will briefly summarise these facts...

1354
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,680
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1355
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:01,360
That is, if Sir Wilfrid
is at all interested in our proceedings.

1356
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:05,760
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech
for the crown, however, is premature.

1357
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:10,680
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1358
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,520
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1359
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,760
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1360
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,160
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1361
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,920
I have anticipated this objection
and can meet it with ample precedent.

1362
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:30,600
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1363
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,040
at page 463.

1364
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:37,240
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1365
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:40,640
1942 at page 153.

1366
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,520
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1367
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:47,560
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1368
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,160
since you appeared for the prosecution.

1369
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:54,800
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.

1370
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,080
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1371
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,200
Letters, my lord.

1372
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,280
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1373
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,960
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

1374
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:11,480
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1375
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,200
in the king against Sullivan
was sustained.

1376
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,440
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1377
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,920
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1378
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,080
As yours is now, by me.

1379
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,320
Call Christine Helm.

1380
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,680
Christine Helm.

1381
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,480
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.

1382
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:02,200
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I
wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

1383
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:06,160
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

1384
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,440
Yes.

1385
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:13,040
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1386
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:17,000
It's a simple question. Do you
or do you not know a man called Max?

1387
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,320
Max? Certainly not.

1388
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:23,120
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1389
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,640
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.

1390
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:32,360
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1391
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,760
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1392
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,120
I suggest that on October 20

1393
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:42,440
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,920
- .. addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1395
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,960
The letter was but one of a series
written to the same man.

1396
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,800
Lies! All lies!

1397
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:56,880
You seem to have been, well, let us say,
on intimate terms with this man.

1398
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,640
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1399
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:05,040
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1400
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:09,840
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened. "

1401
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,800
"I believe all our difficulties
may be ended. "

1402
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,400
I will not stand here
and listen to a pack of lies!

1403
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,200
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1404
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,520
- It isn't?
- No!

1405
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,920
I write my letters on small blue paper
with my initials on it.

1406
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,320
Like this?

1407
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:38,040
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.

1408
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,840
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him
and that's what he is.

1409
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,120
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough
to identify your letter paper.

1410
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:52,960
Now, if you like, I can have an expert
identify your handwriting.

1411
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,880
Damn you!

1412
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,240
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

1413
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,480
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

1414
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,960
Let me go!
Let me get out of here! Let me go!

1415
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,440
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

1416
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,160
Usher, get the witness a chair.

1417
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:20,160
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1418
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,080
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened. "

1419
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,720
"All our difficulties may soon be solved. "

1420
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:38,720
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about. "

1421
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:44,440
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone. "

1422
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:51,440
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home
with me at the time of the murder,

1423
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:55,280
that he came home
with blood on his sleeves,

1424
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:59,160
and that he even admitted to me
that he'd killed her?"

1425
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,600
"Strange that he always said
he would never let me leave him. "

1426
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:06,200
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

1427
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:10,040
because they will take him away forever

1428
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:14,720
and I shall be free and yours,
my beloved. "

1429
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,480
"I count the hours until
we are together. Christine. "

1430
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,200
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?

1431
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:41,000
I now ask you again, Christine Helm,
did you write this letter?

1432
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,240
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.

1433
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:48,320
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1434
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,160
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1435
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:55,440
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1436
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:59,000
If you have already
committed perjury in this courtroom,

1437
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:02,600
I strongly advise you
not to add to your crime.

1438
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:06,320
But, if this letter
has not been written by you,

1439
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,000
then now is the time to state this fact.

1440
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,480
I wrote the letter.

1441
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,640
And that, my lord,
is the case for the defence.

1442
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,440
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1443
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,640
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.

1444
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,720
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.

1445
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,000
I concede.

1446
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,200
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1447
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:45,680
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1448
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:49,080
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1449
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:53,160
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1450
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,400
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1451
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:00,520
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1452
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,480
Come along.

1453
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,360
Where's my wig?

1454
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,480
The prisoner will stand up.

1455
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,680
Members of the jury,
are you all agreed upon your verdict?

1456
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,360
We are.

1457
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,560
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole,

1458
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:54,040
guilty or not guilty
of the murder of Emily Jane French?

1459
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,160
Not guilty, m'lord.

1460
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,640
Silence!

1461
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,560
Silence!

1462
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:28,000
Leonard Stephen Vole,
you have been found not guilty

1463
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:32,520
of the murder
of Emily Jane French on October 14.

1464
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:36,960
You are hereby discharged
and are free to leave the court.

1465
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:50,600
Persons with anything more to do
before the queen's justices

1466
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,880
of oyer and terminer and jail delivery

1467
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,760
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

1468
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,680
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1469
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,200
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

1470
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,600
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1471
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:19,400
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1472
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:23,200
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1473
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:26,320
"Mr Vole. " They didn't call me Mr
when they charged me.

1474
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:31,400
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

1475
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,600
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

1476
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,760
and the other on a banana peel.

1477
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:48,960
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?

1478
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,960
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,

1479
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:56,000
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

1480
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:13,520
- Every word you said was a lie!
- You ought to be locked up! Liar!

1481
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:16,840
You'd better wait here
until we get rid of that crowd, madam.

1482
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,920
Thank you.

1483
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,680
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1484
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:31,120
Let me finish the last of the cocoa
while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1485
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:35,440
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1486
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,200
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1487
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,760
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1488
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,640
I don't mind being called names or
pushed around or even kicked in the shin.

1489
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,000
But I have a ladder
in my last pair of nylons.

1490
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:18,280
In case you are not familiar with
our prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1491
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,480
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1492
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:24,080
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,

1493
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:28,360
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1494
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,960
If I were appearing
for the prosecution, it would be.

1495
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:35,920
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1496
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,040
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1497
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:43,680
and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1498
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:49,360
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1499
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,040
What are you driving at?

1500
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,960
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1501
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,440
- We?
- Remember?

1502
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:00,080
When you said that no jury would
believe an alibi given by a loving wife,

1503
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:04,120
no matter how much she swore
he was innocent? That gave me the idea.

1504
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,760
What idea?

1505
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,200
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1506
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:14,120
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1507
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:18,320
because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.

1508
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,000
So now you know
the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.

1509
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:31,160
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1510
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,840
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1511
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:41,320
I suspected something, but not that.

1512
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,360
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1513
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,040
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such an important role.

1514
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,920
All those blue letters!

1515
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:54,520
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1516
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:57,000
There's never been anyone but Leonard.

1517
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,280
My dear, could you not have trusted me,

1518
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,200
worked with me truthfully
and honourably? We would have won.

1519
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,160
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1520
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,320
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1521
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,560
No, Sir Wilfrid,
you do not understand at all.

1522
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,040
I knew he was guilty.

1523
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:21,160
That can't be true! No!

1524
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,640
Listen to me, once and for all.

1525
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,360
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1526
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,800
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1527
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,920
And you saved him? A murderer?

1528
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,120
Again, you don't understand.

1529
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:38,200
I love him.

1530
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,040
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1531
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,720
Leonard!

1532
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,880
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1533
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,960
Leonard, Leonard.

1534
01:46:54,920 --> 01:47:00,200
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1535
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:05,760
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got
out of this alive, let's stay this way.

1536
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:09,240
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1537
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,480
Who did? You got me off
and I can't be tried again for this.

1538
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:16,960
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1539
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,720
The scales of justice
may tip one way or another,

1540
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,800
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1541
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,920
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather
pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1542
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:31,440
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1543
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,360
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1544
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,960
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1545
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,840
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1546
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,520
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be $5,000 for the defence.

1547
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:51,200
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1548
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:56,120
Standing in the witness box, having
to face you, saying I never loved you.

1549
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:57,360
What is it, Leonard?

1550
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,200
The luggage is in the car and we've
only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1551
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,800
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1552
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,240
Len!

1553
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,920
Oh, Len!

1554
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:08,640
Len...

1555
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:13,720
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1556
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,240
Leonard, who's this girl?

1557
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,000
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1558
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:20,840
Tell her, Len.

1559
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,360
Leonard, is this the girl
who was with you in the travel bureau?

1560
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,520
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1561
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:32,080
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1562
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:36,360
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1563
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:42,160
and we're going away on a cruise,
just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1564
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:47,040
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1565
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,800
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.

1566
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,760
I saved your life
getting you out of Germany,

1567
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,920
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1568
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:00,440
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1569
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,320
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.

1570
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,800
Don't make it worse
or they'll try you as an accessory.

1571
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:10,160
And you know what that means.

1572
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,720
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1573
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:18,280
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1574
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,280
let them try me for...!

1575
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:22,200
Argh!

1576
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,240
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1577
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,520
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1578
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,600
Killed him?

1579
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,840
She executed him.

1580
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:58,880
Carter, what have you done
with the luggage?

1581
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:04,520
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1582
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,560
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1583
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:18,320
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1584
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,440
We are not going yet, are we?

1585
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,520
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1586
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:29,200
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,
and Mayhew too.

1587
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:33,440
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1588
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,320
Sir Wilfrid?

1589
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:38,000
You've forgotten your brandy.

1590
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,600
The management of this theatre suggests

1591
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:05,800
that for the greater entertainment of
friends Who have not yet seen the picture,

1592
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,960
you Will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending

1593
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,720
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
