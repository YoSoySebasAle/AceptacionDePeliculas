1
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:58,988
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:01,574
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:05,495
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,081
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,085
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:14,754
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

7
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:21,427
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:25,556
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:28,601
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:31,813
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

11
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,357
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,234
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:40,238
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:44,534
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

15
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,745
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

16
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:50,373
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

17
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,375
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

18
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,422
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

19
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,590
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

20
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:03,052
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:07,765
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:09,725
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

23
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,894
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:14,605
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

25
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:17,358
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,944
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

27
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:22,530
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:26,993
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,955
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

30
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:33,666
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

31
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,003
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,840
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:43,593
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

34
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:46,971
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

35
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:50,892
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:55,104
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

37
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:59,442
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

38
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,819
to the German government...

39
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:05,823
has declared war on nazi Germany.

40
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:09,619
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

41
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,295
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:22,757
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,847
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:35,269
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

45
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,855
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

46
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:40,900
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:44,737
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

48
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:18,729
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:23,860
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:27,113
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

51
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:30,533
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

52
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,828
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

53
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:38,332
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:42,128
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:46,799
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:49,886
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:52,430
You know what we did
in the last war?

58
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:56,350
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

59
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,895
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

60
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:03,483
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:06,360
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:10,448
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

63
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,577
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:17,789
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:21,125
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

66
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:26,047
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,594
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:35,556
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,017
Look here.

70
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:40,019
Idiot.

71
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:42,939
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:45,149
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

73
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:48,402
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,531
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,325
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

76
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:57,245
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

77
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:01,541
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:05,169
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,592
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

80
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:15,388
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:17,557
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

82
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:22,770
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:26,983
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

84
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:31,737
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:35,116
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

86
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,618
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:42,749
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

88
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:46,002
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

89
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,255
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

90
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:51,758
they bombed the station.

91
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:55,303
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

92
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:58,806
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,477
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:05,772
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:09,484
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:13,821
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

97
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:18,910
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:21,954
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

99
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:24,624
- What instrument?
- The cello.

100
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,293
I love to see women
playing the cello.

101
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,547
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:34,842
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

103
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,762
You know what people are like, they
want to be better nazis than Hitler.

104
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,682
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

105
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:45,061
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

106
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,567
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:54,946
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

108
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:58,324
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,536
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:06,416
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,376
This is absurd.

112
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:14,257
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:19,595
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

114
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:22,014
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:25,017
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:27,270
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:30,314
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:34,652
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

119
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:38,781
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,493
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

121
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,496
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

122
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:48,833
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

123
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:53,671
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

124
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,133
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

125
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:00,595
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

126
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:04,390
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

127
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:07,935
The background must be
sufficiently large...

128
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:11,731
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

129
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:16,277
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

130
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:21,574
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer. "

132
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:33,544
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

133
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,383
Let me see this.

134
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:47,183
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

135
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,938
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

136
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,407
You!

137
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,493
Come here.

138
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,459
Why haven't you greeted us?

139
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:16,421
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:29,183
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

141
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,394
Go to the gutter.

142
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:50,913
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:54,041
What is this?

144
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:58,796
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

145
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,677
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

146
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:08,389
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

147
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:13,978
There'll be created a Jewish district
in which Jews will have to reside. "

148
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:18,483
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

149
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:23,780
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

150
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,075
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

151
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,160
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

152
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,789
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

153
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:36,709
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

154
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,006
Mama?

155
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:45,176
Mama, what is it?

156
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:49,597
20 zlotys!

157
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:52,892
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

158
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:59,398
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

159
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:03,861
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

160
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:14,080
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

161
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:16,916
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

162
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,878
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,923
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,801
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

165
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,845
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,098
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

167
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:34,851
You people are crazy.

168
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:38,896
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:41,566
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

170
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,902
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

171
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:46,863
Take it.

172
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:21,606
Hello.

173
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,942
Hello. Hi.

174
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:29,197
I didn't want to come.

175
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:33,785
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

176
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:35,828
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

177
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,955
Good.

178
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:41,667
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

179
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:44,128
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,759
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,762
That's what I said myself.

182
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:55,556
It's too absurd.

183
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:02,438
I... I should go.

184
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:07,026
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:08,903
soon.

186
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,410
Good-bye.

187
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:31,050
Well...

188
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:35,179
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

189
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:45,398
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:48,443
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:51,863
Look.

192
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:55,241
Come and look.

193
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:28,107
Go away.

194
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:30,443
Go away! Go away!

195
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:34,530
Papa! Papa!

196
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:53,049
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,760
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

198
00:16:55,968 --> 00:17:00,056
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

199
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:02,809
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

200
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:06,312
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:11,109
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:13,027
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

203
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:16,864
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:21,119
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

205
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:25,665
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:29,377
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

207
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,546
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:49,021
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

209
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,315
Why can't they go around?

210
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:55,069
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:57,864
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,492
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:05,079
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

214
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,124
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

215
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,501
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,838
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

217
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:18,968
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

218
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:23,306
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

219
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:26,142
- Dance!
- Dance!

220
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,145
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:33,983
Very well.

222
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,069
What about you?
Dance with him.

223
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:41,574
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

224
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:46,954
Come on. And you.

225
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:54,420
Go on.

226
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:56,839
Faster!

227
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,551
Come on!

228
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:03,137
Faster!

229
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,518
Come on!

230
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:11,854
Faster!

231
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:18,486
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

232
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:21,572
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

233
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,259
Good, they're here.

234
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:45,721
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

235
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,187
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

236
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,731
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

237
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:04,574
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

238
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:10,163
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

239
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:14,959
Amazing, jewellery.

240
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,420
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

241
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:19,964
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

242
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:22,300
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

243
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:24,469
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

244
00:20:24,677 --> 00:20:28,473
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

245
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:32,018
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:34,645
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

247
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:37,148
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

248
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,275
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:42,445
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

250
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:45,948
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

251
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,368
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:20:49,827 --> 00:20:52,205
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

253
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:54,791
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:58,002
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:47,135
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,889
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,815
I always say,
look on the bright side.

258
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:46,319
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

259
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:49,906
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:53,117
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

261
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,244
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

262
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:58,873
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

263
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:03,795
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

264
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:07,924
You're too... too musical.

265
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:14,639
- Who is that?
- Symche.

266
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:16,891
Majorek.

267
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:20,937
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:24,023
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

269
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:28,236
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:31,906
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:35,910
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,913
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

273
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,873
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

274
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,419
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:49,424
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:53,970
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

277
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:57,765
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

278
00:23:58,182 --> 00:23:59,892
Five hundred.

279
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,271
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:07,900
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

281
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,237
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

282
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:14,157
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,784
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,911
They're too clean for them.

285
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,295
Please, mister, please.

286
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:57,575
Hold it!
You little bastard!

287
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,330
Take this!

288
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:04,457
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:06,375
Stop it!

290
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:12,090
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

291
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:21,682
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,882
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

293
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:58,511
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:01,597
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

295
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:06,436
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:26:06,644 --> 00:26:09,647
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:13,151
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

298
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,611
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

299
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:18,030
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

300
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:22,618
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

301
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,206
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:31,169
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

303
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:33,087
I said nothing bad.

304
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:37,341
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

305
00:26:38,426 --> 00:26:40,094
It's not funny.

306
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:43,598
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:47,769
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

308
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:50,146
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

309
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:54,442
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,695
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

311
00:26:57,862 --> 00:27:00,323
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:03,910
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

313
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:05,995
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

314
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,207
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

315
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,336
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

316
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,755
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:21,010
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

318
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:39,320
The lights! The lights!

319
00:27:56,504 --> 00:28:00,591
Turn on the lights.

320
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:05,721
Come on!

321
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:12,687
Open the door!
We want to go in!

322
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:16,399
Open the door!

323
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,622
Stand up!

324
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:37,128
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:40,214
Throw him out!

326
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:54,937
Mama...

327
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:10,119
Come on, run!

328
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,438
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

329
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:39,459
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

330
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,670
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,006
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,469
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

333
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:04,192
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,112
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:11,866
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,127
What happened here?

337
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:26,923
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

338
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:30,718
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

339
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:34,263
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:37,058
Itzak?

341
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:39,102
Itzak?

342
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,647
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:51,114
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

344
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:53,366
Believe me.
They picked him up.

345
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:01,374
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,709
Can you help us?

347
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:06,921
- It costs.
- I have no money.

348
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,632
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

349
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:14,053
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

350
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,640
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

351
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:22,562
Itzak...

352
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:40,663
- Hands up.
- How are you?

353
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:44,417
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

354
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,711
Dead! Dead!

355
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,964
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

356
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:53,176
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

357
00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:56,554
Thank you.

358
00:32:57,221 --> 00:33:01,017
Everything is alright!

359
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,269
He looks very happy.

360
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:06,230
Everything is alright.

361
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:09,692
Everything is alright.

362
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:13,654
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:15,448
It's alright.

364
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,285
Help! Help!

365
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:22,997
Let go! Help!

366
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,427
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:21,013
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

368
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,935
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

369
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:28,688
What did you pay him?

370
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:33,943
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:37,071
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

372
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,033
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:44,412
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

374
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:48,583
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

375
00:34:57,425 --> 00:35:00,636
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

376
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:03,931
Hungry.

377
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:15,026
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

378
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:17,945
You have to have an
employment certificate...

379
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:20,615
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:23,534
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

381
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:26,954
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

382
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,833
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

383
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:35,546
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

384
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:52,063
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:56,818
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,695
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

387
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:02,740
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

388
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:06,911
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,332
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

390
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:14,794
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

391
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:18,047
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:20,341
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

393
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,885
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:27,014
Can you help?
I have no money.

395
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:30,476
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

396
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:32,979
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,815
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

398
00:36:36,023 --> 00:36:39,736
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

399
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:42,238
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

400
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:57,295
- How's your back?
- Better.

401
00:36:57,503 --> 00:36:59,422
Better?

402
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:01,507
Better not ask.

403
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,941
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,529
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:34,559
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

406
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,770
At least we are still together.

407
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:53,786
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

408
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:56,247
Move, move!

409
00:38:56,831 --> 00:39:01,002
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

410
00:39:04,672 --> 00:39:06,716
Wait.

411
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:08,384
Here.

412
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:11,679
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:13,765
You.

414
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,726
You. You.

415
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:20,188
You.

416
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,649
You.

417
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:27,111
You.

418
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:38,873
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

419
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:42,126
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

420
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:45,129
Where are you taking us?

421
00:40:07,902 --> 00:40:10,321
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:15,493
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,122
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

424
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:47,775
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

425
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:51,237
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:40:55,658 --> 00:40:59,454
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:05,293
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

428
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:09,922
Why did I do it?

429
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,966
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

430
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,010
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:58,012
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:01,933
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,352
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

434
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,771
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:09,023
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

436
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:12,276
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:15,071
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

438
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:17,865
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

439
00:42:18,074 --> 00:42:20,535
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

440
00:42:21,077 --> 00:42:24,622
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:27,333
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

442
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,044
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:32,964
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

444
00:42:33,506 --> 00:42:35,508
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

445
00:42:35,716 --> 00:42:37,009
Sure.

446
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:41,431
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

447
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:45,268
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

448
00:43:25,516 --> 00:43:28,686
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:42,450
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

450
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:53,336
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:55,546
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:59,967
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:44:00,134 --> 00:44:03,304
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:11,896
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

455
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:17,235
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

456
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:20,196
The baby cried
just as the police came.

457
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:24,367
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

458
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:29,205
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

459
00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:55,523
What are you reading?

460
00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:02,530
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:45:02,697 --> 00:45:04,866
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:45:05,074 --> 00:45:08,077
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

463
00:45:15,376 --> 00:45:18,755
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:45:35,855 --> 00:45:39,358
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

465
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:43,029
Boy, come here.

466
00:45:43,738 --> 00:45:45,448
Come here.

467
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:48,659
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

468
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,163
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

469
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:54,582
20 zlotys.

470
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:58,169
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:00,838
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:06,135
5, 10, 20.

473
00:47:25,465 --> 00:47:28,176
- Halina?
- What?

474
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:33,306
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

475
00:47:34,307 --> 00:47:37,643
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:42,231
Thank you.

477
00:47:57,955 --> 00:47:59,582
Szpilman?

478
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:11,219
Papa? Papa?

479
00:48:13,513 --> 00:48:15,807
Mama? Halina?

480
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:18,851
Halina? Mama?

481
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:24,273
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:48:27,735 --> 00:48:29,946
Don't run!

483
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,449
Anna!

484
00:48:33,616 --> 00:48:35,910
Anna!

485
00:48:54,804 --> 00:48:57,807
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:05,314
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

487
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:12,822
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

488
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:35,715
Wladek?

489
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:56,110
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,905
It's like this, I...

491
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,325
We...

492
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:07,330
All of them, all of them.

493
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:09,665
All of them.

494
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:14,545
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

495
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:17,799
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

496
00:52:18,007 --> 00:52:19,884
until things die down.

497
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:23,471
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

498
00:52:25,598 --> 00:52:29,185
Attention!
On the march!

499
00:52:38,778 --> 00:52:40,655
Onward!

500
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:45,952
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

501
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,038
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:07,432
It's gold.
Very good price.

503
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:29,495
Someone you know?

504
00:53:29,662 --> 00:53:31,581
A beauty.
Who is she?

505
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:35,710
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

506
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:38,254
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

507
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:42,133
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:10,161
Turn left!

509
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:12,747
On the march!

510
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:19,420
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

511
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:29,263
At ease.

512
00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:35,853
Turn right!

513
00:54:42,735 --> 00:54:45,321
Step forward.

514
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:47,365
You.

515
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:52,036
You. You.

516
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:54,455
You.

517
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:00,253
Down on the ground!

518
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,464
Down on the ground!

519
00:55:29,615 --> 00:55:31,659
Turn left!

520
00:55:32,785 --> 00:55:35,121
On the march.

521
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:15,703
How long have you been here?

522
00:56:15,912 --> 00:56:18,706
Since last night.

523
00:56:18,915 --> 00:56:21,209
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:28,174
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

525
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:32,178
We know what it means.

526
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:36,974
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

527
00:56:39,394 --> 00:56:42,730
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:56:44,023 --> 00:56:46,150
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:50,905
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:56:52,573 --> 00:56:56,285
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:56:56,494 --> 00:57:00,331
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

532
00:57:00,498 --> 00:57:03,418
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

533
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,505
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:57:11,384 --> 00:57:13,594
They're exterminating us.

535
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:19,809
It won't take them long.

536
00:57:21,144 --> 00:57:24,564
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

537
00:57:25,356 --> 00:57:27,817
Mostly young people.

538
00:57:29,026 --> 00:57:31,988
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:36,325
We're in good shape.

540
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:40,329
Organized.
We're prepared.

541
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:43,249
If you need help, I...

542
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:05,146
You! Come here!

543
00:58:06,147 --> 00:58:07,857
Shit!

544
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:17,867
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
00:58:18,951 --> 00:58:21,370
I don't know what I was thinking.

546
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:34,509
Take this! Take this!

547
00:58:48,564 --> 00:58:51,275
Take him away.

548
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,794
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

549
00:59:11,379 --> 00:59:13,840
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

550
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:16,843
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

551
00:59:38,614 --> 00:59:40,283
Trouble.

552
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:42,910
Round up only the Jews!

553
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:45,955
Round up!
Only the Jews.

554
00:59:46,205 --> 00:59:49,459
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

555
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,295
I have good news for you.

556
00:59:59,504 --> 01:00:04,217
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

557
01:00:04,425 --> 01:00:07,220
to resettle you.

558
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:13,893
I promise you that now
and in the future...

559
01:00:14,102 --> 01:00:17,522
nothing else is planned.

560
01:00:18,523 --> 01:00:24,570
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

561
01:00:25,863 --> 01:00:29,075
To show you our goodwill...

562
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:33,037
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

563
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:36,124
to go in town daily...

564
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:42,463
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

565
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,968
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

566
01:00:47,135 --> 01:00:52,390
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

567
01:00:53,558 --> 01:00:58,688
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

568
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:05,570
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

569
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:10,491
Dismiss them.

570
01:01:26,174 --> 01:01:29,969
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

571
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,036
Now!

572
01:03:13,031 --> 01:03:14,949
Majorek.

573
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:19,412
I have a favor to ask.

574
01:03:20,038 --> 01:03:22,290
I want to get out of here.

575
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:29,213
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

576
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:31,633
I know.

577
01:03:32,383 --> 01:03:36,095
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

578
01:03:36,304 --> 01:03:39,641
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

579
01:03:39,807 --> 01:03:43,186
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

580
01:03:44,646 --> 01:03:48,566
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

581
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:53,488
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

582
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:57,283
Would you try to make contact?

583
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:03,873
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

584
01:04:35,488 --> 01:04:38,074
Have you got any plaster?

585
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:50,169
What are you up to?

586
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:54,132
What have you got there?

587
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:58,136
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

588
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:01,055
Three kilos of potato and bread.

589
01:05:01,222 --> 01:05:03,266
Open it.

590
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:11,649
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

591
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:15,111
Open it.

592
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:44,015
Potatoes!

593
01:05:47,518 --> 01:05:50,438
You Jews are all alike.

594
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:54,192
We reach you with a finger...

595
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:57,278
and you take the whole hand.

596
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:14,212
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

597
01:06:37,235 --> 01:06:39,404
I've tried your friends.

598
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:42,865
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

599
01:06:43,408 --> 01:06:45,410
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

600
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:47,453
- Soon.
- Halt!

601
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,915
Shit! Shit!

602
01:06:51,124 --> 01:06:53,668
Wait. What's going on here?

603
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:57,380
Take this! Take this!

604
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:07,265
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

605
01:07:11,436 --> 01:07:13,688
Do you know why
you're being hit?

606
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:16,899
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

607
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:21,446
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

608
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:25,825
On the march!

609
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:28,536
March and sing!

610
01:07:28,953 --> 01:07:30,621
Sing something nice!

611
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:34,167
Loud and clear!

612
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:38,838
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle

613
01:07:39,047 --> 01:07:42,967
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies

614
01:07:43,134 --> 01:07:46,846
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone

615
01:07:47,013 --> 01:07:50,850
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery

616
01:07:51,017 --> 01:07:54,646
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation

617
01:07:54,812 --> 01:07:58,816
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity

618
01:08:31,099 --> 01:08:33,059
Come.

619
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,174
I'm sorry.

620
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,010
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

621
01:10:13,034 --> 01:10:15,870
We haven't much time.
Come on.

622
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:25,046
We must hurry.

623
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:27,465
Here. See if this fit.

624
01:10:27,674 --> 01:10:31,636
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

625
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:34,931
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

626
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:38,893
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

627
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,035
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

628
01:10:56,244 --> 01:10:58,162
He's on the other side of town.

629
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:02,000
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

630
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:06,754
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

631
01:11:44,459 --> 01:11:47,253
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

632
01:12:16,407 --> 01:12:19,202
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

633
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:24,123
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

634
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:33,549
It's not going to be very comfortable.

635
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,969
I'll be fine.

636
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,563
Thank you.

637
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,956
Here. Here. Give it to me.

638
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:09,377
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

639
01:13:26,978 --> 01:13:28,688
DO NOT PASS

640
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,179
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

641
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:10,063
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

642
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:16,152
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

643
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:17,820
Yes.

644
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:23,409
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

645
01:14:25,203 --> 01:14:28,706
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

646
01:14:28,915 --> 01:14:32,168
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

647
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:34,754
To bring more food,
see how you are.

648
01:14:35,088 --> 01:14:37,131
Thank you.

649
01:14:39,342 --> 01:14:42,470
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

650
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:46,766
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

651
01:15:27,598 --> 01:15:29,684
What do you mean you forgot?

652
01:15:29,851 --> 01:15:32,729
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

653
01:15:32,854 --> 01:15:38,234
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

654
01:15:38,443 --> 01:15:40,778
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

655
01:15:40,987 --> 01:15:43,656
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

656
01:15:43,865 --> 01:15:46,451
Takes one to know one. Pig.

657
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:55,001
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

658
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:57,337
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

659
01:15:57,503 --> 01:16:00,715
You fell asleep. Pig.

660
01:16:21,194 --> 01:16:25,073
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

661
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,786
Take cover!

662
01:16:31,371 --> 01:16:32,330
Shoot!

663
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,719
Take cover! Fire!

664
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:53,393
Come on, get out!

665
01:18:17,352 --> 01:18:19,520
The attack was successful.

666
01:18:21,481 --> 01:18:23,608
That building...

667
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:33,076
Turn that way!

668
01:18:39,499 --> 01:18:41,334
Shoot!

669
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:06,484
Thank you.

670
01:19:09,529 --> 01:19:12,615
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

671
01:19:16,536 --> 01:19:20,164
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

672
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:22,792
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

673
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:26,296
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

674
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:29,257
Just be proud of them.

675
01:19:29,465 --> 01:19:32,844
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

676
01:19:34,846 --> 01:19:37,557
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

677
01:19:37,765 --> 01:19:43,271
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

678
01:19:43,438 --> 01:19:48,067
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

679
01:19:48,234 --> 01:19:50,194
What good?

680
01:19:50,403 --> 01:19:52,697
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

681
01:19:52,864 --> 01:19:57,493
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

682
01:19:58,369 --> 01:20:02,373
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

683
01:20:02,582 --> 01:20:05,835
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

684
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:22,060
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

685
01:20:22,268 --> 01:20:24,771
What? What's happened?

686
01:20:27,106 --> 01:20:29,317
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

687
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:33,446
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

688
01:20:34,322 --> 01:20:38,034
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

689
01:20:38,242 --> 01:20:40,536
Where do you want me to go?

690
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:44,082
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

691
01:20:45,124 --> 01:20:48,378
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

692
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:51,214
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

693
01:20:51,422 --> 01:20:53,174
don't let them get you alive.

694
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:56,469
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

695
01:24:04,532 --> 01:24:06,743
Open up!

696
01:24:09,329 --> 01:24:13,458
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

697
01:24:40,234 --> 01:24:44,155
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

698
01:24:44,364 --> 01:24:47,450
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

699
01:24:47,617 --> 01:24:49,994
Have you got your identity card?

700
01:24:50,578 --> 01:24:53,414
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

701
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,378
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

702
01:24:58,586 --> 01:25:01,130
He's a Jew! A Jew!

703
01:25:01,339 --> 01:25:03,132
Stop the Jew!

704
01:25:04,092 --> 01:25:06,719
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

705
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:21,085
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

706
01:26:27,008 --> 01:26:30,845
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

707
01:26:32,096 --> 01:26:34,015
Come in.

708
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,273
I'm sorry.

709
01:26:42,482 --> 01:26:45,818
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

710
01:26:46,027 --> 01:26:49,530
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

711
01:26:49,697 --> 01:26:51,366
Come in.

712
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,959
Sit.

713
01:27:03,795 --> 01:27:06,047
I need help.

714
01:27:07,799 --> 01:27:10,593
He'll be back before curfew.

715
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,262
I've been in hiding.

716
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:17,767
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

717
01:27:19,852 --> 01:27:22,897
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

718
01:27:25,608 --> 01:27:28,111
And how is Jurek?

719
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:29,946
Dead.

720
01:27:36,369 --> 01:27:40,039
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

721
01:27:40,665 --> 01:27:44,294
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

722
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:49,799
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

723
01:27:49,966 --> 01:27:54,595
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

724
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:58,975
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

725
01:27:59,183 --> 01:28:00,977
Don't worry now.

726
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:13,614
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

727
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:19,871
Excuse me.

728
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:26,586
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

729
01:28:26,794 --> 01:28:29,422
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

730
01:28:30,089 --> 01:28:33,551
Sit. Please, sit.

731
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,470
Thank you.

732
01:30:38,384 --> 01:30:41,304
You're on a very German area.

733
01:30:41,512 --> 01:30:45,725
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

734
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,730
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

735
01:30:52,106 --> 01:30:54,359
Safest place to be.

736
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:57,320
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

737
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:04,327
I'll be locking you in.

738
01:31:04,494 --> 01:31:08,373
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

739
01:33:12,664 --> 01:33:14,540
All well?

740
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,251
Thank you.

741
01:33:21,297 --> 01:33:24,968
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

742
01:33:25,134 --> 01:33:26,886
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

743
01:33:27,053 --> 01:33:28,805
Thank you.

744
01:33:29,055 --> 01:33:33,810
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

745
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:36,813
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

746
01:33:40,733 --> 01:33:44,779
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

747
01:33:44,988 --> 01:33:48,324
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

748
01:33:48,908 --> 01:33:51,953
I saw you almost everyday.

749
01:33:52,495 --> 01:33:55,832
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

750
01:33:58,001 --> 01:34:01,546
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

751
01:34:02,338 --> 01:34:05,008
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

752
01:34:05,174 --> 01:34:07,135
night after night,
after night.

753
01:34:07,343 --> 01:34:09,721
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

754
01:34:09,971 --> 01:34:13,141
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

755
01:34:13,349 --> 01:34:14,851
Let's hope so.

756
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,405
Come here.

757
01:34:27,572 --> 01:34:29,699
Be careful with it.

758
01:34:30,575 --> 01:34:33,411
That's it. Be careful.

759
01:34:59,062 --> 01:35:01,814
Still alive then?

760
01:35:05,026 --> 01:35:09,030
Here. Sausage, bread.

761
01:35:09,238 --> 01:35:11,324
You still got that vodka?

762
01:35:25,129 --> 01:35:28,883
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

763
01:35:29,425 --> 01:35:32,470
I think I've got jaundice.

764
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:36,349
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

765
01:35:37,392 --> 01:35:41,270
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

766
01:35:41,479 --> 01:35:43,314
Drink up.

767
01:35:44,107 --> 01:35:47,026
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

768
01:35:47,235 --> 01:35:48,945
Problems.

769
01:35:49,153 --> 01:35:51,155
Money.

770
01:35:51,531 --> 01:35:54,075
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

771
01:35:54,284 --> 01:35:57,996
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

772
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:04,252
Here. Sell this.

773
01:36:06,504 --> 01:36:08,631
Food is more important than time.

774
01:36:13,636 --> 01:36:16,639
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

775
01:36:16,848 --> 01:36:19,017
Russians will be here soon.

776
01:36:19,475 --> 01:36:22,353
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

777
01:36:23,146 --> 01:36:25,106
any day now.

778
01:37:07,231 --> 01:37:09,192
Wladek?

779
01:37:18,117 --> 01:37:21,037
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

780
01:37:23,206 --> 01:37:25,416
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

781
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:29,128
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

782
01:37:29,295 --> 01:37:31,673
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

783
01:37:31,881 --> 01:37:34,926
You stay. I'll go.

784
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:09,419
We came to say goodbye.

785
01:38:09,627 --> 01:38:12,505
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

786
01:38:12,714 --> 01:38:15,883
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

787
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:20,013
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

788
01:38:21,264 --> 01:38:24,142
That man Szalas should be shot.

789
01:38:24,684 --> 01:38:28,646
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

790
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:34,277
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

791
01:38:38,448 --> 01:38:41,159
My God.

792
01:38:44,203 --> 01:38:49,292
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

793
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:52,295
but he'll leave.

794
01:38:54,255 --> 01:38:58,343
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

795
01:38:58,551 --> 01:39:02,055
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

796
01:39:02,263 --> 01:39:06,225
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

797
01:39:09,646 --> 01:39:12,106
Thank you so much for coming.

798
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,818
We've brought you some food.

799
01:39:16,027 --> 01:39:19,697
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

800
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:01,823
I'll throw a grenade!

801
01:40:09,747 --> 01:40:12,166
There's a wounded man over there!

802
01:40:12,667 --> 01:40:15,086
Come.

803
01:40:15,211 --> 01:40:17,547
Watch out! Watch out!

804
01:40:18,631 --> 01:40:21,467
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

805
01:40:22,093 --> 01:40:25,930
Come on! Bring the litter!

806
01:40:29,642 --> 01:40:32,145
Go back inside!

807
01:42:16,749 --> 01:42:19,294
Get out, get out in the streets!

808
01:42:19,502 --> 01:42:23,131
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

809
01:43:02,545 --> 01:43:06,674
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

810
01:44:02,188 --> 01:44:05,233
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

811
01:44:05,608 --> 01:44:09,988
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

812
01:44:10,196 --> 01:44:12,532
Be careful!

813
01:44:17,745 --> 01:44:20,290
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

814
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:25,169
Is there anybody here?

815
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:33,052
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

816
01:48:31,124 --> 01:48:32,875
Come on, pile them up.

817
01:48:38,965 --> 01:48:41,050
Throw it.

818
01:50:01,881 --> 01:50:04,717
We have to mark everything.

819
01:50:05,718 --> 01:50:06,636
Come on.

820
01:56:50,581 --> 01:56:52,875
What are you doing here?

821
01:56:57,130 --> 01:56:59,382
Who are you?

822
01:57:03,344 --> 01:57:06,764
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

823
01:57:08,808 --> 01:57:10,977
What are you doing?

824
01:57:16,524 --> 01:57:18,401
I was...

825
01:57:18,568 --> 01:57:21,487
trying to open this can.

826
01:57:22,155 --> 01:57:24,699
Do you live here?

827
01:57:27,035 --> 01:57:28,911
Do you work here?

828
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,747
No.

829
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:36,669
What do you do for a living?

830
01:57:39,589 --> 01:57:41,299
I am...

831
01:57:42,884 --> 01:57:45,720
I was a pianist.

832
01:57:47,764 --> 01:57:49,891
Pianist?

833
01:58:07,909 --> 01:58:09,827
Come.

834
01:58:33,768 --> 01:58:35,895
Play something.

835
02:03:42,035 --> 02:03:44,704
Are you hiding here?

836
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:50,877
Jew?

837
02:03:53,755 --> 02:03:56,049
Where are you hiding yourself?

838
02:03:57,634 --> 02:03:59,552
In the attic.

839
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:04,891
Show it to me.

840
02:04:27,413 --> 02:04:29,624
Have you got anything to eat?

841
02:05:14,085 --> 02:05:19,424
According to them,
it's very important that...

842
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:27,598
Attention!

843
02:05:29,225 --> 02:05:32,145
- At ease.
- At ease.

844
02:06:34,707 --> 02:06:36,626
Jew?

845
02:06:50,473 --> 02:06:51,849
Please.

846
02:06:52,266 --> 02:06:54,227
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

847
02:06:54,769 --> 02:06:57,397
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

848
02:06:58,690 --> 02:07:02,026
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

849
02:08:29,781 --> 02:08:32,450
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

850
02:08:35,286 --> 02:08:38,456
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

851
02:08:41,250 --> 02:08:44,963
I don't know how to thank you.

852
02:08:46,381 --> 02:08:48,508
Thank God, not me.

853
02:08:48,925 --> 02:08:54,305
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

854
02:09:03,731 --> 02:09:06,943
Here. Take it.

855
02:09:07,944 --> 02:09:12,073
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

856
02:09:16,327 --> 02:09:19,747
What are you going to do
when this is over?

857
02:09:21,499 --> 02:09:25,670
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

858
02:09:26,504 --> 02:09:28,214
Tell me your name.

859
02:09:28,423 --> 02:09:30,967
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

860
02:09:31,134 --> 02:09:33,177
Szpilman.

861
02:09:37,223 --> 02:09:39,976
Perfect name for a pianist.

862
02:10:58,888 --> 02:11:01,432
German! German!

863
02:11:23,621 --> 02:11:26,165
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

864
02:11:27,166 --> 02:11:29,085
I'm Polish!

865
02:11:29,877 --> 02:11:32,463
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

866
02:11:33,131 --> 02:11:37,635
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

867
02:11:37,844 --> 02:11:39,721
Come down!

868
02:11:43,141 --> 02:11:47,103
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

869
02:11:47,312 --> 02:11:49,397
He's Polish.

870
02:11:52,150 --> 02:11:54,319
Yes, he's Polish.

871
02:11:55,528 --> 02:11:57,864
Why the fucking coat?

872
02:11:58,906 --> 02:12:01,075
I'm cold.

873
02:12:19,302 --> 02:12:22,180
Look at them.
German fuckers!

874
02:12:22,722 --> 02:12:25,600
Murderers! Murderers!

875
02:12:25,850 --> 02:12:28,937
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

876
02:12:29,145 --> 02:12:32,440
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

877
02:12:32,649 --> 02:12:36,402
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

878
02:12:36,611 --> 02:12:39,906
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

879
02:12:44,577 --> 02:12:46,162
Musician?

880
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:49,207
Are you a musician?

881
02:12:50,166 --> 02:12:52,210
Do you know...

882
02:12:52,543 --> 02:12:55,588
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

883
02:12:55,797 --> 02:13:00,760
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

884
02:13:01,552 --> 02:13:03,596
Tell him I'm here.

885
02:13:04,347 --> 02:13:06,432
Ask him to help me.

886
02:13:09,394 --> 02:13:12,021
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

887
02:13:12,272 --> 02:13:13,439
What?

888
02:14:51,329 --> 02:14:53,831
It was here, I'm certain of it.

889
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:57,835
Well, it's not here now.

890
02:14:58,044 --> 02:15:01,965
I shouted, abused them. I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I did.

891
02:15:02,215 --> 02:15:03,591
I stood where you are now.

892
02:15:04,759 --> 02:15:07,929
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

893
02:15:09,222 --> 02:15:12,725
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

894
02:15:14,811 --> 02:15:17,981
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
