1
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,267
Dad.

2
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:52,210
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:57,549
Port side stick, starboard side stick,
move fast and clear those murder holes.

4
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,968
I want to see plenty of beach
between men.

5
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:03,972
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,140
Keep the sand out of your weapons.

7
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:10,645
Keep those actions clear.
And I'll see you on the beach.

8
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,800
FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!

9
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,013
«Clear the mortar holes!»

10
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,906
Over the side!

11
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,831
«Port and starboard, over...»

12
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,276
Jesus.

13
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,487
Thank you...

14
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:46,420
I said, what the hell do we do now, sir?

15
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,092
«Captain Miller! Captain Miller!»

16
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,888
- Captain Miller!
- Sergeant Horvath!

17
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:01,144
Move your men off the beach! Go!

18
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,562
Okay, you guys!

19
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,731
- Get on my ass! Follow me!
- Sir!

20
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:08,109
What's the rallying point?

21
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,027
Anywhere but here!

22
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,585
The seawall! Move up to the seawall!

23
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,962
Sir, I'm staying!

24
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,339
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

25
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:33,009
This is all we got
between us and the Almighty.

26
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:37,096
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

27
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:41,309
You stay here, you're dead men!

28
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,075
Mama! Mama!

29
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,208
«Stay down! Stay down!»

30
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,214
What are you guys?

31
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:14,008
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

32
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,761
Here to set up field operations!

33
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,387
Get rid of that crap!

34
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:21,557
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

35
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:32,068
«- I'm hit! I'm hit!»
- Briggs!

36
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:40,576
Get me out of here. I'm hit low. God!

37
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,746
- Medic!
- Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

38
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,583
I gotta clear these obstacles,
make holes for the tanks.

39
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,002
All the armor is foundering
in the Channel.

40
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:53,339
Orders, sir. You go somewhere else.
I'm clearing this one!

41
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,174
Come on, Briggs!

42
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,180
Medic!

43
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,885
«Move! Move!»

44
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,688
«Move! Come on! Move!»

45
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,796
Shore party.
No armor has made it ashore.

46
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,593
We got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open.

47
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:25,181
- Who's in command here?
- You are, sir!

48
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,268
- Sergeant Horvath!
- Sir!

49
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:31,395
You recognize where we are?

50
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,898
Right where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is!

51
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,443
Nobody's where they're supposed to be.

52
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,111
Shore party.

53
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,156
First wave, ineffective.

54
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:46,285
We do not hold the beach.
Say again, we do not hold the beach.

55
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,037
We're all mixed up, sir.

56
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,914
We got the leftovers from Fox Company,

57
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,957
Able Company and George Company!

58
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,669
Plus we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster!

59
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,216
Shore party. Shore party.

60
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,641
CATF, CATF...

61
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,438
- Reiben here, sir!
- Did you see anybody else?

62
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,316
- Jackson, but that's about it.
- Mellish here.

63
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,653
Caparzo! We got DeForest
back there with Wade.

64
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:24,490
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

65
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,242
Wade says he's all used up.

66
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,577
- Move on to somebody you can help.
- Let's go!

67
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,122
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

68
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,128
- Get his attention.
- Wade!

69
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,712
- Yo, Doc!
- Wade!

70
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,966
- Wade! Wade! Wade!
- Wade!

71
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:46,303
- Wade! Wade! Wade!
- Too risky, Doc. Too risky.

72
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,849
- Wade!
- All right. Get him off the beach.

73
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,686
I got it! We stopped the bleeding!
We stopped the bleeding!

74
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,856
Fuck!

75
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,234
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

76
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,736
- Son of a fucking cocksucker!
- Wade! Come on. Come on.

77
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,031
«Wade! It's Mellish! Wade!»

78
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,242
«- Mellish!
- Let's go!»

79
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,493
«We found Miller!»

80
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:12,163
«- Fuck it!
- Let's move! Let's move!»

81
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,339
This is all? This is all that's made it?

82
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:25,926
We got scattered pretty bad, sir.
There's bound to be more.

83
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,263
- Not enough. It's not enough.
- Dog One exit...

84
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,912
It's gotta be that cut on the right.

85
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:33,309
- Or is that one on the left? Shit!
- No. No, no, no.

86
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:36,103
Vierville is to the west of us.
This is Dog One.

87
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:37,438
They're killing us!

88
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:41,650
And we don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

89
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,111
Gather weapons and ammo!

90
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:46,030
Gather weapons and ammo!

91
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,200
Come on, let's drag them in
off the sand!

92
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:01,212
Reiben. Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,
where's your BAR?

93
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,354
Bottom of the channel, sir.
The bitch tried to drown me.

94
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,331
Find a replacement.

95
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,055
Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores!

96
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,018
«Grenades, grenades! Get me
some grenades. Get them over here!»

97
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,691
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

98
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:25,027
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!

99
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,530
Come on, come on, come on!

100
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,449
- Jackson here, sir!
- Reiben back, sir!

101
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,911
Oh, my God!

102
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,375
One more. Give me one more.

103
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,383
Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm gonna die!

104
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,470
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God!

105
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,975
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Almost got it.

106
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,144
- Jesus! Lucky bastard.
- Come on.

107
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:02,314
- Move it!
- Keep it moving. You got it?

108
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:05,442
God! God, help me!

109
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,987
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

110
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,240
You're fine. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

111
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:15,077
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

112
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,830
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

113
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,457
Fire in the hole!

114
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,335
Fire in the hole!

115
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,682
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

116
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,031
That's it! Let's go!

117
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,661
Inspected. Morphine.

118
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,874
Routine.

119
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,381
Priority.

120
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,595
He's gone.

121
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,734
Son of a...

122
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,196
- Get in there.
- Fuck. I can't move.

123
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,489
- Mellish.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,407
Give me your bayonet.

125
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:59,390
Two MG42s and two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

126
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:05,229
There's a little defilade over there,
but it's the perfect fire position

127
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,095
if we get some goddamn armor
on the beach.

128
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:10,192
We gotta open up this draw!
We gotta get this draw open.

129
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,194
Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war!

130
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,280
Grab some cover
and put some fire on that crew.

131
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:19,118
Davis, Debernardo,
Young, Valk, get ready.

132
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,122
Covering fire!

133
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,210
Go, go, go!

134
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,184
Goddamn firing squad.

135
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,479
It's the only way we can get
everybody the hell out of here.

136
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:51,775
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

137
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,486
Why don't we just hand out
blindfolds, Cap?

138
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,155
All we can do here is die.

139
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,823
Covering fire!

140
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,077
Go, go, go!

141
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,038
Come on! Come on! Come on!

142
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:06,999
Go, God damn it!

143
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,055
- Jackson.
- Sir.

144
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:24,850
- Do you see that impact crater?
- Yes, sir.

145
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,011
That should give you complete defilade
from that machine-gun position.

146
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,977
Get in there and give me
some fire discipline.

147
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,899
Wait for my command.

148
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,405
Go!

149
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,753
Captain, if your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

150
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,130
I thought you were my mother.

151
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,717
Be not thou far from me, O Lord.

152
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,267
O my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

153
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,729
I detest my sins
for having offended thee, O Lord.

154
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:12,944
I detest my sins for having
offended thee, O Lord.

155
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:15,088
Listen to me, Lord.

156
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:23,325
All my strength, haste thee to help me.

157
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:44,137
- Dog One exit! Right here!
- We're in business!

158
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,516
Move! Move!

159
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,475
- Reiben.
- Let's go, Sarge. Go!

160
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,852
Reiben.

161
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,171
The place is full of 'em!

162
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,341
Come on, Doyle!

163
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,302
Sarge?

164
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,685
- Flame!
- Doyle, do it!

165
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,901
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

166
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,176
I'll give you <comrade>,
you son of a bitch!

167
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,886
Lie down!

168
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,583
Cease fire! Cease fire!

169
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,878
Cut it out! Cut it out! Cease fire!

170
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,631
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie 3.

171
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,968
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

172
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,096
I'm waiting for you
to tie in my flanks. Over.

173
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,598
What?

174
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,563
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand
what you're saying.

175
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,032
What did he say? What did he say?

176
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:53,326
"Look, I washed for supper."

177
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,458
God damn it!

178
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,424
- Hey, Fish.
- Yeah?

179
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,177
Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife.

180
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,848
And now
it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

181
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,443
«Keep it moving!»

182
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,505
«That's quite a view.»

183
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,007
Yes, it is.

184
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,261
Quite a view.

185
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,233
«Dear Mr. Brian Boyd,»

186
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,619
«no doubt by now you have
received full information...»

187
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,131
«- Dear Mrs. Jensen...»
«- ...untimely death of your son.»

188
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,309
«...no words of mine
can ever relieve the grief...»

189
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:20,237
«Our outfit has felt his loss
tremendously.»

190
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:22,994
«He was a fine soldier
and he believed very strongly in...»

191
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,789
«It's no secret anymore
that we were involved»

192
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,177
«in one of the most important
operations of this war.»

193
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:30,585
«Al was the one
who held us all together.»

194
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,341
«He was always the
first to volunteer...»

195
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:35,674
«...came to a clearing near a road
where over 4,000 troops had passed...»

196
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,926
«Your husband served in a combat unit»

197
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,553
«whose dangerous duty
is to place itself...»

198
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,765
«... which we all cherish
and hold so dear.»

199
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:47,560
«The loss of Lee and others like him
is a distinct blow to the regiment.»

200
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,036
«I fully understand your desire»

201
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,690
«to learn as much as possible
regarding the circumstances»

202
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,900
«leading to his death.»

203
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,208
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

204
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,601
Yes.

205
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,752
These two men died in Normandy.

206
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:57,213
This one at Omaha Beach.

207
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:00,759
- Sean Ryan.
- This man at Utah.

208
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,137
Peter Ryan.

209
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,977
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

210
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,149
Daniel Ryan.

211
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,777
The three men are brothers, sir.

212
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,556
I've just learned that, this afternoon,

213
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:24,452
their mother is going
to be getting all three telegrams.

214
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,508
That's not all. There's a
fourth brother. The youngest.

215
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,498
He parachuted in
with the 101st Airborne,

216
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,041
night before the invasion.

217
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,168
He's somewhere in Normandy.
We don't know where.

218
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,687
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

219
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,259
Come with me.

220
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,449
«God damn it.»

221
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,118
All four of them
were in the same company

222
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,204
in the 29th Division,
but we split them up

223
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,287
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

224
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,918
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

225
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:43,963
No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

226
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,830
But that's still deep
behind German lines.

227
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,634
Now, Mac,
there is no way you can know

228
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:50,637
where in the hell he was dropped.

229
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,894
General, first reports out of
Ike's people at SHAEF

230
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:55,065
said the 101st is scattered
all to hell and gone.

231
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,101
There's misdrops all over Normandy.

232
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:00,104
Now, assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

233
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,648
he could be anywhere.

234
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,775
In fact, he's probably KIA.

235
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,529
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

236
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:10,198
flathatting throughout swarms
of German reinforcements

237
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:14,118
all along our axis of advance,
they're gonna be KIA, too.

238
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,685
I have a letter here,

239
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:44,148
written a long time ago
to a Mrs. Bixby in Boston.

240
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,150
So bear with me.

241
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,530
"Dear Madam,"

242
00:33:51,186 --> 00:33:53,491
"I have been shown in the files
of the War Department"

243
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:57,328
"a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts"

244
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:00,748
"that you are the mother of five"

245
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,463
"sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle."

246
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,886
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine"

247
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,057
"that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief"

248
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,893
"of a loss so overwhelming."

249
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,731
"But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you"

250
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,984
"the consolation that may be found"

251
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:32,322
"in the thanks of the republic
they died to save."

252
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,884
"I pray that Our Heavenly Father"

253
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:40,955
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement"

254
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,418
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved lost,"

255
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,240
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours"

256
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,636
"to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom."

257
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:56,304
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully."

258
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,222
"Abraham Lincoln."

259
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,910
That boy is alive.

260
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,538
We are gonna send somebody
to find him,

261
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:26,834
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

262
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,545
«- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.»

263
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:43,731
«We expected 32 tanks
to float to the beach.»

264
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:44,986
«Twenty-seven didn't make it.»

265
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,034
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go on in, Captain.

266
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,258
I understand your situation.

267
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,238
But if we don't offload
those duel-drive Shermans by 0600,

268
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,797
«we're gonna have an entire division»

269
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:56,280
«stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.»

270
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,783
«Well, you let me know then.»

271
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:02,127
«Have Charlie Company hold at Vierville
until we can get some armor up there.»

272
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,062
«Yes, sir. Runner!»

273
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,880
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for the rest of us.

274
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:15,791
Instead they misdropped, scattered
all their sticks into the wind.

275
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:19,804
- What's your situation?
- Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

276
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,431
We...

277
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:27,103
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

278
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,969
They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

279
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:30,705
and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

280
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:33,276
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

281
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,548
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

282
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,627
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field,

283
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,756
little bit of everything.

284
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:42,618
Spreng Mine 44s. Schuh Mine 42s,
pot mines. A-200s,

285
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:46,205
the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors don't pick up.

286
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:50,752
This road here, they placed
big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s,

287
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,003
I guess for our tanks,

288
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:55,590
from here right up
to the edge of the village. Right here.

289
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:57,633
So we marked them,
called the engineers.

290
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,010
Resistance?

291
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,304
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

292
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,692
There was an under-strength
company without artillery.

293
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:07,018
Wehrmacht 346 Infantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

294
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,145
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

295
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,398
We turned them over
to MPs from the 29th.

296
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,445
What about our casualties?

297
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,198
Well, the figures

298
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:25,077
were 35 dead, times two wounded.

299
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:28,414
They just didn't wanna
give up those 88s.

300
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,085
It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

301
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,670
Yes, sir.

302
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,423
John...

303
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,303
I've got another one for you.

304
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:45,348
- Yes, sir.
- This one's straight from the top.

305
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,106
«You and I are taking a squad
over to Neuville»

306
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,108
«on a public-relations mission.»

307
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:58,027
«You leading a squad?»

308
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,239
«Some private in the 101st
lost three brothers,»

309
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:02,990
«and he's got a ticket home.»

310
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,200
«How come Neuville?»

311
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:08,204
«They think he's up there somewhere,
part of all those airborne misdrops.»

312
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,998
«It's not gonna be easy
finding one particular soldier»

313
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,778
«in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.»

314
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:14,794
«Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.»

315
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:16,462
But what about the company?

316
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:19,841
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

317
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,634
Jesus Christ.

318
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,761
They took away your company?

319
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:28,349
It wasn't my company. It was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

320
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:32,395
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

321
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,896
Beasley's dead.

322
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,774
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

323
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:40,695
- Not that I know of.
- What about Talbot?

324
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:43,781
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

325
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,325
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

326
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,366
Assemble at battalion motor pool
on the beach.

327
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:49,328
Yes, sir.

328
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,406
- Sarge, what we gonna do?
- Okay, listen up...

329
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,786
- What?
- What are we gonna do?

330
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,800
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

331
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,753
with a hunk of cheese in your ass,
Caparzo, you smart ass.

332
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,412
- Now, listen up.
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

333
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,290
- What?
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

334
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,227
«Attention!»

335
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,551
As you were.

336
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,720
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

337
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:07,138
Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir.

338
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:08,961
I understand you speak
French and German.

339
00:39:09,061 --> 00:39:10,725
- Yes, sir.
- How's your accent?

340
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,550
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

341
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,310
- Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
- Very good.

342
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:15,972
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

343
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,357
- We're going to a place called Neuville.
- Yes, sir.

344
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,181
- When was this updated?
- Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

345
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:22,945
- Sir...
- This is the 12th SS Panzer.

346
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,864
These are the two axes
that advance south.

347
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,485
- Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
- There are artillery up here, sir.

348
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:30,202
- That's what I understand. Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,255
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

350
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:33,700
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

351
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:36,315
No, sir. Just if you consider
I've never been in combat, sir.

352
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:38,181
I make maps and I translate.
And that's...

353
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:40,880
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

354
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,715
- Yes, sir.
- My two guys were killed.

355
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,016
Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

356
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:48,179
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

357
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,472
Yes, sir.

358
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,308
- Well, then, get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,686
Sir, may I bring...

360
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:01,984
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

361
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:08,407
Yes, sir.

362
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:13,454
Thank you very much, sir.

363
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,915
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

364
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:18,167
Take your time, Corporal.

365
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,049
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

366
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,258
Yes, sir.

367
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:29,387
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

368
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,431
- You'll need that.
- I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

369
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:32,408
Hey.

370
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,709
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

371
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:37,620
Don't you ever fucking touch me
with those little rat claws again.

372
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,173
Get the fuck back in formation.

373
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:44,545
I was just wondering
where you're from, that's...

374
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:52,011
- Caparzo, is it?
- Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

375
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,220
Got you.

376
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:55,565
And another thing.
Every time you salute the captain,

377
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,808
you make him a target for the Germans.

378
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,685
So do us a favor. Don't do it.

379
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,730
Especially when I'm standing
next to him, <capisci?>

380
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,858
Corporal, what's your book about?

381
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,651
- Hey. Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

382
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:08,986
Actually, it's about the...

383
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,605
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

384
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,531
that develop between
soldiers during war.

385
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:14,700
Brotherhood?

386
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:16,368
What do you know about brotherhood?

387
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:18,579
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

388
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,665
Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

389
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:26,128
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

390
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:28,380
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

391
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:31,247
I mean, where's the sense
of risking the lives of the eight of us

392
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:32,426
to save one guy.

393
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,679
Twenty degrees.
Anybody wanna answer that?

394
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:39,308
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

395
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,185
Hey, doc. I got a mother, all right?

396
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,813
I mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

397
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:47,566
I mean, shit, I bet even
the captain's got a mother.

398
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,486
Well, maybe not the captain,
but the rest of us got mothers.

399
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,198
"Theirs not to reason why
Theirs but to do and die."

400
00:42:55,216 --> 00:42:57,409
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

401
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,161
We're all supposed to die. Is that it?

402
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,997
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

403
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:04,583
- Yes, sir.
- We all have orders we have to follow.

404
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,378
And that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.

405
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,046
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

406
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,549
Even if you think
the mission's <Fubar>, sir?

407
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:14,635
Especially if you think
the mission's <Fubar>.

408
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:18,389
- What's <Fubar>?
- Oh, it's German. Yeah.

409
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:21,100
Never heard of that.

410
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:24,478
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

411
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:28,190
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

412
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:30,484
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

413
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:32,945
this entire mission
is a serious misallocation

414
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,447
of valuable military resources.

415
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:37,449
Yeah. Go on.

416
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:40,055
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

417
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:43,372
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

418
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,167
Reiben, pay attention.
Now, this is the way to gripe!

419
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,543
Continue, Jackson.

420
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,503
Well, what I mean by that, sir,

421
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:52,298
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

422
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:55,092
up to and including one mile
of Adolf Hitler

423
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:56,927
with a clear line of sight, sir...

424
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:59,889
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

425
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,266
Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

426
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:05,394
So, Captain, what about you?
I mean, you don't gripe at all?

427
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,897
I don't gripe to you, Reiben.
I'm a captain.

428
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,900
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

429
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:12,276
You gripe to me,

430
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,905
I gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

431
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:18,206
I don't gripe to you.
I don't gripe in front of you.

432
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:19,867
You should know that as a Ranger.

433
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,827
I'm sorry, sir, but...

434
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:24,747
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe I was a major.

435
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,624
What would you say then?

436
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,500
Well, in that case,

437
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,669
I'd say this is an
excellent mission, sir,

438
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:33,881
with an extremely
valuable objective, sir,

439
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:35,424
worthy of my best efforts, sir.

440
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:41,013
Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private James Ryan,

441
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:44,642
and am willing to lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

442
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:48,187
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

443
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:51,690
- He's good.
- I love him.

444
00:45:02,368 --> 00:45:03,744
Right.

445
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:48,789
- Thunder!
«- Flash!»

446
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:52,167
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

447
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:03,679
Go, go, go, go, go!

448
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:12,279
- You guys are a sight for sore eyes.
- Sergeant Hill, our relief showed up.

449
00:46:12,379 --> 00:46:13,814
How many are you?

450
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:16,567
Just eight of us.
We're not your relief. Sorry.

451
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,564
You're not the relief,
what do you mean, sir?

452
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:20,232
We're here for a Private Ryan.

453
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:22,489
Who? Ryan? What for?

454
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,684
- Is he here?
- Well, I don't know.

455
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:26,076
Maybe with a mixed unit
on the other side of town.

456
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,285
It's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our center

457
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:30,164
a few hours ago,
they cut us right in two.

458
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:33,751
- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan.

459
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,252
He dropped in with 101st.

460
00:46:35,336 --> 00:46:38,255
- Goldman, get me a runner up here.
- Runner!

461
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,049
Come on.

462
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:46,597
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

463
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:51,268
We got stopped by some intense
rifle action from the eastward.

464
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:55,022
The Germans have been
reinforcing two regiments all day.

465
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:57,358
The streets have been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

466
00:46:57,441 --> 00:47:00,007
Most of the German fire now
is concentrated to the westward.

467
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:01,396
Who's that on the loudspeaker?

468
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:03,280
That? That's Dagwood Dusseldorf,

469
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:05,199
our friendly neighborhood
morale officer.

470
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:08,285
¦The Statue of Liberty is "kaput".¦

471
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,789
- "The Statue of Liberty is <kaput>."
<-...kaput.>

472
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:13,624
That's disconcerting.

473
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,295
Take the second left...

474
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:21,632
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

475
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:24,802
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with the 101.

476
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,929
- Got that?
- Cover!

477
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:35,979
Go!

478
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:02,172
- You sadistic fucking animals!
- Get down.

479
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:05,451
They know we're not in direct contact.
They're gonna single out the runners.

480
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:07,344
Yeah. Why do they
keep shooting him up like that?

481
00:48:07,428 --> 00:48:09,847
Long as his lungs have breath in them,
he still carries the message.

482
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,800
- We'd do the same thing.
- No, we wouldn't!

483
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,685
- Wade! Get them ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,603
- Boyd!
- Come on!

485
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:19,440
Try again. See if you can let
Captain Hamill know we're coming.

486
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:22,109
What's the rest of Neuville look like?

487
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:24,611
Next block's got two-story buildings,
both sides of the street.

488
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:26,055
- There's a lot of windows.
- ...copy? Over.

489
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:29,199
And then there's a wide open square
with pretty good cover on the left.

490
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:31,118
- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here.

491
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,619
Yes, sir!

492
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,573
All right. Let's stay out of this
enfilade and use the buildings.

493
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:40,627
Try a left hook.

494
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:42,588
Shoot and scoot,
two of yours, two of mine.

495
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,132
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

496
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:48,969
- Reiben, Caparzo. Fundamentals.
- They're still jamming us.

497
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,638
Short runs. High and low at the corners.

498
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:54,224
It's gonna be tight.
Be prepared for close contact.

499
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:56,143
- Go. Upham.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,444
- You stay with Sergeant Horvath.
- Stay right here.

501
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:02,215
I'll wear him like underwear, Captain!
Stay with me.

502
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,658
All right, past the end
of the block to the left.

503
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:13,221
Those are the gates to the square.

504
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:14,655
Good.

505
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,004
Reiben, where's the captain from?

506
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,435
You figure that one out,
you got yourself a nice prize.

507
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:28,008
300 bucks, last I heard.

508
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:31,345
Company's got a pool.
5 bucks gets you in.

509
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,100
Easy.

510
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:42,564
It's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

511
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:46,135
Somebody must know where he's from,
what he did for a living.

512
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:48,028
I've been with him
since Kasserine Pass,

513
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:49,279
but I don't have a clue.

514
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,198
My ankles are killing me.

515
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:54,201
I'll need a wheelchair
before this war is over.

516
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,787
Oh, that's it. Oh, my God.

517
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:00,123
Got ankles like an old woman.
Like an old...

518
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:01,917
Oh, God.

519
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:06,797
Reiben, so, you don't even know
where he went to school?

520
00:50:06,913 --> 00:50:08,131
Captain didn't go to school.

521
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:11,385
They assembled him at OCS
out of spare body parts of dead GIs.

522
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:12,947
You gotta pay attention to detail.

523
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:15,377
I know exactly where he's from
and exactly what he did

524
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:17,140
'cause I pay attention to detail.

525
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:20,727
Hey, Upham,
careful you don't step in the bullshit.

526
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:28,402
- Do it.
- Thunder!

527
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:31,655
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

528
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:44,459
Upham, tell them to show themselves.

529
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:58,807
Ask them if they know
where the Germans are.

530
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:05,814
«- What's he saying?
- Something about the children.»

531
00:51:06,157 --> 00:51:09,359
- They want us to take the children.
- No, no, no. We can't take the kids.

532
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:11,111
We can't take the kids. We can't!

533
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:14,448
«We can't take the kids! No!»

534
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:18,848
«They think they'll be safe with us.»

535
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:21,100
«It's not gonna be
safe when they're with us!»

536
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:24,175
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!

537
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,627
Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!

538
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,712
«They think they'll be safe with us, sir.»

539
00:51:29,046 --> 00:51:32,341
«Caparzo! Put that kid back!»

540
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,051
It's okay.

541
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:37,387
«- Caparzo! Put that little girl back!»
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

542
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:40,557
Caparzo, give that kid back now!

543
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:42,225
Upham, how do you say, "It's okay"?

544
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:44,645
I can't. She reminds me
of my niece, sir.

545
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,730
Caparzo, get the kid back up there!

546
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,248
Captain, the decent thing to do

547
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:50,679
is to at least take her down
the road to the next town.

548
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:53,922
We're not here to do the decent thing!
We're here to follow fucking orders!

549
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:56,239
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

550
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,159
Cover! Cover!

551
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:11,380
God damn it! Where'd that come from?

552
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:16,593
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

553
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,266
That's where I'd be.

554
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:26,395
I didn't see it.

555
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:29,314
Four hundred fifty yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

556
00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:33,652
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas!
This sniper's got talent!

557
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:41,576
Please don't cry. I'm gonna take you
back to your mama and papa.

558
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,870
Please don't cry. Come on.

559
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:48,542
Carpy.

560
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:01,972
- Captain.
- Hold on, Caparzo.

561
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,559
Help me up. I can walk. I can walk.

562
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:07,811
Caparzo, stay still!

563
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:21,533
Two clicks, left wind.

564
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,538
Fish!

565
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:37,340
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

566
00:53:37,424 --> 00:53:39,384
Wade, you stay put.

567
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:41,678
Where's he shot, Captain?

568
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:46,057
- Captain, can you see him from there?
- You stay there!

569
00:53:46,183 --> 00:53:49,811
Damn it, stay down!
What's the matter with you?

570
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:53,648
Am I gonna take care of you
if you get hit? Huh?

571
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:56,985
- Fish, come over here.
- Carpy, put your head down.

572
00:53:57,068 --> 00:54:00,238
Why can't you put your head down?

573
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,749
O my God, I trust in thee.

574
00:54:10,874 --> 00:54:12,876
Let me not be ashamed.

575
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,546
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

576
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,058
Copy it.

577
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:30,477
Copy it and send it for me.

578
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,021
Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself.
Put it down!

579
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,399
- It's got blood!
- I see it. Carpy, I see it.

580
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:45,075
It's to my dad.
It's got blood on it, Fish.

581
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:15,647
We got him. Stay down.

582
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:28,577
- How bad is it?
- Chest, maybe lung shot.

583
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:46,553
Get that 30 up the street!

584
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:52,601
«Detail!»

585
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:54,769
«- Clear up!
- Clear down!»

586
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,330
That's why we can't take children.

587
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:22,964
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

588
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:26,718
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

589
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:29,095
«- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.»

590
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:33,558
«Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.»

591
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:35,310
«- Jackson!
- Sir.»

592
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:40,190
«Mellish, check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now. Go!»

593
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:53,662
Fuck Ryan.

594
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:06,591
- Thunder!
«- Flash!»

595
00:57:06,675 --> 00:57:08,218
«Come on in.»

596
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:15,266
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

597
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,102
Somewhere down there
across the square.

598
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:18,478
Across the square.

599
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:21,147
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

600
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:23,483
«Sit down.»

601
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:42,627
Jimmy T, go find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

602
00:57:42,711 --> 00:57:44,045
What? Up there?

603
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:46,881
How the hell should I know?
Would you go look, please?

604
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:48,925
Thank you, you moron.

605
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:51,886
All right.

606
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:55,432
You guys just flake out
here for a while.

607
00:57:57,392 --> 00:58:00,854
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

608
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:12,615
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

609
00:58:12,741 --> 00:58:15,952
- Drop them now!
- Drop the fucking weapons!

610
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:22,834
- I'll shoot you! I'll shoot you!
- Drop! Drop! Drop them!

611
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:27,630
Now! Put them down!

612
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:44,189
Clear up!

613
00:58:49,486 --> 00:58:53,156
- Shit. Shit!
«- Clear up!»

614
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:56,201
Clear down!

615
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:11,925
- Enough to make you old.
- Let's hope so.

616
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,395
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders, 101st.

617
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:27,440
John Miller, 2nd Rangers. Thank you.

618
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,229
We're here looking
for a Private James Ryan.

619
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:34,332
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance at all you policed him up?

620
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:37,325
- How was the road in?
- Scenic.

621
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:41,579
- We lost most of our ammo.
- Not to mention one of our men.

622
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,333
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

623
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:48,378
«- Yes, sir!»
- And get Ryan up here.

624
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:53,633
«Ryan! Ryan, front and center!»

625
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:55,426
Ryan!

626
00:59:59,055 --> 01:00:01,099
Here comes our boy.

627
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,568
Told you he was an asshole.

628
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,238
- Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

629
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:19,159
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

630
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,245
This way.

631
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,915
All right. Take a knee.

632
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:38,803
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

633
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:50,190
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so...

634
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,778
So I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

635
01:00:57,238 --> 01:01:00,950
We have orders to come get you

636
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:04,120
because you're going home.

637
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,720
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

638
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:31,814
I was supposed to take them fishing
when we got home.

639
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:48,706
I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

640
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:54,379
- How... How did they die?
- They were killed in action.

641
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,801
That can't be. They're...

642
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:04,514
That... That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

643
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:10,853
- You're James Ryan?
- Yeah.

644
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,732
James Francis Ryan from Iowa?

645
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:17,777
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

646
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:26,953
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

647
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:28,746
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

648
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,623
Are you sure they're okay, though?

649
01:02:30,707 --> 01:02:32,534
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

650
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:34,210
This is just a big foul-up.

651
01:02:34,294 --> 01:02:36,170
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

652
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:40,383
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that...

653
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,635
Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble.

654
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:45,538
I just wrote them a letter
right before I left.

655
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:46,989
«I got to get home.»

656
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:50,143
«I got to get home right now.»

657
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:52,729
«- I wanna go home.
- Easy, now.»

658
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:55,864
- So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
- I don't know.

659
01:02:55,964 --> 01:02:57,317
Are you in touch with your CO?

660
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,319
- That figures.
- What unit's your Ryan in?

661
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,612
Baker Company, 506th.

662
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:03,653
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

663
01:03:03,753 --> 01:03:04,991
Yeah. Charlie, I think.

664
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,743
- You think?
- Yeah.

665
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:10,079
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

666
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:12,749
«- Where was your drop zone?»
- Just inside of Vierville.

667
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:15,710
«Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?»

668
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:19,005
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

669
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:22,045
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

670
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:25,928
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

671
01:03:26,012 --> 01:03:28,056
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

672
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:29,557
God knows where they are.

673
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,351
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

674
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:33,348
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

675
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:36,814
No, sir, but I know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

676
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:38,149
Show me.

677
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:40,526
My men are beat.

678
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:42,862
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

679
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,322
We'll pull out after dark.

680
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:48,368
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

681
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:51,746
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

682
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:55,041
- How about a nice, comfy church?
- We'll take that.

683
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:58,002
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

684
01:03:58,086 --> 01:03:59,712
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

685
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:02,382
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

686
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:04,759
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

687
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,470
- That guy's overrated.
- No argument here.

688
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:10,348
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-Lô.

689
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,350
You got to take Saint-Lô
to take Valognes.

690
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:14,102
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

691
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:17,522
- Cherbourg, you got Paris.
- Paris, you get Berlin.

692
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:20,316
And then that big boat home.

693
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:25,477
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

694
01:04:25,577 --> 01:04:27,532
but I understand what you're doing.

695
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,242
- You do?
- Yeah.

696
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:31,953
I got a couple of brothers myself.

697
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:34,997
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

698
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:39,335
No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home.

699
01:04:47,802 --> 01:04:49,804
«What's with your hand?»

700
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:53,099
I don't know.

701
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:56,102
It started in Portsmouth

702
01:04:56,185 --> 01:04:57,968
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

703
01:04:58,068 --> 01:04:59,480
It comes and goes.

704
01:04:59,564 --> 01:05:02,442
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

705
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:05,945
«This one doesn't seem
to agree with you anymore.»

706
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,535
«What?»

707
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:18,791
«- What?»
- Nothing.

708
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:22,336
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

709
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,073
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

710
01:05:25,173 --> 01:05:28,634
«And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.»

711
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:30,428
- Vecchio.
- Vecchio.

712
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:38,352
«Yeah, Vecchio.»

713
01:05:38,436 --> 01:05:40,313
He was a goofy kid.

714
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:45,067
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

715
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:48,404
for Vecchio, for victory.

716
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:56,829
«He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?»

717
01:05:56,913 --> 01:05:59,665
«How did you get to be a Ranger?»

718
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:04,091
«He got shot in the foot once, didn't he,
when he was walking on his hands?»

719
01:06:04,191 --> 01:06:07,152
«Yeah. He could walk faster on his hands.»

720
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:10,468
«He could run faster on his hands than...»

721
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:14,764
Vecchio.

722
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,141
Yeah.

723
01:06:18,768 --> 01:06:20,144
Caparzo.

724
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:31,572
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

725
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:35,576
you tell yourself it happened

726
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:41,290
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

727
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:44,961
Maybe 100 others.

728
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:52,176
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

729
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,470
«- How many?»
- Ninety-four.

730
01:06:55,888 --> 01:07:01,644
«But that means I've saved the lives
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?»

731
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:06,065
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

732
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:14,490
And that's how simple it is.

733
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,159
That's how you...

734
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:21,163
That's how you rationalize
making the choice

735
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:23,749
«between the mission and the men.»

736
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,295
Except this time, the mission is a man.

737
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:33,050
This Ryan better be worth it.

738
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:38,848
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

739
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:42,435
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

740
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:45,141
'Cause the truth is
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

741
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:47,815
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

742
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,191
Amen.

743
01:07:51,611 --> 01:07:53,738
Look. There it goes again.

744
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,700
Sir, are you all right?

745
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,292
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

746
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,628
Why don't you get some sleep?

747
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:11,797
«- I don't know how he does it.
- What's that?»

748
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:14,550
Falls asleep like that.
I mean, look at him.

749
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:17,678
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

750
01:08:17,762 --> 01:08:19,347
Clear conscience.

751
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,015
Yeah. What's that saying?

752
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:24,268
"If God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

753
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:26,937
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

754
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:29,148
«Yeah, what did I say?»

755
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:33,486
«Well, actually, the trick
to falling asleep is trying to stay awake.»

756
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:35,321
«How is that, Wade?»

757
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:40,409
«Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,»

758
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:42,995
«sleep through the day.»

759
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:44,955
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

760
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:46,499
was when she'd get home.

761
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:49,126
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

762
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,950
and try to stay awake
as long as I could,

763
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:54,507
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

764
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,842
the faster I'd fall asleep.

765
01:08:57,619 --> 01:09:00,054
«Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.»

766
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:02,431
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

767
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,350
chatted me up till dawn.

768
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:06,977
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

769
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:11,065
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

770
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:18,656
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

771
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:21,367
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

772
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,121
«- Who? Your mum?»
- Yeah.

773
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,793
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

774
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:33,713
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

775
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:40,094
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

776
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:43,139
that she came home early

777
01:09:44,557 --> 01:09:46,517
just to talk to me.

778
01:09:49,729 --> 01:09:53,941
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to just be asleep.

779
01:10:01,157 --> 01:10:03,451
I don't know why I did that.

780
01:10:17,006 --> 01:10:20,593
We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

781
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:32,229
«Captain? Sir?»

782
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:35,691
Corporal?

783
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:44,033
How you doing there? Are you all right?

784
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,203
Yeah, I think this is
all good for me, sir.

785
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:50,080
Really?

786
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:52,333
How is that?

787
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,798
"War educates the senses,"

788
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:00,841
"calls into action the will,"

789
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:03,636
"perfects the physical constitution,"

790
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:06,889
"brings men into such swift
and close collision"

791
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:10,100
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

792
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:13,270
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

793
01:11:13,729 --> 01:11:15,481
of finding the bright side.

794
01:11:15,564 --> 01:11:19,235
- You know Emerson, sir?
- I know some.

795
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:27,743
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

796
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:32,122
What's the pool up to?

797
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:38,295
You know, I think it's around 300, sir.

798
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,799
Well, when it gets up to 500,

799
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:44,143
I'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

800
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:46,220
How about that?

801
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:49,890
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
I feel it's my duty under your command

802
01:11:49,974 --> 01:11:54,228
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1,000, sir.

803
01:11:55,938 --> 01:11:58,440
What if we don't live that long?

804
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:04,697
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

805
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,740
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

806
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:12,121
- Get some sleep, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

807
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:20,940
«Who's got sulfa powder?»

808
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:27,446
«Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!»

809
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,073
- Wade.
«- Yes, sir?»

810
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:31,116
- See what you can do.
«- Yes, sir.»

811
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,536
Hold on, fellas.
It won't be much longer.

812
01:13:34,703 --> 01:13:36,538
How we doing here?

813
01:13:37,206 --> 01:13:38,499
All right.

814
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:41,126
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

815
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,962
Doc's in town.

816
01:13:43,379 --> 01:13:44,727
It's all right. It's all right.

817
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:46,090
Don't worry, fellas.

818
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,717
The 29th Infantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

819
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:51,136
«Plasma. Anybody got plasma?»

820
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:55,099
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, you want to fill me in?

821
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:57,142
«Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.»

822
01:13:57,226 --> 01:14:00,854
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider Infantry.

823
01:14:00,938 --> 01:14:02,481
This one was mine, sir.

824
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:03,983
- I was the pilot.
- Private?

825
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:05,909
- Twenty-two men dead.
- Private, take care of...

826
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,756
I ended up over there without a scratch.
It took my co-pilot's head right off.

827
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:10,397
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

828
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:13,408
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

829
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:14,702
Haven't seen them since.

830
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:18,831
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

831
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:21,709
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

832
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,320
- head off to make trouble, sir.
- Water. I need a canteen over here.

833
01:14:24,336 --> 01:14:26,338
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

834
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:28,674
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 101st.

835
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:31,279
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

836
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:32,636
- Upham.
«- Yes, sir.»

837
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,555
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

838
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:36,306
Yes, sir.

839
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:39,101
Reiben.

840
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:43,689
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

841
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:50,654
What?

842
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:54,110
<Juden!>

843
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:56,337
<Juden!>

844
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:57,516
«Keep moving.»

845
01:14:57,578 --> 01:14:59,455
«Keep moving!»

846
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:02,750
I'm <Juden>, you know?

847
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,546
Yeah, I couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as I tried.

848
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:09,882
- I'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

849
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:15,304
Stars.

850
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:20,225
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 101st.

851
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,604
Some fucking genius had the great idea

852
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:25,230
of welding a couple of steel plates

853
01:15:25,314 --> 01:15:28,567
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

854
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,607
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

855
01:15:30,707 --> 01:15:32,738
«until we were just getting airborne.»

856
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:35,824
«Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.»

857
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:39,870
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

858
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:43,248
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

859
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:45,459
And when we released,

860
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,836
you know, I cut as hard as I could,

861
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,423
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

862
01:15:51,507 --> 01:15:55,677
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

863
01:15:57,846 --> 01:16:01,100
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

864
01:16:01,183 --> 01:16:04,978
We were just... We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

865
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:06,855
The grass was wet.

866
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:09,858
Downward slope and all.

867
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:12,486
Twenty-two guys dead.

868
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,784
- All that for a general?
- One man.

869
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:24,331
- A lot of that going around.
- <Fubar>.

870
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:26,875
- <Fubar>.
- <Fubar>.

871
01:16:27,668 --> 01:16:29,086
<Fubar>.

872
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:31,296
You all got that right.

873
01:16:31,497 --> 01:16:33,715
Hey, I looked up "<Fubar>"
in the German dictionary.

874
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:35,017
There's no "<Fubar>" in there.

875
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:36,135
«- Upham.»
- Yes, sir?

876
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:39,088
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

877
01:16:39,188 --> 01:16:40,305
«Yes, sir.»

878
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:43,100
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

879
01:16:43,183 --> 01:16:44,726
Dog tags.

880
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:47,729
«More than I really want to count, sir.»

881
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:51,775
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

882
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,318
«Jackson.»

883
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:56,780
«- Start going through those.»
- Yes, sir.

884
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,575
I'll help.

885
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:03,078
What do you think, Jackson?

886
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:04,371
Do you think
that little prick's in there?

887
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:07,457
Well, if he is, I'm gonna find him.
I bet that son of a bitch is here.

888
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,498
I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

889
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:11,670
10 bucks says I nail him first.

890
01:17:11,753 --> 01:17:14,493
- Let's see who we got in here.
- You mugs don't stand a chance.

891
01:17:14,577 --> 01:17:16,495
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

892
01:17:16,579 --> 01:17:18,093
Just keep looking.

893
01:17:18,594 --> 01:17:20,762
All right. Gary Lanico.

894
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:22,639
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

895
01:17:22,723 --> 01:17:24,593
I swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

896
01:17:24,693 --> 01:17:26,351
«Oh, come on, not the right name.»

897
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:29,479
«Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.»

898
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:32,107
«We gotta find this prick.»

899
01:17:36,445 --> 01:17:38,280
Where is this son of a bitch?

900
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:41,537
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

901
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:43,327
How am I supposed to know
who we got?

902
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:46,079
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

903
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:49,666
- Everybody be friends.
- Cranky there, huh?

904
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:53,587
- I think I got a winner.
- What you talking about?

905
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,130
Ryan.

906
01:17:55,339 --> 01:17:57,925
- Ryan.
- Take a look at that, Mellish.

907
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,467
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

908
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:01,678
R-I-E-N-N-E.

909
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:03,722
«That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.»

910
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:05,891
«- You know what that means?
- It means nothing.»

911
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:08,018
«- What beats three of a kind?
- I got shit here.»

912
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:11,730
«- I got all guys from New York.
- I got a full house.»

913
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:14,074
«- Do you need a hand with that?
- I got a full house.»

914
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:15,275
I got you beat.

915
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:17,533
- I got the straight flush.
- Full house, he's got.

916
01:18:17,633 --> 01:18:20,072
«You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?»

917
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:22,241
«- Ryan.
- Fucking unreal, this guy.»

918
01:18:22,324 --> 01:18:24,910
«Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?»

919
01:18:24,993 --> 01:18:27,579
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

920
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:30,791
«- I guess they're not bullet-proof, huh?
- Guess not. All right?»

921
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:32,744
«I don't like
what he's got between his ears.»

922
01:18:32,844 --> 01:18:35,254
«Sort of like what you fellas got
between your legs.»

923
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:37,422
«- We got to give him that.
- That's not bad.»

924
01:18:37,506 --> 01:18:39,007
«Not bad with you, Jackson.»

925
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,093
All right, I got three of a kind.
All right.

926
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,046
- Full house.
- What the hell are you doing?

927
01:18:43,146 --> 01:18:44,930
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

928
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:46,515
These aren't poker chips.

929
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:50,435
«- All right, all right, all right.
- Put them back in there!»

930
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,627
He's not here.

931
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:22,467
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

932
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:23,802
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

933
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:24,970
calling his name.

934
01:19:25,053 --> 01:19:28,223
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

935
01:19:28,307 --> 01:19:31,476
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

936
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:35,439
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know...

937
01:19:38,734 --> 01:19:41,278
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

938
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:45,157
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from Iowa?

939
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,284
Anybody know a Ryan?

940
01:19:47,743 --> 01:19:49,703
James Ryan!

941
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:55,751
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

942
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:59,129
- Yeah. I think so.
- Bring him up here, would you?

943
01:20:08,233 --> 01:20:11,016
- Do you know Private Ryan?
- You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

944
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:12,309
You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

945
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:14,061
- My hearing is not good!
- It comes and goes!

946
01:20:14,144 --> 01:20:15,354
- It comes and goes!
- A German grenade went off

947
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:17,872
- next to his ear.
- A grenade went off right by my head!

948
01:20:17,972 --> 01:20:20,400
Got it, got it.
Do you know Private Ryan?

949
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:21,943
Who?

950
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:24,488
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

951
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:28,784
- Jimmy Ryan?
- James! James Francis Ryan!

952
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:32,704
- No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
- All right. Get me a pencil.

953
01:20:32,788 --> 01:20:35,123
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

954
01:20:35,207 --> 01:20:37,709
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

955
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:41,254
A small one, sir.

956
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,006
Write this down.

957
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:45,050
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

958
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,927
Iowa, question mark.

959
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:49,513
Do you know him? Does he know him?

960
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:51,640
Read the message. Look.

961
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:57,521
- Yeah. Of course I know him, sir.
- Does he know where he is?

962
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,778
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

963
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:08,198
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

964
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:11,410
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

965
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:16,665
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

966
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:18,083
Ramelle.

967
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:20,732
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last I've seen of him, sir.

968
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:22,629
Great! Great! Thank you.

969
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:25,006
Write thank... Read, and thank you.

970
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,551
- You're welcome!
- Assemble on me.

971
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:31,763
Thank you, Lieutenant.

972
01:21:34,349 --> 01:21:35,767
Ramelle.

973
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,479
We're here. There.

974
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:45,193
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

975
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:48,104
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

976
01:21:48,204 --> 01:21:52,083
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

977
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:55,871
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

978
01:21:55,954 --> 01:21:57,747
And Rommel knows that,

979
01:21:57,831 --> 01:21:59,416
so he's gonna try to get his armor

980
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:02,878
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

981
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:05,222
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

982
01:22:05,322 --> 01:22:07,716
«when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.»

983
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:09,509
«That makes any village on that river»

984
01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:12,888
«with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.»

985
01:22:33,575 --> 01:22:34,993
Let's go.

986
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:45,837
Captain.

987
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:26,127
«What the hell is that?»

988
01:23:27,337 --> 01:23:30,465
A radar site.
It's gotta be out of action.

989
01:23:30,549 --> 01:23:35,345
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

990
01:23:36,513 --> 01:23:39,391
- See it?
- Yeah. That's my guess, too.

991
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:42,561
What is it?

992
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:45,522
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

993
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:47,899
Jesus. Is that what got those guys?

994
01:23:47,983 --> 01:23:49,901
Maybe one of them's our boy.

995
01:23:50,026 --> 01:23:53,405
No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

996
01:23:53,488 --> 01:23:55,574
Yeah, well, I don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

997
01:23:55,657 --> 01:23:58,159
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

998
01:23:58,243 --> 01:24:01,288
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

999
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:04,958
So, Captain, what I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

1000
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:08,461
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

1001
01:24:10,088 --> 01:24:11,965
I'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

1002
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:16,177
- I mean, we left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

1003
01:24:16,261 --> 01:24:20,348
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

1004
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:22,267
Captain...

1005
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,354
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

1006
01:24:25,454 --> 01:24:28,231
«I mean, this isn't our mission,
right, sir?»

1007
01:24:28,315 --> 01:24:30,525
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

1008
01:24:30,609 --> 01:24:32,068
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

1009
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:33,631
the next company that comes along?

1010
01:24:33,714 --> 01:24:35,280
No, sir. That's not what I'm saying.

1011
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,782
I'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

1012
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:39,326
given our objective, sir.

1013
01:24:39,409 --> 01:24:42,162
Our objective is to win the war.

1014
01:24:45,373 --> 01:24:49,377
Sir, I just... I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1015
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,592
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1016
01:25:16,488 --> 01:25:19,658
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1017
01:25:19,741 --> 01:25:22,952
Mellish, you hook to the right.
I'll go up the middle.

1018
01:25:23,078 --> 01:25:24,788
Who's going left?

1019
01:25:31,211 --> 01:25:33,046
Who's going left?

1020
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:38,885
I'll do it.

1021
01:25:39,844 --> 01:25:42,430
- I'll go left.
- All right.

1022
01:25:42,514 --> 01:25:45,308
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1023
01:25:45,392 --> 01:25:46,851
«Yes, sir.»

1024
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,399
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

1025
01:25:53,233 --> 01:25:55,625
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1026
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:59,531
- Maybe I should go up the middle, sir.
- The way you run? I don't think so.

1027
01:25:59,614 --> 01:26:03,410
- Maybe I should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1028
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:06,579
Reiben, base of fire.

1029
01:26:14,963 --> 01:26:17,882
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and...

1030
01:26:17,966 --> 01:26:20,927
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

1031
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:47,514
«Hill's clear! Four down and dead!»

1032
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:52,560
«Upham, grab the gear. Get up here!
We need water and extra dressing now!»

1033
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,896
«Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!»

1034
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:58,399
«Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!»

1035
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,243
«God.»

1036
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,078
«Son of a bitch!»

1037
01:28:10,203 --> 01:28:11,454
«All right. The sulfa.»

1038
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:13,164
«- Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
- I got him.»

1039
01:28:13,248 --> 01:28:14,874
- More sulfa, Mellish.
- I got him. I got him, Wade.

1040
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:16,334
- You're gonna be all right.
- Listen to my voice.

1041
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:17,765
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

1042
01:28:17,865 --> 01:28:19,337
How's it look? How's it look?

1043
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,339
Wade, you're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

1044
01:28:21,422 --> 01:28:23,383
- More sulfa! More sulfa!
- Put my legs up.

1045
01:28:23,466 --> 01:28:26,032
- Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
- He's gonna be all right.

1046
01:28:26,115 --> 01:28:28,855
- I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em.
- You're gonna be okay, Wade.

1047
01:28:28,955 --> 01:28:29,639
I got 'em.

1048
01:28:29,764 --> 01:28:32,475
Upham, give me your canteen!

1049
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,352
- Come on. Come on.
- ...we're gonna get you out of here.

1050
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:35,562
Put some pressure on it.

1051
01:28:35,645 --> 01:28:38,523
- You're gonna be okay.
- How's it look?

1052
01:28:38,606 --> 01:28:40,520
- I'm getting some morphine.
- How's it look?

1053
01:28:40,603 --> 01:28:43,064
- It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
- How's it look?

1054
01:28:43,147 --> 01:28:44,737
You're gonna be okay.

1055
01:28:44,821 --> 01:28:46,908
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

1056
01:28:47,008 --> 01:28:49,826
Am I shot in the spine?

1057
01:28:49,951 --> 01:28:52,495
- You're okay, Wade.
- Am I shot in the spine?

1058
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,689
- Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.
- All right. Flip him over.

1059
01:28:54,789 --> 01:28:56,485
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Put some pressure.

1060
01:28:56,585 --> 01:28:59,171
- Easy, easy.
- Lift him up. Lift him up.

1061
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:04,173
It's okay, doc. It's all right.

1062
01:29:04,299 --> 01:29:06,801
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1063
01:29:06,885 --> 01:29:08,636
It's in the small of your back.

1064
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,055
How big's the hole in the...

1065
01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:13,099
- About the size of an acorn.
- It's fine.

1066
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:15,226
You're fine. You're fine.

1067
01:29:16,853 --> 01:29:20,732
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1068
01:29:20,815 --> 01:29:25,028
- Put some pressure on it.
- It's all right.

1069
01:29:25,153 --> 01:29:27,822
Put some more pressure on it!

1070
01:29:28,323 --> 01:29:30,742
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1071
01:29:30,825 --> 01:29:32,619
Yeah, right here, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1072
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:34,268
- No.
- Right here. Yeah. Right here.

1073
01:29:34,368 --> 01:29:35,830
I'm gonna put your hand on it.

1074
01:29:35,914 --> 01:29:37,914
- We got some pressure on there.
- Right there.

1075
01:29:38,014 --> 01:29:39,959
- That's good.
- Okay. That's the one.

1076
01:29:40,043 --> 01:29:41,836
Oh, my God, my liver!

1077
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,839
- Oh, my God! It's my liver!
- Something wrong, Wade.

1078
01:29:44,923 --> 01:29:46,750
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1079
01:29:46,833 --> 01:29:49,268
What do you need? What do you need?
What can we do, Wade?

1080
01:29:49,368 --> 01:29:50,595
Tell us what to do.

1081
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:51,971
Oh, shit.

1082
01:29:52,055 --> 01:29:56,559
I could use... I could use
a little more morphine.

1083
01:29:57,268 --> 01:29:59,062
More morphine, sir?

1084
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:02,523
Okay. Okay.

1085
01:30:06,194 --> 01:30:07,862
Give it to him.

1086
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:11,741
Give it to him.

1087
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:18,790
- I don't wanna die.
- Here you go. Wade, here you go.

1088
01:30:18,873 --> 01:30:22,335
- Here it comes.
- There you go. There you...

1089
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:27,590
Give him another one.

1090
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:36,099
Mama?

1091
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:39,936
Mama?

1092
01:30:40,728 --> 01:30:43,690
I want to go home. I want to go home.

1093
01:30:45,316 --> 01:30:48,319
Mama. Mama.

1094
01:30:48,403 --> 01:30:51,280
Mama, Mama, Mama...

1095
01:31:34,073 --> 01:31:35,825
«Reiben, hold him!»

1096
01:31:56,554 --> 01:31:57,930
Not yet.

1097
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:04,520
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1098
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:08,024
Same thing
for those paratroopers down there.

1099
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:10,902
Strip that stuff off
and check him for intelligence.

1100
01:32:10,985 --> 01:32:15,198
Ask this piece of shit
if he's the one who shot Wade. Ask him!

1101
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:17,992
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

1102
01:32:20,411 --> 01:32:22,997
Shut up with that filthy pig latin.

1103
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:27,001
«Jackson, you're hit.»

1104
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,421
Shit.

1105
01:32:31,005 --> 01:32:34,342
- I guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
«- Get it cleaned and dressed.»

1106
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,969
«You and Sarge, watch the perimeter.»

1107
01:32:40,014 --> 01:32:44,560
- Sir, he says, "Please don't shoot."
- I don't care what he says, Upham.

1108
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:48,356
Sir? Sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?

1109
01:32:49,357 --> 01:32:53,611
- This is not right, sir.
- You can help him with the bodies.

1110
01:32:55,947 --> 01:32:57,782
What is happening?

1111
01:34:48,267 --> 01:34:49,644
American.

1112
01:34:51,562 --> 01:34:53,314
I like American.

1113
01:35:00,821 --> 01:35:02,615
"Steamboat Willie."

1114
01:35:03,449 --> 01:35:04,742
"Steamboat Willie."

1115
01:35:04,825 --> 01:35:07,495
Yeah, "Steamboat Willie". American.

1116
01:35:19,006 --> 01:35:21,615
- He's says he's not finished.
- Yeah. That's what you think.

1117
01:35:21,715 --> 01:35:23,467
Come on. Yeah.

1118
01:35:33,187 --> 01:35:36,524
Please... I like America.

1119
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:40,111
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1120
01:35:40,194 --> 01:35:43,864
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue? Cool beans!

1121
01:35:47,535 --> 01:35:49,745
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1122
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:53,541
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1123
01:36:00,214 --> 01:36:05,386
~I say can you see~
~I say can you see.~

1124
01:36:05,886 --> 01:36:08,014
~I say...~

1125
01:36:15,021 --> 01:36:16,564
Fuck Hitler.

1126
01:36:18,691 --> 01:36:20,318
Fuck Hitler.

1127
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,746
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.

1128
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:33,831
He says he's sorry about Wade, sir.

1129
01:36:33,914 --> 01:36:35,624
Captain.

1130
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,585
Captain, this isn't right.

1131
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:41,255
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

1132
01:36:41,922 --> 01:36:43,924
He surrendered, sir!

1133
01:36:54,602 --> 01:36:56,312
Tell him

1134
01:36:58,314 --> 01:37:01,650
to march 1,000 paces in that direction,

1135
01:37:01,776 --> 01:37:03,110
then he can take off the blindfold.

1136
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:04,183
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

1137
01:37:04,278 --> 01:37:06,105
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1138
01:37:06,188 --> 01:37:08,058
- Thank you, sir.
- You gotta be kidding me.

1139
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:10,076
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1140
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:14,497
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

1141
01:37:25,132 --> 01:37:27,698
Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

1142
01:37:27,798 --> 01:37:30,509
then thrown back into circulation.

1143
01:37:32,306 --> 01:37:34,767
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1144
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:37,770
- This is such bullshit.
- Y'all got that right.

1145
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:39,855
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

1146
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:42,049
- Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
- Upham, shut your mouth.

1147
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:43,497
It's against the goddamn rules!

1148
01:37:43,597 --> 01:37:47,643
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

1149
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:53,536
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

1150
01:38:00,334 --> 01:38:02,670
Get your gear. Let's go.

1151
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:07,174
You heard him. Gear up.

1152
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:10,386
The Captain just gave you an order.

1153
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:14,306
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

1154
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,891
That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.

1155
01:38:15,975 --> 01:38:17,518
Soldier, you are way out of line.

1156
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:20,855
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

1157
01:38:20,938 --> 01:38:23,691
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

1158
01:38:23,774 --> 01:38:26,110
I swear, I hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

1159
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:27,585
knowing that little Jimmy's life

1160
01:38:27,669 --> 01:38:30,004
is a little bit more important
than two of our guys!

1161
01:38:30,088 --> 01:38:32,867
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

1162
01:38:34,869 --> 01:38:36,435
- Here you go.
- Get the hell off me!

1163
01:38:36,535 --> 01:38:38,287
Reiben, get up.

1164
01:38:39,874 --> 01:38:43,043
Gear up. Fall in.

1165
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,301
I'm done with this mission.

1166
01:38:55,264 --> 01:38:56,891
Hey! Hey!

1167
01:38:58,893 --> 01:39:00,936
- Sir.
- Don't walk away from your Captain.

1168
01:39:01,061 --> 01:39:03,314
- Reiben, get back in line.
- No, sir.

1169
01:39:03,397 --> 01:39:04,799
I'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

1170
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:06,192
if I have to, but I'm done with this.

1171
01:39:06,275 --> 01:39:08,569
- I'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
- Captain!

1172
01:39:08,652 --> 01:39:10,087
All right, now. This is bullshit!

1173
01:39:10,187 --> 01:39:12,573
- Fall in!
- You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

1174
01:39:12,656 --> 01:39:14,033
No. I'm gonna shoot you
'cause I don't like you.

1175
01:39:14,116 --> 01:39:15,201
Sir, listen...

1176
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:17,024
Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

1177
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:20,498
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

1178
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:23,667
- Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1179
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:26,212
- Sir, we have a situation you might...
- That is bullshit!

1180
01:39:26,295 --> 01:39:28,823
Captain, I have a sixth sense about
these things. I know it in my bones.

1181
01:39:28,923 --> 01:39:31,793
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1182
01:39:31,926 --> 01:39:34,622
- He's better than you.
- Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

1183
01:39:34,705 --> 01:39:36,792
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that...

1184
01:39:36,892 --> 01:39:38,849
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1185
01:39:38,933 --> 01:39:40,392
Well, put your money
where your mouth is...

1186
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:41,852
- You don't know when to shut up.
- Do it!

1187
01:39:41,936 --> 01:39:43,562
- You don't know how to shut up.
- Pull the trigger, already!

1188
01:39:43,646 --> 01:39:44,980
Captain, please!

1189
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:48,317
- What's the pool on me up to?
- What?

1190
01:39:48,442 --> 01:39:51,111
- You are a coward son of a bitch!
- I'm waiting, Sarge.

1191
01:39:51,237 --> 01:39:54,865
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

1192
01:39:54,949 --> 01:39:56,784
What's it up to?

1193
01:39:57,409 --> 01:40:01,956
What is it, $300? Is that it? 300?
I'm a schoolteacher.

1194
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:08,796
I teach English composition

1195
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,299
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1196
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:14,176
The last 11 years,

1197
01:40:14,969 --> 01:40:18,013
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1198
01:40:19,932 --> 01:40:23,602
I was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

1199
01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:27,815
I'll be doggone.

1200
01:40:28,482 --> 01:40:31,735
Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1201
01:40:31,819 --> 01:40:34,780
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

1202
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:38,867
But over here, it's a...

1203
01:40:40,494 --> 01:40:42,162
A big...

1204
01:40:43,414 --> 01:40:45,082
A big mystery.

1205
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,836
So I guess I've changed some.

1206
01:40:51,505 --> 01:40:54,675
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much

1207
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,346
my wife is even going to recognize me
whenever it is I get back to her.

1208
01:41:00,848 --> 01:41:03,434
And how I'll ever be able to...

1209
01:41:05,978 --> 01:41:08,606
To tell her about days like today.

1210
01:41:11,859 --> 01:41:13,193
Ryan...

1211
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,489
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

1212
01:41:18,157 --> 01:41:21,827
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if...

1213
01:41:23,662 --> 01:41:26,165
You know, if going to Ramelle

1214
01:41:26,269 --> 01:41:27,791
and finding him, so he can go home,

1215
01:41:27,875 --> 01:41:29,962
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

1216
01:41:30,062 --> 01:41:34,316
well, then... Then that's my mission.

1217
01:41:35,966 --> 01:41:37,551
You want to leave?

1218
01:41:37,635 --> 01:41:40,679
You want to go off and fight the war?

1219
01:41:43,557 --> 01:41:45,017
All right.

1220
01:41:46,352 --> 01:41:48,896
All right, I won't stop you.

1221
01:41:48,979 --> 01:41:51,565
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1222
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:57,905
I just know that every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

1223
01:43:23,115 --> 01:43:24,658
~By memories.~

1224
01:43:25,993 --> 01:43:28,078
~Of the days gone by.~

1225
01:43:29,913 --> 01:43:31,665
~In my solitude.~

1226
01:43:32,624 --> 01:43:35,085
~You taunt me.~

1227
01:43:35,169 --> 01:43:38,672
~With memories that never die.~

1228
01:43:39,923 --> 01:43:42,342
~I sit in my chair.~

1229
01:43:42,468 --> 01:43:44,678
~Filled with despair.~

1230
01:43:44,762 --> 01:43:46,597
~There's no one.~

1231
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,099
~Could be so sad.~

1232
01:43:49,975 --> 01:43:52,019
~With gloom everywhere~

1233
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:54,688
~I sit and I stare...~

1234
01:44:08,619 --> 01:44:10,704
Halftrack! Cover!

1235
01:44:26,386 --> 01:44:29,890
«Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?»

1236
01:44:50,828 --> 01:44:53,437
Get ready to move on their left flank!
Take their left flank!

1237
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:56,456
Hold on and make sure they're down!

1238
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,940
«101st! We're coming out!»

1239
01:45:27,364 --> 01:45:30,325
That was a recon element, 2nd SS.

1240
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:35,247
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1241
01:45:37,124 --> 01:45:40,544
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1242
01:45:40,627 --> 01:45:42,713
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501st.

1243
01:45:42,796 --> 01:45:44,298
Ryan. First of the 506th.

1244
01:45:44,381 --> 01:45:46,758
PFC Toynbe, Third of the 506th.

1245
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,802
James Francis Ryan?

1246
01:45:48,886 --> 01:45:51,388
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1247
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:06,111
Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard.

1248
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:09,740
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1249
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:15,746
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1250
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,700
Tell you what, sir,
if you're our relief,

1251
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,505
I'm gonna file a complaint.

1252
01:46:25,589 --> 01:46:27,549
I wouldn't blame you.

1253
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,052
Who's your CO?

1254
01:46:31,637 --> 01:46:34,431
It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1255
01:46:34,514 --> 01:46:38,977
I'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

1256
01:46:39,061 --> 01:46:41,605
So, what are you guys all about?

1257
01:46:42,189 --> 01:46:44,691
We're here for him. Ryan.

1258
01:46:46,026 --> 01:46:47,486
Me, sir?

1259
01:46:56,828 --> 01:46:59,206
James Francis Ryan of Iowa?

1260
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,460
Yes, sir.
Payton, Iowa, that's correct, but...

1261
01:47:03,543 --> 01:47:05,545
What is this about?

1262
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:10,217
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1263
01:47:17,015 --> 01:47:18,642
Which ones?

1264
01:47:21,561 --> 01:47:23,063
All of them.

1265
01:47:32,906 --> 01:47:34,533
On the level?

1266
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:37,911
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1267
01:47:40,664 --> 01:47:42,582
You might want to take
some time with this.

1268
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:45,752
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1269
01:47:54,761 --> 01:47:57,681
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1270
01:47:57,764 --> 01:48:00,100
- Which one?
- All of them.

1271
01:48:05,105 --> 01:48:06,440
You...

1272
01:48:09,109 --> 01:48:12,404
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1273
01:48:14,114 --> 01:48:16,283
Well, you're going home.

1274
01:48:17,784 --> 01:48:20,370
Our orders are to bring you back.

1275
01:48:23,623 --> 01:48:25,292
Bring me back?

1276
01:48:27,627 --> 01:48:31,131
Corporal Henderson, I don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

1277
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:32,591
but orders are orders.

1278
01:48:32,674 --> 01:48:35,510
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

1279
01:48:35,635 --> 01:48:36,870
Sir, there's no way to tell. I mean,

1280
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:38,497
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

1281
01:48:38,597 --> 01:48:39,931
I have my orders, too, sir.

1282
01:48:40,015 --> 01:48:41,892
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1283
01:48:41,975 --> 01:48:44,895
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1284
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:47,355
I don't see that it does, sir.

1285
01:48:48,982 --> 01:48:51,985
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

1286
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:54,946
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1287
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:57,532
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1288
01:48:57,657 --> 01:48:59,618
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

1289
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:01,286
One at Valognes and this one here.

1290
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:02,630
We let the Germans take them,

1291
01:49:02,713 --> 01:49:04,887
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1292
01:49:04,987 --> 01:49:07,834
Private, your outfit wants to stay,
that's one thing.

1293
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:09,133
But your party's over here.

1294
01:49:09,253 --> 01:49:11,427
Sir, I can't leave
until at least reinforcements...

1295
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:13,799
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

1296
01:49:13,882 --> 01:49:16,491
Sir, what about them?
I mean, there's barely hardly enough...

1297
01:49:16,591 --> 01:49:18,092
Hey, asshole!

1298
01:49:18,303 --> 01:49:22,182
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1299
01:49:27,187 --> 01:49:29,898
- Sir?
- That's right.

1300
01:49:39,783 --> 01:49:44,287
- What were their names?
- Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1301
01:49:46,248 --> 01:49:47,791
Wade and...

1302
01:49:49,292 --> 01:49:50,710
Caparzo.

1303
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:05,559
It doesn't make any sense.

1304
01:50:07,644 --> 01:50:11,898
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do I deserve to go?

1305
01:50:11,982 --> 01:50:16,153
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

1306
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:22,868
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1307
01:50:22,951 --> 01:50:26,288
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1308
01:50:33,503 --> 01:50:35,922
Tell her that when you found me,

1309
01:50:36,006 --> 01:50:39,676
I was here and I was
with the only brothers that I have left,

1310
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:43,013
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1311
01:50:44,181 --> 01:50:46,349
I think she'll understand that.

1312
01:50:46,433 --> 01:50:49,436
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1313
01:51:32,437 --> 01:51:34,481
What are your orders?

1314
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:39,694
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1315
01:51:40,654 --> 01:51:43,281
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1316
01:51:43,365 --> 01:51:46,201
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1317
01:51:46,868 --> 01:51:49,829
I don't know. What do you think?

1318
01:51:50,914 --> 01:51:53,708
«You don't want to know what I think.»

1319
01:51:55,585 --> 01:51:57,254
No, Mike, I do.

1320
01:51:58,964 --> 01:52:02,259
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

1321
01:52:02,342 --> 01:52:04,886
What's he done to deserve this?

1322
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:08,932
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

1323
01:52:10,183 --> 01:52:11,476
Yeah.

1324
01:52:12,018 --> 01:52:17,148
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

1325
01:52:17,232 --> 01:52:19,859
and actually make it out of here?

1326
01:52:20,777 --> 01:52:24,406
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

1327
01:52:24,489 --> 01:52:27,909
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1328
01:52:27,993 --> 01:52:30,912
we were able to pull out of this whole.

1329
01:52:30,996 --> 01:52:33,123
God-awful, shitty mess.

1330
01:52:34,791 --> 01:52:37,294
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1331
01:52:38,461 --> 01:52:40,630
Like you said, Captain,

1332
01:52:42,424 --> 01:52:44,134
we do that,

1333
01:52:44,592 --> 01:52:47,387
we all earn the right to go home.

1334
01:52:50,265 --> 01:52:51,808
Oh, brother.

1335
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:57,564
This is everything.

1336
01:52:58,315 --> 01:53:03,945
You got the two 30-caliber machine
guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1337
01:53:04,696 --> 01:53:08,033
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

1338
01:53:08,116 --> 01:53:10,327
and assorted small arms.

1339
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:13,913
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

1340
01:53:13,997 --> 01:53:16,666
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1341
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:20,003
- Which they're sure to do.
- What are you thinking, sir?

1342
01:53:20,086 --> 01:53:24,716
Well, I'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

1343
01:53:29,262 --> 01:53:31,556
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1344
01:53:31,639 --> 01:53:32,770
in between these buildings

1345
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:36,811
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1346
01:53:36,895 --> 01:53:38,938
- Disable 'em?
- If we can.

1347
01:53:39,022 --> 01:53:40,607
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

1348
01:53:40,690 --> 01:53:42,525
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

1349
01:53:42,609 --> 01:53:45,028
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1350
01:53:45,111 --> 01:53:48,073
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1351
01:53:48,156 --> 01:53:50,367
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

1352
01:53:50,450 --> 01:53:52,494
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

1353
01:53:52,577 --> 01:53:54,788
That would be the idea.

1354
01:53:55,372 --> 01:53:56,831
Jackson.

1355
01:53:57,457 --> 01:53:59,751
If we can, I'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

1356
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:00,835
Yes, sir.

1357
01:54:00,919 --> 01:54:02,879
Give you a little company
if you need it.

1358
01:54:02,962 --> 01:54:05,006
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

1359
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:09,135
I'd say a.30 with about
1,000 rounds would be okay.

1360
01:54:09,219 --> 01:54:11,262
Parker, job opportunity.

1361
01:54:11,346 --> 01:54:13,348
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

1362
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:15,016
It's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

1363
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:17,185
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1364
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:20,355
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1365
01:54:20,814 --> 01:54:23,901
Reiben's right. As our esteemed
colleague from the Airborne pointed out,

1366
01:54:24,001 --> 01:54:26,152
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1367
01:54:26,236 --> 01:54:30,073
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1368
01:54:30,156 --> 01:54:32,575
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1369
01:54:32,659 --> 01:54:35,829
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1370
01:54:35,912 --> 01:54:37,997
Yeah, but with what?

1371
01:54:39,707 --> 01:54:43,545
- Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
- Sticky bomb, sir?

1372
01:54:44,754 --> 01:54:48,591
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. It's in the field manual.

1373
01:54:48,675 --> 01:54:50,552
You check it out if you want to.

1374
01:54:50,635 --> 01:54:52,720
We seem to be out of field manuals, sir.

1375
01:54:52,804 --> 01:54:54,722
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1376
01:54:54,806 --> 01:54:56,806
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

1377
01:54:56,906 --> 01:54:58,309
Some TNT or some composition B?

1378
01:54:58,393 --> 01:55:00,103
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

1379
01:55:00,186 --> 01:55:03,056
I got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

1380
01:55:03,156 --> 01:55:04,941
All right. You can spare some, then.

1381
01:55:05,024 --> 01:55:08,278
You take a standard-issue GI sock,

1382
01:55:08,361 --> 01:55:11,489
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

1383
01:55:11,573 --> 01:55:14,033
rig up a simple fuse,

1384
01:55:14,117 --> 01:55:16,661
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

1385
01:55:16,744 --> 01:55:18,746
That way, when you throw it,

1386
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:21,249
it should stick.
It's a bomb that sticks.

1387
01:55:21,332 --> 01:55:22,959
It's a sticky bomb.

1388
01:55:23,042 --> 01:55:25,651
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

1389
01:55:25,751 --> 01:55:27,172
I'm all ears.

1390
01:55:27,255 --> 01:55:30,800
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

1391
01:55:45,273 --> 01:55:46,774
Haul away.

1392
01:56:00,788 --> 01:56:02,790
All right, select the field of fire.

1393
01:56:02,874 --> 01:56:04,709
Crossfire with the one
in the bell tower.

1394
01:56:04,792 --> 01:56:08,087
All right, I can cover
12 to nine from here.

1395
01:56:11,341 --> 01:56:13,426
«- Easy!
- I got her!»

1396
01:56:47,794 --> 01:56:49,671
Here are the mines.

1397
01:57:00,598 --> 01:57:03,017
For being the best we can do,

1398
01:57:03,101 --> 01:57:07,105
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1399
01:57:09,774 --> 01:57:12,277
And this position right here,

1400
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,947
this is the Alamo.

1401
01:57:16,531 --> 01:57:20,201
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

1402
01:57:20,285 --> 01:57:22,328
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

1403
01:57:22,412 --> 01:57:24,543
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

1404
01:57:24,643 --> 01:57:28,626
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

1405
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:32,130
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1406
01:57:33,047 --> 01:57:35,008
Never more than
two feet away from me,

1407
01:57:35,091 --> 01:57:37,302
and that's not negotiable.

1408
01:57:38,428 --> 01:57:40,847
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1409
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:45,184
- Hey, Upham.
- Yes.

1410
01:57:45,268 --> 01:57:47,145
- Listen to me, all right?
- Yeah.

1411
01:57:47,228 --> 01:57:48,771
- You're listening?
- Yes.

1412
01:57:48,855 --> 01:57:50,940
All right, we're gonna be displacing

1413
01:57:51,024 --> 01:57:52,894
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

1414
01:57:52,994 --> 01:57:53,818
Right up there.

1415
01:57:53,901 --> 01:57:57,363
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1416
01:57:57,447 --> 01:57:59,157
- Right.
- You understand that?

1417
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,534
- Johnny on the spot.
- Yeah.

1418
01:58:01,618 --> 01:58:04,746
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yes.

1419
01:58:05,038 --> 01:58:06,331
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

1420
01:58:06,414 --> 01:58:08,893
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1421
01:58:08,993 --> 01:58:12,079
and I said "No, thank you,
I don't smoke."

1422
01:58:12,545 --> 01:58:14,172
"I don't smoke."

1423
01:58:16,007 --> 01:58:18,968
- Quite a situation, huh?
- Unbelievable.

1424
01:58:20,303 --> 01:58:25,850
Here. Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1425
01:58:26,309 --> 01:58:28,186
You got that right.

1426
01:58:30,438 --> 01:58:31,814
<Fubar>.

1427
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,193
Ouch.

1428
01:58:35,485 --> 01:58:37,111
- Yeah, well...
- <Fubar>.

1429
01:58:37,195 --> 01:58:39,697
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1430
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,699
Yeah. Okay.

1431
01:58:47,914 --> 01:58:49,582
Take it easy.

1432
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:52,251
<Fubar>.

1433
01:59:30,123 --> 01:59:34,502
«- Who's that singing, sir?»
- Edith Piaf.

1434
01:59:36,921 --> 01:59:39,465
«What's she so upset about?»

1435
01:59:40,299 --> 01:59:41,843
Her lover left her,

1436
01:59:41,968 --> 01:59:45,430
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1437
01:59:46,597 --> 01:59:48,474
That would do it.

1438
01:59:55,150 --> 02:00:02,050
~Nous nous aimions bien tendrement~
~Comme s'aiment tous les amants~

1439
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:10,250
~Et puis un jour tu m'as quittée~
~Depuis je suis désespérée~

1440
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:17,650
~Je te vois partout dans le ciel~
~Je te vois partout sur la terre~

1441
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:20,972
~- Tu es ma joie et mon soleil~
 - "Even life itself only represents you."

1442
02:00:22,150 --> 02:00:23,900
~Ma nuit, mes jours,~

1443
02:00:23,925 --> 02:00:24,999
<font color="#ff00ff">~mes aubes claires~</font>

1444
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,911
"Sometimes I dream that I'm in your arms".

1445
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:29,039
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1446
02:00:29,056 --> 02:00:30,391
- The chorus. It's the chorus.
- The chorus.

1447
02:00:30,392 --> 02:00:32,334
<font color="#ff00ff">~Tu es partout car tu es dans mon cœur~</font>

1448
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:33,810
"And you speak softly in my ear"

1449
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:36,730
~Tu es partout car tu es mon bonheur~

1450
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:38,959
~- Toutes les choses...~
- "and you say things..."

1451
02:00:39,192 --> 02:00:41,711
<font color="#ff00ff">~- qui sont autour de moi~</font>
- "that make my eyes close."

1452
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,920
~Même la vie ne représente que toi~

1453
02:00:43,946 --> 02:00:45,232
"And I find that marvelous."

1454
02:00:46,115 --> 02:00:48,743
- Again, Upham...
«- Yes.»

1455
02:00:49,452 --> 02:00:54,081
...to be honest with you,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1456
02:00:54,957 --> 02:00:58,461
- Marvelous.
- No, it's really a melancholy song.

1457
02:00:58,544 --> 02:01:02,256
At the beginning of the song, she says,
"And then one day, you left."

1458
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:06,385
"You left me, and I've been
desperate ever since."

1459
02:01:06,469 --> 02:01:09,639
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the Earth."

1460
02:01:09,722 --> 02:01:11,390
Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

1461
02:01:11,474 --> 02:01:13,344
the krauts aren't going
to have to shoot me.

1462
02:01:13,444 --> 02:01:16,103
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1463
02:01:16,229 --> 02:01:18,898
You know,
you're a strange bird, Upham.

1464
02:01:18,981 --> 02:01:20,858
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1465
02:01:20,942 --> 02:01:22,944
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1466
02:01:23,069 --> 02:01:25,765
It reminds me of Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

1467
02:01:25,865 --> 02:01:27,323
the day I left for basic.

1468
02:01:27,406 --> 02:01:29,951
What, "Don't touch me"?

1469
02:01:30,076 --> 02:01:32,620
No. Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1470
02:01:32,745 --> 02:01:35,540
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

1471
02:01:35,623 --> 02:01:39,418
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

1472
02:01:39,502 --> 02:01:41,155
- Double E?
- These things are massive.

1473
02:01:41,255 --> 02:01:42,463
Those are big.

1474
02:01:42,588 --> 02:01:45,925
No. And I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

1475
02:01:46,008 --> 02:01:48,313
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

1476
02:01:48,413 --> 02:01:51,264
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1477
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:53,599
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1478
02:01:53,683 --> 02:01:56,269
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

1479
02:01:56,352 --> 02:01:58,104
- Is it really tight?
- No, no. It's beautiful.

1480
02:01:58,187 --> 02:01:59,647
And she sees me, and she can tell

1481
02:01:59,749 --> 02:02:02,358
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

1482
02:02:02,441 --> 02:02:04,485
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

1483
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:07,071
And she says, "When you're over there",

1484
02:02:07,154 --> 02:02:09,031
"if you see anything that upsets you,"

1485
02:02:09,115 --> 02:02:12,201
"or if you're ever scared,
I want you to close your eyes"

1486
02:02:12,285 --> 02:02:15,329
"and think of these. You understand?"

1487
02:02:16,789 --> 02:02:18,958
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1488
02:02:32,138 --> 02:02:34,140
«Are you all right, sir?»

1489
02:02:35,182 --> 02:02:37,977
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1490
02:02:42,857 --> 02:02:45,818
«Is it true you were
a teacher back home?»

1491
02:02:46,861 --> 02:02:48,321
Yes.

1492
02:02:48,404 --> 02:02:50,740
See, that's something I could never do,
you know.

1493
02:02:50,823 --> 02:02:55,328
Not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir.

1494
02:02:57,663 --> 02:03:00,082
I had 1,000 kids like you.

1495
02:03:06,339 --> 02:03:09,008
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1496
02:03:10,343 --> 02:03:13,054
I've been trying,
and I can't see their faces at all.

1497
02:03:13,179 --> 02:03:15,348
Has that ever happened to you?

1498
02:03:15,431 --> 02:03:17,850
You gotta think of a context.

1499
02:03:20,019 --> 02:03:22,146
What does that mean?

1500
02:03:22,229 --> 02:03:24,143
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

1501
02:03:24,243 --> 02:03:28,914
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

1502
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:35,201
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1503
02:03:35,284 --> 02:03:38,371
I think of my hammock in the backyard,

1504
02:03:39,205 --> 02:03:43,542
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1505
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,175
This one night, two of my brothers came

1506
02:03:51,258 --> 02:03:54,261
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1507
02:03:55,096 --> 02:03:58,140
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

1508
02:03:58,724 --> 02:04:01,852
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

1509
02:04:01,936 --> 02:04:04,897
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1510
02:04:06,065 --> 02:04:09,110
with Alice. Alice Jardine.

1511
02:04:12,071 --> 02:04:16,283
I mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1512
02:04:16,409 --> 02:04:18,995
and hit every branch coming down.

1513
02:04:20,913 --> 02:04:23,582
And Dan's got her shirt off.

1514
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:26,460
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

1515
02:04:26,585 --> 02:04:29,755
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

1516
02:04:30,589 --> 02:04:33,968
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1517
02:04:36,595 --> 02:04:40,141
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

1518
02:04:40,266 --> 02:04:42,180
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

1519
02:04:42,264 --> 02:04:44,178
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

1520
02:04:44,278 --> 02:04:47,481
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1521
02:04:47,606 --> 02:04:51,777
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

1522
02:04:51,861 --> 02:04:54,238
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

1523
02:04:54,321 --> 02:04:55,823
He's got to wake her up.

1524
02:04:55,948 --> 02:04:59,201
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

1525
02:04:59,285 --> 02:05:02,496
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

1526
02:05:02,618 --> 02:05:04,792
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?"

1527
02:05:04,892 --> 02:05:07,019
"I just did you a favor."

1528
02:05:08,794 --> 02:05:10,671
And so this makes Dan more angry.

1529
02:05:10,796 --> 02:05:13,716
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

1530
02:05:13,799 --> 02:05:16,510
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1531
02:05:16,635 --> 02:05:19,221
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

1532
02:05:19,305 --> 02:05:21,474
because of this thing.

1533
02:05:36,322 --> 02:05:38,240
That was it. That was the last...
That was...

1534
02:05:38,324 --> 02:05:39,909
Dan went off to basic next day.

1535
02:05:39,992 --> 02:05:43,621
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1536
02:05:43,704 --> 02:05:45,831
That was two years ago.

1537
02:05:47,708 --> 02:05:49,085
Oh, my.

1538
02:05:51,045 --> 02:05:54,590
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1539
02:05:55,841 --> 02:05:57,176
No.

1540
02:05:58,385 --> 02:06:01,097
No. That one I save just for me.

1541
02:07:06,412 --> 02:07:08,289
Enemy from the east.

1542
02:07:09,456 --> 02:07:12,376
He sees Tiger tanks, two of them.

1543
02:07:12,459 --> 02:07:14,461
Panzer tanks, two of them.

1544
02:07:14,587 --> 02:07:16,380
Infantry.

1545
02:07:16,463 --> 02:07:18,340
Fifty plus change.

1546
02:07:27,266 --> 02:07:29,059
Disperse! You know what to do!

1547
02:07:29,143 --> 02:07:30,839
- Reiben, get on the rabbit.
- Yes, sir.

1548
02:07:30,939 --> 02:07:34,148
«- Upham, get some cover.
- Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!»

1549
02:07:34,273 --> 02:07:37,193
«- This is it.
- Everybody check your ammo!»

1550
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,153
«Good luck, Reiben.»

1551
02:07:39,278 --> 02:07:42,615
I don't need any luck, Sarge,
I was born lucky.

1552
02:07:55,377 --> 02:07:56,629
One in five tracer?

1553
02:07:56,754 --> 02:07:58,714
Yep, and tracers point both ways.

1554
02:07:58,797 --> 02:08:02,885
Yeah? Why don't you check
the head space and she should run.

1555
02:08:10,726 --> 02:08:12,937
Upham! Hustle up!

1556
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:04,947
- Corporal Upham?
- Yes, sir.

1557
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:07,422
We don't have a 30-caliber
machine gun in this position.

1558
02:09:07,522 --> 02:09:10,786
Either Mr. Mellish or Mr. Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

1559
02:09:10,869 --> 02:09:12,246
Yes, sir.

1560
02:09:13,038 --> 02:09:16,333
Upham! Jackson's fine.
Turn around to Mellish.

1561
02:09:37,771 --> 02:09:39,293
There's a ton of infantry, Captain.

1562
02:09:39,393 --> 02:09:41,687
I don't know if they took
the bait though.

1563
02:10:05,507 --> 02:10:07,634
You got any more of that?

1564
02:10:53,806 --> 02:10:56,141
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1565
02:11:01,063 --> 02:11:03,899
Infantry's moving to the left.

1566
02:11:03,982 --> 02:11:07,361
Halftrack just went by
with about 20 troops, sir.

1567
02:12:46,043 --> 02:12:49,379
Mellish! Henderson! Displace!

1568
02:13:10,943 --> 02:13:12,736
Do it, now! Light it up!

1569
02:13:12,819 --> 02:13:14,613
You! Light it!

1570
02:13:25,791 --> 02:13:27,876
Thirty infantry on the right flank!

1571
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,462
Get over there,
find a hole, and stop them!

1572
02:13:30,587 --> 02:13:32,256
«Displace!»

1573
02:13:43,809 --> 02:13:45,143
Upham!

1574
02:14:00,492 --> 02:14:01,994
Clear!

1575
02:14:03,787 --> 02:14:05,038
Krauts!

1576
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:08,500
Right flank!

1577
02:14:44,995 --> 02:14:47,164
Get down! Get down!

1578
02:14:54,212 --> 02:14:57,299
Upham! Upham! 30-cal! Hurry!

1579
02:14:57,382 --> 02:15:00,886
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1580
02:15:55,774 --> 02:15:58,610
Reversing! He's still in this fight!

1581
02:15:59,611 --> 02:16:02,114
No, no, Ryan, get down! Get down!

1582
02:16:15,085 --> 02:16:16,336
Ryan!

1583
02:16:35,522 --> 02:16:36,940
Ryan!

1584
02:16:39,276 --> 02:16:40,861
- Ryan!
«- Get off me!»

1585
02:16:40,986 --> 02:16:43,447
- Are you all right?
- Get off me!

1586
02:16:43,530 --> 02:16:45,657
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, too, Captain. Thanks.

1587
02:16:46,533 --> 02:16:51,163
Okay, both sides!
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1588
02:16:54,166 --> 02:16:55,667
Grenade!

1589
02:16:57,502 --> 02:16:59,171
20-mill!

1590
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:03,341
Flak gun, 20 millimeter. Take it out!

1591
02:17:15,687 --> 02:17:19,191
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
I ain't got a shot!

1592
02:17:23,695 --> 02:17:25,447
Pincer move, Parker!

1593
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:28,033
- Targets 8 o'clock low!
«- Shit!»

1594
02:17:28,116 --> 02:17:30,368
God grant me strength.

1595
02:17:44,257 --> 02:17:45,801
Displace!

1596
02:17:45,884 --> 02:17:47,302
Come on!

1597
02:18:03,109 --> 02:18:05,862
Cover, Upham! Cover! Cover!

1598
02:18:22,629 --> 02:18:24,589
I'm out of 30-caliber.

1599
02:18:28,009 --> 02:18:30,846
Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
which teaches my hands to war

1600
02:18:30,929 --> 02:18:33,306
and my fingers to fight.

1601
02:18:41,815 --> 02:18:44,317
My goodness and my fortress,

1602
02:18:44,401 --> 02:18:47,070
my high tower and my deliverer,

1603
02:18:49,656 --> 02:18:52,868
my shield and he in whom I trust.

1604
02:18:55,912 --> 02:18:57,998
Come here, baby.

1605
02:19:20,604 --> 02:19:22,397
Parker, get down!

1606
02:19:44,085 --> 02:19:46,504
Captain, that 20-millimeter's
killing us.

1607
02:19:46,588 --> 02:19:48,882
We gotta try to flank it somehow.

1608
02:19:49,007 --> 02:19:51,843
Well, let me get over for the top shot.

1609
02:20:16,368 --> 02:20:17,786
Upham!

1610
02:20:36,638 --> 02:20:41,101
Upham! Upham!
Upham, ammo, God damn it!

1611
02:21:24,310 --> 02:21:26,730
I'm jammed! I'm jammed!
You got any 30-cal?

1612
02:21:26,813 --> 02:21:28,481
- I'm out.
- Shit.

1613
02:21:40,285 --> 02:21:42,787
Upham! Upham!

1614
02:22:40,970 --> 02:22:42,430
Reiben!

1615
02:23:08,915 --> 02:23:13,086
I'm out! I need another bandoleer!
Anybody got a bandoleer?

1616
02:23:38,069 --> 02:23:40,280
God! God!

1617
02:23:44,576 --> 02:23:47,495
You stupid son of a bitch!

1618
02:24:31,122 --> 02:24:34,079
Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop.
Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop!

1619
02:24:34,179 --> 02:24:35,931
Stop! Don't...

1620
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:17,418
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1621
02:25:17,502 --> 02:25:19,295
Son of a bitch!

1622
02:25:20,755 --> 02:25:21,798
Bitch!

1623
02:26:40,835 --> 02:26:43,921
- I'm out.
- Those 60 rounds.

1624
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:48,509
- We can use them without the tube.
- How?

1625
02:26:48,593 --> 02:26:51,554
Fuse-arming wire, set back, heave it!

1626
02:27:07,278 --> 02:27:08,946
Panzerschreck!

1627
02:27:42,980 --> 02:27:45,233
We're going to the Alamo.

1628
02:27:55,451 --> 02:27:57,286
Alamo! Alamo!

1629
02:28:16,848 --> 02:28:19,142
We'll take it! You fall back!

1630
02:28:19,267 --> 02:28:22,854
- You be right behind us!
- Soon as we're in business!

1631
02:28:26,816 --> 02:28:28,943
Displace. Reiben.

1632
02:28:31,446 --> 02:28:32,864
Reload.

1633
02:29:21,704 --> 02:29:23,206
All right, go.

1634
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:25,566
We're blowing the bridge!

1635
02:29:25,666 --> 02:29:28,544
- Get off! Clear the bridge!
- Displace...

1636
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:54,403
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1637
02:29:54,529 --> 02:29:57,312
- I just got the wind knocked out of me.
- Well, get out of here!

1638
02:29:57,412 --> 02:30:00,833
Take cover!
We're going to blow this bridge!

1639
02:30:01,953 --> 02:30:03,746
Come on, come on!

1640
02:30:08,543 --> 02:30:11,379
Tiger coming coming across the bridge!

1641
02:30:43,452 --> 02:30:46,706
Captain, get behind something!

1642
02:30:46,789 --> 02:30:49,458
«Come on, Captain, move it!»

1643
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:13,649
Mike.

1644
02:31:18,821 --> 02:31:20,156
Mike!

1645
02:31:59,195 --> 02:32:00,488
«Captain.»

1646
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:07,370
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

1647
02:34:00,441 --> 02:34:01,776
Upham.

1648
02:34:32,723 --> 02:34:34,975
Hang in there, Captain.

1649
02:35:19,061 --> 02:35:20,771
Medic!

1650
02:35:23,566 --> 02:35:26,110
Medic! We got a medic?

1651
02:35:32,908 --> 02:35:35,786
They're tank-busters, sir. P-51s.

1652
02:35:36,745 --> 02:35:38,956
Angels on our shoulders.

1653
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:46,630
What, sir?

1654
02:35:51,093 --> 02:35:52,469
James...

1655
02:35:54,263 --> 02:35:55,764
Earn this.

1656
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:01,478
Earn it.

1657
02:36:30,966 --> 02:36:33,135
«My dear Mrs. Ryan,»

1658
02:36:34,386 --> 02:36:36,847
«it's with the most
profound sense of joy»

1659
02:36:36,931 --> 02:36:42,102
«that I write to inform you
your son Private James Ryan»

1660
02:36:42,186 --> 02:36:44,313
«is well and, at this very moment,»

1661
02:36:44,396 --> 02:36:47,858
«on his way home
from European battlefields.»

1662
02:36:47,942 --> 02:36:51,445
«Reports from the front indicate
James did his duty in combat»

1663
02:36:51,528 --> 02:36:55,074
«with great courage
and steadfast dedication,»

1664
02:36:55,741 --> 02:36:58,327
«even after he was informed
of the tragic loss»

1665
02:36:58,410 --> 02:37:01,914
«your family has suffered
in this great campaign»

1666
02:37:01,997 --> 02:37:05,417
«to rid the world
of tyranny and oppression.»

1667
02:37:05,501 --> 02:37:08,754
«I take great pleasure in joining
the Secretary of War,»

1668
02:37:08,879 --> 02:37:11,006
«the men and women
of the United States Army»

1669
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:13,467
«and the citizens of a grateful nation»

1670
02:37:13,550 --> 02:37:16,470
«in wishing you good health
and many years of happiness»

1671
02:37:16,553 --> 02:37:19,098
«with James at your side.»

1672
02:37:20,265 --> 02:37:24,269
«Nothing, not even the safe
return of a beloved son,»

1673
02:37:24,353 --> 02:37:25,896
«can compensate you»

1674
02:37:25,980 --> 02:37:29,024
«or the thousands
of other American families»

1675
02:37:29,108 --> 02:37:32,486
«who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war.»

1676
02:37:32,569 --> 02:37:36,073
«And I might share with you some words
which have sustained me»

1677
02:37:36,156 --> 02:37:40,285
«through long, dark nights of peril,
loss and heartache.»

1678
02:37:40,369 --> 02:37:41,829
«And I quote,»

1679
02:37:43,163 --> 02:37:44,748
«'I pray that our heavenly father»

1680
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:48,043
«'may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement»

1681
02:37:48,127 --> 02:37:50,087
«'and leave you only
the cherished memory»

1682
02:37:50,170 --> 02:37:52,172
«'of the loved and lost»

1683
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:54,633
«'and the solemn pride
that must be yours»

1684
02:37:54,717 --> 02:37:59,471
«'to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom.»

«'Abraham Lincoln. '»

«George C Marshall,
General, Chief of Staff.»

1688
02:38:59,698 --> 02:39:02,034
My family is with me today.

1689
02:39:02,951 --> 02:39:05,788
They wanted to come with me.

1690
02:39:07,456 --> 02:39:08,624
To be honest with you,

1691
02:39:08,707 --> 02:39:11,960
I wasn't sure how I'd feel
coming back here.

1692
02:39:15,339 --> 02:39:18,801
Every day I think about
what you said to me

1693
02:39:18,884 --> 02:39:20,969
that day on the bridge.

1694
02:39:22,888 --> 02:39:26,308
And I've tried to live my life
the best I could.

1695
02:39:27,434 --> 02:39:29,812
I hope that was enough.

1696
02:39:30,604 --> 02:39:33,315
I hope that, at least in your eyes,

1697
02:39:35,150 --> 02:39:38,862
I've earned what all of you
have done for me.

1698
02:39:52,417 --> 02:39:53,752
James.

1699
02:39:56,004 --> 02:39:58,006
"Captain John H. Miller."

1700
02:40:06,682 --> 02:40:10,602
- Tell me I've led a good life.
- What?

1701
02:40:11,854 --> 02:40:14,022
Tell me I'm a good man.

1702
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:22,865
You are.
