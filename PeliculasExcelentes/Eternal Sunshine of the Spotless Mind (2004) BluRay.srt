00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:41,211
<i>Random thoughts
for Valentine's Day, 2004.</i>

2
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,177
<i>Today is a holiday invented
by greeting-card companies</i>

3
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:49,381
<i>to make people feel like crap.</i>

4
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:55,014
<i>I ditched work today.</i>

5
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,600
<i>Took a train out to Montauk.</i>

6
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,486
<i>I don't know why.</i>

7
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,448
<i>I'm not an impulsive person.</i>

8
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:18,167
<i>I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.</i>

9
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,457
<i>I gotta get my car fixed.</i>

10
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:23,338
Hi, Cindy. It's Joel.

11
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:28,424
Listen, I don't feel
very well today.

12
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,347
No, food poisoning, I think.

13
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:34,726
<i>It's goddamn freezing
on this beach.</i>

14
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,729
<i>Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.</i>

15
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:43,476
<i>Pages ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.</i>

16
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:49,696
<i>It appears this is
my first entry in two years.</i>

17
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,661
<i>Sand is overrated.</i>

18
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,002
<i>It's just tiny little rocks.</i>

19
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:16,142
<i>If only I could meet
someone new.</i>

20
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,057
<i>I guess my chances
of that happening</i>

21
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,684
<i>are somewhat diminished,</i>

22
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:24,517
<i>since I'm incapable of making eye contact
with a woman I don't know.</i>

23
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:30,194
<i>Maybe I should get back together
with Naomi. She was nice.</i>

24
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:32,775
<i>Nice is good.</i>

25
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,237
<i>She loved me.</i>

26
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:16,654
<i>Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see</i>

27
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:19,455
<i>who shows me
the least bit of attention?</i>

28
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,116
Hi.

29
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,958
- I'm sorry?
- I just said hi.

30
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,120
Hi, hello.

31
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,294
Okay if I sit closer?

32
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:14,636
How far are you going?

33
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,763
Rockville Center.

34
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,465
Get out. Me, too.

35
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:19,933
Really?

36
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,009
What are the odds?

37
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,688
Listen, do I know you?

38
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:30,860
Do you ever shop
at Barnes and Noble?

39
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,107
Sure.

40
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,814
- That's it!
- Yeah?

41
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,398
I've seen you, man.

42
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,744
Book slave there
for five years now.

43
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,365
Jesus!

44
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,449
I would have thought
I would remember you.

45
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,375
It might be the hair.

46
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,452
What might?

47
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,378
It changes a lot, the color.

48
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,872
That's why you might
not recognize me.

49
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,006
- It's called Blue Ruin.
- Right.

50
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:55,084
The color.
Snappy name, huh?

51
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:56,386
I like it.

52
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:03,268
This company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:06,938
You've got Red Menace,
Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

54
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,308
That would be a job,
coming up with those names.

55
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,269
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:17,106
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? 15 maybe?

57
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:19,492
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:23,113
Agent Orange.
I came up with that one.

59
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:26,703
I apply my personality
in a paste.

60
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:29,043
I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:34,216
Well, you don't know me,
so you don't know, do you?

62
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:41,340
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be nice.

63
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,892
Yeah. I got it.

64
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,368
My name's Clementine,
by the way.

65
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,619
I'm Joel.

66
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,413
Hi, Joel.

67
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,462
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,711
Oh, no.
You wouldn't do that.

69
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,507
You're trying to be nice.

70
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,548
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

71
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,300
Huckleberry Hound.

72
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,757
I don't know what that means.

73
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,514
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

74
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,430
It's been suggested.

75
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,150
<i>Oh, my darling, oh, my darling,
oh, my darling Clementine</i>

76
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:37,984
<i>You are lost and gone forever,
dreadful sorry, Clementine</i>

77
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:39,523
No?

78
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:40,982
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:43,901
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

80
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,956
It means merciful, right?
Clemency?

81
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:50,409
Although it hardly fits.

82
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,790
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

83
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,918
I wouldn't think that about you.

84
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,215
Why wouldn't you think that
about me?

85
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,292
I don't know.

86
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:04,890
You seem nice.

87
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,967
Now I'm nice?

88
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:10,224
Oh, God, don't you know
any other adjectives?

89
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:13,057
I don't need nice.
I don't need myself to be it

90
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:15,017
and I don't need anybody
to be it at me.

91
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,225
Okay.

92
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,740
It's Joel, right?

93
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,119
Yes.

94
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:29,451
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

95
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,576
I'm a little out of sorts today.

96
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,091
My embarrassing admission

97
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:46,718
is I really like that
you're nice right now.

98
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,262
I can't tell from one moment to
the next what I'm going to like,

99
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:55,849
but right now I'm glad you are.

100
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:07,527
I have some stuff
that I probably should...

101
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,790
- I'm writing...
- I'm sorry. Okay.

102
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:14,538
- No.
- Sure. That's okay.

103
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,505
Take care, then.

104
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,707
Jesus.

105
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:39,147
I could give you a ride
if you need.

106
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:41,234
It's cold.

107
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:44,147
Yeah! Okay. It is frosty.

108
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,823
You're not a stalker
or anything, right?

109
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:49,699
I'm not a stalker. You're the one
that talked to me, remember?

110
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,996
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

111
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,540
Really?
There's a stalker book?

112
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,163
I've got to read that one.

113
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:07,050
Look, I'm sorry
if I came off sort of nutso.

114
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,926
I'm not really.

115
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:12,180
That's okay.
I didn't think you were.

116
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:20,730
Do you want to have a drink?

117
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,398
I have lots of drinks,
and I could...

118
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:29,534
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.

119
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,235
Good night, Joel.

120
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:52,758
Two Blue Ruins.

121
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:56,053
Thank you.

122
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,433
Drink up, young man.

123
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:01,441
It'll make the whole seduction
part less repugnant.

124
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:07,523
I'm just kidding!
Come on.

125
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,577
You're kind of close-mouthed,
aren't you?

126
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,828
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:22,375
You know, my life isn't
that interesting.

128
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,253
I go to work, I come home.

129
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,503
I don't know what to say.

130
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,346
You should read my journal.

131
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,176
I mean, it's just blank.

132
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,892
Really? Does that
make you sad or anxious?

133
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:43,441
I'm always anxious, thinking
I'm not living my life to the fullest.

134
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,439
Taking advantage
of every possibility

135
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,238
and making sure I'm not wasting
one second of the little time I have.

136
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,566
- I think about that.
- Yeah?

137
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,118
You're really nice.

138
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,330
God, I have to stop saying that.

139
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:06,089
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.

140
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,001
Okay.

141
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:19,056
Joel, you should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

142
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,396
It gets frozen
this time of year.

143
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,473
- That sounds scary.
- Exactly.

144
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:27,399
I'll pack a picnic,
a night picnic.

145
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:29,900
Night picnics are different.

146
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,320
That sounds good.

147
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:36,494
But I should go now.

148
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:39,155
You should stay.

149
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,615
No, I really have...

150
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,285
I have to get up so early and...

151
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,165
I would like you to call me.

152
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,668
Would you do that?
I'd like it.

153
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:48,748
Yes.

154
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:56,302
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call.

155
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:58,049
That'd be nice.

156
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,017
<i>What took you so long?</i>

157
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,685
I just walked in.

158
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,601
<i>You miss me?</i>

159
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:48,474
Oddly enough, I do.

160
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,692
<i>You said "I do".
I guess that means we're married.</i>

161
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:54,272
I guess so.

162
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,401
<i>Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?</i>

163
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,994
It's really solid
this time of year.

164
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,541
- I don't know.
- Come on.

165
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,216
It's so beautiful.

166
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:15,877
Isn't it?

167
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:21,549
Don't go too far.

168
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:25,678
Are you okay?

169
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:31,525
Oh, my ass!

170
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:36,440
- I think I should go back.
- Come on!

171
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:38,024
But what if it breaks?

172
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,486
"What if?"
Do you really care right now?

173
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,988
Come here, please.

174
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:53,249
Slidey-slidey.

175
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,379
This looks good.

176
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,293
Let me show you this one thing.

177
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:59,220
What are you doing?

178
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,057
Come on.

179
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,391
Think I heard a crack.

180
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:13,984
It's not going to crack,
or break.

181
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,527
It's so thick.

182
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,817
Show me which constellations
you know.

183
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:25,447
I don't know any.

184
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,326
Show me which ones you know.

185
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,411
Okay.

186
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,126
There's Osidius.

187
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:39,420
Where?

188
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:42,006
Right there. See?

189
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,598
A sort of a swoop and a cross.

190
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,011
Osidius the Emphatic.

191
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:50,521
You're full of shit, right?

192
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,725
No. Osidius, right there.

193
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,859
Swoop and a cross.

194
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:56,778
Shut the fuck up!

195
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,037
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

196
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,677
Sorry to wake you,
but we're here.

197
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:32,646
Can I come over to your house,

198
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,981
to sleep? I'm so tired.

199
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:41,322
Okay. Yeah, sure.

200
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,821
Let me get my toothbrush.

201
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:07,724
Yes?

202
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,013
Can I help you?

203
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,186
What do you mean?

204
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:15,265
Can I help you with something?

205
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,350
No.

206
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:20,144
What are you doing here?

207
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,947
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

208
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,201
Thanks.

209
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,345
We're looking for 159.

210
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,680
What number is that?

211
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,139
I don't know
what number that is.

212
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,692
Jesus Christ. You'd think
they'd light the number

213
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,109
or at least put a number on...

214
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,527
- Is that him?
- I think so.

215
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,231
Yeah, that's him.

216
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,027
That's him.

217
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,004
- Hey, Joel.
- Frank.

218
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,009
Shit.

219
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:55,472
Jesus. The only Valentine's Day cards
I get are from my mother.

220
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,518
How pathetic is that?

221
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:01,147
You're lucky you have Clementine.
She is way cool.

222
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:04,143
You got any big Valentine's Day
plans with her?

223
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,197
No.

224
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:12,444
It's only a day away.
Better make some reservations or something.

225
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,744
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's, right?

226
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:16,161
McRomance!

227
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,073
You want some fries
with that shake?

228
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:21,456
I have to go to sleep now,
Frank.

229
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,460
It's 8:30.

230
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,862
Patrick, stop it.

231
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,420
Okay.

232
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,349
Showtime at the Apollo.

233
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,780
Quiet.

234
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:47,912
Get it off your head.

235
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:52,421
Hey, Joel.
What's up?

236
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:55,218
Hi, Frank.

237
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:05,147
I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom. How pathetic is that?

238
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:09,143
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

239
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:12,813
You got any big Valentine's Day
plans with her?

240
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:15,152
No.

241
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:19,156
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation somewhere.

242
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,076
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's.

243
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:24,787
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

244
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:28,337
Valentine's Day is three days away.
I want it resolved.

245
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,584
I'm willing to be the one
to resolve it.

246
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:33,666
So I call her, and
she's changed her number.

247
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,262
<i>So I walked over to Antic Attic
to get her something.</i>

248
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:40,965
<i>I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early Valentine.</i>

249
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,802
And you won't believe it.

250
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:48,523
She's there with this guy,

251
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,060
this really young guy.

252
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:55,022
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

253
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:56,692
Excuse me?

254
00:22:57,702 --> 00:22:59,284
Can I help you
find something, sir?

255
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,827
Hey, Clem-ato.

256
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:08,705
Patrick! Baby boy!

257
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,502
What are you doing here, baby?

258
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:14,958
Just came to surprise you.

259
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:17,545
Let me know
if you need something, sir.

260
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:20,672
How are you?

261
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,217
Pretty good, pretty bored,
pretty tired.

262
00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:26,554
- I so want what's in your suit.
- Good.

263
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:43,654
Why would she do that to me?

264
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:49,577
Does anybody want a joint?

265
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,580
God, Rob, give it a rest.

266
00:23:52,757 --> 00:23:55,340
- God, she's punishing me.
- I know.

267
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:57,507
- For being honest.
- It's horrible.

268
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,177
- I should just go to her house.
- No.

269
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:01,630
You don't want to go there, man.

270
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:04,432
- Get off me. It's too...
- Right.

271
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:07,185
- Yeah.
- I don't want to seem desperate.

272
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:09,730
Joel, why don't you
just see this as a sign?

273
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,182
Make a clean break. Right?

274
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:18,695
All right, Joel.

275
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:21,649
Look, man, seriously,
here's the deal.

276
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,494
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?

277
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:26,658
What's your fucking suggestion?

278
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:28,489
What's your brilliant,
reasoned solution?

279
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:30,201
You're making this
about our shit now?

280
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,581
- This isn't about us.
- I agree.

281
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:34,662
It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult, okay?

282
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:36,623
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

283
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:41,128
Why don't you go
do your laundry?

284
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,676
That's great.
That's good.

285
00:24:57,071 --> 00:24:58,151
Okay.

286
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:06,449
- What is it?
- I don't know.

287
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,122
It's some place
that does a thing.

288
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,674
Good morning. Lacuna.

289
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,008
No, I'm sorry. That offer
expired after the New Year.

290
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:33,013
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

291
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,639
How about on the 5th?

292
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:37,354
That's a Wednesday.

293
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:40,153
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

294
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:43,193
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

295
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:47,072
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

296
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:49,195
May I help you?

297
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:51,572
- I'm Joel Barish.
- Excuse me?

298
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:54,493
I'm Joel Barish.

299
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,419
I have an appointment
with Doctor...

300
00:25:56,506 --> 00:25:59,840
Mierzwiak.
Here, can you please fill this out?

301
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,132
I just want to talk to him.

302
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,960
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.

303
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:04,761
- All right.
- Thank you.

304
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:08,764
I don't have a pen.

305
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,433
There's a pen right there.

306
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:13,637
Good morning. Lacuna.

307
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:16,014
Yeah, that offer,
that's done now.

308
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,895
That expired after the New Year.

309
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:19,480
Mr. Barish?

310
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:23,984
How are we today?

311
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:25,360
Not too good, actually.

312
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:28,243
Oh, my God! Stan!

313
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:29,910
Sorry, I was just...

314
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,159
I'm working.

315
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,497
- Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.

316
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:40,581
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.

317
00:26:45,763 --> 00:26:48,004
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem's...

318
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,931
- I assure you, no.
- No.

319
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,557
There's no such thing as this.

320
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:04,021
Look, our files are
confidential, Mr. Barish,

321
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:06,106
so I can't show you evidence.

322
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:07,694
Suffice it to say

323
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:11,449
that Miss Kruczynski
was not happy

324
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:13,989
and she wanted to move on.

325
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,912
<i>We provide that possibility.</i>

326
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,964
"We provide that possibility."

327
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:25,417
What the hell is that?

328
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:28,261
I'm the nicest guy
she ever went out with.

329
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,428
Fuck!

330
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:33,058
Rob, give it a rest!

331
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:34,384
It's okay.
It's all right.

332
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:36,686
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.

333
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:42,894
What can I say? You know,
Clementine's just like that.

334
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:44,819
She's impulsive.

335
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,148
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

336
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,569
A lark?

337
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,499
Why did you do that?

338
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:01,134
Don't. Wait.

339
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:02,545
Don't. Wait.

340
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:05,124
I'm sorry, Doctor,
he just barged right in here.

341
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:06,708
Okay. I want it done.

342
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:09,261
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time...

343
00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:11,384
That's okay, Mary.

344
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:12,714
But there are people waiting.

345
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:15,301
Mr. Barish,
if you'd like to come inside.

346
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,601
- If you'd take care of Mrs. Woo.
- Yes, of course.

347
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:19,099
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo.

348
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:29,155
The first thing we need
you to do, Mr. Barish,

349
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:33,031
<i>is to go home and collect
everything you own</i>

350
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:35,829
<i>that has some association
with Clementine.</i>

351
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,289
<i>Anything.</i>

352
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,418
<i>We'll use these items</i>

353
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:46,214
<i>to create a map of Clementine
in your brain, okay?</i>

354
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,419
<i>We'll need photos,</i>

355
00:28:50,888 --> 00:28:54,631
<i>clothing, gifts, books
she may have bought you,</i>

356
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:58,768
<i>CDs you may have bought
together, journal entries.</i>

357
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,896
<i>We want to empty your home,</i>

358
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,229
<i>we want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

359
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:07,485
<i>And after the mapping is done,</i>

360
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:10,906
<i>our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.</i>

361
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,950
<i>That way, when
you awake in the morning,</i>

362
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:16,824
<i>you'll find yourself
in your own bed</i>

363
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,998
<i>as if nothing had happened,
a new life awaiting you.</i>

364
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,087
Wake up, buddy!

365
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,887
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

366
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:38,847
You can't have the procedure
done three times in one month.

367
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:41,186
It's just not our policy here.

368
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:43,100
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?

369
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:45,769
Hello, I'm right here.

370
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:49,189
I know it's an emergency.
We'll do everything we can.

371
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,862
We can fit you in on March 1.

372
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:53,781
Maybe you could talk
to the doctor and...

373
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,656
All right, so let's make
an appointment.

374
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:58,703
What day would you like
to come in this week?

375
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,872
- Mr. Barish.
- He's really busy this afternoon.

376
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:05,251
Maybe tomorrow would be better,
around 12:15.

377
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:06,453
Can you do that?

378
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:10,423
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

379
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:21,810
This is Stan Fink, one of our most
experienced and skilled technicians.

380
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:25,935
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

381
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,107
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

382
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,856
My name is Joel Barish,

383
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:34,531
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

384
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:39,828
Very good.
Now tell me about Clementine.

385
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:46,710
I was living with this woman,
Naomi,

386
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:49,837
a couple years ago.

387
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,960
And my friends, Rob and Carrie,

388
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:53,792
<i>invited us to this party
at the beach.</i>

389
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,126
<i>I don't like parties.</i>

390
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:58,096
<i>Naomi couldn't go, but I went</i>

391
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,513
<i>and I met Clementine.</i>

392
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,935
I'm sorry.

393
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:08,185
We'll start with your
most recent memories

394
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:11,189
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

395
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:14,779
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories,

396
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,822
and when you eradicate
that core,

397
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:19,534
it starts its
degradation process.

398
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,703
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

399
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:25,783
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared.

400
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:27,958
As in a dream upon waking.

401
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:31,041
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

402
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,134
Technically speaking,
the procedure is brain damage.

403
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,338
But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

404
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:41,047
Nothing you'll miss.

405
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,385
Comfortable?

406
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:46,845
What we're doing here,
Mr. Barish,

407
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,557
is actually creating a map
of your brain.

408
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,482
Okay, let's get started.

409
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:53,857
If we want to get this procedure
underway tonight,

410
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,311
we have some work to do.

411
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:58,899
I want you to react to these
objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.

412
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,161
There's a good story
behind that...

413
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:07,616
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get
a much better emotional read-out

414
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,544
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

415
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:13,541
Just please try to focus
on the memories.

416
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:14,963
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:20,925
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy read-outs.

418
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:22,380
Very good.

419
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:24,257
Here's another object.

420
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,225
Next item.

421
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:31,769
Potato head.

422
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:33,099
Next item.

423
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:37,562
<i>Just focus on the memories.</i>

424
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:40,024
<i>Patrick, do me a favor.</i>

425
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,530
Patrick,
do me a favor, will you?

426
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:47,535
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What have we got there?

427
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,788
- Voltage looks fine.
- Really?

428
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,627
I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.

429
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:01,216
<i>Technically,
the procedure is brain damage.</i>

430
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:03,888
<i>But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.</i>

431
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,261
Check the connections, please.

432
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:09,973
There you are.

433
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:17,402
What am I...

434
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:20,150
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

435
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:23,074
Why am I standing here...

436
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:24,822
Oh, my God, déjà vu.

437
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:30,114
- This is so...
- We should get started.

438
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,496
If we want to get the procedure
underway tonight,

439
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:34,042
we have some work to do.

440
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,497
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

441
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:37,921
I suppose so.

442
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,625
This is about right.

443
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:43,002
This is what it would look like.

444
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:46,802
Very good.

445
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:50,019
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

446
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,594
That way you won't
be confused later

447
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:54,557
by their unexplainable
presence in your home.

448
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:56,691
There we go. Patrick?

449
00:33:58,696 --> 00:33:59,983
Patrick?

450
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:02,192
Patrick?

451
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,945
Why are there so many wires?

452
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:07,197
<i>Because we have
a lot of equipment.</i>

453
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:08,611
Does that help?

454
00:34:08,706 --> 00:34:11,414
<i>Are you sure you set
that thing up properly?</i>

455
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,576
<i>- How's that?</i>
- How are you today, Mr. Barish?

456
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:15,956
- There we are, Mr. Barish.
<i>- All right, that's better.</i>

457
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:17,167
I don't know if I like this.

458
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,339
I think I might try this then.

459
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:20,836
We're almost done now.

460
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:23,338
Your journal.
That'll be invaluable.

461
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:28,132
<i>I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.</i>

462
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:30,718
<i>Her name is Clementine
and she's amazing.</i>

463
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:32,817
Jesus!

464
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:35,730
- What?
- Come on, careful! Step back!

465
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,107
Just take it easy.

466
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:40,360
It's fine.

467
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,903
Let's not roach the guy.

468
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:47,780
All right.
We got that one.

469
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,953
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

470
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,825
It's an apartment, Patrick.

471
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,410
Well, not a dump then,
but sort of plain.

472
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:57,702
Uninspired.

473
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:00,754
And there's sort
of a stale smell.

474
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,377
Can we just please
get through this?

475
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,213
We've got a long night
ahead of us.

476
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:16,229
<i>This is the last time I saw you.</i>

477
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:33,368
It's 3:00.

478
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:38,002
I kind of,
sort of wrecked your car.

479
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,588
Driving drunk.
It's pathetic.

480
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,041
I was a little tipsy.

481
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,800
Don't call me pathetic!

482
00:35:46,888 --> 00:35:48,127
It is pathetic.

483
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:50,093
It's fucking irresponsible.

484
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:51,799
You could have killed somebody.

485
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:55,226
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?

486
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:58,771
Should I check the grille to see
if there's children or small animals?

487
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:01,895
It's just a fucking dent.
You're like an old lady or something.

488
00:36:01,986 --> 00:36:03,569
What are you like?

489
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:07,780
- A wino?
- A "wino"? Jesus.

490
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:11,281
Are you from the '50s
or something? A "wino"?

491
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:14,238
Face it, Joely.

492
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:18,166
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you.

493
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:21,169
And in your little, wormy brain,

494
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,167
you're trying to figure out,

495
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,879
"Did she fuck
someone tonight?"

496
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:30,674
Now, see, Clem, I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

497
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,557
Isn't that how you get
people to like you?

498
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,271
I'm sorry, okay?

499
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,028
Clem, I didn't mean it,
all right?

500
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:58,866
Your keys.
I won't need them anymore.

501
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:04,705
I was just angry or annoyed
or something. I don't know.

502
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:16,549
Got it.

503
00:37:18,146 --> 00:37:19,852
Mary's coming over tonight.

504
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:22,518
Just thought you'd want to know.

505
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,140
I like Mary.

506
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:26,943
I like when she comes to visit.
I don't think she likes me.

507
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,485
She likes you okay.

508
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:32,148
So maybe I should invite
my girlfriend over.

509
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:33,274
I have a girlfriend now.

510
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:34,826
Do whatever you want.

511
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:36,402
Did I tell you...

512
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:44,294
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

513
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,588
We gotta focus here, Patrick.

514
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,669
The thing is,

515
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:52,094
my situation is a little weird.

516
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:54,304
My girlfriend situation.

517
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:56,047
I'm sure it is.

518
00:37:57,018 --> 00:37:58,508
You've got to be...

519
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:26,290
Clem, let me drive you home.

520
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,212
Get out of my face, faggot!

521
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:32,750
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

522
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:35,424
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

523
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,801
You did it to me first!

524
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:41,597
I can't believe you did this to me!
God damn it!

525
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,345
Did you hear me?

526
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:47,315
By morning you'll be gone!

527
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:50,982
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

528
00:38:56,536 --> 00:38:59,449
<i>Is there something wrong with
a girl being attracted to me?</i>

529
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:02,406
<i>- Is that a problem?
- No, I think it's funny.</i>

530
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:05,917
<i>Who do you think's better-looking,
me or this guy?</i>

531
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:07,835
<i>Patrick, let's focus, buddy.</i>

532
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:10,748
<i>Remember that girl
we did last week?</i>

533
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:13,378
<i>The one with the potatoes?</i>

534
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,086
<i>That girl?</i>

535
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:18,764
<i>Yeah, that's this guy's girl.</i>

536
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:21,425
<i>Right, was.</i>

537
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,515
<i>We took care of that.</i>

538
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:29,606
I kind of fell in love
with her that night.

539
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:32,277
What? You little fuck.

540
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,353
What?

541
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,527
She was unconscious, man.

542
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,778
She was beautiful.

543
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:42,033
I stole a pair of her panties,
as well.

544
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:46,207
Jesus!

545
00:39:46,294 --> 00:39:49,002
What? It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.

546
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:51,420
Don't tell me this.
I don't want to hear this shit.

547
00:39:51,507 --> 00:39:54,124
<i>- They were clean.
- What? Don't. Stop.</i>

548
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:56,880
<i>- Okay, all right.
- We've got work to do.</i>

549
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,885
<i>Hold my papers.</i>

550
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:17,070
There's more.

551
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:24,621
After we did her,
I kind of asked her out.

552
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,291
<i>What?</i>

553
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:29,535
Jesus.

554
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:37,084
...how unethical...

555
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:39,920
It's not really that bad.

556
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:43,177
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

557
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:46,010
<i>Patrick, you stole
a girl's panties.</i>

558
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:00,114
There's someone here.

559
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:03,493
He stole your underwear.

560
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,787
I don't see anyone.

561
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:27,134
Joel, where are my boots?

562
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:29,811
<i>Now, why are you
showing me poisons?</i>

563
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:31,813
<i>Can't you understand English?</i>

564
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:34,187
<i>Potions, I said. Potions.</i>

565
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:43,156
<i>Love potion, please.</i>

566
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:46,657
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

567
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,083
I should have left you
at the flea market.

568
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:06,677
Want to go?

569
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:09,559
I want to have a baby.

570
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:13,059
Let's talk about it later.

571
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:15,686
No. I want to have a baby.

572
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:19,318
I don't think we're ready.

573
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,946
You're not ready.

574
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,242
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

575
00:42:27,038 --> 00:42:28,244
What?

576
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,406
I don't want to
talk about it here.

577
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,616
I can't hear you.

578
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,951
I can never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

579
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:36,832
I said I don't want to
talk about this!

580
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:39,130
We're fucking gonna
talk about it!

581
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:42,585
You can't just say that and say
you don't wanna talk about it.

582
00:42:42,678 --> 00:42:44,795
- I'm sorry.
- I'd make a fucking good mother.

583
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:46,300
I love children.

584
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,850
I'm creative, I'm smart, and
I'd make a fucking great mother!

585
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:51,222
It's you, Joel.

586
00:42:51,312 --> 00:42:52,692
It's you who can't
commit to anything.

587
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:53,886
It's going.

588
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:55,987
You've no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you.

589
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:59,401
I don't even know why I am.
Maybe I should end it right here!

590
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:03,321
Leave you at the flea market
with the stupid costume jewelry!

591
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:06,867
Maybe you can find a nice
antique rocking chair to die in!

592
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:18,328
- Hi, Patrick.
- Hi, Mary, how's it going?

593
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:20,039
- Hey, you.
- It's freezing outside.

594
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,339
Did you find us okay?

595
00:43:21,425 --> 00:43:22,416
Yeah.

596
00:43:27,348 --> 00:43:28,463
Hot.

597
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:31,556
Poor guy.

598
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:36,687
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

599
00:43:36,774 --> 00:43:39,311
We haven't checked yet.

600
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:43,486
Let me do the honors.

601
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:46,906
Mary hates me.

602
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:49,609
Never really had
much luck with the ladies.

603
00:43:49,704 --> 00:43:52,241
Maybe if you stopped
stealing their panties.

604
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:56,290
- There's more.
- No.

605
00:43:56,377 --> 00:43:57,617
- Yes.
- No.

606
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:04,549
You didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

607
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:06,751
No, I don't know.
That's okay.

608
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:09,508
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful,

609
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,512
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

610
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:24,686
That's Nietzsche.

611
00:44:24,906 --> 00:44:27,694
<i>Beyond Good and Evil.</i>
I found it in my <i>Bartlett's</i>.

612
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:30,615
What's your <i>Bartlett's</i>?

613
00:44:31,078 --> 00:44:32,568
It's a quote book, Patrick.

614
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:34,788
It's a book of quotations.

615
00:44:34,874 --> 00:44:37,411
I think Howard will be
in <i>Bartlett's</i> one day.

616
00:44:37,502 --> 00:44:39,208
Definitely.
Howard is pure <i>Bartlett's</i>.

617
00:44:43,341 --> 00:44:45,048
Can you wake him up?

618
00:44:45,134 --> 00:44:46,420
You can't wake him up.

619
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:57,640
You don't tell me things, Joel.

620
00:44:59,357 --> 00:45:01,143
I'm an open book.

621
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:04,149
I tell you everything.

622
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:07,358
Every damn embarrassing thing.

623
00:45:10,451 --> 00:45:12,192
You don't trust me.

624
00:45:12,703 --> 00:45:15,991
Constantly talking isn't
necessarily communicating.

625
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,367
I don't do that.

626
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,997
I want to know you.

627
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,968
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus.

628
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:35,716
People have to share things,
Joel.

629
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:39,185
That's what intimacy is.

630
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:42,518
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

631
00:45:42,608 --> 00:45:43,939
I'm sorry.

632
00:45:45,236 --> 00:45:47,568
My life just isn't
that interesting.

633
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:51,740
<i>I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.</i>

634
00:45:51,826 --> 00:45:56,366
<i>What do you write if you don't have
any thoughts or passions or love?</i>

635
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,752
<i>November 19, 2003.</i>

636
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:10,834
<i>Dinner at Kang's again.</i>

637
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:15,801
<i>Are we like those poor couples</i>

638
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:19,385
<i>you feel sorry for
in restaurants?</i>

639
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:21,595
<i>Are we the dining dead?</i>

640
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:26,479
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

641
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,237
I like that.

642
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:36,985
How's the chicken?

643
00:46:37,663 --> 00:46:38,778
Good.

644
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,957
- More?
- No, thank you.

645
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:48,625
<i>She's going to be
drunk and stupid now.</i>

646
00:46:49,258 --> 00:46:52,796
Would you do me a favor and clean
the goddamn hair off the soap

647
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:54,423
when you're done in the shower?

648
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:56,220
- It's really...
- Yeah.

649
00:46:56,557 --> 00:46:58,264
- It's gross.
- Gross.

650
00:47:00,311 --> 00:47:03,053
- I think it's just...
- Repulsive.

651
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:04,763
It's repulsive.

652
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:12,979
Patrick,
can we get through this?

653
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:15,736
<i>Hey, Tangerine.</i>

654
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,986
<i>Patrick, it's you.</i>

655
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:22,369
<i>I'm so miserable right now.</i>

656
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:24,578
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

657
00:47:24,669 --> 00:47:27,913
<i>I don't know. I'm just
confused about everything.</i>

658
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:30,167
<i>Confused?</i>

659
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:33,341
<i>What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.</i>

660
00:47:41,644 --> 00:47:42,679
<i>Do you love me?</i>

661
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,135
<i>Of course I do.</i>

662
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,062
Where's the self-help section?

663
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:48,602
<i>Do you think I'm ugly?</i>

664
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:50,400
<i>No. You're beautiful.</i>

665
00:47:51,028 --> 00:47:54,362
<i>- Maybe I should come over.
- No. I don't know.</i>

666
00:47:54,657 --> 00:47:56,523
<i>I'm a mess, Patrick.</i>

667
00:47:57,952 --> 00:48:00,193
<i>Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.</i>

668
00:48:00,288 --> 00:48:01,403
<i>Okay.</i>

669
00:48:01,664 --> 00:48:04,703
Can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

670
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:08,126
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

671
00:48:08,212 --> 00:48:10,624
Let him go, Stan.
I'll help.

672
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:13,832
- See?
- How hard can it be?

673
00:48:13,926 --> 00:48:15,543
She hates me.
She wants me to go.

674
00:48:15,636 --> 00:48:16,797
Go.

675
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:20,384
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

676
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:21,885
You like?

677
00:48:25,897 --> 00:48:27,978
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

678
00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:29,305
- I like it.
- You do?

679
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,141
You look like a tangerine.

680
00:48:31,986 --> 00:48:34,398
Clementine the tangerine.

681
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:36,608
Juicy and seedless.

682
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:37,780
I like that.

683
00:48:39,827 --> 00:48:41,818
I like tangerines.

684
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:43,988
Can you see me doing ducks?

685
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:45,113
Tangerine.

686
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:48,666
How does he know
to call you that?

687
00:48:48,753 --> 00:48:50,165
How did who know?

688
00:48:50,254 --> 00:48:52,837
- Oh, my God. Clem?
- This is pretty cool.

689
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:54,414
That's what
they called themselves.

690
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:57,091
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

691
00:48:57,178 --> 00:48:59,466
And they called themselves
that for a reason.

692
00:48:59,555 --> 00:49:01,593
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Like social justice.

693
00:49:01,682 --> 00:49:03,218
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

694
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,597
What Howard gives to the world.

695
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:08,353
Yeah.

696
00:49:09,106 --> 00:49:11,097
To let people begin again.

697
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:14,567
It's beautiful.

698
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:18,022
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free

699
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:20,402
and so clean.

700
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,698
Adults are this mess of sadness

701
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:27,117
and phobias.

702
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:29,407
And Howard
just makes it all go away.

703
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:44,547
Baby, what's going on?

704
00:49:44,642 --> 00:49:46,383
I don't know.

705
00:49:46,477 --> 00:49:50,141
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.

706
00:49:50,439 --> 00:49:53,057
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!

707
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,390
Nothing makes any sense to me!

708
00:49:54,485 --> 00:49:55,817
You're not getting old.

709
00:49:55,903 --> 00:49:59,066
Nothing makes any sense.

710
00:49:59,198 --> 00:50:00,563
Tangerine.

711
00:50:03,953 --> 00:50:05,285
It's okay.

712
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:08,200
Let's go out dancing.

713
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,618
You want to go out
to Montauk with me?

714
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,950
Montauk?

715
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:13,910
No, come up to Boston with me.

716
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:15,790
Sure. We can go next weekend.

717
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:19,420
No, now. I have to go now.

718
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,502
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

719
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:27,048
<i>Hi, it's Joel.</i>

720
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:33,435
<i>Leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.</i>

721
00:50:34,942 --> 00:50:37,104
<i>Pick up.</i>

722
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:44,778
Hello? What's up?

723
00:50:45,203 --> 00:50:47,695
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

724
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:50,826
Can you handle things tonight
alone? I'm really sorry.

725
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:53,620
Don't worry about it.
I've got it under control.

726
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:55,793
He's pretty much
on auto-pilot now, anyway.

727
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,463
<i>Thanks.
I owe you big-time.</i>

728
00:50:57,548 --> 00:50:58,959
Dude, I got to go.

729
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:15,556
Look. You and me
on the Charles River.

730
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,608
I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.

731
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,313
I've never felt that before.
I'm exactly where I want...

732
00:51:23,574 --> 00:51:25,235
I'm so excited.

733
00:51:25,326 --> 00:51:26,783
I'm excited, too.

734
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:28,031
Cool.

735
00:51:31,415 --> 00:51:34,749
I got you this thing.

736
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:39,370
- Happy early Valentine's Day.
- Thank you.

737
00:51:43,052 --> 00:51:44,509
What is it?

738
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:46,006
I don't know. Open it up.

739
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,395
It's gorgeous.

740
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:58,064
- You like it?
- It's just my taste, really.

741
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:02,478
God, I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me jewelry I liked.

742
00:52:03,614 --> 00:52:04,900
Thank you.

743
00:52:12,832 --> 00:52:14,118
- Let's go.
- Okay.

744
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:17,450
- Joely?
- Yeah, Tangerine?

745
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,460
Am I ugly?

746
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:25,250
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.

747
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:29,384
Can't believe
I'm crying already.

748
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:31,635
Sometimes I think

749
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:34,888
people don't understand
how lonely it is to be a kid.

750
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:37,895
Like you don't matter.

751
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:41,688
So, I'm eight,

752
00:52:41,777 --> 00:52:45,145
and I have these toys,
these dolls.

753
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:50,326
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

754
00:52:51,287 --> 00:52:53,153
And I keep yelling at her,

755
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:56,072
"You can't be ugly.
Be pretty."

756
00:52:57,376 --> 00:53:00,664
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,

757
00:53:02,548 --> 00:53:04,789
I would magically change, too.

758
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:11,838
You're pretty.

759
00:53:13,684 --> 00:53:15,140
Don't ever leave me.

760
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:16,513
You're pretty.

761
00:53:19,816 --> 00:53:22,978
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

762
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:24,309
Just this one.

763
00:53:25,363 --> 00:53:27,775
I don't want to hold
your hand. Come on.

764
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:32,909
Stop it!

765
00:53:35,456 --> 00:53:37,367
I could die right now.

766
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,875
I'm just so happy.

767
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:49,500
I've never felt that before.

768
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:54,555
I'm just exactly

769
00:53:57,645 --> 00:53:59,306
where I want to be.

770
00:54:08,948 --> 00:54:12,361
I want to call it off.
I'll give you a sign.

771
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:20,032
I want to call it off.

772
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:26,125
Can you hear me? I don't want
this anymore! I want to call it off!

773
00:54:33,264 --> 00:54:35,756
Is anybody there?

774
00:54:53,117 --> 00:54:55,199
- What?
- We've got to go.

775
00:54:55,286 --> 00:54:58,323
- Where?
- I have an idea of how to stop this.

776
00:54:58,414 --> 00:54:59,655
Stop what?

777
00:55:05,463 --> 00:55:07,373
<i>Don't tickle me. No.</i>

778
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:09,297
<i>Smell my pits!</i>

779
00:55:10,301 --> 00:55:11,962
Concentrate, Clem.

780
00:55:13,137 --> 00:55:15,470
<i>- We have to get back to the office.
- Halloween.</i>

781
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:18,299
<i>There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.</i>

782
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:23,061
Back here. Come on.

783
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:26,685
<i>Look at me.
I want to go there.</i>

784
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:31,232
<i>Our files are confidential,
so I can't show you evidence.</i>

785
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:35,441
<i>Suffice it to say
that Miss Kruczynski</i>

786
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:38,993
<i>was not happy and
she wanted to move on.</i>

787
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:41,788
<i>Tell me about...</i>

788
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:44,958
<i>Tell me everything you remember.
That's what he said.</i>

789
00:55:45,044 --> 00:55:47,000
<i>What did we see that day?</i>

790
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:50,877
- We're going to see my grandma.
- Shit!

791
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,463
<i>- Joel, why...
- No. We're not going on a train.</i>

792
00:55:53,553 --> 00:55:55,714
<i>Joel, please.
Don't make me run anymore.</i>

793
00:55:55,805 --> 00:55:57,091
<i>Come on.</i>

794
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:58,172
<i>Mierzwiak!</i>

795
00:55:59,433 --> 00:56:01,471
<i>Do we always have to run?</i>

796
00:56:12,196 --> 00:56:13,358
Please?

797
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:19,151
Why don't we begin by you telling me
everything you can remember...

798
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:22,033
Mierzwiak, wake me up!

799
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:28,122
I'm sorry, Mr. Barish, I thought
you understood what was going on.

800
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:32,797
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her.

801
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:41,674
You got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

802
00:56:42,727 --> 00:56:44,057
I'm in my brain.

803
00:56:44,145 --> 00:56:47,478
I'm part of
your imagination, too.

804
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:50,431
How can I help you from there?

805
00:56:50,526 --> 00:56:53,394
I'm inside your head, too.
I'm you.

806
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:57,612
Sorry.

807
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:59,278
Look, who's that?

808
00:56:59,786 --> 00:57:02,118
He works for us.

809
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:06,574
That's Patrick,

810
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:08,701
baby boy.

811
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:12,917
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.

812
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:17,835
He's seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

813
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:19,840
He stole her underwear.

814
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,257
Jesus Christ.
He stole her underwear.

815
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,221
I could die right now, Clem.

816
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:27,760
I'm just happy.

817
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:31,105
I've never felt that before.

818
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:33,183
I'm exactly where I want to be.

819
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:37,316
I want to go home.

820
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:40,565
What?

821
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:47,905
Wait, Clem.

822
00:57:50,294 --> 00:57:52,956
Clem, they're erasing you.

823
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,671
Over here!

824
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:57,874
Clem, focus.

825
00:57:58,052 --> 00:58:00,885
I hired them, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.

826
00:58:00,972 --> 00:58:03,964
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

827
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:07,642
I need it to stop before I wake up
and don't know you anymore.

828
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:12,973
Just tell them
to cancel it then.

829
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:15,192
What the hell are you
talking about?

830
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:16,977
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.

831
00:58:17,822 --> 00:58:19,233
Wake yourself up!

832
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:21,406
Okay, you want me
to wake up? All right.

833
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:23,859
Okay, here we go.
Will it make you happy if I try?

834
00:58:23,953 --> 00:58:25,569
- Yeah.
- I'll try really hard.

835
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,121
Here we go.
That was a great idea.

836
00:58:30,835 --> 00:58:33,042
That's working like gangbusters.

837
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:36,169
Don't!
That tickles me!

838
00:58:37,758 --> 00:58:40,295
- What the hell is that?
- It's a birthmark!

839
00:58:43,514 --> 00:58:45,505
It did work, for a second.

840
00:58:46,851 --> 00:58:48,433
- But I couldn't...
- See?

841
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:50,055
I couldn't move.

842
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:54,268
Isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

843
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:56,895
It's more important to prove me
wrong than to actually...

844
00:58:56,986 --> 00:58:59,898
I don't want to discuss this
right now, okay?

845
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:01,104
Fine.

846
00:59:03,284 --> 00:59:06,402
Then what? I'm listening.

847
00:59:06,537 --> 00:59:08,619
I don't know.
You erased me.

848
00:59:08,706 --> 00:59:11,289
That's why I'm here
and doing this.

849
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:15,206
I'm sorry.
You know me, I'm impulsive.

850
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:21,716
That's what I love about you.

851
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,387
I have another idea
for this problem.

852
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:32,302
This is a memory of me.

853
00:59:32,396 --> 00:59:34,809
The way you wanted
to have sex on the couch

854
00:59:34,899 --> 00:59:37,266
after you look down
at my crotch.

855
00:59:38,653 --> 00:59:40,768
The eraser guys are coming,

856
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:43,192
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

857
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:44,989
somewhere where I don't belong,

858
00:59:45,409 --> 00:59:46,866
and we hide there till morning?

859
00:59:53,918 --> 00:59:56,159
I can't remember anything
without you.

860
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,088
- That's very sweet, but try, okay?
- Okay.

861
01:00:08,724 --> 01:00:12,764
<i>Row, row, row your boat,
gently down the stream</i>

862
01:00:13,729 --> 01:00:17,348
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream</i>

863
01:00:26,117 --> 01:00:29,404
It's working.
I'm a genius.

864
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:59,139
Where did you go?

865
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,733
I'm supposed to come, too!

866
01:01:01,819 --> 01:01:03,355
I'm just gonna go
get a salad bowl.

867
01:01:03,446 --> 01:01:05,159
Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

868
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:06,775
He likes to be near me.

869
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:08,607
Absolutely.

870
01:01:09,202 --> 01:01:12,786
It worked.
My God, look at this.

871
01:01:13,664 --> 01:01:15,530
It worked!

872
01:01:16,209 --> 01:01:17,745
Look at this dress, man.

873
01:01:19,504 --> 01:01:20,744
I wish I could take it with me.

874
01:01:23,257 --> 01:01:25,373
- Who am I?
- Mrs. Hamlyn.

875
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:26,625
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

876
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:29,381
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

877
01:01:29,806 --> 01:01:33,015
Found the salad bowl.
I'm serving salad and string beans.

878
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,934
Is he okay under there?
Honey, are you all right?

879
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,227
I feel like I could
clean up all clay.

880
01:01:38,314 --> 01:01:41,147
Would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?

881
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:44,352
No, not at all.
God, I love this kitchen.

882
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:46,356
Thank you so much.

883
01:01:46,781 --> 01:01:49,318
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.

884
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:54,537
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

885
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:56,279
Oh, baby Joel.

886
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:59,533
Is every little peanut
under there okay?

887
01:01:59,627 --> 01:02:00,913
He's fine.

888
01:02:01,003 --> 01:02:02,710
Do you have something to drink?

889
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:05,255
How about a cocktail?
I know it's not 5:00...

890
01:02:05,341 --> 01:02:06,456
I would die for a vodka.

891
01:02:06,551 --> 01:02:08,041
Let me check if I have that.

892
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:09,877
Okay, I'm just going
to wait right here.

893
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:12,963
No, sweetie. Joely?

894
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:16,220
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.

895
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,345
Ice cream.

896
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:21,145
No, not until after
you've had your dinner.

897
01:02:21,232 --> 01:02:24,816
Come on! Grow up.

898
01:02:24,944 --> 01:02:26,480
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God.

899
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:28,983
No, I'm right here.
This is sort of warped.

900
01:02:29,073 --> 01:02:31,656
I'm scared.
I want my mommy.

901
01:02:31,742 --> 01:02:34,905
Don't cry, baby Joel.
It's okay.

902
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:41,124
Joel, stop it! I think it's working.
We're hidden, Joel. Look!

903
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:42,872
Honey, look.

904
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:45,127
Wait there.

905
01:02:49,135 --> 01:02:52,503
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

906
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,559
Yuck.

907
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:54,339
Yuck.

908
01:02:58,227 --> 01:03:00,468
- It stopped.
- What?

909
01:03:01,606 --> 01:03:03,313
It stopped erasing.

910
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:07,442
Oh, shit!
This is terrible.

911
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:12,230
He's off the map.

912
01:03:12,325 --> 01:03:15,784
- Where?
- I don't know where.

913
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,863
This is very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

914
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:25,786
Crap! What did we do?
What do I do?

915
01:03:25,922 --> 01:03:28,380
- What shall we do?
- I don't know what to do.

916
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:31,709
- What shall we do?
- I just said, I don't know.

917
01:03:31,803 --> 01:03:33,384
I'm sorry.
What shall we do?

918
01:03:33,471 --> 01:03:36,680
I don't know. Mellow out.
You're freaking me out.

919
01:03:36,766 --> 01:03:40,805
We have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

920
01:03:40,937 --> 01:03:45,147
- Quiet. You're freaking me out.
- All gooey and half-baked.

921
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:48,850
That sounds so good.
I'm hungry.

922
01:03:49,028 --> 01:03:51,565
Oh, shit. What?

923
01:03:53,157 --> 01:03:54,693
We should call Howard.

924
01:03:54,784 --> 01:03:58,573
No way. No sir, man.
This is my... I can handle this.

925
01:03:58,663 --> 01:04:00,529
You can't call Howard.

926
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,915
There's no time to fuck around.

927
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:06,242
I've got this under control.
What are you talking about?

928
01:04:06,337 --> 01:04:07,452
Stop fucking around.

929
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:08,707
Okay. I'll call Howard.

930
01:04:16,848 --> 01:04:17,882
Hello?

931
01:04:17,974 --> 01:04:22,309
Howard, it's Stan. I'm working
on this guy down here.

932
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:24,011
We've lost him for a moment,

933
01:04:24,856 --> 01:04:27,267
and I can't bring him back up.

934
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:30,896
Okay, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

935
01:04:30,987 --> 01:04:34,275
I wasn't sure because I was away
from the monitor for a minute,

936
01:04:34,365 --> 01:04:38,154
and I had it on auto-pilot
because I had to pee.

937
01:04:38,244 --> 01:04:39,905
<i>Where was Patrick?</i>

938
01:04:40,037 --> 01:04:42,574
He had to go home sick.

939
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:46,624
What's the address?

940
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:47,746
<i>I know, I'm so sorry.</i>

941
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:48,998
That's okay. Come on.

942
01:04:49,088 --> 01:04:51,250
<i>We're at 159 South Village.</i>

943
01:04:51,591 --> 01:04:54,378
<i>Apartment 1-E.
Rockville Center.</i>

944
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,672
Mary, he's coming right now.

945
01:04:56,888 --> 01:04:57,877
I'm staying.

946
01:04:59,056 --> 01:05:01,047
Get your stuff, Mary.

947
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:02,890
I think you should go.

948
01:05:03,227 --> 01:05:04,263
No.

949
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,480
I am so stoned.

950
01:05:09,567 --> 01:05:12,650
Please, Mary, you have to go.

951
01:05:12,737 --> 01:05:16,105
Stop being stoned.
I don't want him to see me stoned.

952
01:05:17,074 --> 01:05:21,159
You have no idea how much trouble
I'll get into if Howard comes...

953
01:05:21,454 --> 01:05:24,321
Joel, stop. Look.

954
01:05:30,755 --> 01:05:34,749
I want her to pick me up.
Weird how strong that desire is.

955
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:38,005
Joel, look at me.
You'll remember me in the morning,

956
01:05:38,095 --> 01:05:41,930
you'll come to me, you'll tell me
about us, and we'll start over.

957
01:05:43,392 --> 01:05:46,476
Pat? I thought we could
have a little cocktail.

958
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:49,270
That Patrick guy,
he's copying me.

959
01:05:49,357 --> 01:05:50,813
What Patrick guy?

960
01:05:50,983 --> 01:05:52,690
- That guy.
- What?

961
01:05:52,777 --> 01:05:54,814
He's here, in my apartment.

962
01:05:54,904 --> 01:05:58,113
One of the eraser guys. He fell
for you when they were doing you,

963
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:02,158
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

964
01:06:02,537 --> 01:06:04,743
- and you guys are dating.
- Really?

965
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:06,863
Is he cute?

966
01:06:09,377 --> 01:06:11,493
There's nothing wrong with you.

967
01:06:11,587 --> 01:06:14,626
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

968
01:06:15,842 --> 01:06:18,800
You're kind, beautiful,

969
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:24,219
smart, funny, and nice.

970
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:26,386
What?

971
01:06:28,062 --> 01:06:29,644
Okay, all right.

972
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,943
- Move. Come on, let's go.
- Careful.

973
01:06:38,948 --> 01:06:40,655
I'm still stoned.

974
01:06:41,909 --> 01:06:44,697
Those eye drops
you gave me didn't do shit.

975
01:06:49,459 --> 01:06:50,744
Be cool.

976
01:06:55,506 --> 01:06:57,338
Hello, Mary,
what are you doing here?

977
01:06:57,425 --> 01:06:59,133
Hi, Howard. She was
just here to help out.

978
01:06:59,218 --> 01:07:02,461
I wanted to understand as much
about the procedure as possible.

979
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,891
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings

980
01:07:06,976 --> 01:07:08,592
of the work that we do.

981
01:07:08,686 --> 01:07:11,975
Not that I do,
but the work that is done

982
01:07:12,064 --> 01:07:13,930
by people where I also work.

983
01:07:14,025 --> 01:07:15,561
The work of my colleagues.

984
01:07:16,777 --> 01:07:20,567
Let's see if we can get
to the bottom of this, shall we?

985
01:07:26,245 --> 01:07:27,281
That's odd.

986
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:28,827
I already tried that.

987
01:07:28,915 --> 01:07:30,128
You tried going
through the C-gate?

988
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:32,040
Of course.

989
01:07:32,293 --> 01:07:34,330
I mean, yes.

990
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:40,373
All right.

991
01:07:42,678 --> 01:07:45,045
- You want to get linked up?
- Yeah.

992
01:07:47,183 --> 01:07:50,972
I ran the utility programs,
and I had nothing there,

993
01:07:51,062 --> 01:07:54,520
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

994
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:57,811
- Here, Howard, I got you a chair.
- Thank you.

995
01:07:57,902 --> 01:08:00,065
There you go.
You're welcome.

996
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:02,562
All right.
I've got it.

997
01:08:02,657 --> 01:08:05,398
I'll go through
the entire memory,

998
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:06,783
see if something comes up.

999
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,202
I love being bathed in the sink.

1000
01:08:16,504 --> 01:08:18,290
Such a feeling of security.

1001
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,753
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.

1002
01:08:22,677 --> 01:08:24,088
There it is.

1003
01:08:24,387 --> 01:08:27,674
I don't understand why
it's off the map like that.

1004
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,217
What the heck
was he doing there?

1005
01:08:40,486 --> 01:08:41,851
His eyes are open.

1006
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:47,156
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.

1007
01:08:48,202 --> 01:08:50,614
This is not good.

1008
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,492
I'm going to have
to give him this.

1009
01:09:20,318 --> 01:09:23,184
<i>Can't you see
I love you, Antoine?</i>

1010
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:25,813
Okay, we're back in.

1011
01:09:28,117 --> 01:09:32,988
That was beautiful to watch, Howard,
like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

1012
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:36,991
Thank you, Mary.

1013
01:09:37,752 --> 01:09:40,995
Howard, you should get some sleep.
I think I'll be fine now.

1014
01:09:41,088 --> 01:09:44,707
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1015
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,968
Lucky me. Lay one on me.

1016
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:56,851
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.

1017
01:09:56,938 --> 01:10:00,396
Yes, I know, but how can a woman
love a man with a name like Wally?

1018
01:10:01,609 --> 01:10:03,066
What was that?

1019
01:10:03,194 --> 01:10:05,777
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1020
01:10:05,863 --> 01:10:07,103
There is?

1021
01:10:09,534 --> 01:10:10,615
Got it.

1022
01:10:10,952 --> 01:10:14,819
Tangerine! Come on.
We've got to go.

1023
01:10:14,914 --> 01:10:17,120
Go on. Please go.

1024
01:10:20,253 --> 01:10:22,368
You can run, but you can't hide.

1025
01:10:22,922 --> 01:10:24,287
Clem, come on!

1026
01:10:25,299 --> 01:10:26,290
<i>There I am.</i>

1027
01:10:28,261 --> 01:10:29,421
That truck.

1028
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:32,220
Doc? Please!

1029
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:38,595
<i>Let's begin by you telling me
everything you remember...</i>

1030
01:10:39,564 --> 01:10:42,806
That's strange. He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1031
01:10:44,485 --> 01:10:47,820
At least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1032
01:10:48,156 --> 01:10:49,316
Come on, Clem.

1033
01:10:49,407 --> 01:10:52,115
<i>He's developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.</i>

1034
01:10:52,201 --> 01:10:54,033
I don't want to run anymore.

1035
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:55,568
Shit.

1036
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:58,371
Come on.

1037
01:10:58,458 --> 01:11:00,824
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1038
01:11:00,918 --> 01:11:03,580
- Where?
- Hide me in your humiliation.

1039
01:11:04,672 --> 01:11:05,707
Humiliation.

1040
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:07,665
<i>Come on, you big baby.</i>

1041
01:11:16,225 --> 01:11:17,261
No!

1042
01:11:18,603 --> 01:11:20,810
- Bye, Howard.
- Wait.

1043
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:23,764
He's disappeared again.

1044
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:25,352
Oh, dear.

1045
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:28,518
I'm so sorry, Howard.

1046
01:11:29,113 --> 01:11:30,478
Humiliation.

1047
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:40,788
I don't like it, either. I'm trying
to find horrible secret places to...

1048
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,865
Honey, I have a surprise.

1049
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,833
You know what?
I'll just ask you in the morning.

1050
01:11:47,924 --> 01:11:48,913
Good night.

1051
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,133
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

1052
01:11:56,682 --> 01:11:57,889
Look.

1053
01:12:00,102 --> 01:12:03,141
Joel, look where we are.

1054
01:12:07,318 --> 01:12:08,558
This isn't good.

1055
01:12:08,653 --> 01:12:12,317
Then hide me somewhere
really buried.

1056
01:12:13,407 --> 01:12:15,445
Hit it, Joel!

1057
01:12:15,535 --> 01:12:19,823
I can't, I've got to go home.
I'll do it later!

1058
01:12:39,517 --> 01:12:41,257
He has a girlfriend.

1059
01:12:41,352 --> 01:12:45,310
Wait, what am I doing?
Freddy, you don't scare me anymore.

1060
01:12:48,442 --> 01:12:50,775
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.

1061
01:12:50,862 --> 01:12:52,944
They're not worth it, Joel.

1062
01:12:54,323 --> 01:12:55,984
He's not listening!
Come on.

1063
01:12:56,075 --> 01:12:57,486
Stupid!

1064
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:05,783
<i>I'm so ashamed.</i>

1065
01:13:05,877 --> 01:13:10,461
<i>It's okay. You were a little kid.
Come on.</i>

1066
01:13:10,673 --> 01:13:12,538
<i>That's where I live, lived.</i>

1067
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,667
<i>I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.</i>

1068
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,219
<i>Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.</i>

1069
01:13:17,305 --> 01:13:19,591
<i>You can really kill me
this time. It's my turn. Go.</i>

1070
01:13:19,682 --> 01:13:22,219
<i>You're really going to die,
though, okay?</i>

1071
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:23,640
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1072
01:13:23,728 --> 01:13:24,968
<i>You're dead.</i>

1073
01:13:26,564 --> 01:13:27,929
<i>My mom.</i>

1074
01:13:28,191 --> 01:13:31,308
<i>It's okay, we're playing.
It's not real.</i>

1075
01:13:31,402 --> 01:13:32,563
<i>He's killing me.</i>

1076
01:13:32,653 --> 01:13:35,646
<i>Are you dead yet?
You're dead!</i>

1077
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:39,991
I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it,

1078
01:13:40,077 --> 01:13:42,069
but I'm finding him
quickly enough.

1079
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:21,365
Are you okay?

1080
01:14:25,456 --> 01:14:29,620
Oh, my God, that was terrible.
Almost three seconds.

1081
01:14:30,128 --> 01:14:31,334
Let's do it one more time.

1082
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:32,952
One more and then I get to go.

1083
01:14:47,562 --> 01:14:48,768
This is so cool!

1084
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:50,687
Look out!

1085
01:14:54,777 --> 01:14:56,142
It's fluff.

1086
01:14:57,488 --> 01:14:58,899
Our house.

1087
01:15:04,162 --> 01:15:06,119
Wait, we've got to go.

1088
01:15:08,332 --> 01:15:09,868
Come on.

1089
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,167
This is a really bad time
for this.

1090
01:15:22,346 --> 01:15:24,213
I don't even know
where we're going.

1091
01:15:24,307 --> 01:15:26,764
It's going to be fun.
It's the best place.

1092
01:15:26,851 --> 01:15:29,639
- No, this way.
- This way. Come on.

1093
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:32,353
You're no help at all.

1094
01:15:34,317 --> 01:15:35,523
Come on.

1095
01:15:36,194 --> 01:15:37,980
Let go of me, Joel.

1096
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:53,458
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1097
01:15:57,924 --> 01:16:02,167
I guess I'll go out
for some air,

1098
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:04,047
if nobody minds.

1099
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:07,798
It looks like you have
everything under control here.

1100
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,843
Yeah, that's fine.

1101
01:16:22,156 --> 01:16:24,272
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1102
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:27,116
What do you mean?

1103
01:16:27,203 --> 01:16:29,364
Like famous quotes.

1104
01:16:30,331 --> 01:16:32,618
I find reading them
inspirational,

1105
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:37,579
and in my reading, I've come across
some I thought you might like, too.

1106
01:16:38,631 --> 01:16:40,213
I'd love to hear some.

1107
01:16:40,299 --> 01:16:43,337
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful,

1108
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:46,341
for they get the better
even of their blunders".

1109
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,172
- That's Nietzsche, right?
- Yeah.

1110
01:16:48,266 --> 01:16:50,553
I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

1111
01:16:50,643 --> 01:16:54,602
No, it's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1112
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,976
There's this other one I like.

1113
01:16:58,067 --> 01:16:59,774
It's by Pope Alexander
and it goes...

1114
01:17:00,528 --> 01:17:02,144
Alexander Pope?

1115
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:04,104
Oh, yeah. Shit.

1116
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:08,279
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"

1117
01:17:08,369 --> 01:17:10,906
and sound like a dope,
and then I go ahead and say it.

1118
01:17:10,997 --> 01:17:13,955
- It's no big deal.
- You're such a sweetheart.

1119
01:17:16,419 --> 01:17:20,037
The quote goes, "How happy
is the blameless vestal's lot!"

1120
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:24,337
<i>"The world forgetting
by the world forgot"</i>

1121
01:17:25,428 --> 01:17:27,885
<i>"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind!"</i>

1122
01:17:28,973 --> 01:17:32,716
<i>"Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned."</i>

1123
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:37,225
I want to be a great,
big, huge elephant.

1124
01:17:38,232 --> 01:17:40,473
With a huge trunk like that.

1125
01:17:44,822 --> 01:17:47,439
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1126
01:17:47,825 --> 01:17:50,442
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1127
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:57,790
I really admire the work you do.

1128
01:17:59,253 --> 01:18:00,466
I don't mean to be
so familiar...

1129
01:18:00,546 --> 01:18:03,629
It's fine.
I'm happy to hear...

1130
01:18:10,014 --> 01:18:11,379
I'm sorry.

1131
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:17,890
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1132
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:22,352
I shouldn't have said that.

1133
01:18:22,443 --> 01:18:25,435
Mary, you're a wonderful girl.

1134
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:30,698
But, you know,
I have a wife and kids.

1135
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:38,952
Mary, we can't do this.

1136
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,767
Good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1137
01:19:07,405 --> 01:19:09,442
- What? Who is it?
- Oh, my God.

1138
01:19:23,254 --> 01:19:25,336
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1139
01:19:30,761 --> 01:19:32,798
Hollis!

1140
01:19:36,267 --> 01:19:37,382
Wait.

1141
01:19:39,312 --> 01:19:40,768
I knew it, Howard.

1142
01:19:40,855 --> 01:19:43,222
It didn't start out like this.
I came here to work.

1143
01:19:43,316 --> 01:19:45,523
This is a one-time mistake.

1144
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:47,692
I'm a stupid girl with a crush.

1145
01:19:47,778 --> 01:19:50,110
I basically forced him into it.

1146
01:19:51,491 --> 01:19:53,948
Don't be a monster.
Tell the girl.

1147
01:19:57,079 --> 01:19:58,535
Tell me what?

1148
01:19:59,123 --> 01:20:00,784
Oh, you poor kid.

1149
01:20:02,627 --> 01:20:05,710
You can have him.
You did.

1150
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:17,805
What?

1151
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,772
We have a history.

1152
01:20:31,823 --> 01:20:34,905
I'm sorry.
You wanted the procedure.

1153
01:20:36,911 --> 01:20:41,496
You wanted it done
so you could get past...

1154
01:20:49,173 --> 01:20:53,633
I have to finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.

1155
01:20:55,805 --> 01:20:59,265
We'll talk later, okay?

1156
01:21:17,827 --> 01:21:19,944
Let me give you a lift home.

1157
01:21:35,553 --> 01:21:39,013
Didn't figure you'd show
your face around me again.

1158
01:21:39,891 --> 01:21:42,882
I thought you were humiliated.

1159
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,801
You did run away, after all.

1160
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,312
I just needed to see you.

1161
01:21:47,398 --> 01:21:48,479
Yeah?

1162
01:21:50,109 --> 01:21:51,770
I'd like to

1163
01:21:52,862 --> 01:21:54,648
take you out or something.

1164
01:21:56,073 --> 01:21:57,563
You're married.

1165
01:21:58,326 --> 01:22:00,533
Not yet. Not married.

1166
01:22:01,496 --> 01:22:03,202
No, I'm not married.

1167
01:22:03,372 --> 01:22:06,910
Look, I'm telling you right off the bat,
I'm high maintenance,

1168
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:10,665
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage

1169
01:22:10,755 --> 01:22:12,997
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1170
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:15,924
If you want to be with me,
you're with me.

1171
01:22:16,427 --> 01:22:17,508
Okay.

1172
01:22:18,221 --> 01:22:21,679
Too many guys think
I'm a concept, or I complete them

1173
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:24,054
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1174
01:22:24,644 --> 01:22:28,182
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's
looking for my own peace of mind.

1175
01:22:28,272 --> 01:22:29,637
Don't assign me yours.

1176
01:22:29,732 --> 01:22:32,019
I remember that speech
really well.

1177
01:22:33,069 --> 01:22:34,606
I had you pegged, didn't I?

1178
01:22:34,695 --> 01:22:36,653
Had the whole human race pegged.

1179
01:22:37,406 --> 01:22:38,646
Probably.

1180
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,775
I still thought you were
going to save my life.

1181
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:44,110
Even after that.

1182
01:22:46,374 --> 01:22:47,615
I know.

1183
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:52,502
It would be different,

1184
01:22:53,965 --> 01:22:56,581
if we could just
give it another go-round.

1185
01:23:00,221 --> 01:23:03,759
Remember me.
Try your best.

1186
01:23:07,311 --> 01:23:08,767
Maybe we can.

1187
01:23:40,595 --> 01:23:43,336
<i>Just tell me what you remember,</i>

1188
01:23:43,431 --> 01:23:45,047
<i>and we'll take it from there.</i>

1189
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,389
<i>I liked you immediately.</i>

1190
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:54,765
<i>You didn't come on to me at all.
I liked that.</i>

1191
01:23:57,278 --> 01:23:59,770
<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at first,</i>

1192
01:23:59,864 --> 01:24:02,481
<i>but I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

1193
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:06,113
<i>I couldn't wait to come to work.</i>

1194
01:24:06,204 --> 01:24:10,698
<i>I had these fantasies of us
being married and having kids...</i>

1195
01:24:13,294 --> 01:24:15,205
<i>Howie, I can't do this.</i>

1196
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:18,128
<i>We agreed it's
for the best, Mary.</i>

1197
01:24:18,216 --> 01:24:19,455
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1198
01:24:21,427 --> 01:24:22,714
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1199
01:24:23,179 --> 01:24:25,467
I'll take the bottom and you...

1200
01:24:25,556 --> 01:24:27,513
No, Joel, help me with that.

1201
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,716
Will you get the cooler?

1202
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,471
Honey, the cooler's pretty...

1203
01:24:30,561 --> 01:24:31,847
She can get it.

1204
01:24:32,688 --> 01:24:34,520
Let me get that.
No, no, no.

1205
01:24:34,607 --> 01:24:35,642
Don't take anything.

1206
01:24:35,733 --> 01:24:36,849
I can take the plane.

1207
01:24:36,943 --> 01:24:39,274
Put the gate back up.

1208
01:24:42,573 --> 01:24:44,440
<i>This is the day we met.</i>

1209
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,159
<i>You were by the surf. I could
just make you out in the distance.</i>

1210
01:24:48,246 --> 01:24:50,828
<i>I remember being drawn
to you, even then.</i>

1211
01:24:50,915 --> 01:24:53,078
<i>I thought,
"Wow, how odd!"</i>

1212
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:55,159
<i>"I'm drawn to someone's back."</i>

1213
01:24:55,419 --> 01:24:57,502
<i>You were in that
orange sweatshirt</i>

1214
01:24:57,588 --> 01:25:01,207
<i>that I would come to know so well,
and even hate, eventually.</i>

1215
01:25:01,759 --> 01:25:05,844
But at the time I thought,
"How cool, an orange sweatshirt."

1216
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,262
Hi, there.

1217
01:25:09,517 --> 01:25:10,633
Hi.

1218
01:25:10,726 --> 01:25:14,435
I saw you sitting
over here by yourself,

1219
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:18,393
and I thought, "Thank God",

1220
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:22,193
"someone normal who doesn't know
how to interact at these things".

1221
01:25:23,781 --> 01:25:26,364
I don't ever know what to say.

1222
01:25:26,993 --> 01:25:28,529
I'm Clementine.

1223
01:25:29,704 --> 01:25:32,570
Can I borrow
a piece of your chicken?

1224
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:36,666
And then you just took it,
without waiting for an answer.

1225
01:25:41,299 --> 01:25:45,041
It was so intimate,
like we were already lovers.

1226
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,967
I'm Joel.

1227
01:25:50,016 --> 01:25:53,758
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.

1228
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,469
You mean, like

1229
01:25:56,564 --> 01:25:59,226
<i>"Oh, my darlin, Clementine?"</i>

1230
01:25:59,817 --> 01:26:02,276
Huckleberry Hound?
That sort of thing?

1231
01:26:02,361 --> 01:26:04,569
Yeah, like that.

1232
01:26:04,655 --> 01:26:06,191
No, no jokes.

1233
01:26:06,574 --> 01:26:08,656
One of my favorite things
when I was a kid

1234
01:26:08,743 --> 01:26:10,984
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1235
01:26:14,457 --> 01:26:16,663
I think your name is magical.

1236
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:23,163
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.

1237
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:27,254
I know.

1238
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:30,169
What do we do?

1239
01:26:33,142 --> 01:26:34,382
Enjoy it.

1240
01:26:52,036 --> 01:26:53,868
- You married?
- No.

1241
01:26:54,122 --> 01:26:56,362
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1242
01:26:56,457 --> 01:26:58,994
I do sort of live
with someone, though.

1243
01:26:59,544 --> 01:27:00,954
Male or female?

1244
01:27:01,045 --> 01:27:03,537
What? Female.

1245
01:27:07,301 --> 01:27:10,134
At least I'm not barking up
the wrong tree.

1246
01:27:13,391 --> 01:27:15,301
Do you know these people?

1247
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:16,883
No, of course not.
Come on.

1248
01:27:19,313 --> 01:27:20,803
They might have a dog.

1249
01:27:20,898 --> 01:27:22,230
There's no dog.

1250
01:27:24,235 --> 01:27:26,225
What are you doing?

1251
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,731
It's freezing out.

1252
01:27:28,698 --> 01:27:30,484
I don't believe this.

1253
01:27:42,712 --> 01:27:45,079
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1254
01:27:46,549 --> 01:27:49,257
Nobody's coming here tonight,
believe me.

1255
01:27:53,764 --> 01:27:57,429
So, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1256
01:27:58,603 --> 01:28:00,970
Naomi, but we're not really...

1257
01:28:02,273 --> 01:28:05,060
Whatever.
So this is great.

1258
01:28:05,151 --> 01:28:10,020
Now I can look for candles,
matches, and the liquor cabinet.

1259
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,446
Oh, God.

1260
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:19,570
I think we should go.

1261
01:28:19,665 --> 01:28:21,452
There's no phone line.

1262
01:28:21,876 --> 01:28:23,708
- What?
- I think we should go.

1263
01:28:23,795 --> 01:28:27,459
Why? It's our house.
Just for tonight.

1264
01:28:27,548 --> 01:28:30,667
We are David and Ruth Laskin.

1265
01:28:32,094 --> 01:28:33,881
Which one do you want to be?

1266
01:28:34,096 --> 01:28:37,180
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1267
01:28:39,519 --> 01:28:40,974
What do you need?

1268
01:28:42,772 --> 01:28:43,932
Alcohol.

1269
01:28:45,942 --> 01:28:47,432
So, are you okay with wine?

1270
01:28:47,527 --> 01:28:48,641
I don't know.

1271
01:28:48,736 --> 01:28:50,352
Well, you choose the wine.

1272
01:28:50,446 --> 01:28:54,405
I'll go find the bedroom and
slip into something more Ruth.

1273
01:28:57,912 --> 01:29:00,824
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- We really should go.

1274
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:05,159
I've got to catch my ride.

1275
01:29:07,338 --> 01:29:08,794
So go.

1276
01:29:09,882 --> 01:29:13,841
I did. I thought
maybe you were a nut.

1277
01:29:15,179 --> 01:29:16,886
But you were exciting.

1278
01:29:19,142 --> 01:29:20,883
I wish you'd stayed.

1279
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:23,935
I wish I'd stayed, too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1280
01:29:24,021 --> 01:29:26,354
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1281
01:29:33,406 --> 01:29:36,194
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1282
01:29:36,325 --> 01:29:38,784
I came back downstairs
and you were gone.

1283
01:29:38,911 --> 01:29:41,654
- I walked out the door.
- Why?

1284
01:29:41,747 --> 01:29:44,865
I don't know. I felt
like a scared little kid.

1285
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,201
It was above my head.

1286
01:29:48,004 --> 01:29:49,961
- You were scared?
- Yeah.

1287
01:29:52,383 --> 01:29:54,670
I thought you knew
that about me.

1288
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:58,921
<i>I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation.</i>

1289
01:30:00,016 --> 01:30:02,724
- Was it something I said?
- Yeah.

1290
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:09,397
You said "so go"
with such disdain.

1291
01:30:10,735 --> 01:30:12,317
I'm sorry.

1292
01:30:12,403 --> 01:30:13,483
It's okay.

1293
01:30:21,746 --> 01:30:23,907
What if you stayed this time?

1294
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:27,914
I walked out the door.

1295
01:30:29,545 --> 01:30:30,536
There's no memory left.

1296
01:30:31,088 --> 01:30:33,205
Come back and make up a goodbye.

1297
01:30:34,425 --> 01:30:35,756
Let's pretend we had one.

1298
01:30:47,355 --> 01:30:48,685
Bye, Joel.

1299
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:51,602
I love you.

1300
01:30:52,151 --> 01:30:55,394
Meet me in Montauk.

1301
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:03,071
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.

1302
01:31:04,622 --> 01:31:08,535
<i>You were operating the plane with
the remote control, and it crashed.</i>

1303
01:31:08,626 --> 01:31:10,333
<i>It was fucking windy.
Come on.</i>

1304
01:31:10,419 --> 01:31:12,660
<i>You're stoned
and you're driving.</i>

1305
01:31:12,755 --> 01:31:16,214
<i>The pot balances it out and brings you
back up. That's why I smoke it.</i>

1306
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:19,008
<i>If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.</i>

1307
01:31:19,137 --> 01:31:23,973
<i>It does. A medical test was done.
It's proven on the Science Network.</i>

1308
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:25,719
<i>Honey, just watch the road.</i>

1309
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:27,140
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

1310
01:31:29,105 --> 01:31:31,938
I saw you talking
to a pretty girl.

1311
01:31:32,024 --> 01:31:33,106
She was nice.

1312
01:31:33,192 --> 01:31:35,058
Yeah, man, who was it?

1313
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,363
She was just a girl.

1314
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:49,372
Okay.

1315
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,907
So I've got to drop the van off.

1316
01:32:29,207 --> 01:32:32,120
Thanks, Stan. We'll talk.

1317
01:33:59,046 --> 01:34:00,301
You've got all your stuff,
I see.

1318
01:34:00,381 --> 01:34:01,415
That's right.

1319
01:34:01,507 --> 01:34:03,373
I take it you're not
coming back.

1320
01:34:03,801 --> 01:34:05,838
I wouldn't come back
if I was you.

1321
01:34:05,928 --> 01:34:08,135
- Do you swear you didn't know?
- I swear.

1322
01:34:09,474 --> 01:34:11,009
So you didn't do the erasing?

1323
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:12,761
Of course not. God, no.

1324
01:34:12,852 --> 01:34:15,469
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1325
01:34:16,147 --> 01:34:17,558
Once, maybe.

1326
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:22,818
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car,

1327
01:34:23,029 --> 01:34:25,066
and I saw you two talking.

1328
01:34:25,615 --> 01:34:28,107
So I waved to you,
and you giggled.

1329
01:34:28,826 --> 01:34:30,362
How did I look?

1330
01:34:32,747 --> 01:34:34,329
You looked happy.

1331
01:34:34,832 --> 01:34:37,324
Happy with a secret.

1332
01:34:38,753 --> 01:34:40,243
And after that?

1333
01:34:40,338 --> 01:34:42,625
I never saw you two together
again like that,

1334
01:34:42,715 --> 01:34:46,299
so I just figured
I was imagining things.

1335
01:35:12,537 --> 01:35:16,781
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?

1336
01:35:28,344 --> 01:35:29,550
Thanks.

1337
01:36:04,547 --> 01:36:06,539
Let me get my toothbrush.

1338
01:36:21,397 --> 01:36:24,355
<i>Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.</i>

1339
01:36:24,442 --> 01:36:27,935
<i>I feel like you're mad at me
and I don't know what I did.</i>

1340
01:36:29,113 --> 01:36:30,695
<i>What did I do?</i>

1341
01:36:30,781 --> 01:36:34,695
<i>I love you so much.
I'll do anything to make you happy.</i>

1342
01:36:35,411 --> 01:36:38,699
<i>Just tell me what you want me
to do, and I'll do it.</i>

1343
01:36:38,956 --> 01:36:42,699
<i>I'm going to stop by this morning,
just to make sure you're okay.</i>

1344
01:36:58,309 --> 01:37:00,846
I had a really nice time
last night.

1345
01:37:02,021 --> 01:37:03,136
Nice?

1346
01:37:03,314 --> 01:37:07,899
I had the best fucking night of
my entire fucking life last night.

1347
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:09,809
That's better.

1348
01:37:13,991 --> 01:37:15,277
This is weird.

1349
01:37:15,368 --> 01:37:17,826
<i>"To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.</i>

1350
01:37:17,912 --> 01:37:19,244
<i>My name is Mary Svevo.</i>

1351
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:21,412
<i>We've met, but
you don't remember me.</i>

1352
01:37:21,499 --> 01:37:26,118
<i>I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased.</i>

1353
01:37:26,212 --> 01:37:29,045
<i>I've since decided
that this is a horrible...</i>

1354
01:37:29,173 --> 01:37:32,882
<i>To correct this, I'm sending
everyone's file back to them."</i>

1355
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:37,046
<i>My name is
Clementine Kruczynski.</i>

1356
01:37:37,348 --> 01:37:40,010
<i>I'm here to erase Joel Barish.</i>

1357
01:37:40,518 --> 01:37:42,725
- What is this?
- I don't know.

1358
01:37:42,812 --> 01:37:43,928
<i>He's boring.</i>

1359
01:37:44,021 --> 01:37:46,854
<i>Is that enough reason
to erase someone?</i>

1360
01:37:47,191 --> 01:37:51,560
<i>I've been thinking how I was before and
how I am now, and he changed me.</i>

1361
01:37:51,654 --> 01:37:53,520
<i>I feel like
I'm always pissy now.</i>

1362
01:37:53,614 --> 01:37:56,777
<i>I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.</i>

1363
01:37:56,868 --> 01:37:58,778
<i>I can't stand
to even look at him.</i>

1364
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:01,406
<i>That pathetic, wimpy,
apologetic smile.</i>

1365
01:38:01,497 --> 01:38:03,454
<i>That sort of wounded puppy shit.</i>

1366
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:05,578
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

1367
01:38:05,668 --> 01:38:07,784
<i>The bloom is certainly
off the rose at this point.</i>

1368
01:38:07,879 --> 01:38:10,210
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1369
01:38:10,381 --> 01:38:12,918
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

1370
01:38:13,009 --> 01:38:14,592
You clearly are!

1371
01:38:14,927 --> 01:38:17,464
Let's just take a minute and...

1372
01:38:46,417 --> 01:38:49,581
Patrick, get the fuck
away from me!

1373
01:38:50,588 --> 01:38:53,330
- Can we talk about it?
- No, get the fuck away!

1374
01:39:28,084 --> 01:39:31,827
Hey, Clementine.
Nice to see you.

1375
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:42,804
<i>I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.</i>

1376
01:39:43,307 --> 01:39:45,799
<i>I couldn't talk to her
about books.</i>

1377
01:39:45,977 --> 01:39:48,593
<i>She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.</i>

1378
01:39:49,272 --> 01:39:52,309
<i>Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.</i>

1379
01:39:52,817 --> 01:39:55,309
<i>The truth is,
I was embarrassed in public,</i>

1380
01:39:55,403 --> 01:39:56,308
<i>Hi.</i>

1381
01:39:56,389 --> 01:39:59,101
<i>Because she would pronounce
library, "Li-berry".</i>

1382
01:40:04,328 --> 01:40:05,659
Look what I found.

1383
01:40:05,746 --> 01:40:09,661
<i>I think if there's a truly seductive
quality about Clementine,</i>

1384
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:13,494
<i>it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.</i>

1385
01:40:15,298 --> 01:40:17,459
Made me look skinny.

1386
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:21,293
<i>An amazing, burning meteorite
will carry you to another world</i>

1387
01:40:21,387 --> 01:40:23,298
<i>where things are exciting.</i>

1388
01:40:25,683 --> 01:40:29,894
<i>But what you quickly learn is
that it's really an elaborate ruse.</i>

1389
01:40:30,521 --> 01:40:32,559
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1390
01:40:33,858 --> 01:40:35,189
It's okay.

1391
01:40:40,156 --> 01:40:43,400
I really like you. I hate that
I said mean things about you.

1392
01:40:43,493 --> 01:40:45,529
Let me turn this off, okay?

1393
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:48,112
That's only fair.

1394
01:40:51,542 --> 01:40:54,785
<i>The whole thing with the hair,
it's all bullshit.</i>

1395
01:40:54,879 --> 01:40:57,121
I really like your hair.

1396
01:40:57,215 --> 01:40:58,420
Thank you.

1397
01:40:58,883 --> 01:41:00,089
I do.

1398
01:41:03,471 --> 01:41:05,303
You want a drink or something?

1399
01:41:05,389 --> 01:41:07,050
Do you have any whiskey?

1400
01:41:08,643 --> 01:41:13,387
<i>I didn't think her sex
was motivated.</i>

1401
01:41:13,731 --> 01:41:17,645
<i>I saw it clearly the last night
we were together. It wasn't sexy.</i>

1402
01:41:17,735 --> 01:41:20,147
<i>It was just sad.</i>

1403
01:41:21,364 --> 01:41:23,479
Sorry, I thought there was more.

1404
01:41:23,616 --> 01:41:26,905
<i>The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her</i>

1405
01:41:26,994 --> 01:41:28,701
<i>is to fuck them.</i>

1406
01:41:29,872 --> 01:41:33,787
<i>Or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of them.</i>

1407
01:41:33,876 --> 01:41:37,335
<i>I think she's so
desperate and insecure</i>

1408
01:41:38,381 --> 01:41:41,589
<i>that she'll sooner or later
go around fucking everybody.</i>

1409
01:41:41,676 --> 01:41:42,790
I don't do that.

1410
01:41:42,885 --> 01:41:45,297
I wouldn't think that about you.

1411
01:41:45,513 --> 01:41:47,550
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1412
01:41:47,765 --> 01:41:50,633
It hurts me that you said that,
because I don't do that.

1413
01:41:50,726 --> 01:41:52,433
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this.

1414
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:56,263
I'm going to go.
I'm a little confused.

1415
01:41:56,357 --> 01:41:59,099
I don't really think
I can be here.

1416
01:42:06,075 --> 01:42:07,066
Bye.

1417
01:42:07,785 --> 01:42:09,867
<i>I really thought
I knew her so well.</i>

1418
01:42:09,954 --> 01:42:11,946
It was nice meeting you and all.

1419
01:42:14,792 --> 01:42:18,127
<i>What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,</i>

1420
01:42:18,212 --> 01:42:20,829
<i>only to find out
that she's a stranger.</i>

1421
01:42:25,761 --> 01:42:26,843
Wait.

1422
01:42:29,807 --> 01:42:31,970
- What?
- I don't know. Just wait.

1423
01:42:32,101 --> 01:42:36,847
- What do you want, Joel?
- I want you to wait for a while.

1424
01:42:51,454 --> 01:42:53,444
- Okay.
- Really?

1425
01:42:54,248 --> 01:42:58,163
I'm not a concept, just a fucked-up girl
looking for my peace of mind.

1426
01:42:58,252 --> 01:42:59,742
I'm not perfect.

1427
01:42:59,837 --> 01:43:02,296
I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1428
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:04,748
- But you will.
- Right now I can't.

1429
01:43:05,218 --> 01:43:06,879
You will think of things.

1430
01:43:06,969 --> 01:43:08,836
And I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped,

1431
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:11,341
because that's
what happens with me.

1432
01:43:12,809 --> 01:43:13,890
Okay.

1433
01:43:18,397 --> 01:43:19,512
Okay.

1434
01:43:24,195 --> 01:43:25,355
Okay.
