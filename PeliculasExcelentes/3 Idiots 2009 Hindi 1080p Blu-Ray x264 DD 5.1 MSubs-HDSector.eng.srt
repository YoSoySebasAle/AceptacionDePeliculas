Captain, there's a
medical emergency

17
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:54,636
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

19
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,511
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

Chatur called. Remember him?

25
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:27,053
The 'Silencer'?

26
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:28,261
Yeah

27
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,678
He said Rancho is coming

28
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:34,928
What?

29
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:38,678
He said - Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

30
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:41,303
Oh shucks!

31
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:42,386
Hurry!

32
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:43,594
OK

00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,886
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

Tell me later - bye

37
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,303
You forgot your pants

38
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:13,761

Forgot my socks

42
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,386
More than just your socks

43
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,261
Your pants

44
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:24,553
Oh no

45
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,094
Now get my brother

00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,428
Same last name - Dhillon

47
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:45,178
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

48
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:06,719
Hey Rancho

49
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,344
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

50
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:10,303

00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,844
Welcome, idiots

53
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,553
Some 'madeira' for you?

54
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:25,303
The same rum you
guzzled those days

55
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,219
Have a drink

56
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,094
Where is Rancho?

57
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,636
Patience. First look at this

58
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:37,303
Don't eye my wife. Check out

64
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,803
Why're you showing us all this?

65
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,511
Forgot?

66
00:06:58,636 --> 00:06:59,636
What's this?

00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,886
'5th September'. Today's date

68
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:21,511
I challenge you

69

We'll meet again after ten years

70
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,303
Same day. Same place

71
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:29,553
We'll see who's more successful

72
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:34,636
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

73
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:40,303
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

74
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:43,928
I kept my promise. I'm back

75
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:48,843
Jackass! I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

76
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:49,928
all to meet Rancho

77
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,969
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

78
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,761
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

79
00:07:56,011 --> 00:08:00,094
I know he won't show up

80
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,594
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

81
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,803
So why'd you call us here?

82
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,178
To meet Rancho

83
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:11,719
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

84
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,261
So you know where Rancho is?

85

Yes

86
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:18,928

00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:57,511
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

185
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:02,386
One

186
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:06,761
Two

187
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,261
Three

188
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:26,136
Four

189
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,344
Five

190
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:38,886
Six

191
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,386
Seven

192
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,011
Eight

193
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:00,344
Nine

194
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:11,053
Ten

195
00:17:56,886 --> 00:18:01,386
<i>Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics</i>

196
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,594
<i>We had studied it. He applied it</i>

197
00:18:09,886 --> 00:18:13,844
<i>Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE</i>

198
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,344
<i>Students called him Virus,
computer Virus</i>

199
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:20,303
Virus on the way, with eggs

200
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:24,094
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

201
00:18:24,428 --> 00:18:26,969
<i>Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen</i>

202
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:31,344
<i>He couldn't bear anyone
getting ahead of him</i>

203
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,344
<i>To save time,
his shirts had Velcro</i>

204
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:40,011
<i>and his ties had hooks</i>

205
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:46,594
<i>He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously</i>

206
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:54,303
<i>Everyday at 2 p.m. he took a
7½ minute power nap</i>

207
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:55,969
<i>with an opera as lullaby</i>

208
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,636
<i>Govind, his valet, had instructions</i>

209
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:06,886
<i>to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc</i>

210
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:26,593
- What is this?
- Sir, nest

211
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:29,010
- Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

212
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,011
Wrong

213
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,886
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

214
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:36,428
She lays her eggs in other nests

215
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,303
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

216
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:48,886
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

217
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:53,886
Competition over

218
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:58,719
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

219
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:02,136
Compete or die

220
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:06,219
You also are like the koel birds

221
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:14,928
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

222
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:20,386
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

223
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,928
and only 200 are selected - You!

224
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:30,178
And these? Finished. Broken eggs

225
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:34,803
My son... he tried for three years

226
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,219
Rejected. Every time

227
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:43,178
Remember, life is a race

228
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:47,428
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

229
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:50,011
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

230
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:53,553
This is an astronaut pen

231
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,469
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

232
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:02,553
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

233
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:07,219
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

234
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:09,386
One day, when I was a student

235
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:11,428
the Director of our institute
called me

236
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:14,136
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

237
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:15,719
'Come here!' I got scared

238
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:18,303
He showed me this pen

239
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:22,053
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

240
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:24,886
'I give it to you'

241
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:30,636
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

242
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:32,928
...pass it onto him'

243
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:38,344
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

244
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:39,886
But no luck

245
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,719
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

246
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:49,428
Good. Put your hands down

247
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:56,511
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

248
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:58,303
One question, sir

249
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:03,261
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

250
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:06,428
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

251
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:09,344
They'd have saved millions

252
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:23,803
I will get back to you on this

253
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:30,094
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

254
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:33,553
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

255
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:35,803
You deflated Virus's erection

256
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:39,844
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

257
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:42,428
Buzz off. You don't have school?

258
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:44,468
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

259
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:47,761
- Keep off my dad!
- Relax

260
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:51,761
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

261
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:57,386
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

262
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,678
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

263
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:03,094
If I get caught?
Then new uniform, new school

264
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:05,469
<i>See that? - He was different...</i>

265
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,136
<i>He challenged conventions
at every stage</i>

266
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:12,469
<i>A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest</i>

267
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:16,261
<i>We were robots, blindly following
our professors' commands</i>

268
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:19,511
<i>He was the only one
who was not a machine</i>

269
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:22,136
What is a machine?

270
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:29,094
Why're you smiling?

271
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:33,303
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

272
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,594
I'm so happy to be here finally

273
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:41,011
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

274
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,844
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

275
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:47,636
Will you please elaborate?

276
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:56,428
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

277
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:00,718
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

278
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,053
The fan... A machine!

279
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:05,844
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

280
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:09,094
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

281
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:11,803
We're surrounded by machines

282
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:14,844
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

283
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:17,678
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

284
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:21,969
What is the definition?

285
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,386
I just gave it to you, sir

286
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:29,594
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine - up, down...

287
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,386
Idiot! Anybody else?

288
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:34,136
Yes?

289
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:36,760
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

290
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:38,441
that their relative motions
are constrained

291
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:40,844
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

292
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,261
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

293
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:46,053
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

294
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,385
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

295
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,385
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

296
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:53,678
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

297
00:24:55,053 --> 00:24:56,053
Wonderful

298
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:57,719
Perfect. Please sit down

299
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:59,303
Thank you

300
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,719
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

301
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,886
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

302
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:09,886
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

303
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,511
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

304
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,386
You think you're smarter
than the book?

305
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:20,719
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

306
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,636
But there are other books...
Get out!

307
00:25:23,678 --> 00:25:24,928
Why?

308
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:27,136
In simple language - Out!

309
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:38,011
Idiot!

310
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:42,469
So, we were discussing
the machine...

311
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:45,094
Why're you back?

312
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,219
I forgot something

313
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:48,886
What?

314
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:52,302
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

315
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:54,594
debate and explain information;
That are illustrated, non-illustrated

316
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,636
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non jacketed

317
00:25:56,844 --> 00:25:58,885
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

318
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,678
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

319
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:02,511
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

320
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:04,761
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

321
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,553
What do you mean?

322
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:14,094
Books, sir

323
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:17,094
I forgot my books. May I?

324
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:19,094
Couldn't you ask simply?

325
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:22,719
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

326
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:31,844
<i>Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in</i>

327
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:35,094
<i>When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another</i>

328
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,553
<i>He said - First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it</i>

329
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:41,344
<i>He was unlike any of us</i>

330
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:43,969
<i>We fought for a shower
every morning</i>

331
00:26:44,594 --> 00:26:46,803
<i>He'd bathe wherever
he found water</i>

332
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,011
Morning, sir

333
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:51,553
<i>Machines were his passion</i>

334
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:56,094
<i>When he spotted them,
he opened them</i>

335
00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:57,549
<i>Some he could re-assemble...</i>

336
00:26:58,553 --> 00:26:59,844
<i>some he couldn't</i>

337
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:03,219
<i>There was another, just like him</i>

338
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,261
<i>Joy Lobo</i>

339
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,719
Sir. Excuse me, sir

340
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:11,803
Mr. Joy Lobo!

341
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:15,136
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

342
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:16,219
Why?

343
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,011
Dad wants to make
train reservations

344
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,886
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

345
00:27:22,803 --> 00:27:24,969
In that case, call your dad

346
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,553
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

347
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:35,011
Hello

348
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:38,178
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

349
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:39,386
Joy!

350
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:41,969
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

351
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:44,593
What happened, sir?

352
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:46,719
He has violated all deadlines

353
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:50,803
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

354
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:52,844
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

355
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:57,761
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

356
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,386
Sir, I am this close, sir
Is your project ready?

357
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:06,761
Is your project ready?
Sir, see it once, please

358
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:08,511
Submit it, and we'll consider

359
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:11,135
Sir, a small extension...
Why, why should I?

360
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,219
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

361
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:15,594
Did you stop eating?

362
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:17,136
No

363
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:18,386
Stopped bathing?

364
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:20,303
So why stop studying?

365
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:23,136
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

366
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:24,428
Mr. Lobo!

367
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,636
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

368
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:32,886
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

369
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:38,053
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

370
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,719
Sir... I'm very close...

Dude's come up with an
amazing design

384
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,136
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

385
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:09,636
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

386
00:30:10,053 --> 00:30:12,928
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

387
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:15,219
It will fly! We'll make it fly

388
00:30:17,553 --> 00:30:19,719
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

389
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:22,761
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

390
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,469
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

391
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:29,053
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

392
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,886
You scare easily, bro

393
00:30:32,678 --> 00:30:36,511
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

394
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:38,886
- All is well?
- Aal izz well

395
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:41,553
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

396
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:44,178
We had an old watchman
in our village

397
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:50,261
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

398
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:54,386
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

399
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:56,636
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

400
00:30:56,969 --> 00:31:00,386
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

401
00:31:02,303 --> 00:31:06,844
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

402
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,678
You have to trick it

403
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:16,636
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

404
00:31:17,928 --> 00:31:19,594
That resolves the problem?

405
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:21,636
No. But you gain courage to face it

406
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:27,511
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

Take it higher

455
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,344
Look at Silencer - the nude dude!

456
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:21,344
Joy, come out

457
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,928
Come to the window

458
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:26,511
Joy, look outside

459
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:21,886
Good news, sir

460
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:26,094
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

461
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:28,719
Everyone thinks this is suicide

462
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:32,136
The post mortem report -

463
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,761
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

464
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,011
resulting in choking

465
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:42,678
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

466
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:47,344
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

467
00:36:48,344 --> 00:36:49,464
That's missing in the report

468
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:53,844
Engineers are a clever bunch

469
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:58,636
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

470
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,428
If they had, all would know...

471
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:05,053
this isn't suicide... it's murder

472
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:13,178
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

473
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:16,886
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

474
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:20,969
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

475
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:25,219
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

476
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,844
Look at these statistics -
India ranks No. 1 in suicides

477
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:34,928
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

478
00:37:36,636 --> 00:37:39,511
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

479
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:41,053
Something's terribly wrong, sir

480
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:43,428
I can't speak for the rest

481
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,216
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

482
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:48,719
I've run this place for 32 years

483
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:52,511
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're No. 1

484
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,261
What's the point, sir?

485
00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:59,261
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

486
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:05,969
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

487
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:12,178
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

488
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:14,553
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

489
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:16,053
No sir, I...

490
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:20,261
Sir, my paper...

491
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:40,338
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

492
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,928
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

493
00:38:44,428 --> 00:38:49,094
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

494
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:54,261
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

495
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,511
We do not have all day

496
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:55,719
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

497
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,178
You may refer to your books

498
00:39:58,803 --> 00:40:00,803
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

499
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:05,469
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

500
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,553
Your time starts... now

501
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:40,219
Time up

502
00:40:42,678 --> 00:40:43,678
Time up, sir

503
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:47,886
No one got the answer?

504
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:53,761
Now rewind your life by a minute

505
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:57,803
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

506
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:00,719
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

507
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:03,928
Anyone?... Sir?

508
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:09,678
No. You all got into a frantic race

509
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,881
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

510
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:19,469
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

511
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:21,988
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

512
00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:27,678
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

513
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:32,385
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

514
00:41:32,386 --> 00:41:33,386
Hello!

515
00:41:33,844 --> 00:41:38,386
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

516
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:40,469
Sir, these words don't exist

517
00:41:41,678 --> 00:41:44,969
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

518
00:41:57,553 --> 00:41:58,553
Quiet!

519
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,761
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

520
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:05,136
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

521
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:07,219
You're an expert at that

522
00:42:08,094 --> 00:42:11,303
I was teaching you... how to teach

523
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,053
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

524
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:20,053
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

525
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:21,594
Bye, sir

526
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:24,719
Quiet!

527
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:28,386
Quiet, I said

528
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:35,219
<i>I regret to inform you
that your son...</i>

529
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,469
<i>Farhan... Raju...</i>

530
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:37,841
<i>has fallen into bad company</i>

531
00:42:38,178 --> 00:42:41,303
<i>Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined</i>

532
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:45,678
<i>Virus's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs</i>

533
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:48,552
<i>Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom</i>

534
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:51,594
<i>Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down</i>

535
00:42:52,678 --> 00:42:54,803
Come in

536
00:42:57,386 --> 00:42:58,386
See that?

537
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:02,261
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

538
00:43:04,053 --> 00:43:07,678
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

539
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:13,094
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

540
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,844
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

541
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,469
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. Understand?

542
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:31,469
You took these pictures, Farhan?

543
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:35,386
He had that useless
obsession for a while

544
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:38,135
Went around taking
pictures of animals

545
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:40,886
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

546
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:44,511
Son, what was your
score that year?

547
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:46,678
91%

548
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:51,678
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

549
00:43:54,844 --> 00:43:56,261
You find it funny?

550
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:01,011
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

551
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:03,803
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

552
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:05,136
Enough!

553
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:11,678
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

554
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:15,553
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

555
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:22,761
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

556
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:27,136
<i>Dad denied us a meal...</i>

557
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:29,386
<i>So, to fill our bellies with food...</i>

558
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:33,053
<i>and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house</i>

559
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:39,094
<i>Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film</i>

560
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:40,886
<i>A small, dingy room...</i>

561
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,511
<i>a paralyzed father...</i>

562
00:44:43,344 --> 00:44:44,511
<i>a coughing mother...</i>

563
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:46,386
<i>and an unwed sister</i>

564
00:44:47,553 --> 00:44:48,886
<i>A sofa sprouting springs...</i>

565
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,636
<i>a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof</i>

566
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:55,928
<i>Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer</i>

567
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:58,761
<i>Father was once a postmaster</i>

568
00:44:59,303 --> 00:45:01,678
<i>Paralysis shut down
his body partly...</i>

569
00:45:02,178 --> 00:45:04,553
<i>his salary completely.
And the sister...</i>

570
00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:08,344
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

571
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:11,594
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

572
00:45:12,136 --> 00:45:13,136
Some okra?

573
00:45:14,053 --> 00:45:17,886
Okra is now 12Rs per kilo,
cauliflower is 10Rs.

574
00:45:18,261 --> 00:45:19,636
It's daylight robbery!

575
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:24,011
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

576
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:25,303
Mom!

577
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:27,803
Cottage cheese?

578
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:31,719
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

579
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:33,803
Cottage cheese? No, no, it's OK

580
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:36,011
Mom, please

581
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:38,678
Alright, I'll shut up

582
00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:44,844
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

583
00:45:45,094 --> 00:45:47,344
and then take the vow of silence

584
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:52,844
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes - his friends?

585
00:45:56,803 --> 00:45:57,844
Hey Raju

586
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:02,428
<i>We were in a huge dilemma</i>

587
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:06,178
<i>Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?</i>

588
00:46:07,428 --> 00:46:10,344
<i>Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese</i>

589
00:46:22,303 --> 00:46:25,094
Even his eczema cream
costs 55Rs now

590
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:31,178
Another roti?

591
00:46:31,553 --> 00:46:34,469
No, thank you. We're through

592
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:44,844
Okra for 12Rs.
Cauliflower for 10Rs.

593
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:49,719
At least you were offered a meal

594
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:53,428
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi!

595
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:56,261
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

596
00:46:56,553 --> 00:47:00,094
Don't poke fun at my mom!
Enough, you guys

597
00:47:00,428 --> 00:47:01,803
I'm famished. Let's eat out

598
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,303
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

599
00:47:05,386 --> 00:47:09,928
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

600
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:14,386
C'mon - Come

601
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:18,343
Good evening, good evening

602
00:47:18,344 --> 00:47:19,344
Oh, Uncle

603
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:27,719
Three large vodkas.
Half soda, half water

604
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:29,178
If we're caught, we're dead

605
00:47:29,386 --> 00:47:32,010
What's for starters?
Get double portions

606
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:35,011
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

607
00:47:35,803 --> 00:47:37,428
Pia, what the hell!

608
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:40,511
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

609
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:45,303
What'll people say - My fiancée...

610
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:48,303
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200Rs watch!

611
00:47:49,261 --> 00:47:50,719
Please take it off. Thank you

612
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:52,303
Hi handsome

613
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,385
Hey Aunty. You're looking good

614
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:57,928
Don't miss my set, darling
Rubies?

615
00:47:58,136 --> 00:48:00,843
From Mandalay - Mandalay... Wow!

616
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,511
Hey, let's go meet David
Of course

617
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:07,886
Excuse me

618
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:11,094
Yes?

619
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:12,469
Flowers

620
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:17,178
- May I take the glass?
- Why?

621
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:19,761
So you don't break it on my head

622
00:48:20,594 --> 00:48:21,803
Why would I do that?

623
00:48:22,261 --> 00:48:24,344
For the free advice I'll now impart

624
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:26,553
What?

625
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:28,303
Don't marry that ass

626
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,428
Excuse me?

627
00:48:30,553 --> 00:48:32,219
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

628
00:48:32,678 --> 00:48:35,636
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

629
00:48:36,303 --> 00:48:38,844
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

630
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:40,178
Want a demonstration?

631
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,803
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

632
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:47,261
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

633
00:48:59,344 --> 00:49:05,261
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

634
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:08,594
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

635
00:49:09,178 --> 00:49:11,844
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched!

636
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:19,136
Dad, are they your guests?

637
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:25,761
My students.
What're they doing here?

638
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:30,928
Hold on, Dad

639
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,719
These beans smell great

640
00:49:34,886 --> 00:49:37,178
No room for roti Just pile it on

641
00:49:39,178 --> 00:49:40,511
Hi - Hey

642
00:49:42,094 --> 00:49:45,053
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

643
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:48,844
It was my moral responsibility

644
00:49:49,678 --> 00:49:51,078
Can I ask you for little more help?

645
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:54,761
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

646
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:59,719
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

647
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:02,636
Certainly. Raju, the mint sauce

648
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:04,636
You're really sweet

649
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:08,928
Where is your daddy?
Right behind you

650
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,886
Aal izz well

651
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:21,844
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

652
00:50:22,178 --> 00:50:23,678
What're you doing here?

653
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:27,428
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

654
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:30,761
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

655
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:32,344
Sister?

656
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:37,594
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

657
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:40,219
Empty. No gift cheques

658
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:42,593
Forgot the cheques, Raju
...Farhan?

659
00:50:42,594 --> 00:50:46,719
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

660
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:51,178
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

661
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:53,511
How? Can you explain?

662
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:57,428
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

663
00:50:57,761 --> 00:50:58,761
Won't you?

664
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:03,094
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

665
00:51:03,386 --> 00:51:05,678
disrupt wedding celebrations

666
00:51:06,053 --> 00:51:08,136
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

667
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:10,678
draws power from guests' cars

668
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:12,261
I see

669
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,969
Wow

670
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:15,761
So where's the inverter?

671
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:18,178
Sir, the design is ready

672
00:51:21,303 --> 00:51:22,553
Where's the design, Farhan?

673
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:26,011
I gave you the design
I gave it to Raju

674
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:27,469
Raju, design?

675
00:51:30,511 --> 00:51:34,219
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

676
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:38,219
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

677
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,594
I'll make one, I promise

678
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:45,428
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

679
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:49,344
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

680
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:55,511
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

681
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:04,886
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

682
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:06,886
...in installments

683
00:52:09,386 --> 00:52:12,594
We'll never crash a wedding again
Not even my own

684
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:14,969
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

685
00:52:15,678 --> 00:52:17,678
Uh... right. No marriage

686
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,553
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

687
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:25,761
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

688
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:29,303
Sit!

689
00:52:40,344 --> 00:52:41,344
Pay attention

690
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:57,219
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

691
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:04,886
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizable income

692
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:13,761
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

693
00:53:15,053 --> 00:53:18,386
Isn't that your fathers income,
Farhan?

694
00:53:19,303 --> 00:53:20,969
Yes, sir

695
00:53:22,386 --> 00:53:24,386
Now take away another zero...

696
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:31,219
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

697
00:53:32,428 --> 00:53:33,761
Big reason to worry

698
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:45,636
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

699
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:50,303
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

700
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:14,636
- Want a shave?
- No, sir

701
00:54:14,844 --> 00:54:15,844
Then get lost!

702
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:32,511
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

703
00:54:32,678 --> 00:54:33,719
I have to worry

704
00:54:34,178 --> 00:54:37,636
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

705
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:41,594
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

706
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,594
Shut up, Raju

707
00:54:43,886 --> 00:54:46,511
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

708
00:54:46,928 --> 00:54:48,344
I won't be his flunky... like you

709
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:51,594
You're crossing the line
No, I'm drawing one

710
00:54:52,136 --> 00:54:53,803
I have a family to support

711
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:58,261
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

712
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:04,594
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

713
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:11,761
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

714
00:55:14,636 --> 00:55:17,803
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

715
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:21,009
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

716
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:23,261
Hey... no wisecracks about mom

717
00:55:24,053 --> 00:55:28,261
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

718
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:33,261
To quote a Wise One - Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

719
00:55:34,053 --> 00:55:39,553
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down!

720
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:43,386
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

721
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:46,469
Go rot in the bogs!

722
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:51,053
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

723
00:55:51,386 --> 00:55:52,511
Oh yeah?

724
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,303
Shove this back into the tube

725
00:56:01,386 --> 00:56:02,969
<i>Raju got onto another train</i>

726
00:56:03,553 --> 00:56:08,678
<i>His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels</i>

727
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,011
<i>Chatur was called 'Silencer'</i>

728
00:56:15,386 --> 00:56:19,053
<i>To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack</i>

729
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:21,428
<i>And then let off silent...
but lethal farts</i>

730
00:56:24,178 --> 00:56:27,344
I didn't do it... Raju?

731
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:30,178
<i>He always blamed others
for the output</i>

732
00:56:30,969 --> 00:56:33,803
<i>Silencer crammed 18 hours a day</i>

733
00:56:34,094 --> 00:56:37,178
<i>On exam eve,
he would distract others</i>

734
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:44,219
<i>His belief - There are only
two ways of topping</i>

735
00:56:44,594 --> 00:56:47,844
<i>Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades</i>

736
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:56,011
<i>Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...</i>

737
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:57,761
<i>with one master plan</i>

738
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:07,844
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

739
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:11,928
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

740
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:16,969
<i>Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function</i>

741
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:21,219
<i>To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...</i>

742
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:22,761
<i>in highbrow Hindi</i>

743
00:57:24,344 --> 00:57:29,678
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

744
00:57:30,094 --> 00:57:32,469
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

745
00:57:35,303 --> 00:57:37,136
Oh... the things I have to do...

746
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:43,886
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

747
00:57:44,053 --> 00:57:45,594
- Really?
- Yes. Just now

748
00:57:46,011 --> 00:57:49,344
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

749
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:57,553
Hello. Hello
Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

750
00:57:57,719 --> 00:57:58,719
Yes?

751
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:01,553
I'm calling from the police station

752
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:04,761
- Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

753
00:58:06,344 --> 00:58:09,344
Your life is in danger
What?... How?

754
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,261
Listen carefully, or else...

755
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:17,219
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

756
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,219
Why? What happened?

757
00:58:19,386 --> 00:58:20,928
<i>While Chatur was kept engaged</i>

758
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:25,344
<i>Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for example...</i>

759
00:58:25,594 --> 00:58:27,928
<i>'served' became 'screwed'</i>

760
00:58:28,803 --> 00:58:30,053
Yes sir?

761
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:33,136
- Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

762
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:36,886
I'm permanent staff, sir

763
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:38,928
Congratulations

764
00:58:39,386 --> 00:58:42,719
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

765
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:44,136
Excuse me, sir

766
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:55,969
Yes... so where was I?

767
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:58,636
You said I may die...
outside the gate

768
00:58:58,803 --> 00:59:05,178
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

769
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:07,428
Traffic signal. OK

770
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:13,178
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

771
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:15,011
OK. Then?

772
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:17,136
Then cross the road
with great caution

773
00:59:17,928 --> 00:59:23,136
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

774
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,886
What nonsense! I know that

775
00:59:27,053 --> 00:59:30,594
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

776
00:59:37,678 --> 00:59:39,719
From the librarian, Silencer

777
00:59:39,886 --> 00:59:41,428
You don't call me that, Chanchad

778
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:49,344
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

779
00:59:50,178 --> 00:59:52,386
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

780
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:55,136
Remembered? Rascals!

781
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:05,344
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

782
01:00:07,678 --> 01:00:11,928
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

783
01:00:12,594 --> 01:00:16,511
respected teachers and friends

784
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:22,969
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

785
01:00:23,636 --> 01:00:27,886
The credit goes solely to

786
01:00:28,344 --> 01:00:32,094
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

787
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:36,261
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

788
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:39,261
He's a great guy, really you are

789
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:48,928
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

790
01:00:51,511 --> 01:00:53,844
He means - 'served' students

791
01:00:54,136 --> 01:00:56,678
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

792
01:00:59,386 --> 01:01:04,386
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

793
01:01:04,636 --> 01:01:07,511
can screw so many, so well

794
01:01:10,636 --> 01:01:15,886
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

795
01:01:19,636 --> 01:01:26,219
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

796
01:01:28,844 --> 01:01:30,553
Let's replicate his methods

797
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:40,011
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

798
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:46,886
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

799
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:54,136
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

800
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:04,511
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

801
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:06,844
cannot be matched by any student...

802
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:10,636
anywhere on the planet

803
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:21,386
Mr. Minister. Good evening

804
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:29,469
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

805
01:02:30,261 --> 01:02:31,844
Booty, funds - Bosom

806
01:02:35,469 --> 01:02:37,594
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

807
01:02:39,053 --> 01:02:41,053
What nonsense! That's insulting

808
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:46,219
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

809
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:49,803
No one offers it so readily

810
01:02:53,844 --> 01:02:54,844
Vulgar fellow!

811
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:56,553
You have generously offered
your bosom...

812
01:02:56,969 --> 01:03:00,011
to this relentless screwer

813
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:07,219
Now see how he makes it grow

814
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:11,719
Is this what you teach here, Director?

815
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,803
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

816
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,928
Listen to this - the might
of his fart in verse

817
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,011
A good loud fart is honorable

818
01:03:29,261 --> 01:03:31,594
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

819
01:03:31,803 --> 01:03:34,636
A medium fart is tolerable

820
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:41,511
Softer windbreaks are terrible

821
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:49,386
And the silent ones unbearable

822
01:03:59,553 --> 01:04:02,469
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

823
01:04:02,678 --> 01:04:06,136
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

824
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:10,219
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

825
01:04:11,469 --> 01:04:14,053
He still doesn't get it

826
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:24,553
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable!

827
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:27,469
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

828
01:04:28,928 --> 01:04:32,303
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

829
01:04:34,844 --> 01:04:38,136
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

830
01:04:41,136 --> 01:04:43,136
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

831
01:04:43,428 --> 01:04:44,636
I will

832
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:48,094
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

833
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:52,594
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

834
01:04:52,928 --> 01:04:58,261
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju - Don't cram blindly

835
01:04:58,636 --> 01:05:00,803
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

836
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:03,428
I'm not here to enjoy Science

837
01:05:03,594 --> 01:05:06,469
So You're here to screw Science

838
01:05:08,178 --> 01:05:11,136
Go ahead. Laugh at my methods

839
01:05:12,261 --> 01:05:16,553
But one day these methods
will bring me success

840
01:05:17,053 --> 01:05:19,886
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

841
01:05:21,344 --> 01:05:25,553
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

842
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:28,636
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

843
01:05:28,886 --> 01:05:33,469
These ideals don't work
in the real world

844
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:38,303
You take your train, I'll take mine

845
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:42,386
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

846
01:05:43,303 --> 01:05:48,219
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

847
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:50,928
you... or I

848
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,011
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

849
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:59,803
It's a challenge

850
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:02,136
Watch it!

851
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:09,678
What's he writing?

852
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:19,469
Don't forget this date

853
01:06:27,803 --> 01:06:30,344
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

854
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:31,928
Get used to them, Pia

855
01:06:32,094 --> 01:06:34,178
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

856
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,428
Where's the bill, man?

857
01:06:39,928 --> 01:06:40,928
I'll be back

858
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:52,968
- You changed the speech?
- What?

859
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:53,969
Don't lie

860
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,386
Um... Yeah

861
01:06:56,636 --> 01:06:59,011
What's your problem with dad?
I have no problem

862
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:02,303
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh

863
01:07:06,678 --> 01:07:08,136
Why're you harassing him?

864
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:10,573
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

865
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,386
Churning out asses.
Like that one

866
01:07:19,553 --> 01:07:20,553
She destroyed it, man

867
01:07:23,969 --> 01:07:25,178
How dare you call him an ass?

868
01:07:25,428 --> 01:07:28,678
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

869
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,594
then becomes a banker in the USA

870
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:34,011
Because it rakes in more money?

871
01:07:34,303 --> 01:07:36,803
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

872
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,053
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

873
01:07:39,428 --> 01:07:43,053
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

874
01:07:43,386 --> 01:07:44,636
It's not you he cares for

875
01:07:46,928 --> 01:07:48,261
Who do you think you are?

876
01:07:48,553 --> 01:07:50,178
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

877
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:54,094
New watch? One moment

878
01:07:55,344 --> 01:07:57,386
You always need a demo

879
01:07:58,469 --> 01:07:59,469
Hey Suhas

880
01:08:01,469 --> 01:08:03,011
Where were you?

881
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:05,094
She's looking for her watch

882
01:08:05,303 --> 01:08:07,053
What? You lost the watch

883
01:08:07,344 --> 01:08:08,469
Never mind. Get another

884
01:08:08,803 --> 01:08:10,053
It cost 400,000!

885
01:08:12,136 --> 01:08:14,053
Mine's just 250Rs
but keeps the same time

886
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:16,553
Keep quiet... How could
you be so careless, Pia

887
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:19,844
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

888
01:08:20,011 --> 01:08:22,553
That was a limited edition watch

889
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:26,386
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

890
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:29,136
What're you staring at?

891
01:08:32,136 --> 01:08:34,844
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

892
01:08:35,428 --> 01:08:36,636
I can't handle this

893
01:08:37,511 --> 01:08:39,594
Stop crying and look for it

894
01:08:53,136 --> 01:08:56,011
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass!

895
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:05,094
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

896
01:09:05,386 --> 01:09:06,386
Get lost

897
01:09:07,053 --> 01:09:08,178
It's too noisy here

898
01:09:08,553 --> 01:09:10,428
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

899
01:09:10,636 --> 01:09:13,428
I said 'Get lost'
Don't get so uptight

900
01:09:13,844 --> 01:09:16,553
Actually, you never
really loved him

901
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:18,011
What do you mean?

902
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:23,011
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

903
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:26,178
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

904
01:09:27,219 --> 01:09:28,928
The Moon appears gigantic?

905
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:32,011
That happens in movies, not in life

906
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:35,178
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

907
01:09:35,553 --> 01:09:36,594
...not an ass

908
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:46,636
Hello. What?

909
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:51,219
Oh God! OK, I'm on my way

910
01:09:54,469 --> 01:09:56,468
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

911
01:09:56,469 --> 01:09:58,136
It's an emergency, please What?

912
01:09:58,678 --> 01:10:01,844
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

913
01:10:02,094 --> 01:10:04,719
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath

914
01:10:05,428 --> 01:10:07,219
Please help me,
it's an emergency

915
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:14,886
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

916
01:10:15,303 --> 01:10:17,636
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

917
01:10:18,178 --> 01:10:19,719
and here I am, helping you!

918
01:10:20,886 --> 01:10:22,053
Unbelievable!

919
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:27,094
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

920
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:33,844
Where's Raju, ma'am?
Gone to get a cab

921
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:35,719
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

922
01:10:36,053 --> 01:10:38,594
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

923
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:39,844
but an ambulance...!

924
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:42,261
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

925
01:10:56,428 --> 01:10:57,428
Hey stop!

926
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:01,969
Move, it's an emergency!

927
01:11:03,636 --> 01:11:04,719
Move... move...

928
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:07,761
Move... move...

929
01:11:11,844 --> 01:11:13,969
Doctor, emergency!

930
01:11:15,594 --> 01:11:16,594
That's the patient

931
01:11:22,469 --> 01:11:24,511
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

932
01:11:25,053 --> 01:11:26,928
What the hell!
You brought dad on the scooter

933
01:11:28,844 --> 01:11:30,136
Should I've sent him by courier?

934
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:33,344
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

935
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:35,761
Go ask the doctor

936
01:11:36,761 --> 01:11:39,969
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

937
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:41,886
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

938
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:44,803
Call me if there's a problem

939
01:11:53,969 --> 01:11:56,928
Rancho! Thank you...

940
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,719
Thanking your buddies!
Silencer teaching you manners?

941
01:12:02,969 --> 01:12:06,011
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

942
01:12:07,844 --> 01:12:10,719
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

943
01:12:11,344 --> 01:12:14,553
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one

944
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:18,511
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

945
01:12:19,178 --> 01:12:20,178
Don't worry

946
01:12:27,178 --> 01:12:31,303
Rancho, forgive me. I was scared

947
01:12:31,594 --> 01:12:33,678
It's OK. Quiet, now

948
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:38,386
Please forgive me

949
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:49,011
It's OK, calm down.
Go see your dad

950
01:12:49,594 --> 01:12:50,928
And don't go
with that weepy face

951
01:12:57,261 --> 01:12:58,261
Thanks buddy

952
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:14,594
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

953
01:13:14,928 --> 01:13:17,219
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

954
01:13:19,886 --> 01:13:21,761
Hey, happy Independence Day

955
01:13:22,053 --> 01:13:23,719
Today isn't Independence Day

956
01:13:24,094 --> 01:13:27,219
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

957
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:30,594
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

958
01:13:32,928 --> 01:13:33,928
Hey

959
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:37,719
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

960
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:41,928
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

961
01:13:42,761 --> 01:13:43,928
Only the watch was old

962
01:13:44,594 --> 01:13:45,594
What could that mean?

963
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:50,928
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

964
01:13:53,803 --> 01:13:54,803
Yes

965
01:13:55,886 --> 01:13:57,594
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

966
01:14:00,178 --> 01:14:02,303
Yes. How do you know?

967
01:14:02,594 --> 01:14:03,594
Seen your dad?

968
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:06,761
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

969
01:14:06,969 --> 01:14:08,553
you'll be a broken egg
...cuckoo bird'

970
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,011

Hello. Wake up

1014
01:18:35,428 --> 01:18:38,135
- Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What!

1015
01:18:38,136 --> 01:18:39,594
No, stupid

1016
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:42,344
It's 8.30, your exam is at 9

1017
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:45,386
But we can't leave him alone

1018
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:48,635
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1019
01:18:48,636 --> 01:18:51,261
Take my scooter.
It's getting late

1020
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:52,761
Hey...

1021
01:18:57,178 --> 01:18:58,511
Gosh, what an ancient watch

1022
01:19:05,094 --> 01:19:06,094
Go

1023
01:19:24,136 --> 01:19:26,511
Sorry, we're late
It was an emergency

1024
01:19:32,428 --> 01:19:33,511
Settle down there

1025
01:19:38,094 --> 01:19:39,303
Sir, they're still writing

1026
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:42,344
Hello. Time up

1027
01:19:43,219 --> 01:19:45,803
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

1028
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:47,302
It was an emergency

1029
01:19:47,303 --> 01:19:51,553
<i>He glared at us like we'd
asked for both his kidneys</i>

1030
01:19:52,803 --> 01:19:53,928
<i>But we continued writing</i>

1031
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:57,928
<i>He continued arranging
the answer sheets</i>

1032
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:07,469
Done, sir

1033
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,969
You're late.
I can't accept these

1034
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:12,219
Sir, please, sir

1035
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:17,928
Sir, do you know who we are?

1036
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:21,219
Prime Ministers son? Even then...

1037
01:20:21,553 --> 01:20:23,594
I will not accept your paper

1038
01:20:25,136 --> 01:20:27,094
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1039
01:20:28,428 --> 01:20:29,511
No...

1040
01:20:31,386 --> 01:20:32,510
Who are you?

1041
01:20:32,511 --> 01:20:34,469
He doesn't know - Run!

1042
01:20:36,178 --> 01:20:38,428
Hey, what's your roll number?

1043
01:20:39,261 --> 01:20:43,511
Where the hell are their papers?

1044
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:49,968
O Lord, have mercy

1045
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:55,719
<i>Today was Results day.
Time to make a deal with God</i>

1046
01:20:55,886 --> 01:20:58,344
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut

1047
01:20:58,844 --> 01:21:03,719
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1048
01:21:03,969 --> 01:21:07,344
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass

1049
01:21:07,636 --> 01:21:10,928
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1050
01:21:11,261 --> 01:21:12,678
Watch over my results

1051
01:21:12,928 --> 01:21:16,761
God of Wealth,
I'll offer 100Rs every month

1052
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:19,594
<i>100Rs won't bribe even a traffic cop</i>

1053
01:21:20,344 --> 01:21:22,136
<i>let alone the Almighty</i>

1054
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:25,428
Check from the bottom

1055
01:21:26,469 --> 01:21:28,553
You are... last

1056
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,303
And you?

1057
01:21:33,261 --> 01:21:34,678
Second last

1058
01:21:36,303 --> 01:21:37,344
Rancho?

1059
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:42,844
Not there

1060
01:21:44,261 --> 01:21:45,261
My heart sank

1061
01:21:45,886 --> 01:21:50,261
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked

1062
01:21:52,761 --> 01:21:56,428
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1063
01:22:00,594 --> 01:22:03,469
What's Silencer howling about?

1064
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:05,136
He got the second rank

1065
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:08,428
Who's first?

1066
01:22:09,678 --> 01:22:10,761
Rancho

1067
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:14,678
Rancho?

1068
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:18,011
Move aside

1069
01:22:22,636 --> 01:22:24,886
<i>We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:</i>

1070
01:22:25,719 --> 01:22:31,053
<i>Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse</i>

1071
01:22:31,803 --> 01:22:36,178
<i>We were sad.
Two others were sadder</i>

1072
01:22:37,469 --> 01:22:41,303
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director

1073
01:22:41,969 --> 01:22:44,219
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1074
01:22:45,178 --> 01:22:48,386
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1075
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:52,844
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1076
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:55,469
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1077
01:22:56,678 --> 01:22:57,886
Any problem with that?

1078
01:22:58,053 --> 01:23:02,136
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1079
01:23:02,636 --> 01:23:05,761
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1080
01:23:06,094 --> 01:23:09,344
It's not nice, sir
You have a better idea?

1081
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:14,094
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1082
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:18,636
Why publicize someone's flaws?

1083
01:23:18,969 --> 01:23:23,969
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1084
01:23:24,136 --> 01:23:25,553
or air your report on TV

1085
01:23:26,428 --> 01:23:27,469
You see, sir?

1086
01:23:28,094 --> 01:23:29,844
So basically,
what you are saying is

1087
01:23:30,386 --> 01:23:32,146
I should personally go to
each student's room

1088
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:34,261
and whisper in his ears...

1089
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,843
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1090
01:23:37,844 --> 01:23:39,386
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1091
01:23:42,428 --> 01:23:46,761
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1092
01:23:49,136 --> 01:23:51,053
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1093
01:23:51,344 --> 01:23:53,719
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1094
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:55,428
At least they're in the corner

1095
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:57,969
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1096
01:23:59,136 --> 01:24:01,094
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1097
01:24:01,928 --> 01:24:05,761
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1098
01:24:06,261 --> 01:24:08,053
prefers humans to machines

1099
01:24:09,969 --> 01:24:11,761
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1100
01:24:13,803 --> 01:24:16,094
You guarantee it!

1101
01:24:16,344 --> 01:24:17,844
Bet, sir?

1102
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:22,553
Govind - Yes, sir?

1103
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:30,011
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1104
01:24:31,261 --> 01:24:32,428
shave off my moustache

1105
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:36,053
Sir!

1106
01:24:36,386 --> 01:24:39,386
- Happy?
- Smile, please

1107
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:41,719
Happy, sir

1108
01:24:46,053 --> 01:24:49,594
Jackass!
Honking to hide your tooting

1109
01:24:50,178 --> 01:24:52,844
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1110
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:55,761
I didn't do it... Raju?

1111
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:57,718
This is a familiar stink

1112
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:00,719
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1113
01:25:26,011 --> 01:25:28,594
Toss me your wallet - I'll buy pants

1114
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:33,344
Take Chatur's suit instead
Don't touch my suit

1115
01:25:34,553 --> 01:25:36,303
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1116
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:40,469
Where's this?
If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1117
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,261
He can't read - But he can speak

1118
01:25:43,511 --> 01:25:47,469
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1119
01:25:47,719 --> 01:25:49,428
Yes, he lives there

1120
01:25:50,136 --> 01:25:55,428
<i>Free as the wind was he</i>

1121
01:25:57,469 --> 01:26:02,844
<i>Like a soaring kite was he</i>

1122
01:26:04,553 --> 01:26:06,803
<i>Where did he go...</i>

1123
01:26:07,053 --> 01:26:09,261
<i>let's find him</i>

1124
01:26:09,428 --> 01:26:12,135
Chatur, your pills
Thanks. Where were they?

1125
01:26:12,136 --> 01:26:14,636
In the pocket - Hey, my pants!

1126
01:26:14,803 --> 01:26:16,761
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1127
01:26:18,386 --> 01:26:20,303
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1128
01:26:21,886 --> 01:26:22,886
I want it now

1129
01:26:38,178 --> 01:26:39,261
What happened?

1130
01:26:41,428 --> 01:26:42,594
Rancho's father

1131
01:26:46,136 --> 01:26:48,844
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

1132
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:52,094
There he is - Thank you

1133
01:27:15,303 --> 01:27:18,428
Rancho... - Yes?

1134
01:27:19,053 --> 01:27:22,719
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1135
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:25,053
I am Ranchhoddas

1136
01:27:25,678 --> 01:27:29,553
No, I mean... 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1137
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:33,553
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1138
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:41,303
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1139
01:28:00,803 --> 01:28:02,719
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1140
01:28:09,928 --> 01:28:10,928
Raju

1141
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:39,645
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1142
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:40,931
That too, for the wrong guy!

1143
01:28:41,436 --> 01:28:45,353
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1144
01:28:45,978 --> 01:28:47,395
What's going on?

1145
01:28:48,145 --> 01:28:50,770
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1146
01:28:51,978 --> 01:28:52,978
Good point!

1147
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,645
Hey Chatur, come here

1148
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:05,311
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1149
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,020
Handmade biscuits

1150
01:29:08,895 --> 01:29:11,103
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1151
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:13,644
Phunsukh Bangdu? Who's that?

1152
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:18,352
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1153
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:21,269
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1154
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,936
400 patents. The world wants him

1155
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,436
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1156
01:29:29,228 --> 01:29:34,769
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1157
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:38,895
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1158
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:40,978
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1159
01:29:41,395 --> 01:29:44,936
He led me to Rancho, See this

1160
01:29:47,145 --> 01:29:51,685
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1161
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:55,978
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1162
01:29:56,145 --> 01:30:01,810
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1163
01:30:01,811 --> 01:30:03,436
What happened to his face?

1164
01:30:03,853 --> 01:30:06,145
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1165
01:30:10,561 --> 01:30:12,353
Only one man has the answer

1166
01:30:12,978 --> 01:30:17,603
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1167
01:30:19,103 --> 01:30:22,853
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1168
01:30:23,811 --> 01:30:26,270
But I waited
for the highway tender

1169
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:32,228
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1170
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:40,811
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1171
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,311
Wrong

1172
01:30:42,811 --> 01:30:45,603
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1173
01:30:45,936 --> 01:30:47,186
You were a very good son

1174
01:30:49,853 --> 01:30:54,561
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1175
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:57,936
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made inquiries

1176
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:01,311
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1177
01:31:01,811 --> 01:31:05,020
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1178
01:31:20,645 --> 01:31:22,020
This is a 150 acre estate

1179
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:25,645
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1180
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,020
Get the point?

1181
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,270
Now get lost

1182
01:31:34,728 --> 01:31:38,978
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1183
01:31:46,478 --> 01:31:48,020
Grab Papa!

1184
01:31:50,978 --> 01:31:52,061
Here, here

1185
01:31:56,228 --> 01:31:57,228
Let go of Papa!

1186
01:32:00,186 --> 01:32:02,978
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed!

1187
01:32:03,145 --> 01:32:06,020
Hand over Papa
Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1188
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:10,061
Get Papa out of the potty
You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1189
01:32:10,228 --> 01:32:11,602
I'll count to three

1190
01:32:11,603 --> 01:32:15,311
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1191
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,020
One

1192
01:32:19,186 --> 01:32:23,895
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1193
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:26,186
Two

1194
01:32:26,187 --> 01:32:28,603
Then grope for him in the gutter

1195
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:29,770
What is it, Raju?

1196
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:33,520
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1197
01:32:34,436 --> 01:32:35,436
Empty?

1198
01:32:36,728 --> 01:32:40,145
Empty - we'll empty it out!

1199
01:32:40,311 --> 01:32:41,270
No, no!

1200
01:32:41,271 --> 01:32:44,227
We'll empty it out

1201
01:32:44,228 --> 01:32:46,645
No... hands up!

1202
01:32:48,978 --> 01:32:51,978
Who are you?

1203
01:32:52,186 --> 01:32:53,270
I am Rancho

1204
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:57,020
I swear on Papa, it's true

1205
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:59,020
I am Rancho! That was Chhote.

1206
01:33:00,186 --> 01:33:01,186
Chhote?

1207
01:33:02,395 --> 01:33:07,353
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1208
01:33:09,353 --> 01:33:12,145
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1209
01:33:14,395 --> 01:33:22,186
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1210
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:24,895
He had a passion for learning

1211
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,811
<i>He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school</i>

1212
01:33:32,853 --> 01:33:35,770
<i>And attend any class he liked.
It suited me</i>

1213
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:42,811
<i>I made him do my homework,
take my exams</i>

1214
01:33:43,353 --> 01:33:46,353
<i>It was going well, till
one day...</i>

1215
01:33:46,811 --> 01:33:51,435
<i>Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math</i>

1216
01:33:51,436 --> 01:33:52,936
Which grade are you in, son?

1217
01:33:54,186 --> 01:33:55,353
What's your name?

1218
01:33:56,353 --> 01:33:57,353
<i>We got caught</i>

1219
01:33:58,478 --> 01:33:59,811
<i>Papa was a powerful man, so...</i>

1220
01:33:59,978 --> 01:34:03,436
<i>our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal</i>

1221
01:34:03,978 --> 01:34:07,895
You started it, you will finish it

1222
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,395
People pretend to show me respect

1223
01:34:14,145 --> 01:34:16,311
But behind my back...

1224
01:34:17,311 --> 01:34:18,895
mock me as an illiterate

1225
01:34:19,936 --> 01:34:21,936
I won't let that happen to my son

1226
01:34:23,061 --> 01:34:27,353
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1227
01:34:27,936 --> 01:34:29,853
Let the game go on

1228
01:34:30,895 --> 01:34:32,478
Make this kid an engineer

1229
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:39,103
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1230
01:34:39,478 --> 01:34:43,436
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1231
01:34:45,145 --> 01:34:51,270
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1232
01:34:53,436 --> 01:35:01,436
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1233
01:35:06,645 --> 01:35:08,270
He really misses you both

1234
01:35:10,728 --> 01:35:14,645
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1235
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:21,478
But please keep my secret

1236
01:35:23,395 --> 01:35:24,520
What secret?

1237
01:35:37,895 --> 01:35:41,353
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1238
01:35:43,603 --> 01:35:46,227
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1239
01:35:46,228 --> 01:35:49,810
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1240
01:35:49,811 --> 01:35:52,061
Ignore it - Where're we going?

1241
01:35:53,436 --> 01:35:54,395
Ladakh

1242
01:35:54,396 --> 01:35:55,728
Ladakh! Why?

1243
01:35:56,478 --> 01:35:57,478
To meet Rancho

1244
01:35:57,603 --> 01:36:00,644
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1245
01:36:00,645 --> 01:36:04,186
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1246
01:36:04,478 --> 01:36:07,520
School teacher!

1247
01:36:08,436 --> 01:36:11,811
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1248
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:14,520
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1249
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:15,895
D for Donkey

1250
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:21,561
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1251
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:24,770
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1252
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,895
<i>Today my respect
for that idiot shot up</i>

1253
01:36:31,853 --> 01:36:34,145
<i>Most of us went to college
just for a degree</i>

1254
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:38,936
<i>No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...</i>

1255
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:41,811
<i>no credit card, no social status</i>

1256
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,311
<i>None of this mattered to him</i>

1257
01:36:44,478 --> 01:36:46,270
<i>He was in college
for the joy of learning</i>

1258
01:36:46,811 --> 01:36:50,061
<i>He never cared
if he was first or last</i>

1259
01:36:50,686 --> 01:36:52,978
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1260
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:54,560
Neil Armstrong, sir

1261
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:56,686
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1262
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:58,103
Who was the second?

1263
01:36:58,645 --> 01:37:00,245
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1264
01:37:00,728 --> 01:37:03,186
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1265
01:37:04,353 --> 01:37:09,770
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1266
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:15,895
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1267
01:37:16,686 --> 01:37:18,520
This is your last lap, my friends

1268
01:37:18,895 --> 01:37:21,185
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1269
01:37:21,186 --> 01:37:23,145
Go out there and make history!

1270
01:37:26,603 --> 01:37:27,811
Any questions?

1271
01:37:30,353 --> 01:37:31,353
Yes?

1272
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:36,186
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1273
01:37:36,603 --> 01:37:43,853
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1274
01:37:44,395 --> 01:37:45,686
Very good question

1275
01:37:48,978 --> 01:37:51,311
Anyone else
with the same question?

1276
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:54,561
As expected

1277
01:37:56,936 --> 01:38:00,020
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1278
01:38:11,228 --> 01:38:13,560
For the last four years

1279
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:16,478
they've been our most
consistent students

1280
01:38:16,645 --> 01:38:19,936
Consistently last in every exam

1281
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:22,145
Come my geniuses, come

1282
01:38:23,645 --> 01:38:29,228
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1283
01:38:29,978 --> 01:38:32,978
'Cause they're completely unused

1284
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,728
And to answer their question -

1285
01:38:37,145 --> 01:38:40,436
The exam won't affect their jobs

1286
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:44,770
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1287
01:38:45,645 --> 01:38:48,645
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1288
01:38:48,978 --> 01:38:51,977
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1289
01:38:51,978 --> 01:38:53,498
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1290
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:07,395
He screwed us!

1291
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:09,478
In front of everyone

1292
01:39:10,645 --> 01:39:15,852
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1293
01:39:15,853 --> 01:39:17,727
Do me just one favor -

1294
01:39:17,728 --> 01:39:20,145
Delete Virus!

1295
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:23,770
Burn him in hell

1296
01:39:25,186 --> 01:39:28,978
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1297
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:32,603
You think God is a contract killer?

1298
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:34,520
You shut up

1299
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:38,227
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1300
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:40,145
We're rotting in the corner

1301
01:39:41,228 --> 01:39:44,228
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1302
01:39:46,728 --> 01:39:48,520
- Know why I come first?
- Why?

1303
01:39:48,978 --> 01:39:50,645
Because I love machines

1304
01:39:51,478 --> 01:39:53,270
Engineering is my passion

1305
01:39:54,353 --> 01:39:55,561
Know your passion?

1306
01:39:58,436 --> 01:40:00,103
That's my bag - Be quiet

1307
01:40:01,103 --> 01:40:02,395
What're you up to?

1308
01:40:04,853 --> 01:40:06,978
This... is your passion

1309
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:09,645
Go post this letter

1310
01:40:10,061 --> 01:40:11,353
What letter?

1311
01:40:14,103 --> 01:40:18,353
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1312
01:40:19,145 --> 01:40:21,895
Andre... - Istvan

1313
01:40:22,895 --> 01:40:26,478
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1314
01:40:27,436 --> 01:40:30,728
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1315
01:40:32,478 --> 01:40:36,020
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1316
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:38,978
Follow your talent

1317
01:40:42,145 --> 01:40:46,145
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1318
01:40:46,978 --> 01:40:50,478
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1319
01:40:51,228 --> 01:40:52,520
imagine the disaster

1320
01:40:54,603 --> 01:40:57,103
Do you get it?

1321
01:41:00,686 --> 01:41:03,978
Idiot! Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1322
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,020
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1323
01:41:11,353 --> 01:41:15,478
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1324
01:41:16,936 --> 01:41:19,436
- But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1325
01:41:20,603 --> 01:41:22,936
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1326
01:41:24,686 --> 01:41:29,145
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1327
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:32,895
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1328
01:41:34,395 --> 01:41:38,145
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1329
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,645
How'll you focus on studies?

1330
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:45,103
Strange buddies! One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1331
01:41:46,103 --> 01:41:51,436
You live in both - fear and pretense

1332
01:41:51,686 --> 01:41:57,728
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't

1333
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,311
What rubbish!

1334
01:42:02,978 --> 01:42:07,144
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1335
01:42:07,145 --> 01:42:10,353
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1336
01:42:10,853 --> 01:42:14,810
There's no connection!
Deep connection, Your Holiness

1337
01:42:14,811 --> 01:42:20,270
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1338
01:42:20,728 --> 01:42:25,145
I'll tell Dad - No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1339
01:42:26,353 --> 01:42:29,978
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1340
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:31,478
Deal?

1341
01:42:33,603 --> 01:42:35,353
Have the guts?

1342
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,770
His Holiness is speechless

1343
01:42:43,853 --> 01:42:44,853
Let's go

1344
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:51,061
Follow me - Where?

1345
01:42:56,728 --> 01:42:58,228
Let's go

1346
01:42:58,686 --> 01:43:01,894
Hey Virus! I'm anti-Virus

1347
01:43:01,895 --> 01:43:03,353
Hope no dog here

1348
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,895
Cowards! Let's go

1349
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:09,728
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1350
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:23,561
Beware - Virus inside

1351
01:43:44,186 --> 01:43:45,353
Need background score?

1352
01:43:45,603 --> 01:43:46,603
Pia - Who's it?

1353
01:43:49,353 --> 01:43:53,020
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1354
01:43:54,978 --> 01:43:58,353
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1355
01:43:58,686 --> 01:44:01,061
<i>♪ Say not a word...</i>

1356
01:44:01,436 --> 01:44:02,436
Pia... - Yes?

1357
01:44:04,561 --> 01:44:07,853
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1358
01:44:08,728 --> 01:44:13,270
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1359
01:44:17,728 --> 01:44:23,103
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1360
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:24,270
Wow

1361
01:44:25,395 --> 01:44:28,478
<i>♪ ...and time stands still</i>

1362
01:44:29,561 --> 01:44:36,978
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1363
01:44:39,978 --> 01:44:42,270
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1364
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:48,686
and come close to kiss me

1365
01:44:51,811 --> 01:44:54,061
But that kiss doesn't happen

1366
01:44:54,936 --> 01:44:55,936
Why?

1367
01:44:56,186 --> 01:44:59,311
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1368
01:45:00,436 --> 01:45:02,061
The noses never collide, stupid!

1369
01:45:07,228 --> 01:45:10,270
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1370
01:45:10,895 --> 01:45:11,895
I wish I was

1371
01:45:12,145 --> 01:45:13,895
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1372
01:45:14,395 --> 01:45:16,186
It took him four years
to say this

1373
01:45:16,436 --> 01:45:19,560
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1374
01:45:19,561 --> 01:45:22,770
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1375
01:45:23,353 --> 01:45:24,978
- Who's this?
- My sister

1376
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,020
Who're you?

1377
01:45:36,728 --> 01:45:40,519
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time!

1378
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:44,311
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1379
01:45:44,645 --> 01:45:48,645
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1380
01:45:49,645 --> 01:45:50,645
Meaning?

1381
01:45:50,728 --> 01:45:53,561
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1382
01:45:54,395 --> 01:45:59,853
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1383
01:46:00,978 --> 01:46:04,686
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1384
01:46:04,853 --> 01:46:10,228
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1385
01:46:11,103 --> 01:46:16,311
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1386
01:46:17,145 --> 01:46:20,478
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1387
01:46:21,395 --> 01:46:22,395
He kicked

1388
01:46:24,186 --> 01:46:25,228
Say it again

1389
01:46:26,478 --> 01:46:28,061
All is well

1390
01:46:28,978 --> 01:46:30,645
Kicked again

1391
01:46:32,311 --> 01:46:35,270
Once more - All is well

1392
01:46:39,811 --> 01:46:43,936
All is well

1393
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,520
Who is it?

1394
01:46:46,353 --> 01:46:47,353
Go

1395
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:53,144
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1396
01:46:53,145 --> 01:46:57,561
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1397
01:47:04,061 --> 01:47:06,770
Who is it? Your future son-in-law

1398
01:47:07,061 --> 01:47:08,520
And the wedding party

1399
01:47:09,395 --> 01:47:10,436
Rastogi!

1400
01:47:12,895 --> 01:47:14,686
Security, that way

1401
01:47:44,311 --> 01:47:48,020
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1402
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:52,645
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1403
01:47:54,103 --> 01:47:58,061
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1404
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,561
Let me demonstrate to you

1405
01:48:00,186 --> 01:48:02,103
- What's this?
- Pencil

1406
01:48:02,436 --> 01:48:03,935
- What's inside?
- Lead

1407
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:06,061
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1408
01:48:06,603 --> 01:48:09,561
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1409
01:48:17,228 --> 01:48:19,811
Where is Raju Rastogi?
Present, sir

1410
01:48:27,311 --> 01:48:29,186
Hi. Everybody is here

1411
01:48:30,895 --> 01:48:31,936
Good morning, sir

1412
01:48:32,895 --> 01:48:34,061
Where were you last night?

1413
01:48:34,645 --> 01:48:37,686
Studying all night, sir
Studying?

1414
01:48:37,895 --> 01:48:38,895
Really?

1415
01:48:38,978 --> 01:48:42,060
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1416
01:48:42,061 --> 01:48:43,061
Not slept?

1417
01:48:43,145 --> 01:48:44,145
What did you study?

1418
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:49,270
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1419
01:48:49,603 --> 01:48:50,603
Whole chapter?

1420
01:48:50,728 --> 01:48:52,852
In that case, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1421
01:48:52,853 --> 01:48:53,853
Yes sir!

1422
01:48:53,895 --> 01:48:56,520
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1423
01:49:04,645 --> 01:49:05,645
Stop it

1424
01:49:13,228 --> 01:49:15,478
Sir, rum

1425
01:49:17,395 --> 01:49:18,395
Mr. Rastogi

1426
01:49:18,895 --> 01:49:21,228
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1427
01:49:27,353 --> 01:49:28,353
Sir?

1428
01:49:29,478 --> 01:49:30,478
Close the door

1429
01:49:35,645 --> 01:49:36,686
Can you type?

1430
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:39,020
Yes, sir

1431
01:49:39,103 --> 01:49:40,520
Will you type a letter for me?

1432
01:49:42,645 --> 01:49:43,686
Definitely, sir

1433
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:45,020
Come, sit

1434
01:49:45,728 --> 01:49:46,728
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1435
01:49:49,145 --> 01:49:50,145
Please type

1436
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:52,770
Dear Sir...

1437
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:56,936
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1438
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:00,936
that your son is rusticated...

1439
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:04,270
No, sorry, delete that. Go back

1440
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:09,061
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1441
01:50:10,186 --> 01:50:14,311
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1442
01:50:14,936 --> 01:50:16,311
Come on, type

1443
01:50:23,811 --> 01:50:25,478
It'll kill my dad, sir

1444
01:50:25,686 --> 01:50:27,436
Please type - Sir, please sir

1445
01:50:27,936 --> 01:50:31,853
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1446
01:50:33,936 --> 01:50:39,144
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1447
01:50:39,145 --> 01:50:43,395
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1448
01:50:43,561 --> 01:50:47,978
Sir, give me one chance... please

1449
01:50:53,603 --> 01:50:56,978
OK, remove your name
from the letter...

1450
01:50:58,353 --> 01:51:00,478
and put in Rancho's

1451
01:51:01,936 --> 01:51:04,103
I know he was with you
last night

1452
01:51:04,978 --> 01:51:09,020
Be my witness and I'll spare you

1453
01:51:12,603 --> 01:51:16,603

01:52:59,395 --> 01:53:02,103
Rancho, watch that monitor

1465
01:53:02,436 --> 01:53:03,436
Raju

1466
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:08,145
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1467
01:53:08,686 --> 01:53:12,978
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1468
01:53:14,853 --> 01:53:19,228
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1469
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:24,895
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1470
01:53:25,145 --> 01:53:26,478
The new medicine worked

1471
01:53:26,936 --> 01:53:29,728
Is this your family tradition -

1472
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:33,645
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1473
01:53:33,853 --> 01:53:35,561
Come, wake up

1474
01:53:36,478 --> 01:53:37,853
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1475
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:41,811
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1476
01:53:47,853 --> 01:53:52,145
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1477
01:53:54,436 --> 01:53:57,228
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1478
01:53:57,603 --> 01:53:59,811
Problem solved... Wake up now

1479
01:54:00,145 --> 01:54:02,853
Everything's resolved!
You hear that?

1480
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:06,061

01:55:03,645 --> 01:55:07,478
Look, mom bought a new saree
Brand new

1492
01:55:07,645 --> 01:55:09,228
It cost 2000Rs.

1493
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:11,145
Wake up now

1494
01:55:12,353 --> 01:55:14,436
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1495
01:55:14,936 --> 01:55:15,936
Look!

1496
01:55:17,936 --> 01:55:19,102
Hey Raju!

1497
01:55:19,103 --> 01:55:22,103

1504
01:55:56,186 --> 01:55:59,603
Did you hear about your sis?

1505
01:56:00,561 --> 01:56:03,228
She's getting married

1506
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:05,561
Without any dowry

1507
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:11,145
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1508
01:56:11,395 --> 01:56:14,853
He just wants Kammo

1509
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:19,727
You know who the bridegroom is?
Yeah

1510
01:56:19,728 --> 01:56:20,645
Guess!

1511
01:56:20,646 --> 01:56:22,520
You know him very well - Yes

1512
01:56:22,728 --> 01:56:24,353
He loves animals - Huh...?

1513
01:56:25,186 --> 01:56:27,310
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1514
01:56:27,311 --> 01:56:28,977
Quiet... Shhhh...

1515
01:56:28,978 --> 01:56:32,103
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1516
01:56:33,103 --> 01:56:37,186
Farhan will never take any dowry

1517
01:56:37,853 --> 01:56:42,186
Farhan will marry your sister

1518
01:56:42,645 --> 01:56:46,770
For free! Free! Free!

1519
01:56:47,853 --> 01:56:49,936
Raju!

1520
01:56:56,936 --> 01:57:00,686
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1521
01:57:01,103 --> 01:57:02,811
Why sacrifice me...!

1522
01:57:03,103 --> 01:57:05,061
Well done, buddy

1523
01:57:05,895 --> 01:57:09,395
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1524

1525
01:57:14,145 --> 01:57:17,270

You called for a taxi?

1534
01:58:06,353 --> 01:58:08,103
I did - It's waiting

1535
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:09,728
Thank you. Why?

1536
01:58:10,186 --> 01:58:11,478
I'm going to the job interview

1537
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:12,978
You coming with me?

1538
01:58:13,395 --> 01:58:17,978
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1539
01:58:18,145 --> 01:58:19,478
Why would I go home?

1540
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:24,436
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1541
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:29,853
Give me your tie

1542
01:58:31,436 --> 01:58:32,436
Why?

1543
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:36,395
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1544
01:58:37,353 --> 01:58:38,353
What's that?

1545
01:58:38,436 --> 01:58:41,270
A letter - For you, from Hungary

1546
01:58:41,645 --> 01:58:44,228
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1547
01:58:52,186 --> 01:58:53,936
You posted my letter!

1548
01:58:54,145 --> 01:58:55,811
He loved your pictures

1549
01:58:56,311 --> 01:58:58,936
The guy wants you to assist him...

1550
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:03,270
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1551
01:59:03,686 --> 01:59:05,228
Will pay you, too

1552
01:59:21,186 --> 01:59:22,436
Dad will never agree

1553
01:59:25,061 --> 01:59:27,686
Go speak to him...
from your heart

1554
01:59:29,395 --> 01:59:30,520
For once, dump your fears...

1555
01:59:31,228 --> 01:59:37,228
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1556
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:40,450
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1557
01:59:40,478 --> 01:59:44,228
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1558
01:59:50,811 --> 01:59:52,728
Do you think he'll like it?

1559
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:55,686
Why such an expensive gift?

1560
01:59:56,853 --> 01:59:59,270
Our son's getting
his first job today

1561
02:00:00,603 --> 02:00:04,478
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1562
02:00:06,436 --> 02:00:07,436
Farhan?

1563
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,770
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1564
02:00:16,603 --> 02:00:17,603
I didn't go

1565
02:00:20,228 --> 02:00:21,936
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1566
02:00:26,186 --> 02:00:28,103
What happened?
You had an accident?

1567
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:36,978
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1568
02:00:39,811 --> 02:00:40,811
Why?

1569
02:00:41,061 --> 02:00:43,353
Because I was rusticated
from college

1570
02:00:46,311 --> 02:00:47,311
Why?

1571
02:00:47,645 --> 02:00:52,436
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1572
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:58,395
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1573
02:00:58,561 --> 02:01:02,270
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1574
02:01:04,436 --> 02:01:09,020
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1575
02:01:09,395 --> 02:01:10,936
Then work will become play

1576
02:01:11,103 --> 02:01:12,978
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1577
02:01:13,645 --> 02:01:17,352
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1578
02:01:17,353 --> 02:01:18,520
Five years from now...

1579
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:24,102
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1580
02:01:24,103 --> 02:01:28,061
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1581
02:01:30,145 --> 02:01:31,895
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1582
02:01:32,061 --> 02:01:33,228
The world will laugh!

1583
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:36,478
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1584
02:01:37,395 --> 02:01:43,061
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1585
02:01:43,353 --> 02:01:45,478
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1586
02:01:48,311 --> 02:01:50,791
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1587
02:01:52,936 --> 02:01:55,895
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1588
02:01:58,770 --> 02:01:59,978
You did all that, Dad

1589
02:02:02,478 --> 02:02:07,895
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1590
02:02:09,103 --> 02:02:10,936
I don't even know his first name

1591
02:02:11,103 --> 02:02:13,978
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1592
02:02:14,186 --> 02:02:16,895
Enough, please... he's upset

1593
02:02:18,186 --> 02:02:20,603
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1594
02:02:20,853 --> 02:02:22,395
Then the discussion is over

1595
02:02:22,728 --> 02:02:26,478
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1596
02:02:29,978 --> 02:02:34,936
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1597
02:02:37,478 --> 02:02:44,436
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1598
02:02:46,061 --> 02:02:49,853
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1599
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:53,352
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1600
02:02:53,353 --> 02:02:55,103
when you see my dead body

1601
02:03:00,436 --> 02:03:04,436
I want to convince you, Dad

1602
02:03:05,936 --> 02:03:08,353
but not with a suicide threat

1603
02:03:12,145 --> 02:03:15,936
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1604
02:03:16,270 --> 02:03:17,478
I'll earn less

1605
02:03:18,436 --> 02:03:20,103
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1606
02:03:22,186 --> 02:03:23,686
But I'll be happy

1607
02:03:25,395 --> 02:03:26,645
I will be really happy

1608
02:03:27,978 --> 02:03:29,898
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1609
02:03:31,561 --> 02:03:33,270
I've always listened to you

1610
02:03:33,686 --> 02:03:36,770
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1611
02:03:38,895 --> 02:03:39,895
Please... Dad

1612
02:03:46,228 --> 02:03:47,228
Dad...

1613
02:03:48,395 --> 02:03:49,603
Please don't go away...

1614
02:03:55,853 --> 02:03:57,020
Return this

1615
02:04:00,561 --> 02:04:02,978
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1616
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:06,020
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1617
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,353
If you need more money, just ask

1618
02:04:18,186 --> 02:04:20,103
Go live your life, my son

1619
02:04:23,061 --> 02:04:27,311
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1620
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:29,020
Fear

1621
02:04:29,978 --> 02:04:31,378
I was a good student
since childhood

1622
02:04:32,145 --> 02:04:34,270
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1623
02:04:36,228 --> 02:04:37,228
That scared me

1624
02:04:38,728 --> 02:04:42,186
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1625
02:04:43,936 --> 02:04:44,936
My fear grew

1626
02:04:46,645 --> 02:04:48,061
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1627
02:04:48,728 --> 02:04:51,103
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1628
02:04:52,145 --> 02:04:56,561
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors

1629
02:04:59,686 --> 02:05:02,770
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1630
02:05:03,353 --> 02:05:04,561
Finally, sense dawned

1631
02:05:06,103 --> 02:05:11,228
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1632
02:05:13,728 --> 02:05:17,686
If you reject me, no regrets

1633
02:05:18,061 --> 02:05:22,145
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1634
02:05:22,728 --> 02:05:27,895
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1635
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:32,894
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1636
02:05:32,895 --> 02:05:35,228
You're too straightforward

1637
02:05:37,145 --> 02:05:38,145
But...

1638
02:05:39,145 --> 02:05:45,561
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1639
02:05:45,728 --> 02:05:48,686
we may consider you

1640
02:05:52,061 --> 02:05:55,186
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1641
02:05:57,103 --> 02:05:58,895
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1642
02:05:59,645 --> 02:06:00,645
Can't change it, sir

1643
02:06:04,186 --> 02:06:09,395
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude

1644
02:06:09,561 --> 02:06:10,895
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1645
02:06:15,311 --> 02:06:16,311
Wait

1646
02:06:18,145 --> 02:06:22,103
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1647
02:06:22,561 --> 02:06:25,395
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1648
02:06:25,603 --> 02:06:26,936
Where did you spring from, son?

1649
02:06:28,895 --> 02:06:29,895
Sir?

1650
02:06:29,978 --> 02:06:32,561
Shall we discuss the salary?

1651
02:06:40,145 --> 02:06:41,145
Thank you, sir

1652
02:07:13,603 --> 02:07:17,770
Your Majesty, thou art great

1653
02:07:19,728 --> 02:07:21,353
Accept this humble offering

1654
02:07:57,978 --> 02:08:01,395
Govind!

1655
02:08:03,478 --> 02:08:06,936
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'

1656
02:08:14,186 --> 02:08:15,186
What have you done?

1657
02:08:18,811 --> 02:08:22,186
I feel naked without
my moustache

1658
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,395
I've lost my dignity

1659
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:30,936
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1660
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:36,270
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1661
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:41,686
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1662
02:08:44,936 --> 02:08:47,478
Dad, that's not fair

1663
02:08:49,853 --> 02:08:53,353
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1664
02:08:53,895 --> 02:08:57,186
And this is World War... III

1665
02:08:58,686 --> 02:08:59,726
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1666
02:09:04,686 --> 02:09:05,686
Hey

1667
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:09,020
What're you doing here?

1668
02:09:11,895 --> 02:09:12,895
Be careful

1669
02:09:18,436 --> 02:09:22,270
You've been drinking
Yup, had to down a couple

1670
02:09:22,853 --> 02:09:25,144
A couple too many!

1671
02:09:25,145 --> 02:09:27,020
Needed the guts - For what?

1672
02:09:28,811 --> 02:09:30,311
For stealing this - What's this?

1673
02:09:31,436 --> 02:09:35,561
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1674
02:09:38,103 --> 02:09:40,395
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1675
02:09:41,103 --> 02:09:45,061
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1676
02:09:45,395 --> 02:09:46,395
Go get it!

1677
02:09:47,395 --> 02:09:49,936
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating!

1678
02:09:54,436 --> 02:09:57,645
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1679
02:09:59,186 --> 02:10:00,186
Tell me something...

1680
02:10:02,145 --> 02:10:03,311
Do you really feel...

1681
02:10:04,895 --> 02:10:10,395
the noses collide while kissing?

1682
02:10:15,853 --> 02:10:19,561
Wait. Have some dhokla

1683
02:10:22,061 --> 02:10:24,645
You Gujaratis are so cute

1684
02:10:25,603 --> 02:10:28,895
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1685
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:35,228
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1686
02:10:36,395 --> 02:10:38,560
Sound like missiles

1687
02:10:38,561 --> 02:10:39,561
C'mon

1688
02:10:39,645 --> 02:10:42,103
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1689
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:45,603
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1690
02:10:45,978 --> 02:10:46,978
C'mon

1691
02:10:50,353 --> 02:10:51,353
Oh...

1692
02:10:52,853 --> 02:10:57,270
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1693
02:10:58,228 --> 02:11:01,520
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad' - Yuck

1694
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:05,311
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1695
02:11:07,186 --> 02:11:10,145
Pia, we can't get married

1696
02:11:13,728 --> 02:11:14,728
Why?

1697
02:11:15,478 --> 02:11:16,895
Is there someone else?

1698
02:11:19,436 --> 02:11:20,436
No

1699
02:11:20,603 --> 02:11:22,311
- Are you gay?
- No

1700
02:11:24,186 --> 02:11:26,061
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1701
02:11:30,645 --> 02:11:32,061
- Are you impotent?
- No

1702
02:11:34,770 --> 02:11:36,561
Then prove it

1703
02:11:37,061 --> 02:11:38,061
Pia, no

1704
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:39,686
Stop, stop!

1705
02:11:39,895 --> 02:11:42,228
What happened?
We didn't inform Pia

1706
02:11:42,728 --> 02:11:44,852
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1707
02:11:44,853 --> 02:11:46,686
Shut up!
Are you in touch with her?

1708
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:50,145
No... I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1709
02:11:56,645 --> 02:11:57,561
Hello

1710
02:11:57,562 --> 02:11:59,852
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1711
02:11:59,853 --> 02:12:03,228
Hello, is Pia there?
No, she's not

1712
02:12:03,645 --> 02:12:05,395
Is she at the hospital?

1713
02:12:05,561 --> 02:12:07,103
Why would she be there?

1714
02:12:07,353 --> 02:12:09,520
She's getting married today
in Manali

1715
02:12:17,561 --> 02:12:18,770
Too late! She's married

1716
02:12:20,228 --> 02:12:23,103
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1717
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:25,520
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1718
02:12:26,061 --> 02:12:27,061
What do you say?

1719
02:12:28,895 --> 02:12:31,270
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1720
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,228
No turning back

1721
02:12:33,728 --> 02:12:36,436
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1722
02:12:36,645 --> 02:12:39,186
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1723
02:12:39,353 --> 02:12:40,853
Get into the car

1724
02:12:41,145 --> 02:12:44,270
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1725
02:12:44,686 --> 02:12:47,061
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1726
02:12:47,228 --> 02:12:50,186
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1727
02:13:23,436 --> 02:13:25,561
Pia weds Suhas!
Thanks for the suit

1728
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,395
Virus will have a heart attack

1729
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:33,186
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1730
02:13:34,645 --> 02:13:38,020
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1731
02:13:54,853 --> 02:13:57,061
Farhan - We found Rancho

1732
02:14:05,228 --> 02:14:06,811
- For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1733
02:14:07,561 --> 02:14:10,353
- You've taken ages.
- Sorry, sir

1734
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:11,520
Off, now

1735
02:14:20,436 --> 02:14:22,103
Housekeeping, sir - Come in

1736
02:14:22,686 --> 02:14:25,394
<i>♪ Amore... Amore... ♪</i>

1737
02:14:25,395 --> 02:14:26,852
Quick, iron my coat

1738
02:14:26,853 --> 02:14:29,686
<i>♪ Amore... Amore... ♪</i>

1739
02:14:30,561 --> 02:14:33,770
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1740
02:14:34,311 --> 02:14:35,353
You're mad, Farhan

1741
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:39,145
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1742
02:14:39,395 --> 02:14:41,311
You're still eating his favorite food

1743
02:14:41,645 --> 02:14:44,270
<i>♪ Amore... Amore... ♪</i>

1744
02:14:59,686 --> 02:15:03,977
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1745
02:15:03,978 --> 02:15:06,811
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1746
02:15:07,395 --> 02:15:09,435
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1747
02:15:09,436 --> 02:15:12,727
My 150,000/ - coat

1748
02:15:12,728 --> 02:15:14,894
Why do you people eat sauce?

1749
02:15:14,895 --> 02:15:17,477
I'll sort it out, sir - How?

1750
02:15:17,478 --> 02:15:20,020
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1751
02:15:20,186 --> 02:15:22,145
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1752
02:15:27,478 --> 02:15:28,770
Get it soon

1753
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:31,978
But it's too late now, Farhan
Pia

1754
02:15:32,895 --> 02:15:35,103
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1755
02:15:46,561 --> 02:15:49,895
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1756
02:15:55,061 --> 02:15:56,020
Where is Suhas?

1757
02:15:56,021 --> 02:15:58,728
Housekeeping took my coat

1758
02:15:59,228 --> 02:16:00,978
Go... Send Suhas here

1759
02:16:01,228 --> 02:16:04,395
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1760
02:16:15,728 --> 02:16:17,353
- Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1761
02:16:17,728 --> 02:16:20,311
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1762
02:16:21,853 --> 02:16:23,519
Sir... - My coat?

1763
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:24,645
You're here...

1764
02:16:24,853 --> 02:16:26,436
- So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1765
02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:31,228
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1766
02:16:31,436 --> 02:16:33,686
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1767
02:16:34,186 --> 02:16:37,436
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1768
02:16:37,728 --> 02:16:39,478
So you'll commit suicide?

1769
02:16:40,103 --> 02:16:41,103
Rastogi!

1770
02:16:41,104 --> 02:16:43,186
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1771
02:16:44,603 --> 02:16:47,685
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed

1772
02:16:47,686 --> 02:16:50,436
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1773
02:16:50,811 --> 02:16:54,270
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1774
02:16:56,478 --> 02:16:57,478
Housekeeping?

1775
02:17:37,145 --> 02:17:40,145
Pia, minor problem

1776
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:41,478
What?

1777
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:43,477
We don't know if Rancho's married

1778
02:17:43,478 --> 02:17:44,395
What!

1779
02:17:44,396 --> 02:17:47,020
He won't be married
And if he is?

1780
02:17:47,936 --> 02:17:49,311
Then we'll drop you back

1781
02:17:50,228 --> 02:17:53,978
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1782
02:17:57,853 --> 02:17:58,853
What's he doing here?

1783
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:03,145
Ignore him
The biscuit's very good

1784
02:18:04,228 --> 02:18:06,061
<i>Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen</i>

1785
02:18:06,603 --> 02:18:10,436
<i>But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft</i>

1786
02:18:11,270 --> 02:18:13,686
<i>almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and</i>

1787
02:18:13,978 --> 02:18:18,353
<i>made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho</i>

1788
02:18:19,853 --> 02:18:21,936
<i>But he too would do
anything for friends</i>

1789
02:18:22,228 --> 02:18:25,810
<i>Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den</i>

1790
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:26,851
Envelope with the red seal

1791
02:18:27,853 --> 02:18:32,811
<i>He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump</i>

1792
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:41,270
<i>We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju</i>

1793
02:18:41,686 --> 02:18:43,086
<i>We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek</i>

1794
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:46,811
Where's it hidden...

1795
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:50,603
We'll grow old searching!
Ask Pia

1796
02:18:56,853 --> 02:18:57,978
Pia, your phone

1797
02:18:59,270 --> 02:19:02,602
Mr. Papa-To-Be!
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1798
02:19:02,603 --> 02:19:03,603
He kicked

1799
02:19:05,895 --> 02:19:07,353
Pia, your phone

1800
02:19:13,228 --> 02:19:14,436
Found it! Rancho

1801
02:19:15,936 --> 02:19:16,936
Hello?

1802
02:19:35,353 --> 02:19:37,561
Quick, photocopy this

1803
02:19:58,686 --> 02:19:59,686
Where was it?

1804
02:19:59,853 --> 02:20:00,853
Put it back

1805
02:20:24,186 --> 02:20:26,186
- We're safe!
- Where were you?

1806
02:20:30,811 --> 02:20:32,478
Here - What's this?

1807
02:20:32,853 --> 02:20:33,853
A gift

1808
02:20:34,895 --> 02:20:38,770
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1809
02:20:46,395 --> 02:20:47,686
Strange buddies!

1810
02:20:49,061 --> 02:20:53,603
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1811
02:20:55,686 --> 02:20:56,686
No way

1812
02:20:58,311 --> 02:20:59,671
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1813
02:21:03,561 --> 02:21:04,686
If I don't, it's still OK

1814
02:21:21,936 --> 02:21:26,436
<i>He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...</i>

1815
02:21:27,395 --> 02:21:29,270
<i>but then I controlled my emotions</i>

1816
02:21:48,395 --> 02:21:51,353
Damn thief - Sir, please, sir

1817
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:54,686
Rascal - Sorry sir

1818
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:56,520
Wanted to change the system

1819
02:21:58,270 --> 02:22:03,186
You'll pee on my door
Sir, what're you doing

1820
02:22:04,728 --> 02:22:05,728
Sorry sir

1821
02:22:07,186 --> 02:22:09,020
You are rusticated!

1822
02:22:09,853 --> 02:22:12,811
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1823
02:22:13,270 --> 02:22:14,561
I will call the police!

1824
02:22:17,103 --> 02:22:18,103
Rascals!

1825
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:19,561
Rascals, all of you

1826
02:22:23,603 --> 02:22:25,895
How did he get my office key?

1827
02:22:27,228 --> 02:22:28,603
I gave him the key, Dad

1828
02:22:30,020 --> 02:22:33,603
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today

1829
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:34,811
Stop it, Pia

1830
02:22:35,853 --> 02:22:38,645
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1831
02:22:39,228 --> 02:22:40,228
Shut up, Pia

1832
02:22:40,229 --> 02:22:42,478
You decided he'd be an engineer

1833
02:22:42,686 --> 02:22:44,936
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1834
02:22:45,770 --> 02:22:47,311
You put such pressure on him...

1835
02:22:47,728 --> 02:22:49,978
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1836
02:22:54,270 --> 02:22:55,270
I don't understand...

1837
02:22:55,936 --> 02:22:58,478
Dad, you go to your room

1838
02:23:02,395 --> 02:23:04,728
Pia, don't do this

1839
02:23:07,228 --> 02:23:11,103
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1840
02:23:13,395 --> 02:23:15,935
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1841
02:23:15,936 --> 02:23:17,186
Put that away, please

1842
02:23:17,395 --> 02:23:19,020
No more cover-ups!

1843
02:23:22,436 --> 02:23:25,727
Just once...

1844
02:23:25,728 --> 02:23:29,395
if you'd said - Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1845
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:31,645
just do what your heart is in

1846
02:23:33,145 --> 02:23:34,853
then he'd be alive today

1847
02:23:42,811 --> 02:23:44,853
He didn't commit suicide

1848
02:23:45,603 --> 02:23:46,603
You're right, Dad

1849
02:23:48,145 --> 02:23:49,353
It wasn't suicide...

1850
02:23:51,853 --> 02:23:52,895
It was murder

1851
02:24:08,853 --> 02:24:11,769
<i>Many city roads are
completely submerged</i>

1852
02:24:11,770 --> 02:24:13,728
<i>Traffic has come to a standstill</i>

1853
02:24:27,686 --> 02:24:31,478
Dad...

1854
02:24:32,603 --> 02:24:33,603
Mona?

1855
02:24:37,728 --> 02:24:40,186
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1856
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:43,020
Why? Your pop owns the road?

1857
02:24:43,186 --> 02:24:44,853
Please help,
we are desperate here!

1858
02:24:45,853 --> 02:24:47,686
You can't send an ambulance?

1859
02:24:48,728 --> 02:24:50,603
Get it from another hospital

1860
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:54,770
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1861
02:24:58,311 --> 02:24:59,561
Mona, you OK?

1862
02:25:00,145 --> 02:25:01,145
Rancho, Pia

1863
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,353
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1864
02:25:07,686 --> 02:25:12,520
The water bag has burst

1865
02:25:13,561 --> 02:25:16,061
Disconnected! Mona

1866
02:25:21,311 --> 02:25:22,311
Mona!

1867
02:25:26,686 --> 02:25:28,186
Turn on the lights - Where to?

1868
02:25:28,728 --> 02:25:32,645
To the table tennis table
Pia, we're in the common room

1869
02:25:36,645 --> 02:25:38,478
Raju, turn on the web camera

1870
02:25:44,645 --> 02:25:45,770
Where's Mona? Show me

1871
02:25:47,353 --> 02:25:48,353
Hold on

1872
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:51,520
Here, Pia

1873
02:25:51,686 --> 02:25:54,685
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1874
02:25:54,686 --> 02:25:55,686
Pia, I'm dying!

1875
02:25:56,061 --> 02:25:58,645
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1876
02:25:58,811 --> 02:26:00,186
babies were delivered

1877
02:26:00,811 --> 02:26:03,103
You all will deliver this baby

1878
02:26:05,811 --> 02:26:07,353
All is well

1879
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:10,478
How dare you? I'll kill you

1880
02:26:10,645 --> 02:26:12,645
Dad, stay out of this

1881
02:26:13,645 --> 02:26:15,852
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1882
02:26:15,853 --> 02:26:18,311
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1883
02:26:18,603 --> 02:26:20,061
Rancho, cover Mona

1884
02:26:27,645 --> 02:26:29,145
Mona, try pushing

1885
02:26:29,603 --> 02:26:33,520
Push with all your might

1886
02:26:33,811 --> 02:26:36,186
Stop it! I can't do it

1887
02:26:36,436 --> 02:26:38,228
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1888
02:26:39,186 --> 02:26:40,186
Crowning...?

1889
02:26:41,395 --> 02:26:42,395
Get that diagram

1890
02:26:45,228 --> 02:26:47,936
See if the head is coming out

1891
02:26:50,311 --> 02:26:51,603
Check quickly

1892
02:26:52,436 --> 02:26:53,436
Go!

1893
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:56,478
Go, Rancho, go

1894
02:27:03,770 --> 02:27:05,977
No crowning

1895
02:27:05,978 --> 02:27:07,811
Mona, please push

1896
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:11,520
Mona!

1897
02:27:14,395 --> 02:27:15,520
She's tired, Pia

1898
02:27:15,978 --> 02:27:19,645
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1899
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:23,770
They need a vacuum cup
Where will they get one?

1900
02:27:23,978 --> 02:27:26,811
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1901
02:27:27,103 --> 02:27:28,103
I'll show you

1902
02:27:31,228 --> 02:27:35,520
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1903
02:27:35,853 --> 02:27:39,603
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1904
02:27:40,353 --> 02:27:42,186
and the baby is pulled out

1905
02:27:42,686 --> 02:27:44,853
I can make this - How?

1906
02:27:45,145 --> 02:27:47,019
With a vacuum cleaner
Vacuum cleaner?

1907
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:48,144
Yes

1908
02:27:48,145 --> 02:27:50,560
That pressure's too high

1909
02:27:50,561 --> 02:27:52,769
I'll control it
D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1910
02:27:52,770 --> 02:27:53,811
Yes, in my office

1911
02:27:54,270 --> 02:27:56,978
Farhan, rush and get it
Here's the key

1912
02:28:02,978 --> 02:28:06,395
Mona, push

1913
02:28:07,186 --> 02:28:08,686
Oh my God

1914
02:28:09,603 --> 02:28:10,603
What happened?

1915
02:28:15,395 --> 02:28:17,645
Raju, what happened?
The power's gone

1916
02:28:18,645 --> 02:28:20,144
How'll the vacuum work now?

1917
02:28:20,145 --> 02:28:22,769
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1918
02:28:22,770 --> 02:28:23,770
How?

1919
02:28:24,436 --> 02:28:25,895
Millimeter, get Virus out

1920
02:28:27,311 --> 02:28:29,936
What nonsense is this!

1921
02:28:30,186 --> 02:28:33,728
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1922
02:28:33,936 --> 02:28:35,811
Get that, quick - OK

1923
02:28:36,103 --> 02:28:38,228
Raju, wake up the hostel

1924
02:28:38,436 --> 02:28:41,353
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1925
02:28:44,228 --> 02:28:46,853
Emergency in the common room!

1926
02:29:17,686 --> 02:29:19,770
- Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1927
02:29:20,061 --> 02:29:22,728
Keep the batteries here
...and the wires

1928
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:28,186
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1929
02:29:33,020 --> 02:29:34,186
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1930
02:29:35,353 --> 02:29:38,310
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1931
02:29:38,311 --> 02:29:39,728
- Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1932
02:29:42,478 --> 02:29:43,478
Rancho, blower

1933
02:29:43,645 --> 02:29:45,645
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1934
02:30:12,061 --> 02:30:13,311
Rancho, I'm done

1935
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:16,895
- All switches off?
- Yes

1936
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:20,144
Hit the table
and computer switches

1937
02:30:20,145 --> 02:30:21,145
OK

1938
02:30:33,686 --> 02:30:34,770
Raju, turn on the computer

1939
02:30:35,186 --> 02:30:36,853
Farhan, here

1940
02:30:38,978 --> 02:30:40,978
Pia, come here quick

1941
02:30:43,478 --> 02:30:44,561
Love you, Rancho

1942
02:30:45,353 --> 02:30:47,311
Farhan, turn it on - OK

1943
02:30:53,895 --> 02:30:55,895
Pia, how much suction?

1944
02:30:56,311 --> 02:30:57,728
Not more than 0.5

1945
02:30:57,978 --> 02:30:59,978
Farhan, 0.5 - Cover it

1946
02:31:01,561 --> 02:31:02,561
0.5

1947
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:09,020
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1948
02:31:10,145 --> 02:31:11,020
Farhan, stop

1949
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:12,020
OK

1950
02:31:18,270 --> 02:31:19,561
Raju, get on the table

1951
02:31:19,853 --> 02:31:22,978
Push the baby down, like this

1952
02:31:23,186 --> 02:31:24,186
OK

1953
02:31:25,228 --> 02:31:26,228
Farhan, turn it on

1954
02:31:30,728 --> 02:31:33,020
C'mon, you can do it

1955
02:31:34,186 --> 02:31:36,603
C'mon, push

1956
02:31:40,811 --> 02:31:43,353
Do it for Champ

1957
02:31:43,603 --> 02:31:46,020
C'mon, Mona

1958
02:31:47,770 --> 02:31:49,811
He's coming out!

1959
02:31:51,186 --> 02:31:52,936
You can do it

1960
02:31:53,770 --> 02:31:56,103
Yes Mona, push

1961
02:32:03,978 --> 02:32:05,144
Farhan, turn it off

1962
02:32:05,145 --> 02:32:06,145
OK, off

1963
02:32:26,436 --> 02:32:28,186
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1964
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:30,686
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1965
02:32:31,436 --> 02:32:33,436
Get scissors - Be careful

1966
02:32:34,686 --> 02:32:36,936
Cut at the center, get a towel

1967
02:32:39,770 --> 02:32:42,061
Pia, he's not crying

1968
02:32:46,353 --> 02:32:49,228
Hey Champ!

1969
02:32:50,603 --> 02:32:53,020
Rancho, rub his back

1970
02:32:55,311 --> 02:32:57,311
Hey Champ - Come on, Champ

1971
02:32:59,186 --> 02:33:01,270
No, nothing

1972
02:33:01,770 --> 02:33:02,770
Blow air into his mouth

1973
02:33:09,978 --> 02:33:10,978
C'mon, Champ

1974
02:33:16,353 --> 02:33:17,353
No response

1975
02:33:41,561 --> 02:33:45,145
Hush Mona, say - All is well

1976
02:33:50,436 --> 02:33:51,436
He kicked

1977
02:33:52,686 --> 02:33:53,686
What?

1978
02:33:54,436 --> 02:33:55,686
He kicked

1979
02:33:59,186 --> 02:34:00,478
Say - All is well

1980
02:34:02,145 --> 02:34:09,020
All is well

1981
02:34:50,478 --> 02:34:53,811
<i>If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'</i>

1982
02:34:53,978 --> 02:34:55,811
<i>I would've broken his jaw</i>

1983
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:59,311
<i>But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us</i>

1984
02:34:59,645 --> 02:35:02,770
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1985
02:35:03,853 --> 02:35:06,853
Be what you want to be

1986
02:35:23,353 --> 02:35:27,228
Wait - I've not finished with you!

1987
02:35:29,645 --> 02:35:32,186
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1988
02:35:32,561 --> 02:35:34,936
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1989
02:35:35,728 --> 02:35:37,978
If a pencil tip breaks

1990
02:35:38,186 --> 02:35:44,061
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1991
02:35:44,228 --> 02:35:46,145
You were wrong

1992
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:49,603
You cannot be right all the time

1993
02:35:51,728 --> 02:35:52,728
You understand?

1994
02:35:55,186 --> 02:35:56,186
Yes, sir

1995
02:35:57,311 --> 02:35:59,395
This was an important invention

1996
02:36:00,728 --> 02:36:01,728
You understand?

1997
02:36:03,145 --> 02:36:04,145
Yes, sir

1998
02:36:06,561 --> 02:36:14,561
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student...'

1999
02:36:33,811 --> 02:36:38,228
Go, study!
Pass your exams and leave

2000
02:36:47,145 --> 02:36:49,228
<i>And now, Student of the Year...</i>

2001
02:36:49,478 --> 02:36:51,936
<i>Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad</i>

2002
02:37:09,603 --> 02:37:10,895
Sir, one photo

2003

<i>♪ I wanted to capture all these

2004

2007
02:38:19,270 --> 02:38:20,270
Untie him

2008
02:38:23,561 --> 02:38:25,436
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2009
02:38:39,936 --> 02:38:40,936
Raju

2010
02:38:59,811 --> 02:39:01,770
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2011
02:39:02,353 --> 02:39:03,395
But where is he?

2012
02:39:07,895 --> 02:39:09,103
Don't pee here

2013
02:39:10,228 --> 02:39:11,811
Go away creatures

2014
02:39:12,228 --> 02:39:15,270
Don't pee here - I'll smack you

2015
02:39:33,061 --> 02:39:35,228
Bingo! He cannot be far

2016
02:39:46,728 --> 02:39:48,978
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

2017
02:39:49,145 --> 02:39:51,227
- He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2018
02:39:51,228 --> 02:39:53,395
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2019
02:39:53,561 --> 02:39:56,228
Calm down. Come with me

2020
02:39:58,728 --> 02:39:59,728
- Where's he?
- Rancho

2021
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:10,145
Farhan, he's read all your books

2022
02:40:16,478 --> 02:40:22,478
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2023
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:29,478
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2024
02:40:31,436 --> 02:40:34,603
Who are you? How do you know us?

2025
02:40:34,895 --> 02:40:36,936
- Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2026
02:40:37,895 --> 02:40:41,853
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2027
02:40:46,936 --> 02:40:51,395
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2028
02:40:52,270 --> 02:40:53,352
How did you get here?

2029
02:40:53,353 --> 02:40:56,561
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2030
02:40:56,853 --> 02:41:00,561
It said - 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did

2031
02:41:02,186 --> 02:41:03,270
That rascal Rancho!

2032
02:41:07,478 --> 02:41:08,478
Where is that idiot?

2033
02:41:19,645 --> 02:41:21,520
Dorje, you fly it

2034
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:41,978
<i>Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride</i>

2035
02:41:42,936 --> 02:41:45,186
<i>Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet</i>

2036
02:41:45,853 --> 02:41:48,561
<i>and come close to kiss me</i>

2037
02:41:52,186 --> 02:41:53,586
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2038
02:41:55,770 --> 02:41:56,770
No

2039
02:41:58,395 --> 02:41:59,395
Sorry

2040
02:41:59,686 --> 02:42:00,686
Did you marry?

2041
02:42:01,103 --> 02:42:05,311
What? No

2042
02:42:06,311 --> 02:42:08,895
- You?
- Almost... Idiot

2043
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:17,520
So?

2044
02:42:18,853 --> 02:42:19,853
So what?

2045
02:42:20,353 --> 02:42:21,645
Do you love someone?

2046
02:42:26,103 --> 02:42:27,103
Yes

2047
02:42:32,978 --> 02:42:33,978
Who?

2048
02:42:35,145 --> 02:42:36,145
You

2049
02:43:01,728 --> 02:43:04,895
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2050
02:43:06,145 --> 02:43:07,145
That's right!

2051
02:43:07,228 --> 02:43:08,311
Rancho

2052
02:43:09,853 --> 02:43:10,853
Hi... Farhan!

2053
02:43:10,895 --> 02:43:12,978
Screw your 'Hi'

2054
02:43:13,436 --> 02:43:18,145
Hey, listen to me...
No, you listen to me

2055
02:43:18,353 --> 02:43:20,603
I can explain everything

2056
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:22,645
Hi... Raju!

2057
02:43:22,646 --> 02:43:24,520
How we hunted for you!

2058
02:43:27,436 --> 02:43:31,520
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2059
02:43:33,603 --> 02:43:35,853
Add a couple from me too

2060
02:43:36,436 --> 02:43:41,603
Rascal, scoundrel Let him go now

2061
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:42,770
OK OK, enough

2062
02:43:44,061 --> 02:43:45,811
On your feet, c'mon

2063
02:44:15,853 --> 02:44:17,561
Having fun, idiots?

2064
02:44:17,853 --> 02:44:19,686
Hey... Hi Chatur

2065
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:25,061
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2066
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:32,270
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2067
02:44:34,228 --> 02:44:38,936
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2068
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:42,395
from engineer to primary teacher

2069
02:44:44,603 --> 02:44:47,478
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000Rs?

2070
02:44:47,895 --> 02:44:49,645
For me that's $100

2071
02:44:50,103 --> 02:44:53,478
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2072
02:44:53,686 --> 02:44:56,436
Cut the crap
Crap is what he gave us

2073
02:44:56,645 --> 02:45:01,686
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2074
02:45:01,936 --> 02:45:04,478
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2075
02:45:04,978 --> 02:45:06,378
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2076
02:45:06,561 --> 02:45:07,561
Just relax

2077
02:45:07,562 --> 02:45:14,311
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2078
02:45:16,020 --> 02:45:22,770
Sign here.
Accept - You lost, I won!

2079
02:45:23,061 --> 02:45:26,061
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2080
02:45:26,270 --> 02:45:28,311
Chatur - Crazy guy

2081
02:45:30,145 --> 02:45:34,436
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2082
02:45:34,895 --> 02:45:36,270
Forget it, man

2083
02:45:36,978 --> 02:45:40,645
This is for winners, not losers

2084
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:48,728
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2085
02:45:50,895 --> 02:45:53,686
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2086
02:45:55,228 --> 02:45:57,978
He hasn't changed at all!
Ignore him

2087
02:45:58,145 --> 02:45:59,603
He's full of crap

2088
02:45:59,978 --> 02:46:04,353
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2089
02:46:04,770 --> 02:46:08,770
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad - Yuck!

2090
02:46:09,561 --> 02:46:11,020
By the way,
what is your real name?

2091
02:46:11,895 --> 02:46:12,895
Phunsukh Wangdu

2092
02:46:13,603 --> 02:46:14,603
Wangdu?

2093
02:46:14,686 --> 02:46:15,686
Pia Wangdu!

2094
02:46:16,228 --> 02:46:17,936
You mean you're a scientist?

2095
02:46:18,186 --> 02:46:19,478
You have 400 patents?

2096
02:46:19,645 --> 02:46:21,560
I won't change my name
after marriage

2097
02:46:21,561 --> 02:46:23,269
You mean you're Chatur's Wangdu?

2098
02:46:23,270 --> 02:46:25,519
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2099
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:26,520
I don't like Wangdu

2100
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:29,186
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2101
02:46:29,645 --> 02:46:31,644
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2102
02:46:31,645 --> 02:46:33,810
So you are THE Phunsukh Wangdu?

2103
02:46:33,811 --> 02:46:34,936
Yes, yes!

2104
02:46:36,228 --> 02:46:39,103
Hey Silencer
Hey Chatur, come back

2105
02:46:40,395 --> 02:46:41,478
Take that

2106
02:46:43,061 --> 02:46:45,311
Wait, I'll stop him

2107
02:46:53,228 --> 02:46:56,811
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2108
02:46:57,353 --> 02:46:58,685
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2109
02:46:58,686 --> 02:47:00,978
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2110
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:03,520
What sir? Why sir?

2111
02:47:03,770 --> 02:47:06,561
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2112
02:47:08,478 --> 02:47:10,436
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2113
02:47:10,811 --> 02:47:14,978
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2114
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:19,978
Mr. Wangdu...?

2115
02:47:20,186 --> 02:47:21,353
Yes, Chatur?

2116
02:47:22,186 --> 02:47:24,145
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2117
02:47:27,311 --> 02:47:28,936
...S for Screwed

2118
02:47:36,103 --> 02:47:40,186
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2119
02:47:40,603 --> 02:47:42,186
Totally floored me. Good one

2120
02:47:42,895 --> 02:47:47,145
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2121
02:47:47,353 --> 02:47:50,520
Hey Chatur - take that

2122
02:47:51,186 --> 02:47:53,145
I was just joking, man

2123
02:47:53,561 --> 02:47:57,395
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2124
02:47:58,436 --> 02:48:00,310
You're fibbing

2125
02:48:00,311 --> 02:48:02,352
No, really, I swear

2126
02:48:02,353 --> 02:48:04,311
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0

2127
02:48:04,728 --> 02:48:07,020
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2128
02:48:08,478 --> 02:48:09,894
Beware of farts

2129
02:48:09,895 --> 02:48:14,269
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2130
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:16,603
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life!

2131
02:48:20,353 --> 02:48:24,395
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2132
02:48:25,395 --> 02:48:27,895
<i>His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
had correctly stated</i>

2133
02:48:28,145 --> 02:48:33,186
<i>Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down</i>
