1
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:39,034
My name is Turkish.

2
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:41,412
Funny name for an Englishman,
I know.

3
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:46,041
My parents to be were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.

4
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,669
They named me after
the name of the plane.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,464
Not many people are
named after a plane crash.

6
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,674
That's Tommy.

7
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:56,093
He tells people
he was named after a gun.

8
00:00:56,303 --> 00:01:01,015
But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.

9
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:04,643
Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.

10
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:07,313
Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.

11
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:12,443
What it really means is I try to keep him
out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me.

12
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:15,654
I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.

13
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:18,949
But really, he's like my brother.

14
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:22,703
What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.

15
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:26,832
I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:

16
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:29,668
What do I know about diamonds?

17
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:32,004
Don't they come from Antwerp?

18
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,548
Himy, would you listen to this?

19
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,175
Do we have a choice?

20
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:39,929
A lot of it wasn't
meant to be taken literally.

21
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:42,640
It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.

22
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,226
It's bound with moral fiber,

23
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,063
but asking a grown man
to believe it?

24
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,149
What is it?

25
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,903
Well, what is it?

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,533
What you want I
should do, drop my pants?

27
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,493
Okay, go through.

28
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,955
It's a nice story.

29
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,583
It's just that. Just a story.

30
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:13,295
Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.

31
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,798
Enough already. Ruben,
will you say something?

32
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,801
Listen to this. Are you
busy? I'll tell you the whole story.

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,264
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"

34
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,683
into the Greek word
for "virgin."

35
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:28,352
It was an easy mistake
to make

36
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:33,148
because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.

37
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,327
So, they came up
with a prophecy:

38
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,748
"Behold, the virgin shall
conceive and bear us a son."

39
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:54,128
You understand this? It was the word
"virgin" that caught people's attention.

40
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:58,507
It's not every day a virgin
conceives and bears a son.

41
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:18,861
But leave that for a
couple of hundred years to stew

42
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:22,656
and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.

43
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:26,076
Oy vay, what are you saying?

44
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:28,871
I'm saying, just
because it's written

45
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:30,664
doesn't make it so.

46
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,835
Gives them hope. It's not really
important whether it's fact or fiction.

47
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:36,086
People like to believe.

48
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:37,546
I don't want to hear any more.

49
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:41,008
Anyway, who is it
that we're seeing?

50
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,344
- Michael.
- Hello?

51
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,263
Mutti.

52
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:50,225
Rudy! Rud, Rud,
let them in, please.

53
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:56,357
Rud, it's okay,
let them through.

54
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:57,524
Michael.
- Mutti.

55
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:02,529
You have kept us waiting for half an
hour. Are you trying to give me heartburn?

56
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,200
Mutti. Mutti?

57
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:10,204
Lie down on the floor.

58
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:13,791
Get on the floor!

59
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,918
Lie on the floor!

60
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:17,878
Get on the fucking floor!

61
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:21,548
Get down!
Get fucking down!

62
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,968
Down on the floor! Get down!

63
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:25,636
On the ground!

64
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,475
Get down, I say!

65
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:33,769
Time.
- Seven minutes!

66
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:39,316
Where is the stone?

67
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:44,488
Where is the stone?

68
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:48,826
Where is the stone?

69
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,750
Michael, where is the stone?

70
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,754
When does
your plane leave?

71
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,006
Twenty minutes.

72
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,342
Give me your gun.

73
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:41,855
When you get to London,

74
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,982
if you want a gun,

75
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,026
call this number.

76
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:52,991
Boris.
- Boris.

77
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:56,328
He can get you anything
you need.

78
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:05,379
Is he allowed
to do that?

79
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:09,883
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

80
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:12,344
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

81
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:15,055
What's happening with
those sausages, Charlie?

82
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:16,807
Two minutes, Turkish.

83
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:22,104
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

84
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,981
We're gonna need
a proper office.

85
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,025
I want a new one, Tommy.
You're going to buy it for me.

86
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:28,861
Why me?

87
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,488
Well, you know
about caravans.

88
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,157
How's that?

89
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,869
You spent a summer in one. Which
means you know more than me.

90
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:40,581
And I don't want to have me
pants pulled down over the price.

91
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:42,082
What's wrong with this one?

92
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:45,460
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

93
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,546
It's tiptop.

94
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,590
It's just I'm not sure
about the color.

95
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:54,178
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

96
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:56,221
Here's an address.

97
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:59,349
It's a campsite.

98
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:03,770
You've got 10 grand, and it
would be nice to see change.

99
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,440
What's happening with
them sausages, Charlie?

100
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:07,733
Five minutes, Turkish.

101
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,738
It was two minutes
five minutes ago.

102
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:14,573
They ain't pikeys,
are they?

103
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,576
I fucking hate pikeys.

104
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:20,412
You're a sensitive boy,
Tommy.

105
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,209
Fuck me. Hold tight.

106
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,295
What's that?
It's me belt, Turkish.

107
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,881
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

108
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:34,301
What's a gun doing in your trousers?
It's for protection.

109
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:35,719
Protection from what?

110
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:37,804
"Zee" Germans?

111
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:41,225
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off every time you sit down?

112
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:44,686
Where did you get it?
Boris The Blade.

113
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:47,439
You mean Boris the sneaky,
fucking Russian.

114
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,691
Heavy, isn't it?

115
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:52,819
Heavy is good.

116
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,072
Heavy is reliable.

117
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:57,950
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

118
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,286
Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.

119
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:05,666
As bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.

120
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:09,878
Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.

121
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:13,090
Back to my partner, Tommy.

122
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,008
Tommy runs the other business,

123
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:17,094
the slot machines,

124
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,847
which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.

125
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:25,477
However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.

126
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:27,938
All right, I'll take it.

127
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:32,109
There's a reason for Tommy's
newfound enthusiasm for firearms.

128
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,863
Sooner or later, in the unlicensed boxing
world, you have to deal with that reason:

129
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,323
Brick Top.

130
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:41,201
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

131
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:44,621
He doesn't look bad, does he?
No, he looks great.

132
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,206
He'll do you proud, governor.

133
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:50,544
You reckon that's what people
should do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

134
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:51,878
It's what you deserve,
Mr. Pulford.

135
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:54,464
Pull your tongue out
of my arsehole, Gary.

136
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:56,800
Dogs do that.

137
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:59,219
You're not a dog, are you, Gary?

138
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:00,929
No. No, I'm not.

139
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,556
However,

140
00:10:03,558 --> 00:10:07,102
you do have all the
characteristics of a dog, Gary.

141
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:08,562
All except loyalty.

142
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:13,233
It's rumored that his favorite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun,

143
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:17,738
a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.

144
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:22,284
You're a ruthless little cunt,
Liam. I'll give you that.

145
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:27,247
But I got no time
for grouses.

146
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,418
Feed him to the pigs,
Errol.

147
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,172
What the fuck are you
two looking at?

148
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:42,429
If you got to deal with him, you just
make sure you don't end up owing him.

149
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:43,889
Because then you're in his debt.

150
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:46,350
Which means, you're in his pocket.

151
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:49,978
And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.

152
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:53,732
I hear he's a
good fighter, so I'll use him.

153
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,193
I'll be doing you a favor, boy.

154
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:59,404
What he means is,
I'm doing him a favor.

155
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:04,701
Because everybody knows nobody
takes a dive in my fights. Unlike his.

156
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:07,621
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

157
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:09,706
You don't like me,
do you, boy?

158
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,166
Don't know what you mean.

159
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:14,586
I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. Fuck me, it stinks.

160
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:20,092
I like my fights to finish prompt so we
can get out before the authorities find out.

161
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:22,552
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

162
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:25,305
You can sort me out
by showing me out.

163
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:28,392
It's hard to make a living in the
boxing world, so every now and then

164
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,144
you gotta do something that might
not agree with your principles.

165
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:34,439
Basically, you have to forget
you got any.

166
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:36,108
Are they Lancashire pigs?

167
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,901
Who the fuck is talking
to you, boy?

168
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:42,489
Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.

169
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:43,907
Don't let me down.

170
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,494
You don't want to let
me down, do you, boy?

171
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:51,665
See you ringside.

172
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:58,505
Boris,
Franky-fucking-Four Fingers

173
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:01,425
has a diamond the size
of a fist.

174
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:05,303
I have told you it's in the
briefcase connected to his arm.

175
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:07,764
I sent him to you
to buy a gun.

176
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,809
What more do you want me
to do, hit him for you?

177
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:13,437
But don't you hit him either.

178
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:16,773
Americans can't know
it was Russian.

179
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:18,692
It will come back to me.

180
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,694
So, what should I do?

181
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:24,698
Boris, you're my brother,
so think like my brother!

182
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:27,159
Get somebody else
to steal that stone!

183
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,494
I don't want it getting
back to me.

184
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:32,622
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

185
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,624
So don't use idiots
for the job.

186
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:38,503
He'll stay in London only for a couple
of days before he goes to New York,

187
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:41,173
so move quick. Okay?

188
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,470
One more thing.

189
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,221
It might help.

190
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:50,432
He loves to gamble.

191
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:53,977
Eighty-six karats?

192
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,188
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

193
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:59,399
Clean, no fluorescence.
A beautiful stone.

194
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:00,734
You're a good boy, Franky.

195
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:04,070
A good boy. And you did a real
good job. Now when do you get back?

196
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:09,075
I got to move the two-grainers here,
and get a better price. Couple of days.

197
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,744
Talk to my cousin Dougie.
Doug The Head?

198
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:11,912
Yeah, Doug The Head.

199
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,708
And Franky...

200
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,419
And what?
Stay out of those casinos.

201
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:24,508
You did a good job, bubbe.

202
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:27,761
Don't go screwing it up, all right?
I hear you, Avi.

203
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:30,430
I'll see you, Avi.

204
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,935
Eighty-six karats.

205
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,853
Where?
London.

206
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:38,688
London?
London.

207
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,899
London?
Yes, London.

208
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:44,444
You know, fish, chips,
cup of tea,

209
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,906
bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

210
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,909
No, Paulie,
that ain't for me.

211
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:54,287
That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.

212
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,040
If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.

213
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,625
Pretends he's Jewish.

214
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:00,460
Wishes he was Jewish.

215
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:02,921
Even tells his family
they're Jewish,

216
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,549
but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.

217
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:10,637
He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business

218
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,265
it is good for business.
Avi!

219
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:15,475
He'll be there today.
Take care of him, will you?

220
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:18,478
Avi, you know
I won't buy schtrops.

221
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:21,314
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

222
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,650
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

223
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:25,735
We play by the rules.

224
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,320
Listen to me.

225
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:30,824
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

226
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:34,995
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

227
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:42,502
What are you doing here?

228
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,629
It's a free country, isn't it?

229
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,674
Well, it ain't
a free shop, is it?

230
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,843
So fuck off.

231
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:03,106
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

232
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:05,483
I just had cousin Avi
on the phone.

233
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:08,445
You got to go see him.
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

234
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:12,032
He's a big mucker in New York.
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

235
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,743
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

236
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,454
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

237
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:25,545
The weight is sign of reliability.

238
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,381
I always go for reliability.

239
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,224
I'll take it.

240
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:40,060
How much do you want for it?

241
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:41,478
Nothing.

242
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:46,316
Okay, so what do you
want for it?

243
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,151
I want you to do
something for me.

244
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:49,736
Hmm.

245
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,072
There is a fight
in couple of days.

246
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:54,866
What kind of a fight?

247
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:56,743
Unlicensed boxing.

248
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:58,078
Aha.

249
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,747
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

250
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:05,919
If you place one
down for me,

251
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:08,088
we will call it quits.

252
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,590
Why don't you put it down yourself?
Well,

253
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:16,262
there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

254
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:20,684
And I already have an
outstanding debt with the house.

255
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:25,438
I know something most don't.

256
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,774
So, nu?

257
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:30,527
What do you know?

258
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:38,034
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

259
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:41,287
Ten points.
What are we doing here?

260
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:45,375
We're buying a caravan.
Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

261
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,420
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

262
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:49,587
Not if you're here.

263
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:51,631
Oh, you bastard.

264
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,426
I fucking hate pikeys.

265
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,888
That's a flash car, mister.

266
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,557
Not as flash
as your bike, is it?

267
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,726
Who are you looking for?

268
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,269
Mr. O'Neil.

269
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:07,230
Want me to get him?
That's a good lad.

270
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,232
Piss off.

271
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,777
Are you going to go get him for me?
Yeah.

272
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:16,823
What are you waiting for?
The five quid you'll pay me.

273
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:18,658
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

274
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:21,244
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.

275
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,037
Oh, you're a real
tight fucker, aren't you?

276
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,331
Now, there was a problem
with pikeys, or gypsies.

277
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,000
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

278
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,335
You can't really understand
much of what is being said.

279
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,171
You Tommy?
Come about the caravan?

280
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:33,673
Mr. O'Neil.
Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

281
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:35,508
It's not Irish, it's not English.

282
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:37,969
How are you?
Weather's been kind.

283
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,929
It's just, well... It's just Pikey.

284
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:42,307
Fuck me. Would you
look at the size of him?

285
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,892
How big are you?

286
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,519
Hey, kids, how big is he?
Big man, that's for sure.

287
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:49,522
Hey, Mam, come and look
at the size of this fella.

288
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:54,986
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

289
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,822
Get out of the way, Mickey.
See if they'd like a drink.

290
00:17:58,032 --> 00:17:59,365
I could murder one.

291
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:02,660
Be no murdering done around
here, I don't mind telling you.

292
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,871
Get your hands out of there.

293
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,748
Cup of tea for the big fella?
Come on.

294
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:10,126
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

295
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:12,837
You little bugger.

296
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:16,216
Is the big fella not coming with us?
No, he's minding the car.

297
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:20,261
What does he think we are, thieves?
No, nothing like that.

298
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:23,640
He just likes looking after cars.
Good dags. Do you like dags?

299
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,642
Dags?
What?

300
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,560
Yeah, dags.
Dags. You like dags?

301
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:29,896
Oh, dogs.

302
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:32,232
Sure, I like dags.

303
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,235
I like caravans more.
You're very welcome.

304
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,916
Now, pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.

305
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,168
It's probably the reason
they talk like they do,

306
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,546
so you can't follow
what's being said.

307
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:58,258
But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked,

308
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:00,844
on his return
there will be ice cream waiting.

309
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,388
Good dog,
good family.

310
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:06,349
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

311
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,435
See you later, lads.
See you, boss.

312
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,896
All right, Mickey. Laters.

313
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,858
I don't see what
the fuss is about.

314
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,860
They aren't bad fellas.

315
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:29,289
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

316
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:32,625
Now look, I've helped you as
much as I'm going to help you.

317
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,711
See that car?
I suggest you use it.

318
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,590
You should fuck off now while you
still got the legs to carry you.

319
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,801
Nobody-
Nobody brings you

320
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:44,929
unless they're trying to say
something without talking, right, boy?

321
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,808
Sorry, Mickey, just give our money
back and you can keep your caravan.

322
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:52,103
Why the fuck do I want a caravan
that's got no fucking wheels?

323
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:55,481
You want to settle this with a fight?
Over my dead body.

324
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,066
Now, go on! Go on!

325
00:19:57,318 --> 00:20:01,279
I'll not have you fighting! You
know what happens when you fight!

326
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:03,281
Get her to sit down.

327
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,617
For fuck's sake!

328
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:13,499
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

329
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:16,336
I'll fight you for it.
You and me.

330
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,684
So that's the kind
of fight it'll be.

331
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:34,103
You want to stay down.

332
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:40,526
You want to stay down!

333
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:46,115
Get back down
and fucking stay down.

334
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,785
I promise you,
you want to stay down.

335
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:51,120
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

336
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:53,373
Cheeky bastard.

337
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:02,131
Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.

338
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,676
Get back down

339
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:07,720
or you will not be coming up
next time.

340
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,141
Bollocks to you.

341
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:14,560
This is sick. I'm out of here.

342
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:17,355
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

343
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,568
You stay until the job's done.

344
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,313
It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey

345
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:02,358
was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.

346
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:05,278
Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.

347
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:09,824
Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.

348
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,785
If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes,

349
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,288
Tommy knows he'll be
buried with him.

350
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,583
Why would the gypsies
want to go to the trouble to explain

351
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:21,044
why a man died in their campsite?

352
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,464
Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.

353
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:28,217
It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?

354
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:30,803
Tommy, "The Tit,"

355
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,680
is praying.

356
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,223
And if he isn't,

357
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,476
he fucking should be.

358
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:05,505
Bad Boy.

359
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:07,757
Sol.
- Easy.

360
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:10,760
No, it's a moissanite.

361
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:11,928
A what-anight?

362
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:15,556
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

363
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:16,849
It's Mickey Mouse, mate.

364
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:18,851
Spurious.

365
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:21,104
Not genuine.

366
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:23,272
And it's worth

367
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:24,941
fuck-all.

368
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:28,027
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

369
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:30,196
Leave this game to me
and Sol.

370
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:32,782
Laters.

371
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:37,787
What is that, Vince?

372
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,705
This is a dog, Sol.

373
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:42,125
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

374
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:43,960
What's your problem?
It's only a fucking dog.

375
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,878
Where'd you get it?
The gyppos.

376
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:47,213
Here.

377
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:50,299
They threw it in
with a load of moody gold.

378
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:55,054
You know gyppos, Sol. They're
always throwing dogs in with deals.

379
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:56,681
Well, it better not
be dangerous.

380
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,685
And what do you think
you're doing now?

381
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:03,938
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

382
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:07,567
Stop the dog!

383
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:08,985
Come back here!

384
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:11,070
All right, Boris?

385
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:15,074
Don't worry about the dog.
I'm not.

386
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:17,952
What can I do for you, Boris?

387
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,454
I have a job for you.

388
00:24:20,664 --> 00:24:22,415
I already have a job.

389
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:26,210
Fifty grand
for half a day's work.

390
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:28,504
Go on.

391
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:32,049
I want you to hold up a bookies.

392
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:38,598
Ah... From Russia
with love, eh?

393
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,726
I have stones to sell,

394
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:45,062
fat to chew and many different men
to see about many different ducks,

395
00:24:45,272 --> 00:24:46,856
so if I am not rushing you...

396
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:50,902
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

397
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,447
I am not in Rome, Doug.

398
00:24:54,656 --> 00:24:56,407
I am in a rush.

399
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:58,284
I got to make the bookies.

400
00:24:58,452 --> 00:24:59,619
Bookies?

401
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:02,955
What are you betting on?
Bomber Harris.

402
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,125
The unlicensed boxer, right?

403
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:10,880
Do you know something
that I don't?

404
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,134
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

405
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:19,972
He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?

406
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:21,432
Of course I am.

407
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:25,478
Tyrone will drive for us. He's
done a rally driving course.

408
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:26,938
Of course I have.

409
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:32,526
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

410
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,278
Your seats?

411
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:36,781
Tyrone, this is a stolen car,
mate.

412
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:38,950
While I'm at the
wheel, it's my car,

413
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:43,579
so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

414
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,707
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

415
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,668
It went straight back
to the gyppos.

416
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:51,629
Oh, shut up.
And how could it find them?

417
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:55,132
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

418
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:57,009
Ask him.

419
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,971
It's like he's a fucking
homing beacon or something.

420
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:03,057
Steady on the brakes.

421
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,559
Fuck me, I thought you
said he could drive, Sol.

422
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:09,647
Listen, don't worry about me. Just
worry about that dog on my seats.

423
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:11,357
All right?

424
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:33,170
Hey.
What?

425
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:37,258
I thought you said he was a getaway
driver. What the fuck can he get away from?

426
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:40,344
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

427
00:26:40,595 --> 00:26:42,179
Just worry about getting us
a gun, yeah?

428
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:43,556
Yeah?

429
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:48,519
What's that?

430
00:26:49,438 --> 00:26:52,023
This is a shotgun, Sol.

431
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:55,067
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

432
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,322
I want to raise pulses, don't I?
You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

433
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,009
That does not
look like a bookies.

434
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,472
Why'd we stop here for? What's the
matter with that space over there?

435
00:27:24,806 --> 00:27:26,640
It's too tight.

436
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:28,768
Too tight?

437
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:31,896
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

438
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:36,359
Leave him alone. He's a
natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

439
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,235
Of course I am.

440
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:52,375
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

441
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,710
Yeah, Tyrone,
what have you done?

442
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:57,713
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

443
00:27:57,964 --> 00:28:00,383
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

444
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:03,260
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

445
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,512
I didn't see it there.

446
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:08,641
It's a four-ton truck, Tyrone. It's not
like it's a packet of fucking peanuts, is it?

447
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:10,601
It was at a funny angle.

448
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:14,647
It's behind you,
Tyrone.

449
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:17,316
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

450
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:20,277
Control that dog
as well.

451
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:23,322
Get that dog off him.
Get it off me.

452
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:28,160
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

453
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:33,040
Don't snatch.

454
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:36,919
He can't swallow
the whole ball.

455
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:40,965
Yeah.

456
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,511
Why the fuck

457
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:48,139
did you put Gorgeous George

458
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:51,016
into a bare-knuckle boxing match

459
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:53,561
two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

460
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,106
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

461
00:28:57,357 --> 00:29:01,569
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

462
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:04,196
What the fuck
did you expect?

463
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:06,782
A grease-down
and a shiatsu?

464
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:09,452
Who took the jam
out of your doughnut?

465
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:12,163
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut, Tommy.

466
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:13,789
You did.

467
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:18,002
You said get a good deal.

468
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:20,754
I fail to recognize
the correlation

469
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:24,216
between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous,

470
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:25,676
and a good deal.

471
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:28,095
How're we gonna explain this
to Brick Top?

472
00:29:28,305 --> 00:29:30,139
That his fight isn't gonna happen?

473
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:32,099
We replace the fighter.

474
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:34,185
Oh, and hope he
doesn't notice?

475
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:36,312
And who the fuck are we gonna
replace him with?

476
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:38,314
What about John The Gun?

477
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:41,025
Or Mad Fist Willy?

478
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,527
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you, Tommy?

479
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,738
Mad Fist went mad,

480
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:48,657
and The Gun shot himself.

481
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,872
Jesus.

482
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,962
What?
Let's use the fucking pikey.

483
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:05,758
How much you gonna pay us?
10 K.

484
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:09,303
Me bollocks. Lose more than
that running for the bus.

485
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:18,646
All right.

486
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,857
I'll do it for a caravan.

487
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:23,609
A what?

488
00:30:23,777 --> 00:30:25,110
A caravan.

489
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,948
Top of the range and all that.
It was us that wanted a caravan.

490
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:31,617
Anyway, what's wrong
with this one?

491
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:33,953
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

492
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,830
Your what?

493
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,207
His ma.

494
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:07,861
Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.

495
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:11,615
They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.

496
00:31:11,825 --> 00:31:13,242
Now I'm changing fighters,

497
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:16,954
and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.

498
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,832
He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up,

499
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,376
and aim for penetration.

500
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,795
If I didn't have
the replacement pikey,

501
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:27,339
he'd want to split me in half.

502
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:33,470
They could charm the paint
off walls, these fellas.

503
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,731
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

504
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:47,860
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

505
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:50,696
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

506
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,532
Do you like a dog fight,
Turkish?

507
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,577
We've lost Gorgeous George.

508
00:31:57,537 --> 00:31:58,829
Shh...

509
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:02,583
You're gonna have
to repeat that.

510
00:32:03,376 --> 00:32:05,669
We've lost Gorgeous George.

511
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:08,172
Well, where'd you lose him?

512
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,924
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

513
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:13,844
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, now is it?

514
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:15,054
We're not backing out.

515
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:18,223
You bet your bollocks to a barn
dance you're not backing out.

516
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:19,892
We're changing the fighter.

517
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:24,730
Oh, fuck me, your lady
friend got a voice?

518
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:27,149
And who might you be changing
him to, sweethearts?

519
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,735
You won't know him,
but he's mustard.

520
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:31,070
Mustard?

521
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,990
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee,

522
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:36,659
you can't change fighters.

523
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:39,078
Look, you've still got your fight.
No.

524
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:42,498
I lose all bets at the bookies. You
can't change fighters at the last minute.

525
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:46,585
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

526
00:32:46,753 --> 00:32:48,545
You can take bets
at the fight.

527
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:51,423
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

528
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:54,009
And you don't want to get
bitten, now do you, sweethearts?

529
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,017
Make sure your man
goes down in the fourth.

530
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,646
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

531
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:09,483
This is the one place
I didn't want to be:

532
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:10,984
In his debt.

533
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:13,821
Which now means
I'm in his pocket.

534
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,865
You're on thin fucking ice,
my pedigree chums.

535
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:19,785
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

536
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:22,287
Now, fuck off.

537
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:33,799
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

538
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:37,177
I don't know, Avi. I'm not
his mother. But I'm seeing him later.

539
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:40,013
When later?
Well, he said he wanted cash.

540
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:43,308
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

541
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:51,233
A fight?

542
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:55,821
What do you mean? What do you
mean, a fight? A boxing match?

543
00:33:56,322 --> 00:34:00,701
Is there gambling involved?
It's a boxing match, Avi.

544
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,495
Did he have a case with him?
Yes, he had a case.

545
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:05,414
And this schmuck is gambling?

546
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:10,335
You're talking about Franky "I've got a
problem with gambling" Four Fingers, Doug.

547
00:34:10,503 --> 00:34:12,171
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

548
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:14,506
Well, you're plenty fucking
stupid, I'll give you that.

549
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:17,342
Do you have any idea why they
call him Franky Four Fingers?

550
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:18,927
No, I have no idea.

551
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,347
Well, because he makes stupid
bets with dangerous people.

552
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:25,225
And when he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop, Doug.

553
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:27,436
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin either.

554
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:29,104
Avi, I'm sure he can pay.

555
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:33,108
Not with my goods, he isn't. You got
a toothbrush? We're going to London.

556
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,694
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

557
00:34:40,408 --> 00:34:43,452
Avi!
Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

558
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,290
I don't like leaving
my own country, Doug,

559
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:52,711
and I especially don't like leaving it
for anything less than warm, sandy beaches

560
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:55,464
and cocktails
with little straw hats.

561
00:34:56,216 --> 00:34:58,008
We've got sandy beaches.

562
00:34:58,218 --> 00:35:00,093
So who the fuck
wants to see them?

563
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:04,264
I hope that you can appreciate the
concern I have for my friend Franky.

564
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:06,809
I'm gonna find him, Doug, and
you're gonna help me find him.

565
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,977
And we're gonna start
at that fight.

566
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:13,065
How am I gonna
get it out?

567
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:15,067
It will probably
cough it up.

568
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:16,568
Do you think he'll
be all right?

569
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,070
I hope not.

570
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:20,239
Look, are we gonna rob this bookies?

571
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:21,448
Yes, big man.

572
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:22,741
What are we waiting
for anyway?

573
00:35:23,076 --> 00:35:26,620
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

574
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:27,788
And why's that?

575
00:35:27,997 --> 00:35:32,918
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

576
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:34,253
What's in the case?

577
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,132
Oh, for fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

578
00:35:40,844 --> 00:35:41,927
Jesus.

579
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:45,430
Private night tonight, chaps.
I'm well aware of that, my son.

580
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:47,349
That's why we're here.

581
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:50,352
Well done.
This is the back way in.

582
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:53,605
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

583
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:55,649
Private night tonight,
chaps.

584
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:57,651
We know. That's exactly
why we're here.

585
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,444
Tickets.

586
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:02,114
Are we ever gonna get
into this place, huh?

587
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:05,200
Avi, Avi,
you gotta understand.

588
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:08,287
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

589
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:11,373
I'm not looking for Vegas,
and I'm not looking for legal.

590
00:36:11,624 --> 00:36:13,458
I'm looking for
Franky-fucking-Four Fingers.

591
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:17,296
I know that, and he
said he's gonna be here.

592
00:36:17,463 --> 00:36:18,839
Well, if there's gambling
involved, he'll be here.

593
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:20,215
Let's not have a fuck-up.

594
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:21,800
You won't let us down,
will you?

595
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:25,971
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that. Peter.

596
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:30,809
Oh, is that him?

597
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:33,186
I don't know. How many
fingers did he have?

598
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,606
I'm sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

599
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:38,483
Look, let's not stand on ceremony,
mate. Let's start the show.

600
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,418
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

601
00:36:56,669 --> 00:36:59,588
Look, if you know what's good
for you you'll give me everything-

602
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:01,340
Ah!

603
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:06,678
Vince, what are you
doing up there?

604
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:09,348
What does it look
like I'm doing up here?

605
00:37:11,517 --> 00:37:14,394
This is starting to hurt,
Solomon.

606
00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:16,897
Drop the screen now.

607
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:21,318
How you doing, Vince?

608
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:23,946
I'd do a lot better if
you'd stop using my name.

609
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:26,198
Fill that bag.
All bets are off.

610
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:30,202
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

611
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:31,620
Appreciate it,

612
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:33,747
but all bets

613
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:36,708
are

614
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:38,085
off.

615
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:42,464
If all bets are off, then there
can't be any money, can there?

616
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:46,343
I ain't fucking buying that.

617
00:37:46,594 --> 00:37:50,055
Well, that's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

618
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:52,432
What have you got?

619
00:37:54,227 --> 00:37:55,811
Nothing, really.

620
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,398
A few coins, but no notes.

621
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:03,235
Show me your hands.

622
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:07,072
You've got five fingers.

623
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,410
Copper coins.

624
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:15,330
What do you mean,
copper fucking coins?

625
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:27,884
It won't open because
it's a security door.

626
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:29,261
Hold that.

627
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:35,267
Ah!

628
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:36,893
Fuck.

629
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:39,730
My leg.

630
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:46,194
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

631
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,121
We're fucked.

632
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:04,629
What the fuck are
you two doing?

633
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:11,053
Get us out of here, Tyrone.

634
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,686
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

635
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:30,155
Who the fuck
is this man, Tyrone?

636
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:36,787
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

637
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,499
In the red corner

638
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,251
we have the young
and unchallenged...

639
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:47,756
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

640
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:49,674
Just make sure he doesn't
kill me before the fourth.

641
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:53,762
So give it up
for the bone-crunching

642
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,139
one-punch machine gun,

643
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,266
Mickey!

644
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:06,525
And in the other corner...

645
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:08,985
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker-

646
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:12,114
Well, he is a fat fucker, but
he's dirty and he's dangerous.

647
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:17,202
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

648
00:40:19,872 --> 00:40:21,998
Now, try and look
like a fighter.

649
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,709
Let's get ready

650
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:27,712
to rumble!

651
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:04,291
Do you realize I've just dumped
fucking forty grand down you?

652
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,709
What's the fucking crack?

653
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:08,628
I'll make it up to you.
I ain't fucking happy.

654
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,299
I'll make it up to you,
I promise. Stand on me.

655
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:15,635
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

656
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,514
Well, thanks for the tip,
Brick Top.

657
00:41:19,724 --> 00:41:22,851
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone,

658
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,519
I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

659
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,774
You stop me again whilst I'm walking
and I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

660
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:30,942
Ah!

661
00:41:51,464 --> 00:41:54,424
He's here.
Well, you explain it to him.

662
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:04,351
What you doing with him?
The case was attached to his arm.

663
00:42:04,644 --> 00:42:06,019
So why didn't you
chop it off?

664
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:09,481
Why?
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

665
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,107
But he has the case.

666
00:42:11,317 --> 00:42:13,818
Look, we
- Well, you have a problem.

667
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:15,111
What?

668
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:16,655
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

669
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:19,616
Oh. Okay.

670
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:22,327
Here is the 10 grand.

671
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:25,664
No. Keep it.
We want this.

672
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,625
Well, at least
half of this.

673
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:31,670
What was
in the case was mine.

674
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:35,215
What was in the bookies
was yours. Okay?

675
00:42:35,508 --> 00:42:39,344
Well, it wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

676
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:41,346
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

677
00:42:41,514 --> 00:42:45,058
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

678
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:49,479
I mean, we could, by all rights,
keep the whole fucking stone, Boris.

679
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:00,407
Watch out!

680
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:04,577
Drop the gun, fat boy.

681
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:12,168
You fucking idiots. He
could not know my name.

682
00:43:13,212 --> 00:43:14,921
Give me the stone.

683
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:18,508
It's in the case.
What?

684
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:20,885
It's in the case.

685
00:43:21,095 --> 00:43:22,762
You put the stone in the case?

686
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:25,765
Then open it
and give me the stone.

687
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:30,937
The only man who knew the
combination, you just shot.

688
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:04,429
Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.

689
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:09,684
Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.

690
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:13,563
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.

691
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:18,443
I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.

692
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:22,447
But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.

693
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:24,449
Once I have that, it's-

694
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:25,784
Oink, oink.

695
00:44:26,452 --> 00:44:27,619
Shit.

696
00:44:29,914 --> 00:44:31,748
So that's where
you keep the sugar.

697
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:36,503
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

698
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,964
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it, John?

699
00:44:40,174 --> 00:44:42,592
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

700
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:44,803
No, we don't, John.

701
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,517
Hey.

702
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:59,359
I just had them polished.

703
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:06,491
Go and put the kettle on.

704
00:45:09,954 --> 00:45:13,331
You take sugar?
No, thank you, Turkish.

705
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm sweet enough.

706
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:26,803
He is now your problem.

707
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:29,472
Okay?

708
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:41,609
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body,

709
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,988
but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

710
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:49,659
Well, look at him.

711
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:59,878
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

712
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:01,421
I want to use the pikey.

713
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,382
All right. Of course.

714
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:06,885
Of course, fucking of course.

715
00:46:07,094 --> 00:46:09,596
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

716
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:11,764
But this time...

717
00:46:12,558 --> 00:46:16,394
I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

718
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:21,399
And I do mean it, this time.

719
00:46:30,326 --> 00:46:34,621
Now, I know you come
back here to open your safe.

720
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:39,584
So now you can open it.

721
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:42,253
He's been a busy
little bastard, that Turkish.

722
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:44,255
I think you've let him get away
with enough already, governor.

723
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:48,593
It can get you in a lot of trouble,
thinking, Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

724
00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:50,762
Right. That takes
care of one little piggy.

725
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:53,806
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

726
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:55,308
Find them today.

727
00:47:14,328 --> 00:47:16,788
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

728
00:47:17,623 --> 00:47:18,748
Tommy.

729
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:23,294
You're a snake in the grass, ain't
you, Tommy? Where'd they come from?

730
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:25,797
You're looking for
my boy, are you?

731
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:27,423
Do you know
where I can find him?

732
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:29,592
Yeah.

733
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,761
Don't suppose you'd like to share
that information with me, would you?

734
00:47:31,971 --> 00:47:34,347
I don't want you getting my boy
into any trouble. Do you hear me?

735
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,851
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

736
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:41,813
He's coursing.

737
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,484
What's coursing?
Hare coursing.

738
00:47:47,987 --> 00:47:51,948
They set two lurchers-
They're dogs, before you ask.

739
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:54,367
On a hare.

740
00:47:54,994 --> 00:47:58,121
And the hare has
to outrun the dogs.

741
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,373
So, what if it doesn't?

742
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:05,211
Well, the big rabbit
gets fucked, doesn't it?

743
00:48:08,716 --> 00:48:10,466
Proper fucked?

744
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:12,510
Yeah, Tommy.

745
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:15,054
Before "zee"
Germans get there.

746
00:48:17,308 --> 00:48:19,142
Do you know these tits, Errol?

747
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:20,810
I know a lot of tits, governor...

748
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,980
but I don't know any quite as
fucking stupid as these two.

749
00:48:24,189 --> 00:48:25,356
John?

750
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:27,859
I can't help, guv.

751
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:34,032
Ah, Tyrone.

752
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:37,160
You silly, fat bastard.

753
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:39,704
Well, do you want to do it?

754
00:48:39,872 --> 00:48:41,664
That depends.
On what?

755
00:48:41,874 --> 00:48:44,876
On you buying
this caravan.

756
00:48:45,044 --> 00:48:47,462
Ah, not the rouge one.
The rose.

757
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:50,214
It's not the same caravan.
It's not the same fight.

758
00:48:50,382 --> 00:48:52,425
It's twice the size
of the last one.

759
00:48:52,593 --> 00:48:54,052
Turkish, the fight
is twice the size.

760
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:55,637
And me ma still
needs a caravan.

761
00:48:55,804 --> 00:48:58,890
And I like to look after me
ma. It's a fair deal. Take it.

762
00:48:59,058 --> 00:49:03,144
Mickey, you're lucky we aren't worm
food after your last performance.

763
00:49:03,395 --> 00:49:05,897
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

764
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:12,403
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

765
00:49:12,738 --> 00:49:14,489
Eh, save your breath
for cooling your porridge.

766
00:49:14,657 --> 00:49:16,407
Now look, she wants
a hack with two roof lights...

767
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:27,085
Right. And she's terrible partial
to the periwinkle blue, boys.

768
00:49:29,296 --> 00:49:30,797
Have I made myself
clear, boys?

769
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,259
Yeah, that's perfectly
clear, Mickey. Yeah.

770
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:38,763
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

771
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:45,645
Did you understand a single
word of what he just said?

772
00:49:48,482 --> 00:49:49,607
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.

773
00:49:51,443 --> 00:49:52,652
Fucker.

774
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:54,779
I'll bet you for it.

775
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,115
You'll what?
- He'll bet you for it.

776
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,327
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favor?

777
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,079
I'll do you a favor.

778
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:05,957
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan,

779
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,792
and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

780
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:12,171
If I lose...

781
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,427
oh, fuck it,
I'll do the fight for free.

782
00:50:19,304 --> 00:50:22,181
Now the last thing I
really want to do is bet a pikey.

783
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,600
However, I don't really
have much of a choice.

784
00:50:25,185 --> 00:50:28,479
Somehow I've got to get
him to fight, but if I lose...

785
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:31,941
Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.

786
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:36,028
Okay. I reckon
the hare gets fucked.

787
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,822
What? Proper fucked?

788
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:42,201
You got that, London?

789
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:43,494
We're on!

790
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:58,569
Okay, I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

791
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:00,947
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

792
00:52:17,923 --> 00:52:20,716
Periwinkle blue.
Bye, boys.

793
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:25,096
Who's proper
fucked now, then?

794
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:28,891
There's something
very wrong with this.

795
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:32,395
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

796
00:52:33,146 --> 00:52:37,775
Well, why didn't you "bust a
cap in his ass" then, Tommy?

797
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:41,487
Mind you, you'd do more
damage if you threw it at him.

798
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:44,240
What? You saying
I can't shoot?

799
00:52:44,449 --> 00:52:47,994
Oh, no, Tommy. I wasn't
saying you can't shoot.

800
00:52:48,287 --> 00:52:50,121
I know you can't shoot.

801
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,667
What I was saying is, that six-pound
piece of shit stuck in your trousers there

802
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,919
would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

803
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,629
You saying the
gun don't work?

804
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:00,256
You tried it?

805
00:53:05,512 --> 00:53:06,512
Whoops.

806
00:53:08,974 --> 00:53:12,101
I want to see that
sneaky fucking Russian.

807
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:15,021
What has he got a tea
cozy on his head for?

808
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:17,148
To keep his head warm.

809
00:53:17,357 --> 00:53:19,859
What happened to him?
He got shot in the face, Lincoln.

810
00:53:20,152 --> 00:53:21,527
I thought that was obvious.

811
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:24,155
What'd you do that for? Did
you mistake him for a rabbit?

812
00:53:24,364 --> 00:53:26,824
What do you want me to do about it?
Sort it out.

813
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:29,952
I'm not a fucking witch doctor.
But you are a bad boy yardie.

814
00:53:30,162 --> 00:53:32,997
And bad boy yardies are supposed
to know how to get rid of bodies.

815
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:36,000
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

816
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:44,175
Looks like
we're in, governor.

817
00:53:45,928 --> 00:53:47,970
Goody gumdrops.

818
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,514
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

819
00:53:52,392 --> 00:53:53,517
Grab hold of his legs.

820
00:53:53,685 --> 00:53:56,562
What do you think I'm gonna
grab him by, his fucking ears?

821
00:54:07,032 --> 00:54:09,408
Hope this is not
a bad moment.

822
00:54:14,706 --> 00:54:15,957
Do you know who I am?

823
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,835
I do.

824
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:29,845
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

825
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:33,057
Well, I don't.

826
00:54:40,732 --> 00:54:45,236
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

827
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:47,738
Apparently, the best thing to do

828
00:54:47,906 --> 00:54:52,576
is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

829
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:54,620
Would someone
mind telling me,

830
00:54:54,788 --> 00:54:56,122
who are you?

831
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:59,417
And when you got your six
pieces, you gotta get rid of them

832
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:03,087
because it's no good leaving it in the deep
freeze for your mum to discover, now is it?

833
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,430
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

834
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:16,100
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days,

835
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:19,603
then the sight of a chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

836
00:55:21,106 --> 00:55:23,065
You gotta shave
the heads of your victims

837
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,608
and pull the teeth out

838
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:26,402
for the sake of the
piggies' digestion.

839
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:28,946
You could do this afterwards,
of course,

840
00:55:29,156 --> 00:55:31,657
but you don't want to sieving
through pigshit, now do you?

841
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:36,579
They will go
through bone like butter.

842
00:55:36,788 --> 00:55:40,833
You need at least 16 pigs to
finish the job in one sitting,

843
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:45,129
so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

844
00:55:45,297 --> 00:55:48,507
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds

845
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,676
in about eight minutes.

846
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:52,553
That means that a single pig

847
00:55:52,804 --> 00:55:56,474
can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh

848
00:55:56,725 --> 00:55:58,851
every minute.

849
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:01,312
Hence the expression

850
00:56:01,563 --> 00:56:04,899
"as greedy as a pig."

851
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:12,990
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

852
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,452
Now I mean, if you wouldn't mind
telling me who the fuck you are,

853
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:19,580
apart from someone who feeds
people to pigs, of course.

854
00:56:23,835 --> 00:56:25,753
Do you know what
"nemesis" means?

855
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:33,552
"A righteous infliction
of retribution

856
00:56:33,845 --> 00:56:37,515
manifested by an
appropriate agent."

857
00:56:37,682 --> 00:56:42,645
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

858
00:56:43,188 --> 00:56:44,647
Me.

859
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:53,781
Gentlemen...

860
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:27,731
Why can't you find
me Franky, Doug?

861
00:57:27,983 --> 00:57:32,570
Avi, what do you want me to
do? I'm not a bounty hunter.

862
00:57:34,156 --> 00:57:35,739
What about Tony?
You know, Bullet-Tooth Tony.

863
00:57:37,075 --> 00:57:38,909
Who's Bullet-Tooth-?
Tony!

864
00:57:39,077 --> 00:57:40,327
You silly fuck.

865
00:57:40,495 --> 00:57:41,579
He's a liability.

866
00:57:41,746 --> 00:57:43,998
He'll find you Moses and the
burning bush if you pay him to.

867
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,583
You are gonna die, Tony!

868
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,210
He got shot six times,
had the bullets molded into gold.

869
00:57:49,921 --> 00:57:51,755
I shoot you, you go down!

870
00:57:51,923 --> 00:57:54,592
Yeah, he's got two in his teeth that
Dad did for him, so he loves Dad.

871
00:57:56,011 --> 00:57:57,720
Why don't you fucking die?

872
00:57:57,929 --> 00:57:59,597
He's the best chance
you got of finding Franky.

873
00:57:59,764 --> 00:58:01,974
Six times?

874
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:03,601
In one sitting.

875
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:06,103
You're in trouble now.

876
00:58:07,689 --> 00:58:10,024
Well, that sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

877
00:58:22,495 --> 00:58:23,579
Bonjour.

878
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,084
What have you got to tell me
that's so fucking important?

879
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:31,837
Mr. Pulford, why do you
think we've got a dead man

880
00:58:32,047 --> 00:58:33,380
missing an arm in our office?

881
00:58:33,548 --> 00:58:34,840
Talk to me, tell me.

882
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:36,884
Four days.
You give us four days

883
00:58:37,177 --> 00:58:40,804
and I will get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

884
00:58:41,056 --> 00:58:42,223
What do you think, Errol?

885
00:58:42,432 --> 00:58:44,642
I think we should drip-dry
them, governor, while we got the chance.

886
00:58:45,977 --> 00:58:48,187
It was a rhetorical
question, Errol.

887
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,065
What have I told
you about thinking?

888
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:53,859
You got 48 hours.
Yeah.

889
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:57,404
You can keep that silly, fat
wanker. The lads can't lift him.

890
00:58:57,656 --> 00:59:00,574
Forty-eight hours.
After that it's your family

891
00:59:00,825 --> 00:59:03,661
and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

892
00:59:05,997 --> 00:59:10,042
So, what should I call you? Should
I call you, uh, "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

893
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:11,919
You can call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

894
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:15,673
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

895
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,593
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

896
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:21,845
Forty thousand.

897
00:59:23,515 --> 00:59:25,349
Where was he last seen?

898
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:27,268
At a bookies.

899
00:59:27,686 --> 00:59:29,103
Bookies?

900
00:59:31,356 --> 00:59:32,815
Pass us the blower, Susi.

901
00:59:37,237 --> 00:59:38,946
The bookies got blagged last night.
Blagged?

902
00:59:39,114 --> 00:59:40,364
Speak English to me, Tony.

903
00:59:40,573 --> 00:59:42,866
I thought this country
spawned the fucking language,

904
00:59:43,034 --> 00:59:45,035
and so far, nobody
seems to speak it.

905
00:59:45,203 --> 00:59:46,954
Blagged, robbed.

906
00:59:47,205 --> 00:59:49,540
We're gonna go and see a man that
looks like he might know something.

907
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:51,542
I need a gun.

908
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:54,878
You don't, Rosebud, me
old son. You need me.

909
00:59:57,382 --> 00:59:59,758
I got fucking black ink
all over fuck boy, mate.

910
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:02,094
He's stained for fucking life.

911
01:00:02,387 --> 01:00:05,055
Okay, that and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell, mate. You should have seen it-

912
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:06,640
All right, Mullet?

913
01:00:11,563 --> 01:00:13,397
How you doing, Tony?
You all right, mate?

914
01:00:13,565 --> 01:00:15,566
Oh, nice tie.

915
01:00:15,734 --> 01:00:17,526
I heard you weren't about
that much these days, Tone.

916
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:20,988
What do you know? Still warm, the
blood that courses through my veins.

917
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,282
Unlike yours, Mullet.

918
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:25,659
I wanna know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

919
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:29,163
Do me a favor, Tone.
I will do you a favor, Mullet.

920
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:33,167
I'll not bash the living fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends here.

921
01:00:34,085 --> 01:00:37,338
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, Tone, you know how it is, man.

922
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:43,677
Comfortable, Mullet?

923
01:00:43,845 --> 01:00:46,805
Seems sadly ironic, it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

924
01:00:47,015 --> 01:00:48,766
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

925
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:52,144
What the fuck
you doing, Tone?

926
01:00:52,354 --> 01:00:54,980
Driving down the street with
your head stuck in my window.

927
01:00:55,815 --> 01:00:57,733
What you think
I'm doing, you penis?

928
01:00:57,901 --> 01:00:59,276
Well, don't, Tone.

929
01:01:00,362 --> 01:01:02,321
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

930
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:03,822
Slow down, Tone.

931
01:01:04,115 --> 01:01:06,158
Slow down, Tony!

932
01:01:06,368 --> 01:01:08,952
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

933
01:01:10,455 --> 01:01:12,623
Play some music if you like.
Ahh!

934
01:01:14,459 --> 01:01:16,293
Oh, I love this track.

935
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:18,754
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

936
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:21,340
Yes, Mullet?

937
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:27,012
I think it's two black guys that work
from a... In a pawnshop in Smith Street.

938
01:01:27,305 --> 01:01:29,056
Better not be telling
me porky pies.

939
01:01:29,307 --> 01:01:34,686
I'm fucking tell you, it's two black guys
work out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

940
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:37,314
It's very effective, Tony.

941
01:01:37,565 --> 01:01:39,650
It's not too subtle,
but effective.

942
01:01:41,236 --> 01:01:42,736
Are we taking him with us?

943
01:01:51,996 --> 01:01:53,163
It's the Russian.

944
01:01:54,165 --> 01:01:55,249
A Russian?

945
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,085
Well, to be technical he's
an Uzbekistanian, but...

946
01:01:58,336 --> 01:02:02,881
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

947
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:05,384
Give me a name.
Yurinov.

948
01:02:05,677 --> 01:02:07,010
Boris.

949
01:02:07,512 --> 01:02:09,096
Boris The Blade?
Yeah.

950
01:02:09,347 --> 01:02:12,224
As in Boris
The Bullet-Dodger?

951
01:02:13,726 --> 01:02:16,186
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

952
01:02:17,105 --> 01:02:19,523
Because he
dodges bullets, Avi.

953
01:02:21,401 --> 01:02:24,403
He won't fight
unless we buy his mum a caravan,

954
01:02:24,696 --> 01:02:26,238
and you nicked all our savings.

955
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:30,742
In the quiet words of the
Virgin Mary, come again?

956
01:02:31,703 --> 01:02:35,581
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

957
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,208
Are you taking the piss?
- What can I do?

958
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:40,586
I can't make him do it, can I?

959
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:43,964
You're not much good
to me alive are you, Turkish?

960
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:52,598
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

961
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,602
I want that pikey to fight.

962
01:03:21,127 --> 01:03:24,296
Brick Top thought
smashing up our arcade

963
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:27,591
might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.

964
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,761
And if that wasn't enough,

965
01:03:31,137 --> 01:03:33,472
he thought it would be
a good idea

966
01:03:34,098 --> 01:03:36,475
to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.

967
01:03:37,936 --> 01:03:39,770
While she was asleep in it.

968
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:38,996
Turkish, get your arse up.

969
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:41,039
You lot,

970
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:43,750
follow me and I'll
fucking shoot you.

971
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:47,671
Calm down, son.
Behave yourself.

972
01:04:47,922 --> 01:04:50,841
I've got the gun, son. I think
it's you who should behave.

973
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,594
What?

974
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:56,722
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

975
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:16,700
Jesus.

976
01:05:16,868 --> 01:05:18,535
Sorry, Mickey.

977
01:05:19,704 --> 01:05:21,288
ODid you do it?

978
01:05:26,377 --> 01:05:27,878
Then what are you sorry for?

979
01:05:28,713 --> 01:05:30,339
What the fuck
are you still doing here?

980
01:05:30,506 --> 01:05:31,548
Darren, come back!

981
01:05:31,716 --> 01:05:34,593
You got some tars on you.
Fuck off, Darren.

982
01:05:35,094 --> 01:05:36,887
Fuck off!
Darren!

983
01:05:44,062 --> 01:05:46,063
How silly do I feel?

984
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:49,232
His mum is still smoking
next to us,

985
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,485
and I'm asking him to fight.

986
01:05:52,403 --> 01:05:55,489
I'll do the fight before he
causes any more carnage.

987
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:57,908
And if he'd said no,

988
01:05:58,242 --> 01:06:00,535
it could've been
a shite sight worse.

989
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:07,918
Russians.

990
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:14,966
Russians.

991
01:06:15,176 --> 01:06:16,635
I should've known.

992
01:06:16,928 --> 01:06:20,806
Anti-Semite,
slippery Cossack sluts.

993
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:23,100
What do you know
about this goyim?

994
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:25,352
Ex-KGB cancer.

995
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,146
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

996
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:29,606
He'll be impossible
to track down.

997
01:06:31,776 --> 01:06:32,818
Yeah.

998
01:06:33,027 --> 01:06:36,446
There's a strange man
who wants to sell us an 84-karat stone.

999
01:06:36,656 --> 01:06:39,199
Where does he come from?
I don't know. Hard to tell.

1000
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:40,992
He's got a thick Russian accent.

1001
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:58,009
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

1002
01:06:58,678 --> 01:07:01,805
That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

1003
01:07:01,973 --> 01:07:04,933
First things first. One of us...

1004
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:10,021
Tyrone, you get around to the Russian's.
The second you see him, you give us a call.

1005
01:07:10,523 --> 01:07:11,690
Now.

1006
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:20,824
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

1007
01:07:21,033 --> 01:07:24,202
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

1008
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:26,413
He's all yours, Rosebud, old son.

1009
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:29,291
Not a problem.

1010
01:07:31,043 --> 01:07:32,711
You're gonna have
to get me to a doctor.

1011
01:07:33,004 --> 01:07:34,254
Shoot that fuck!
Yeah, yeah.

1012
01:07:34,422 --> 01:07:35,797
Then, get me to a doctor.

1013
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:37,966
Okay, yeah, yeah. But first
we get the stone, Rosey.

1014
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:40,343
First the stone. And then
I'll get you to a doctor.

1015
01:07:40,553 --> 01:07:43,472
And not just any doctor, boychik. I'm
gonna get you to a nice Jewish doctor.

1016
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:45,807
Find my friend
a nice Jewish doctor!

1017
01:07:49,896 --> 01:07:52,522
Get his keys and find
out exactly where the stone is.

1018
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,524
I think that you got
something to tell us.

1019
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:56,026
Easy. Take it easy,
Rosebud.

1020
01:07:56,194 --> 01:07:59,696
Oi. Do you want him
to be able to talk or not?

1021
01:07:59,906 --> 01:08:02,365
What the fuck do
you mean, replicas?

1022
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:06,203
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

1023
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:08,705
And I've got some extra
loud blanks, just in case.

1024
01:08:08,873 --> 01:08:11,750
In- Oh, in case we have
to deafen them to death?

1025
01:08:18,382 --> 01:08:20,717
Yeah.
Boris is here.

1026
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,886
We're coming over.
You hold him there.

1027
01:08:23,054 --> 01:08:24,054
Hold on!

1028
01:08:24,347 --> 01:08:25,388
He's not on his own!

1029
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:32,896
We're off.

1030
01:08:37,443 --> 01:08:40,028
Very industrious
for a Cossack.

1031
01:08:48,412 --> 01:08:51,081
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1032
01:08:54,752 --> 01:08:55,752
So, where is he, Tyrone?

1033
01:08:55,962 --> 01:08:58,672
It's not just he. Three
fellas went in the house.

1034
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,257
They locked Boris
in the back of the car.

1035
01:09:00,424 --> 01:09:02,008
Why didn't you tell us that?

1036
01:09:02,844 --> 01:09:04,761
Oi. Did they look hard?

1037
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:06,221
They looked messy.

1038
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:07,848
Hey, come on.
Let's get out of here.

1039
01:09:08,015 --> 01:09:09,432
What do you want to do
about the Russian?

1040
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,268
I want you to bury him.

1041
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:12,894
All right.

1042
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:16,773
I think we should
get you a new gun.

1043
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:18,733
But this time, try it.

1044
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:21,152
How far to the Russian's?

1045
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:22,946
We'll be there
in a minute.

1046
01:09:28,828 --> 01:09:31,329
Well, come on, then.
Uh-uh. Not so fast, Vinny.

1047
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:34,583
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1048
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:38,670
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

1049
01:09:38,963 --> 01:09:40,505
Why? What's
wrong with it?

1050
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:43,675
It's not in sync with evolution.
Shut up.

1051
01:09:43,926 --> 01:09:45,302
How do you wanna
get rid of him?

1052
01:09:45,511 --> 01:09:47,971
Well, do you want to shoot him?
It's a little noisy, isn't it?

1053
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,308
Well, do you want to stab him?
Well, it's a little cold-blooded, isn't it?

1054
01:09:51,475 --> 01:09:54,936
Do you want to kill him or not?
I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1055
01:09:55,146 --> 01:09:56,646
There. That's the spirit.

1056
01:09:56,814 --> 01:09:58,189
Do they fire?

1057
01:09:58,482 --> 01:09:59,816
Of course they fire.

1058
01:09:59,984 --> 01:10:02,235
Yeah. But how do you know?
I mean, they're replicas.

1059
01:10:02,403 --> 01:10:04,321
What do you know
about replicas?

1060
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:08,491
Whoa!

1061
01:10:08,659 --> 01:10:10,660
What the fuck are
you doing, Solomon?

1062
01:10:10,828 --> 01:10:13,038
Well, you wanted to know
whether or not they worked.

1063
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:16,958
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1064
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:20,879
What are you gonna do
with that, pick his teeth?

1065
01:10:21,172 --> 01:10:22,714
Wipe the butter off
and put it away.

1066
01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:24,841
Look, there's a proper
blade back there.

1067
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:28,470
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1068
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,181
Before that, they were running
around as mad as lorries.

1069
01:10:31,349 --> 01:10:35,352
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1070
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:38,605
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1071
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:40,732
Let me do you a favor.

1072
01:10:45,863 --> 01:10:46,947
Whoops.

1073
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:48,657
You. Want a knife?

1074
01:10:48,824 --> 01:10:51,034
Me? Oh, no, not me. I wouldn't
know what to do with it.

1075
01:10:51,202 --> 01:10:53,370
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1076
01:10:53,537 --> 01:10:55,664
What have you used to keep
your fork company all these years?

1077
01:10:55,873 --> 01:10:59,542
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1078
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:23,024
Is that Boris?

1079
01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:43,545
Oh, Tyrone,
what have you done?

1080
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,256
What about Rosebud?

1081
01:11:46,549 --> 01:11:49,384
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1082
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:52,220
But which bit would you like to bring?

1083
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,643
- They're getting out.
- Hold on.

1084
01:11:58,811 --> 01:12:00,979
Get down
and follow them.

1085
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:03,273
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1086
01:12:03,441 --> 01:12:04,816
You're making a scene.

1087
01:12:05,109 --> 01:12:07,652
I'm sorry for causing
a scene, Tony.

1088
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:11,156
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1089
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:12,907
Well, I can't leave
him in here, can I?

1090
01:12:19,957 --> 01:12:21,958
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1091
01:12:23,502 --> 01:12:27,505
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1092
01:12:27,798 --> 01:12:31,468
He's left the door open.
Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1093
01:12:31,677 --> 01:12:33,136
Should we go in?

1094
01:12:33,345 --> 01:12:36,806
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1095
01:12:37,099 --> 01:12:41,144
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1096
01:12:41,353 --> 01:12:44,814
He's got as many of these
nuts as he has those nuts.

1097
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:47,984
I don't care if he's
got fucking hazelnuts.

1098
01:12:48,194 --> 01:12:51,988
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1099
01:12:52,448 --> 01:12:56,201
My God, Tommy, you
certainly got those minerals.

1100
01:12:56,494 --> 01:13:00,163
Well, come on, then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1101
01:13:00,372 --> 01:13:02,665
You just tell him
who's in charge.

1102
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:09,672
Uh, Boris-

1103
01:13:14,887 --> 01:13:16,387
You certainly told him, Tommy.

1104
01:13:23,521 --> 01:13:25,480
The Drowning Trout.

1105
01:13:27,358 --> 01:13:28,858
Come and pick us up.

1106
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:30,193
And Doug...

1107
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:32,987
sharpish.

1108
01:13:53,175 --> 01:13:56,052
I don't want a fuss and I don't
want to put a bullet in your face,

1109
01:13:56,262 --> 01:13:59,889
but unless you give me exactly what
I want there will be fucking murders.

1110
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:03,685
What's your name?

1111
01:14:04,562 --> 01:14:05,562
Shoot him.

1112
01:14:06,021 --> 01:14:07,647
Ooh.

1113
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:16,573
Let go of the gun!

1114
01:14:22,413 --> 01:14:25,874
So, you're obviously
the big dick,

1115
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:29,460
and that, on either side
of you, are your balls.

1116
01:14:30,337 --> 01:14:32,589
There are two types of balls:

1117
01:14:33,382 --> 01:14:37,302
There are big brave balls, and there
are little mincey faggot balls.

1118
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:40,054
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1119
01:14:40,598 --> 01:14:42,891
Your dicks have drive
and clarity of vision,

1120
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:45,602
but they're not clever.

1121
01:14:46,103 --> 01:14:49,230
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1122
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:53,401
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy

1123
01:14:53,652 --> 01:14:56,905
and have brought your two
little mincey faggot balls along

1124
01:14:57,114 --> 01:15:00,617
for a good old time. But you've
got your parties muddled up.

1125
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:03,953
There's no pussy here,

1126
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:08,416
just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1127
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:10,793
Like a prick,

1128
01:15:11,795 --> 01:15:13,338
you're having second thoughts.

1129
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,257
You're shrinking.

1130
01:15:17,092 --> 01:15:19,802
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1131
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:24,224
And the fact that you've got "Replica"
written down the side of your gun...

1132
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:34,108
and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle. 50"...

1133
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:38,154
written on the side of mine...

1134
01:15:43,327 --> 01:15:45,203
should precipitate

1135
01:15:46,372 --> 01:15:50,208
your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1136
01:15:52,503 --> 01:15:53,628
Now...

1137
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:57,757
fuck off.

1138
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:14,649
Lock the door.

1139
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,192
Lock it!

1140
01:16:17,528 --> 01:16:18,736
Oh!

1141
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:23,366
Give me the case.

1142
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:25,743
Fuck you.

1143
01:16:26,745 --> 01:16:27,745
Shoot me.

1144
01:16:28,163 --> 01:16:30,206
I will. I'll shoot you.

1145
01:16:40,384 --> 01:16:43,219
Pass me case
or I shoot you.

1146
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:45,763
You know what?

1147
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:47,056
Fuck you too.

1148
01:16:47,558 --> 01:16:51,144
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing
me a favor, you Russian fuck. Go ahead!

1149
01:16:51,312 --> 01:16:53,938
You! Drop guns.

1150
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,565
Fuck you!

1151
01:16:55,733 --> 01:16:57,734
You drop your gun!

1152
01:16:59,069 --> 01:17:00,361
Okay.

1153
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:02,363
Avi...

1154
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:03,740
pull your socks up!

1155
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,590
Tyrone?
Fuck it. We're out of here.

1156
01:17:21,717 --> 01:17:23,259
Give me case.

1157
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:37,231
Avi...

1158
01:17:38,108 --> 01:17:40,401
where's the case?
- Put the gun away.

1159
01:17:41,945 --> 01:17:43,613
What's Boris doing here?

1160
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,783
Boris, what are
you doing here?

1161
01:17:46,992 --> 01:17:48,534
Fuck you!

1162
01:17:57,628 --> 01:17:59,003
Where's the case?

1163
01:18:00,464 --> 01:18:03,091
You piece of crap.
Don't take the piss, Boris.

1164
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,259
I'll show you.

1165
01:18:09,014 --> 01:18:10,473
Fuck you!

1166
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:16,479
Almost had it.

1167
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:18,481
For fuck's sake.

1168
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,112
Fuck you and all.

1169
01:18:26,323 --> 01:18:29,117
You lucky bastard.

1170
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:37,333
Jeez, it's flawless.

1171
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,837
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1172
01:18:41,088 --> 01:18:42,296
Leave the dog here.

1173
01:18:42,506 --> 01:18:47,343
Sol, why don't we just leave?
Because life's too short, Vincent,

1174
01:18:47,594 --> 01:18:50,430
and it'll get a lot fucking shorter
if Brick Top wishes it to be.

1175
01:18:50,681 --> 01:18:53,975
Now leave that dog here.
I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1176
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:55,143
Don't worry about it!

1177
01:18:55,352 --> 01:18:58,980
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1178
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:02,024
It's okay.

1179
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:04,610
Sit down. Down.

1180
01:19:09,616 --> 01:19:12,702
I don't want to go in
there. You'll never see me again.

1181
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:15,204
Well, we won't if you don't.

1182
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:18,040
All right, you give
me the stone,

1183
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:22,128
and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1184
01:19:22,337 --> 01:19:26,549
All right. Give me
a minute. It's a bit fiddly.

1185
01:19:30,387 --> 01:19:31,679
What is it doing down there?

1186
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:35,600
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1187
01:19:36,059 --> 01:19:37,810
You ain't from this planet,
are you, Vincent?

1188
01:19:37,978 --> 01:19:41,814
Who is gonna mug two
black fellas holding pistols,

1189
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:45,818
sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1190
01:19:48,447 --> 01:19:51,908
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his
friend, Desert Eagle. 50.

1191
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:55,161
What have they got to do
with anything?

1192
01:19:55,412 --> 01:19:57,663
They're both staring
straight at me.

1193
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:05,046
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1194
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:06,589
Now, out of the car.

1195
01:20:06,757 --> 01:20:09,050
And leave your
water pistols behind.

1196
01:20:09,885 --> 01:20:13,596
Look, just- Just tell him the
stone's back at the office.

1197
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:15,389
I'll think of something.

1198
01:20:20,145 --> 01:20:21,312
Why's he sweating, Gorgeous?

1199
01:20:23,607 --> 01:20:24,815
Oh, never mind.

1200
01:20:24,983 --> 01:20:27,568
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1201
01:20:27,736 --> 01:20:31,822
I'm a little worried, actually, Turkish.
Worried about what?

1202
01:20:32,449 --> 01:20:36,285
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1203
01:20:36,495 --> 01:20:38,621
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

1204
01:20:38,789 --> 01:20:40,623
We get murdered before
we leave the building,

1205
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:42,917
and I imagine we
get fed to the pigs.

1206
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:47,505
Well, I'm glad to see you're
climbing the walls in fucking anxiety.

1207
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:53,344
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1208
01:20:53,637 --> 01:20:55,846
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one, Tommy.

1209
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:58,891
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1210
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:05,481
You know those
gypsies like a drink at a wake.

1211
01:21:05,649 --> 01:21:09,068
I'm not worried about whether
Mickey knocks the other man out.

1212
01:21:09,278 --> 01:21:12,488
I'm worried about whether Mickey
makes it to the fourth fucking round.

1213
01:21:12,656 --> 01:21:15,408
Well, what if he doesn't
make it to the fourth round?

1214
01:21:15,576 --> 01:21:17,827
We get murdered before
leaving the building,

1215
01:21:18,036 --> 01:21:21,581
and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1216
01:21:23,417 --> 01:21:25,418
So why are you so calm?

1217
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:28,838
I said-
I heard what you said, Tommy!

1218
01:21:29,381 --> 01:21:32,258
It's not as though we've
got a choice, now, is it?

1219
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:35,386
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy

1220
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:40,141
and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1221
01:21:41,268 --> 01:21:43,936
Bollocks!
I'm going for a walk.

1222
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:25,436
Oh, that fucking dog!

1223
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:28,439
Go on, get the dog.

1224
01:22:29,316 --> 01:22:32,610
It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
Open a window.

1225
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:43,079
You people
live like animals.

1226
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:45,081
Now, where's the stone?

1227
01:22:45,248 --> 01:22:47,541
Come on, where is it?
It's over here.

1228
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:51,253
Where? Where?
I left it in a box.

1229
01:22:56,301 --> 01:22:57,426
It's empty.

1230
01:22:57,594 --> 01:23:00,763
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1231
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,766
No, I'm being serious!

1232
01:23:03,975 --> 01:23:06,602
The dog. The dog
must have ate it.

1233
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:13,651
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1234
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:17,613
What?
Look in the dog.

1235
01:23:19,116 --> 01:23:20,658
What do you mean,
"look in the dog"?

1236
01:23:20,826 --> 01:23:22,034
I mean, open him up.

1237
01:23:26,331 --> 01:23:29,625
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1238
01:23:29,835 --> 01:23:31,877
You know what I mean.

1239
01:23:34,464 --> 01:23:35,464
That's a bit strong, isn't it?

1240
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:38,551
I don't know about this.

1241
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:41,387
No, you can't do this.

1242
01:23:44,474 --> 01:23:45,891
It's fucking squeaking!

1243
01:23:46,143 --> 01:23:49,603
What's the matter? You never heard a dog
squeak before? Give me that goddamn gun!

1244
01:23:52,816 --> 01:23:54,316
I'm shooting the dog!

1245
01:24:02,743 --> 01:24:04,368
Shoot the fucking dog!

1246
01:24:04,536 --> 01:24:06,328
Look, it's here. It's here.

1247
01:24:15,213 --> 01:24:18,007
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1248
01:24:29,895 --> 01:24:30,895
Thank God for that.

1249
01:24:41,406 --> 01:24:44,742
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1250
01:24:47,704 --> 01:24:49,413
Tony, come on!

1251
01:24:57,714 --> 01:24:58,964
Tony?

1252
01:25:11,144 --> 01:25:14,021
Anything to declare?
Yeah. Don't go to England.

1253
01:25:16,566 --> 01:25:18,734
That dog is gonna go
back to the campsite, Sol.

1254
01:25:18,902 --> 01:25:20,486
I'm telling
you. It always does.

1255
01:25:20,779 --> 01:25:22,905
How's the dog gonna
find the campsite, Vin?

1256
01:25:23,114 --> 01:25:25,199
Have you smelled
the campsite, Sol?

1257
01:25:25,408 --> 01:25:28,577
All right. But we're gonna
have to wait until it gets light.

1258
01:25:28,745 --> 01:25:30,746
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1259
01:25:30,914 --> 01:25:34,250
That one over there with the tea
cozy on his head's starting to stink.

1260
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:39,672
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1261
01:25:42,843 --> 01:25:44,176
Mickey.

1262
01:25:45,428 --> 01:25:47,429
Oi, Mickey!

1263
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,642
You feeling all
right, Mickey?

1264
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:55,938
Need a drink.

1265
01:25:58,608 --> 01:26:00,025
You can't give him a drink!

1266
01:26:00,277 --> 01:26:02,278
It's not for him.
It's for me.

1267
01:26:07,868 --> 01:26:09,952
Ah, mates. Amen.

1268
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:21,380
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night Anderson,
so pay attention to what you're doing.

1269
01:26:22,132 --> 01:26:23,173
All right, Mickey?

1270
01:26:24,509 --> 01:26:25,801
Mickey!

1271
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,141
Need to have a shite!

1272
01:26:33,184 --> 01:26:37,646
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me,

1273
01:26:37,856 --> 01:26:40,316
shoot the bastards.

1274
01:26:42,152 --> 01:26:45,154
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1275
01:26:52,162 --> 01:26:53,662
All right, Tom.

1276
01:26:54,289 --> 01:26:56,457
Hope we're gonna get
a better show this time.

1277
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:58,292
This will make up for it.

1278
01:26:58,501 --> 01:27:01,211
Mickey's going
down in the fourth.

1279
01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:04,006
Now, Terry over there
is in charge of the bets.

1280
01:27:04,257 --> 01:27:05,799
Now, you have
to forgive me.

1281
01:27:06,009 --> 01:27:08,761
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1282
01:27:11,765 --> 01:27:15,017
Are our lads down at the campsite?
They're over there now, governor.

1283
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:20,522
I fucking hate pikeys.

1284
01:27:22,359 --> 01:27:23,692
How long have we gotta stay here?

1285
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:26,403
As long as it takes.
Now, shut up.

1286
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:29,448
Fucking hate pikeys.

1287
01:27:30,575 --> 01:27:32,576
Is he fucking stoned?

1288
01:27:33,036 --> 01:27:35,079
He's like that
before a fight.

1289
01:27:35,372 --> 01:27:37,706
Do you know when
you're going down?

1290
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:40,542
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1291
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:45,047
Oi, fuck-face, who's speaking
to you? He asked him, didn't he?

1292
01:27:45,256 --> 01:27:47,883
Fuck-face?
I like that one, Errol.

1293
01:27:48,093 --> 01:27:50,552
I'll remember that next time
I'm climbing off your mum.

1294
01:27:50,762 --> 01:27:54,098
Not now.
Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1295
01:27:54,307 --> 01:27:57,226
Be a nice one. Nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

1296
01:27:57,394 --> 01:27:58,727
And there none of yours.

1297
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:04,108
There's a campsite full of pikeys that
might not think you're so fucking funny.

1298
01:28:04,317 --> 01:28:07,736
Not when they're putting out
flames on their children's backs.

1299
01:28:09,155 --> 01:28:11,073
Now get up and have
a fucking fight.

1300
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:20,582
Three rounds and you're
a vegetable, aren't you, pikey!

1301
01:29:11,051 --> 01:29:14,178
I'm in charge here. No
fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1302
01:29:14,387 --> 01:29:16,555
Do your worst.
Let's get it on!

1303
01:29:48,004 --> 01:29:51,090
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1304
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:35,050
Talk about saved by the bell.

1305
01:30:35,635 --> 01:30:37,636
Do you understand the
consequences of what would happen

1306
01:30:37,804 --> 01:30:39,179
if you knocked that man out?

1307
01:30:39,389 --> 01:30:41,682
Do not knock him out, Mickey.

1308
01:30:48,273 --> 01:30:50,023
All right, let's break it up.

1309
01:31:24,017 --> 01:31:25,475
What, is he fucking deaf?

1310
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:28,687
What is he doing?

1311
01:31:44,454 --> 01:31:45,829
Come on and sit.

1312
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,584
What the fuck are
you doing, Mickey?

1313
01:31:50,793 --> 01:31:52,920
You're dancing like a fairy.

1314
01:31:53,171 --> 01:31:55,839
They'll hang us with the ring
ropes if they think it's rigged.

1315
01:31:56,591 --> 01:31:58,759
Get out there and hurt him.

1316
01:32:00,136 --> 01:32:05,057
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1317
01:33:25,346 --> 01:33:28,265
All he's got to do is stay down.

1318
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:35,063
Now, we are fucked.

1319
01:33:43,281 --> 01:33:44,281
He can't stand up.

1320
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,490
We're out of here.

1321
01:33:45,658 --> 01:33:48,368
Stupid pikey knows
Brick Top's got a dozen

1322
01:33:48,536 --> 01:33:50,704
keen-to-kill monkeys
with shotguns

1323
01:33:50,913 --> 01:33:52,372
sitting outside his campsite.

1324
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:57,878
Once the campsite's wiped out, I
know it's gonna be the same for us.

1325
01:34:01,257 --> 01:34:03,091
You ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?

1326
01:34:03,259 --> 01:34:04,760
Give me that fucking shooter!

1327
01:34:04,927 --> 01:34:07,512
And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.

1328
01:34:07,722 --> 01:34:08,889
So, what do you do?

1329
01:34:09,432 --> 01:34:11,058
Something very silly.

1330
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:14,811
You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you

1331
01:34:15,063 --> 01:34:17,606
because you're too
fucking scared to think.

1332
01:34:17,815 --> 01:34:20,942
You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.

1333
01:34:21,152 --> 01:34:23,445
But the pikey didn't. Why?

1334
01:34:23,654 --> 01:34:26,448
Because he had plans
on running the car over.

1335
01:34:28,826 --> 01:34:30,994
It had previously occurred to me

1336
01:34:31,287 --> 01:34:34,206
that the gypsy had taken the
demise of his mother rather lightly.

1337
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,754
For every action,
there is a reaction.

1338
01:34:41,339 --> 01:34:42,881
And a pikey reaction

1339
01:34:43,549 --> 01:34:44,925
is quite a fucking thing.

1340
01:35:26,926 --> 01:35:29,010
Pete, talk to me.

1341
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:32,472
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1342
01:35:41,732 --> 01:35:43,150
Give me that
fucking shooter.

1343
01:35:43,317 --> 01:35:45,360
I'll give you your shooter,
you cunt.

1344
01:35:53,369 --> 01:35:57,038
That is when I thought the
pikey had money riding on himself.

1345
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,543
That's the reason the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.

1346
01:36:03,379 --> 01:36:05,088
We've been tucked up...

1347
01:36:06,716 --> 01:36:08,383
while he's been cleaning up.

1348
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:13,096
We're worse off now than
when we started.

1349
01:36:18,603 --> 01:36:21,062
The next day we went
to the campsite,

1350
01:36:21,272 --> 01:36:24,441
but the gypsies had
disappeared during the night.

1351
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,651
Which was probably a good thing,

1352
01:36:26,903 --> 01:36:31,156
considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.

1353
01:36:31,365 --> 01:36:32,991
Where is he?

1354
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:35,410
He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.

1355
01:36:36,162 --> 01:36:39,706
We can't ask a man to fight for
us if we can't find him, can we?

1356
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:43,251
You won't find a pikey that doesn't
want to be found, Tommy.

1357
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:48,381
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1358
01:36:49,967 --> 01:36:51,801
Bollocks! Come on.

1359
01:36:57,058 --> 01:36:59,851
What you doing here?
What's it got to do with you?

1360
01:37:03,731 --> 01:37:05,899
So, what you doing here?

1361
01:37:13,491 --> 01:37:16,701
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1362
01:37:18,287 --> 01:37:19,287
What's in the car?

1363
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:21,456
Seats and a steering wheel.

1364
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:24,125
What do you know about gypsies?

1365
01:37:25,878 --> 01:37:27,879
I know they're
not to be trusted.

1366
01:37:29,924 --> 01:37:32,676
All right, get your dog.
On your way.

1367
01:37:33,469 --> 01:37:34,803
Get the dog, Tommy.

1368
01:37:34,971 --> 01:37:35,971
Aye?

1369
01:37:37,098 --> 01:37:38,390
The dog.

1370
01:37:39,684 --> 01:37:44,229
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1371
01:37:45,189 --> 01:37:46,982
He loves that dog.

1372
01:37:47,149 --> 01:37:48,984
Always playing silly games.

1373
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:52,654
Stop messing about, Tommy,
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1374
01:37:55,283 --> 01:37:59,119
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1375
01:38:10,006 --> 01:38:11,590
Could you tell me

1376
01:38:11,799 --> 01:38:15,051
why you got a dead man with
an arm missing in your boot?

1377
01:38:15,678 --> 01:38:16,678
Hey, George,

1378
01:38:18,055 --> 01:38:20,265
is that a tea cozy
on his head?

1379
01:38:23,644 --> 01:38:26,146
Oh, you love a dog,
don't you, Tommy?

1380
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:38,575
Tommy persuaded
me to keep the dog.

1381
01:38:38,784 --> 01:38:42,037
I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.

1382
01:38:42,246 --> 01:38:43,913
I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.

1383
01:38:45,458 --> 01:38:48,835
The vet found half an
undigested shoe, a squeaky toy

1384
01:38:49,045 --> 01:38:52,380
and an 84-karat diamond
lodged in its stomach.

1385
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:54,466
It's quite amazing what
can happen in a week.

1386
01:38:55,843 --> 01:38:57,844
Still didn't shut it up, though.

1387
01:38:58,721 --> 01:39:00,388
So, what do you do?

1388
01:39:00,598 --> 01:39:03,725
You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.

1389
01:39:03,893 --> 01:39:05,602
So, what do you think?

1390
01:39:07,229 --> 01:39:08,813
Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?

1391
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,320
I might.
