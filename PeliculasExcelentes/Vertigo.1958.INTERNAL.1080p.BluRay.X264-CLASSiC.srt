1
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,684
Give me your hand!

2
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,727
Give me your hand.

3
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,804
I thought you said
no more aches or pains.

4
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,931
No, it's this darned corset.
It binds.

5
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,640
No three-way stretch?
How very un-chic.

6
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,732
You know those police department doctors.
No sense of style.

7
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,565
Well, anyway,
tomorrow will be the day.

8
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,944
Why, what's tomorrow?

9
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,069
Tomorrow? The corset
comes off tomorrow.

10
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,912
I'll be able to scratch myself
like anybody else tomorrow.

11
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,581
I'll throw this miserable
thing out the window.

12
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,081
Be a free...
I'll be a free man.

13
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,292
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

14
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,166
- Mmm. More than you think.
- Really?

15
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,843
What, do you know that
from personal experience or...

16
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,261
Please.

17
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,510
What happens after tomorrow?

18
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,681
What do you mean?

19
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,603
Well, what are you going to do
once you've quit the police force?

20
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,772
You sound so
disapproving, Midge.

21
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,350
No, it's your life.

22
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,685
But you were the bright,
young lawyer that decided

23
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,522
he was going to be
chief of police someday.

24
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,277
I had to quit.

25
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,403
Why?

26
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,157
Well, it's because of this fear
of heights I have, this acrophobia.

27
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,705
I wake up at night seeing
that man fall from the roof,

28
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,579
and I try to reach out
to him, and... It's just...

29
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,251
It wasn't your fault.

30
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,454
I know. That's what
everybody tells me.

31
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,335
Johnny, the doctors
explained to you...

32
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,542
I know, I know.

33
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,299
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.

34
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,928
Boy! What a moment
to find out I had it.

35
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,787
Well, you've got it,
and there's no losing it.

36
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,474
And there's no one to blame.
So why quit?

37
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,557
You mean, and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?

38
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,766
Where you belong.

39
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,227
What about my acrophobia?
What about...

40
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,905
Now suppose I'm sitting in this chair,
behind the desk. Here's the desk.

41
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,991
And a pencil falls from the desk
down to the floor,

42
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,471
and I reach down to pick up the pencil.
Bingo! My acrophobia's back.

43
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,120
Oh, Johnny-O.

44
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,498
Well, what'll you do?

45
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,710
Well, I'm not gonna
do anything for a while.

46
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,961
You know, don't forget, I'm a man
of independent means, as the saying goes.

47
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,087
Fairly independent.

48
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,258
Mmm-hmm.

49
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,837
Well, why don't you
go away for a while?

50
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,593
You mean, to forget?

51
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,140
Oh, no, Midge,
don't be so motherly.

52
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,889
I'm not gonna crack up.

53
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,221
Have you had any
dizzy spells this week?

54
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,932
I'm having one right now.

55
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,769
Midge, the music.
Don't you think it's sort of...

56
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,694
Oh.

57
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,281
What's this doohickey?

58
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,327
It's a brassiere. You know about
those things. You're a big boy now.

59
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,954
I've never run across
one like that.

60
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,501
It's brand-new.

61
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,376
Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps, no back straps,

62
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,129
but does everything
a brassiere should do.

63
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,007
Works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge.

64
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,838
- It does?
- Mmm-hmm.

65
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,970
An aircraft engineer
down the peninsula designed it.

66
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,393
He worked it out
in his spare time.

67
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,266
Kind of a hobby.

68
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,316
A do-it-yourself
type of thing.

69
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,820
How's your love life, Midge?

70
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,939
That's following
a train of thought.

71
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,116
Well...

72
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,535
Normal.

73
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,205
Aren't you ever
gonna get married?

74
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,953
You know there's only one man
in the world for me, Johnny-O.

75
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,582
You mean me. We were engaged once,
though, weren't we?

76
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,748
Three whole weeks.

77
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,708
Good old college days.

78
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,886
But you were the one that called off
the engagement, you remember?

79
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,307
I'm still available.
Available Ferguson.

80
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,603
Oh, Midge, do you remember a fellow
in college by the name of Gavin Elster?

81
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,347
Gavin Elster?

82
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,023
Yes, funny name.

83
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,975
You think I would. No.

84
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,690
I got a call from Gavin today. It's funny,
he sort of dropped out of sight during the war.

85
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,526
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.

86
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,576
It's a Mission number.

87
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,529
Well, that's skid row,
isn't it?

88
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,955
Could be.

89
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,709
He's probably on the bum, and wants
to touch you for the price of a drink.

90
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,005
Well, I'm on the bum. I'll buy him
a couple drinks and tell him my troubles.

91
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,674
But not tonight. How about you
and me going out for a beer?

92
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,128
Mmm-mmm.
Sorry, old man. Work.

93
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,553
Well, then,
I think I'll go home.

94
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,095
Midge, what'd you mean,
"There's no losing it"?

95
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,350
What?

96
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,060
The acrophobia.

97
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,026
I asked my doctor.

98
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,231
He said that only another emotional shock
could do it and probably wouldn't.

99
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,113
You're not gonna go diving off
another rooftop to find out?

100
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,570
- I think I can lick it.
- Well, how?

101
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,199
I have a theory.

102
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,285
I have a theory. I think if I can get used
to heights, just a little bit at a time,

103
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,622
just a little, like that,
progressively, you see?

104
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,581
I'll show you what I mean.

105
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,383
Here. I'll show you
what I mean.

106
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,513
- We'll start with this.
- That?

107
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,808
What do you want me to start with,
the Golden Gate Bridge? Now, watch.

108
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,851
Watch this. Here we go.

109
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,355
There. There.

110
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,435
Now, I look up,
I look down.

111
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,528
I look up.

112
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,883
- All right, there's nothing to it.
- You're kidding.

113
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,507
- Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it.

114
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,119
Here.

115
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,913
That's a girl. I'll use that.
Put it right there.

116
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,042
All right, here's
the first step.

117
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,124
There.

118
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,251
Okay, now step number two.

119
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,425
All right.
Step number two coming up.

120
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,971
There we are.

121
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,471
See? I look up,
I look down, I look up...

122
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,474
I'm going right out and buy myself
a nice tall stepladder.

123
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,930
Take it easy now.

124
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,060
All right, now here we go.

125
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,517
No problem.

126
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,864
Why, this is a cinch.
Here, I look up, I look down.

127
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,740
I look up, I look down.

128
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,465
Oh, Johnny, Johnny.

129
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,610
How did you get in the shipbuilding
business, Gavin?

130
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,859
I married into it.

131
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,612
Very interesting business.

132
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,152
No, to be honest,
I find it dull.

133
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,363
Well, you don't have to
do it for a living.

134
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,949
No, but one assumes
responsibilities.

135
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,622
My wife's family
is all gone.

136
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,538
Someone has to look
after her interests.

137
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,626
Her father's partner runs the company yard
in the East, Baltimore.

138
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,464
So I decided, as long as I had to work
at it, I'd come back here.

139
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,841
I've always
liked it here.

140
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,927
How long have you
been back?

141
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,556
Almost a year.

142
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,354
You like it, huh?

143
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,183
Well, San Francisco's
changed.

144
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,145
The things that spell San Francisco
to me are disappearing fast.

145
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,945
Like all these.

146
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:29,326
Yes. I should have liked to have
lived here then. Color, excitement, power.

147
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,327
Freedom.

148
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,667
Shouldn't you
be sitting down?

149
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,370
No. No, I'm all right.

150
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,838
I was sorry to read about that thing
in the paper. And you've quit the force.

151
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,591
Is it a permanent
physical disability?

152
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,092
No, no.

153
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,517
It just means that I can't climb stairs
that are too steep or go to high places,

154
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,970
like the bar at
the Top of the Mark.

155
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,681
But, there are plenty
of street-level bars in this town.

156
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,858
Would you like a drink now?

157
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,988
No, I don't think so. No, it's
a little early in the day for me.

158
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,532
Well, I guess that just
about covers everything, doesn't it?

159
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,123
I never married. I don't see much of
the old college gang,

160
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,202
I'm a retired detective, and you're
in the shipbuilding business.

161
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,963
What's on your mind, Gavin?

162
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,878
I asked you to come up here, Scottie,
knowing that you'd quit detective work.

163
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,682
But I wondered whether you'd go back
on the job as a special favor to me.

164
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,805
I want you
to follow my wife.

165
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,932
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.

166
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,389
Well, then...

167
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,815
I'm afraid some harm
may come to her.

168
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,233
From whom?

169
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,356
Someone dead.

170
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,409
Scottie, do you believe that
someone out of the past,

171
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,160
someone dead, can enter
and take possession of a living being?

172
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,250
No.

173
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,751
If I told you that I believe this has happened
to my wife, what would you say?

174
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,339
Well, I'd say take her to
the nearest psychiatrist, or psychologist,

175
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,513
or neurologist, or psycho...
Or maybe just the plain family doctor.

176
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,264
I'd have him
check on you, too.

177
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,012
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

178
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,598
Thanks for coming in,
Scottie.

179
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,808
Okay.

180
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,312
I... I didn't mean
to be that rough.

181
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,773
No, it sounds idiotic,
I know.

182
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,402
And you're still the hardheaded Scot,
aren't you?

183
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,864
Always were.
Do you think I'm making it up?

184
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,786
No.

185
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,752
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.

186
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,547
She'll be talking to me
about something.

187
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,217
Suddenly, the words
fade into silence.

188
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,055
A cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank.

189
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,431
She's somewhere else, away from me,
someone I don't know.

190
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,931
I call to her,
she doesn't even hear me.

191
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,149
Then, with a long sigh,
she's back,

192
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,146
looks at me brightly,
doesn't even know she's been away.

193
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,323
Can't tell me
where or when.

194
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,118
Well, how often
does this happen?

195
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,905
More and more
in the past few weeks.

196
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,491
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.

197
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,586
I followed her one day,

198
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,507
watched her coming out of the apartment,
someone I didn't know.

199
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,338
She even walked
a different way.

200
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:35,717
Got into her car and drove out
to Golden Gate Park, five miles.

201
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,552
Sat by the lake,

202
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,810
staring across the water at the pillars
that stand on the far shore.

203
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,141
You know, Portals of the Past.

204
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,357
Sat there a long time,
without moving.

205
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,530
I had to leave,
get back to the office.

206
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,905
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.

207
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:58,114
She said she'd driven out to Golden Gate Park
and sat by the lake, that's all.

208
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,492
Well?

209
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,251
The speedometer on her car showed
that she'd driven 94 miles.

210
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,711
Where did she go?

211
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,132
I've gotta know, Scottie,
where she goes and what she does

212
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,804
before I get involved
with doctors.

213
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,035
Well, have you talked
to the doctors at all, about that?

214
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,846
Yes, but carefully.

215
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,100
I want to know more before committing
her to that kind of care.

216
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,190
Scottie...

217
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,316
All right, I'll get you a firm
of private eyes to follow her for you.

218
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,563
They're dependable,
good boys.

219
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,064
I want you.

220
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,734
Look, this isn't my line.

221
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,945
Scottie, I need a friend, someone I can trust.
I'm in a panic about this.

222
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:41,324
I'm supposed to be retired. I don't want
to get mixed up in this darn thing.

223
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,410
Look, we're going to an opening
at the opera tonight.

224
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,872
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.

225
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,591
Ernie's.

226
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,630
Say, will you tell me something
about the lady sitting in there?

227
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,806
Who's the woman in the painting
she's looking at?

228
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,303
Oh, that's Carlotta.

229
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,808
You'll find it in the catalog.
<i>Portrait of Carlotta.</i>

230
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,978
- May I have this?
- Yes.

231
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,431
Thank you.

232
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,054
Yes?

233
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,014
Is there something
I can do for you?

234
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,601
- Yes. You run this hotel?
- Oh, yes.

235
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:44,815
Would you tell me who has the room
on the second floor in the corner, that corner?

236
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,784
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out
information of that sort.

237
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,079
Our clients are entitled
to their privacy, you know.

238
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,782
And I do believe
it's against the law.

239
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,704
Of course, I don't think any of them
would mind, really, but still I...

240
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,587
Oh, dear, has she done
something wrong?

241
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,509
Please answer my question.

242
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,137
I can't imagine that sweet girl
with that dear face...

243
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,259
What's her name?

244
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,342
Valdes. Miss Valdes.
Spanish, you know.

245
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,597
Carlotta Valdes?

246
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,223
Yeah, that's it.

247
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,852
Sweet name, isn't it?
Foreign, but sweet.

248
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,273
How long has she
had the room?

249
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,978
Oh, it must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.

250
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,154
Does she sleep here, ever?

251
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,529
No, she just comes to sit
two or three times a week.

252
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,362
I don't ask questions, you know,
as long as they're well-behaved.

253
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,992
But I must say...

254
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,324
When she comes down,
don't say that I've been here.

255
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,831
Oh, but she hasn't
been here today.

256
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,249
I just saw her come in
five minutes ago.

257
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,832
No, she hasn't been here at all.

258
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,361
Well, I would have
seen her, you know.

259
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:50,096
I've been right here all the time,
putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves.

260
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,265
And there. There, you see?
Her key is on the rack.

261
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,063
Well, would you
please go up and look?

262
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,390
- To her room?
- That's right.

263
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,567
Yes, of course,
if you ask.

264
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,278
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.

265
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,503
Oh, Mr. Detective?

266
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,758
Would you like
to come and look?

267
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,913
Her car's gone.

268
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,335
What car?

269
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:39,240
Midge, who do you know that's an authority
on San Francisco history?

270
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,625
That's the kind of greeting
a girl likes.

271
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,522
None of this, "Hello,
you look wonderful," stuff.

272
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,400
Just a good straight, "Who do you know that's
an authority on San Francisco..."

273
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,507
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

274
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,051
Well, who do you?
You know everybody.

275
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,425
Professor Saunders,
over in Berkeley.

276
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,427
No, no, I don't mean
that kind of history.

277
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,557
I mean the small stuff, you know,
people you never heard of.

278
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,311
Oh.

279
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,563
Well, you mean the gay old bohemian days
of gay old San Francisco.

280
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:12,488
Juicy stories, like who shot
who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

281
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,655
Yeah, that's right.

282
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,324
- Pop Leibel.
- Who?

283
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,244
Pop Leibel. He owns
the Argosy Book Shop.

284
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,391
Why, what do you
want to know?

285
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,580
I want to know who shot
who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

286
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,873
Hey, wait a minute.

287
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,205
You're not a detective anymore.
What's going on?

288
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,631
You know him well?

289
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,717
Who?

290
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Pop Leibel.

291
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,176
Oh, sure.

292
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,881
Well, come on, let's go.
I want you to introduce me. Get your hat.

293
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,681
I don't need a hat.

294
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,220
Hey, Johnny,
what's it all about?

295
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,856
Hey.

296
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,101
Wait a minute.

297
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,949
Hello. Yes,
I remember. Carlotta.

298
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,831
The beautiful Carlotta.

299
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,830
The sad Carlotta.

300
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,212
What does an old wooden house
at the corner of Eddy and Gough Street

301
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,914
have to do with
Carlotta Valdes?

302
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:16,378
Well, it was hers. It was built
for her many years ago.

303
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,463
- By whom?
- By...

304
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,302
By...

305
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,017
No. The name,
I do not remember.

306
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,975
A rich man,
a powerful man.

307
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,313
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

308
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,487
- Cigarette, miss?
- No, thanks.

309
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,861
It is not an unusual story.

310
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,783
She came from somewhere small
to the south of the city.

311
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,416
Some say from
a mission settlement.

312
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,290
Young, yes.
Very young.

313
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:57,002
And she was found dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man.

314
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:03,183
And he took her and built
for her the great house

315
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,225
in the Western Addition.

316
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:11,058
And there was a...
There was a child.

317
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,519
Yes, that's it.
A child. A child.

318
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:20,450
I cannot tell you exactly
how much time passed,

319
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,868
or how much happiness
there was.

320
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,617
But, then,
he threw her away.

321
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,076
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.

322
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,672
So he kept the child
and threw her away.

323
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,089
You know, a man could
do that in those days.

324
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,887
They had the power
and the freedom.

325
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,221
And she became
the sad Carlotta.

326
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:51,727
Alone in the great house,
walking the streets alone.

327
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,811
Her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.

328
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,567
And the mad Carlotta.

329
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,161
Stopping people
in the streets to ask,

330
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,122
"Where is my child?

331
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,327
"Have you seen my child?"

332
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,166
Poor thing.

333
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,667
And she died.

334
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,507
- She died.
- How?

335
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,343
By her own hand.

336
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,928
There are many
such stories.

337
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,526
- Well, thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

338
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,186
I appreciate it.
Good-bye.

339
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,272
Good-bye.

340
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,691
Hey, wait a minute!
Good-bye, Pop. Thanks a lot.

341
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,826
- Now then, Johnny-O, pay me.
- For what?

342
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,325
For bringing you here.
Come on, tell.

343
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,906
There's nothing to tell.

344
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,436
You'll tell or you'll be back in that corset.
Come on, Johnny, please.

345
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,951
Come on, come on.
I'll take you home.

346
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,175
There we are.

347
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,970
- You haven't told me everything.
- No, I've told you enough.

348
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,676
Who's the guy
and who's the wife?

349
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,519
Out. I've got things to do.

350
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,394
I know. The one that phoned,
your old college chum, Elster.

351
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,567
- Midge, out, please.
- And the idea is

352
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,191
that the beautiful, mad Carlotta has
come back from the dead

353
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,739
and taken possession
of Elster's wife.

354
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,738
Now, Johnny, really. Come on.

355
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,787
Well, I'm not telling you what I think.
I'm telling you what he thinks.

356
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,239
Well, what do you think?

357
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,789
Well, I...

358
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,167
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?

359
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,870
No, not Carlotta.
Elster's wife.

360
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,422
Yes.

361
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,092
I guess you'd consider
that she would be...

362
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,593
I think I'll go take a look
at that portrait. Good-bye.

363
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,798
Midge...

364
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,849
- Good-bye.
- Midge, you...

365
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,378
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.

366
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,334
- That's Carlotta Valdes.
- Yes.

367
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,920
There are things
you didn't tell me.

368
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,701
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- But you knew about this.

369
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,966
Oh, yeah.

370
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,810
You notice the way
she does her hair?

371
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,638
You know,
there's something else.

372
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:42,193
My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces
of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.

373
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,144
She inherited them.

374
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,856
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.

375
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,282
Until now.

376
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,912
Now, when she's alone, she takes
them out and looks at them,

377
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,535
handles them gently,
curiously.

378
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,165
Puts them on and stares
at herself in the mirror.

379
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,748
And goes into that other world,
is someone else again.

380
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,092
Now, Carlotta Valdes
was what?

381
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,386
Your wife's grandmother?

382
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,304
Great-grandmother.

383
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,508
Now, the child
who was taken from her,

384
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:18,187
whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death,
was Madeleine's grandmother.

385
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,517
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valdes home.

386
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,860
Well, I think
that explains it.

387
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:30,442
Anyone could become obsessed
with the past with a background like that.

388
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,865
She never heard
of Carlotta Valdes.

389
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,205
She knows nothing of a grave
out at the Mission Dolores?

390
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,035
Or that old house
on Eddy Street? The...

391
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:44,372
- The portrait at the Palace of the Legion of...
- Nothing.

392
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,377
Well, when she goes
to these places...

393
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,504
She's no longer my wife.

394
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,929
Well, how do you know
all these things she doesn't?

395
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,225
Her mother told me most of them
before she died.

396
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,394
I dug out the rest
for myself here.

397
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,516
Why wouldn't
she tell her daughter?

398
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,018
Natural fear.

399
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,518
Her grandmother went insane,
took her own life.

400
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,149
Her blood is in Madeleine.

401
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,491
Boy, I need this.

402
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,871
Madeleine.

403
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,707
Madeleine!

404
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,932
Yes?

405
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,857
No, it's all right.

406
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,147
Yeah, I'll call you back.

407
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,607
Yes.

408
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,356
Yes.

409
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,030
Are you all right?

410
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,408
Oh. Oh, your...

411
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,998
You'll want this.

412
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,447
You'd better come over here
by the fire where it's warm.

413
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,869
What am I doing here?

414
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,664
What happened?

415
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:06,303
Well, you fell
into San Francisco Bay.

416
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,975
And I tried to dry your hair
as best I could.

417
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,268
Your things are
in the kitchen.

418
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:16,097
They'll be dry
in a few minutes.

419
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,182
Come on over by the fire.

420
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,075
Here, I'll get you
some cushions.

421
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,530
There you are.

422
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,170
Would you like
to have some coffee?

423
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:50,135
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink.

424
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,058
I fell into the Bay
and you fished me out?

425
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,559
That's right.

426
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,607
Thank you.

427
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,356
You don't remember?

428
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:04,899
No, I...

429
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,906
You remember
where you were?

430
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,618
Why, yes. Yes, of course
I remember that.

431
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,710
But then I must have had
a dizzy spell and fainted.

432
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,332
Where were you?

433
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,879
At old Fort Point,
out at the Presidio.

434
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,096
Of course, I remember.
I often go there.

435
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,139
Why? Why do you go there?

436
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,219
Because I love it so.
It's beautiful there,

437
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,937
especially at sunset.

438
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,192
Thank you for the fire.

439
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,110
Where were you before?

440
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,776
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.

441
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,318
Wandering about.

442
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,199
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?

443
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,367
Downtown, shopping.

444
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,499
Here, you'd better have some coffee.
I think it's still warm.

445
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,795
You're terribly direct
in your questions.

446
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,472
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

447
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,468
You're not.
You're merely direct.

448
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,313
And what were you doing there,
at old Fort Point?

449
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,273
Oh, just wandering about.

450
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:29,984
Oh, you like it too?

451
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,235
Yes.

452
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,568
And where had you been
just before?

453
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:38,702
I'd been to the Palace of
the Legion of Honor, the art gallery.

454
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,913
Oh, yes, that's
a lovely spot, isn't it?

455
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:46,581
I've never been inside,
but it looks so lovely driving past.

456
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,589
It's lucky for me
you were wandering about.

457
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,094
Thank you.

458
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,971
I've been a terrible
bother to you.

459
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,643
No, you haven't.

460
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,182
Oh, when you...

461
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,109
There were some pins
in my hair.

462
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,192
Oh, the pins, yes. Right in here.
I'll get them for you.

463
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,027
And my purse, please.

464
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,617
Here you are.

465
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,997
Thank you.

466
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,131
You shouldn't have
brought me here, you know.

467
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,709
Well, I didn't know
where you lived.

468
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,679
You could have
looked in my car.

469
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,801
Oh, but then, you didn't
know my car, did you?

470
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,430
No, I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.

471
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,978
But I didn't think you wanted
to be taken home that way.

472
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,271
No, you're right.

473
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:49,067
I'm glad you didn't take me home.
I wouldn't have known you.

474
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:53,822
Thank you. But I don't know you,
and you don't know me.

475
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,490
My name is
Madeleine Elster.

476
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,158
My name's John Ferguson.

477
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:01,363
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call you John or Jack?

478
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,657
Oh, John, mostly.

479
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,244
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.

480
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,082
I shall call you
Mr. Ferguson.

481
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,382
Oh, gee whiz,
I wouldn't like that. Oh, no.

482
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,887
And after what happened this afternoon,
I should think maybe you'd call me Scottie.

483
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,588
Maybe even John.

484
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,674
I prefer John.

485
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,313
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?

486
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,312
Wander about.

487
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,941
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?

488
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,323
One shouldn't live alone.

489
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,275
Some people prefer it.

490
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,407
No, it's wrong.

491
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,575
I'm married, you know.

492
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,874
Will you tell me something?

493
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,551
Has this ever happened
to you before?

494
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:57,718
What?

495
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,714
Falling into
San Francisco Bay.

496
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,725
Oh.

497
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,057
No. No, it's never
happened before.

498
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:10,440
Oh, I've fallen into lakes out of rowboats
when I was a little girl.

499
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:14,987
I even fell into the river once,
trying to leap from one stone to another.

500
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,856
But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay.

501
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,655
Have you ever before?

502
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,658
No, it's the first time for me, too.

503
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,584
Here, I'll get you
some more coffee.

504
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:44,762
Hello?

505
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,812
<i>Scottie, what happened?
She's not home yet.</i>

506
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:50,473
No, she's all right. She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.

507
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,307
<i>Oh, what happened?</i>

508
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,267
She went into the Bay.

509
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:57,946
Hello? Hello?

510
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,148
<i>Did she hurt herself?</i>

511
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,921
No, she's going to be in fine shape.
There's nothing to worry about.

512
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,615
But she doesn't know.
Now, do you understand that?

513
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,913
She doesn't know
what happened.

514
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,710
<i>Scottie, Madeleine is 26.</i>

515
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:16,456
<i>Carlotta Valdes committed suicide
when she was 26.</i>

516
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,301
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

517
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,327
Well now, Johnny-O.
Was it a ghost?

518
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,586
Was it fun?

519
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,316
That letter for me?

520
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,412
Yes. Hello.

521
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,662
Hello.

522
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:39,076
I worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.

523
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,627
Well, I suddenly
felt such a fool.

524
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,830
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?

525
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,883
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm fine.
No aftereffects.

526
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,949
But as I remember now,
the water was cold, wasn't it?

527
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,509
It sure was.

528
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,636
What a terrible thing
for me to do.

529
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,308
You were so kind.

530
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:01,181
It's a formal thank-you note
and a great big apology.

531
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,267
Oh, you've nothing
to apologize for.

532
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,692
Oh, yes, I do.

533
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,111
The whole thing must have been
so embarrassing for you.

534
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,189
Not at all. I enjoyed

535
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,442
talking to you.

536
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,038
Well, I enjoyed
talking to you.

537
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,876
Well, I'll get my mail.

538
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,984
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee?

539
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,715
No. No, thank you.

540
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,218
Well, I couldn't mail it. I didn't know
your address, but I had a landmark.

541
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,096
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

542
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:41,020
Well, that's the first time
I've been grateful for Coit Tower.

543
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,522
I hope we will, too.

544
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:47,612
What?

545
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,190
Meet again sometime.

546
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,567
We have.

547
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,826
Good-bye.

548
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,752
Where are you going?

549
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,213
- Oh, I don't know.
- Shopping?

550
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,307
No.

551
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,558
Well, anywhere
in particular?

552
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,053
No, I just thought
that I'd wander.

553
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,514
Oh, that's what
I was going to do.

554
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,729
Oh, yes, that's right. I forgot.
It's your occupation, isn't it?

555
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,509
Yeah, well, don't you think it's kind
of a waste for the two of us...

556
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,365
- To wander separately?
- Uh-huh.

557
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,952
But only one is a wanderer.

558
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,371
Two together are
always going somewhere.

559
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,791
No, I don't think
that's necessarily true.

560
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,834
You left your door open.

561
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,082
Be right back.

562
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,252
How old?

563
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,460
Oh, some
2,000 years or more.

564
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,920
The oldest
living things.

565
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,471
Yes.

566
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,385
You've never
been here before?

567
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,137
No.

568
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,594
What are
you thinking?

569
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,146
Of all the people
who've been born and have died,

570
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,848
while the trees
went on living.

571
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:53,687
Their true name is <i>Sequoia sempervirens.</i>
"Always green, ever living."

572
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,693
- I don't like them.
- Why?

573
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,775
Knowing
I have to die.

574
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:19,054
Here's a cross section of one
of the old trees that's been cut down.

575
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,828
Somewhere in here,
I was born,

576
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,452
and there I died.

577
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:57,342
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.

578
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,436
Madeleine.

579
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,394
Madeleine.

580
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,315
Madeleine,
where are you now?

581
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,230
- Here with you.
- Where?

582
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,657
Tall trees...

583
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,905
Have you
been here before?

584
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,362
- Yes.
- When?

585
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,123
When were you born?

586
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,413
- Long ago.
- Where?

587
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,420
When? Tell me.

588
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,122
- Madeleine, tell me.
- No!

589
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,128
Madeleine, tell me what it is.
Where do you go?

590
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,737
- What takes you away?
- No, I can't tell you.

591
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,698
When you jumped into the bay,
you didn't know where you were.

592
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:24,991
- You guessed, but you didn't know.
- I didn't jump.

593
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,909
- I didn't jump. I fell. You told me I fell.
- Why did you jump?

594
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,515
- Why did you jump?
- I can't tell you.

595
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,184
Why did you jump?
What was there inside

596
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,102
- that told you to jump?
- No, please. Please.

597
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,555
What? What?

598
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:38,143
Please don't ask me. Please don't ask me.
Take me away from here.

599
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,858
Shall I take you home?

600
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,649
Somewhere in the light.

601
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,097
Promise me something.
Promise you won't ask me again.

602
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,987
Please promise me that.

603
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,107
Why did you run?

604
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,239
I'm responsible
for you now.

605
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,849
You know, the Chinese say
that once you've saved a person's life,

606
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:35,583
you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.

607
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:37,160
I have to know.

608
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,546
There's so little
that I know.

609
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:49,305
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor

610
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,804
that once was mirrored, and fragments
of that mirror still hang there.

611
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,516
And when I come to the end
of the corridor,

612
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,851
there's nothing but darkness.

613
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,609
And I know that when
I walk into the darkness,

614
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,279
that I'll die.

615
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,957
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back before then.

616
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:18,458
Except once.

617
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,002
Yesterday?

618
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,250
And you didn't know.
You didn't know what happened

619
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,377
till you found
yourself with me.

620
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,049
You didn't know
where you were.

621
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,880
But the small scenes, the fragments
of the mirror, you remember those.

622
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,260
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?

623
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:36,344
There's a room,
and I sit there alone.

624
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,646
Always alone.

625
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,064
What else?

626
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,482
A grave.

627
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,604
Where?

628
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:47,064
I don't know.
It's an open grave and I...

629
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,741
I stand by the gravestone,
looking down into it.

630
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,864
- It's my grave.
- But how do you know?

631
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,616
I know.

632
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:57,323
But is there a name
on the gravestone?

633
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:02,833
No. No, it's new
and clean and waiting.

634
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,756
Well, what else?

635
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,172
This part is a dream.
I think.

636
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:16,225
There's a tower, and a bell
and a garden below.

637
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:20,271
It seems to be in Spain,
a village in Spain.

638
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,349
It clicks off and it's gone.

639
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,810
Well, a portrait?

640
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:28,112
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.

641
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:33,364
If I could just find the key,
the beginning, and put it together, I...

642
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,160
So, explain it away?

643
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,286
There's a way
to explain it, you see.

644
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,749
If I'm mad, then that would
explain it, wouldn't it?

645
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:47,707
Madeleine!

646
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,629
Oh, Scottie!

647
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:58,384
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.

648
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,892
There's someone within me,
and she says I must die.

649
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,018
Oh, Scottie,
don't let me go.

650
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:07,398
I'm here.
I've got you.

651
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,023
I'm so afraid.

652
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,323
Don't leave me.

653
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,418
Stay with me.

654
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,538
All the time.

655
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,063
Hi, Johnny.

656
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,523
Hi.

657
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,357
Did you get my message?

658
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,492
I did, indeed.

659
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:59,411
I'll get you a drink.

660
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,113
Okay.

661
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:05,247
Since when do you go around
slipping notes under men's doors?

662
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,544
Since I stopped being able
to get them on the phone.

663
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,499
For a man who has nothing to do,
you're certainly a busy little bee.

664
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,835
Where do you go
these days?

665
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,419
Just wandering.

666
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,092
Where?

667
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,594
Round about.

668
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:21,935
Oh.

669
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,429
What was this...

670
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,889
What was this desperate
urge to see me?

671
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,817
All I said in my note was,
"Where are you?"

672
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,690
Doesn't sound very
desperate to me.

673
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:35,113
Yeah, I detected
a little undercurrent.

674
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:40,320
Well, I just thought that if I gave you
a drink and fed you some dinner,

675
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,826
you'd be so grateful,
you'd take me to a movie.

676
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,409
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about at dinner?

677
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,079
Oh, this and that.

678
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,960
What I've been doing?

679
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,291
Only if you want to.

680
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:57,253
I'm sure we won't talk about anything
you don't want to talk about.

681
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,679
Naturally.

682
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,763
What have you been doing?

683
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,387
Wandering.

684
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,984
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.

685
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,187
Oh, I've been having
a wonderful time.

686
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,988
I've gone back
to my first love, painting.

687
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,156
Well, good for you.

688
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:21,532
I always said you were wasting your time
in the underwear department.

689
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:25,205
You know, it's a living.
But I'm really excited about this.

690
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,704
What is it?
A still life?

691
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:32,129
No. No, not exactly.
You wanna see?

692
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,797
Hmm. Yeah.

693
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,296
Matter of fact, I thought
I might give it to you.

694
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,422
Oh?

695
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,435
Johnny!

696
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,984
It's not funny, Midge.

697
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,732
- Johnny!
- No.

698
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,280
Johnny, I just thought...

699
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,366
Uh-uh.

700
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,234
No.

701
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,116
Let's make that movie
some other night, okay?

702
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,746
Johnny!

703
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,545
Oh, Marjorie Wood, you fool!

704
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:22,805
Idiot!

705
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,858
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

706
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,627
Madeleine! What's the matter?
What time is it?

707
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,315
I should have phoned you, but I wanted
to see you and be with you.

708
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,066
Why? What's happened?

709
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,398
I had the dream.
The dream came back again.

710
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,326
Now, now, it's gonna
be all right.

711
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,620
It'll be all right.
Here, I'll get you some brandy.

712
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,742
Just drink this down.
Here, just like medicine.

713
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,578
There now.

714
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:40,212
It was a dream. You're awake.
You're all right now.

715
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,168
Now, can you tell me?

716
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:48,057
It was the tower again, and the bell,
and the old Spanish village.

717
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,223
Yes?

718
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,677
Clear, so very clear
for the first time. All of it.

719
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,012
Tell me.

720
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,102
It was a village square
and a green with trees,

721
01:09:56,234 --> 01:10:00,524
and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.

722
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,071
Across the green, there was a big,
gray, wooden house,

723
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,150
with a porch and shutters
and a balcony above, a small garden,

724
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,201
and next to it
a livery stable

725
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,074
with old carriages
lined up inside.

726
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,621
Go on.

727
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,997
At the end of the green,
there was a whitewashed stone house,

728
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,043
with a lovely pepper tree
at the corner.

729
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,373
And an old wooden hotel
from the old California days?

730
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:25,678
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings,
with hanging oil lamps?

731
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,174
Yes.

732
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:30,258
It's all there.
It's no dream.

733
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,478
You've been there before.
You've seen it.

734
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,400
No, never.

735
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,521
Madeleine, a hundred miles
south of San Francisco,

736
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,443
there's an old
Spanish mission,

737
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,022
San Juan Bautista it's called,
and it's been preserved

738
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,950
exactly as it was
100 years ago, as a museum.

739
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:51,574
Now, think hard,
darling. Think hard.

740
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,496
You've been there before.
You've seen it.

741
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,415
No, no, I've never...
I've never been there.

742
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,104
Oh, Scottie, what is it?
I've never been there.

743
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,165
Think hard. Now go on
about your dream.

744
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,087
What was it that
frightened you so?

745
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,884
I stood alone on the green
searching for something.

746
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,302
And then I started
to walk to the church.

747
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:13,434
But then the darkness closed in
and I was alone in the dark.

748
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:17,763
Being pulled into the darkness,
and I fought to wake up.

749
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,274
Oh, you're going to be
all right now, Madeleine.

750
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,273
Don't you see? You've given me
something to work on now.

751
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,508
I'm going to take you down there
to that mission, this afternoon.

752
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,886
And when you see it, you'll remember
when you saw it before,

753
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:33,871
and it'll finish your dream.
It'll destroy it. I promise you. All right?

754
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,663
Come on now.
I'll take you home.

755
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,336
No. I'll be all right.

756
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,664
You come back here
around noon.

757
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:06,005
Madeleine,
where are you now?

758
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,300
- Here with you.
- And it's all real.

759
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:14,176
It's not merely as it was 100 years ago,
or a year ago,

760
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,724
or six months ago, or whenever
it was you were here to see it.

761
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,678
Now, Madeleine,
think of when you were here.

762
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,478
There were not
so many carriages then.

763
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,361
There were horses
in the stalls.

764
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,815
A bay, two black
and a gray.

765
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,156
It was our favorite place.

766
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,581
But we were forbidden
to play here.

767
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,160
Sister Teresa
would scold us.

768
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,293
Look at this.
Well, here's your gray horse.

769
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,117
Have a little trouble getting in and out
of the stall without being pushed,

770
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,507
but even so...

771
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:01,344
You see? There's an answer
for everything.

772
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,441
Madeleine, try.

773
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,107
Try for me.

774
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,966
I love you, Madeleine.

775
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,843
I love you, too.

776
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:39,969
Too late. Too late.

777
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,800
No, no, we're together.

778
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,637
No, it's too late.
There's something I must do.

779
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,643
No. There's nothing
you must do.

780
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,895
There's nothing
you must do.

781
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,901
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.

782
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,246
No, it's too late.

783
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,635
Look. It's not fair.
It's too late.

784
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,075
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.
It shouldn't have happened.

785
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,591
It had to happen. We're in love.
That's all that counts.

786
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:26,474
- Look, let me go. Please let me go!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

787
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,314
You believe I love you?

788
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:34,565
Yes.

789
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,323
And if you lose me,
then you'll know I...

790
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,696
I loved you and I wanted
to go on loving you.

791
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:41,947
I won't lose you.

792
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,702
Let me go into
the church, alone.

793
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,078
But why?

794
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:11,227
Madeleine!

795
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,652
Madeleine!

796
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,821
Madeleine!

797
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,124
Ferguson.

798
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:41,128
Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was not well
with his wife's mental state,

799
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:45,678
took the preliminary precaution
of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson,

800
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,096
lest any harm befall her.

801
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,219
And you have heard that
Mr. Elster was prepared

802
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,926
to take his wife
to an institution,

803
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:58,232
where her mental health would have been
in the hands of qualified specialists.

804
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:01,105
Mr. Ferguson,
being an ex-detective,

805
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:05,735
would have seemed the proper choice
for the role of watchdog and protector.

806
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:08,942
As you have learned,
it was an unfortunate choice.

807
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:12,655
However, I think you'll agree that no blame
can be attached to the husband.

808
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,582
His delay in putting his wife
under medical care was due

809
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,207
only to the need for information
as to her behavior,

810
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,913
which he expected to
get from Mr. Ferguson.

811
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,091
He had taken every precaution
to protect his wife.

812
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:29,763
He could not have anticipated that
Mr. Ferguson's weakness, his fear of heights,

813
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,761
would make him powerless
when he was most needed.

814
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,434
As to Mr. Ferguson,

815
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:39,640
you have heard his former superior,
Detective Captain Hansen,

816
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,941
from that great city
to the north,

817
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,986
testify as to his
character and ability.

818
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,610
Captain Hansen was
most enthusiastic.

819
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,784
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances,

820
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:55,239
Mr. Ferguson allowed a police colleague
to fall to his death,

821
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:58,951
Captain Hansen dismissed
as an "unfortunate incident."

822
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,962
Of course, Mr. Ferguson
is to be congratulated

823
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,166
on having once saved
the woman's life,

824
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:11,130
when, in a previous fit of aberration,
she threw herself into the Bay.

825
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:15,467
It is a pity that knowing
her suicidal tendencies,

826
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:18,520
he did not make a greater effort
the second time.

827
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,274
But we are not here
to pass judgment

828
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,730
on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative.
He did nothing.

829
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,442
And the law has little to say
on the subject of things left undone.

830
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:37,623
Nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall

831
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,665
have any bearing
on your verdict.

832
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:44,962
He did not remain at the scene
of the death. He left.

833
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:48,508
He claims he suffered a mental blackout
and knew nothing more

834
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,803
until he found himself back
in his own apartment in San Francisco

835
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,551
several hours later.

836
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,257
You may accept that, or not.

837
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:02,351
Or you may believe that having once
again allowed someone to die,

838
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:06,025
he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness

839
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,602
and ran away.

840
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,740
That has nothing to do
with your verdict.

841
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:16,452
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

842
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,954
Now, from the evidence of the state
of mind of Madeleine Elster

843
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:24,787
prior to her death, from
the manner of her death,

844
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,042
and from the postmortem
examination of the body

845
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,215
showing the actual cause
of her death,

846
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:32,920
you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict, gentlemen.

847
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,130
You may retire if you wish.

848
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,845
Hold on, Mr. Jones.

849
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,324
We've reached a verdict.

850
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,784
Thank you.

851
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,374
"The jury finds that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide

852
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,130
"while of unsound mind."

853
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,133
Your verdict will be
so recorded. Dismissed.

854
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:23,762
All right, Scottie,
let's go.

855
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,267
Mind if I speak to him
for a minute?

856
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,643
No, go ahead.

857
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,017
Scottie.

858
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,948
Sorry, Scottie.
That was rough.

859
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,526
He had no right
to speak to you like that.

860
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,580
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have got you involved.

861
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,704
No, there's nothing
you have to say to me.

862
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,377
I'm getting out,
Scottie, for good.

863
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,547
I can't stay here.

864
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:55,468
I'm going to wind up her affairs and mine,
get away as far as I can.

865
01:22:56,889 --> 01:23:00,599
Europe, perhaps. And I probably
never will come back.

866
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,469
Good-bye, Scottie.

867
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:09,107
If there's anything
I can do for you before I go.

868
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:13,394
There was no way
for them to understand.

869
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,898
You and I know
who killed Madeleine.

870
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,499
Come on, Scottie.
Let's get out of here.

871
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:38,798
It's Mozart,
Wolfgang Amadeus.

872
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,466
I had a long talk with that lady
in musical therapy, Johnny,

873
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,138
and she says that
Mozart's the boy for you,

874
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,887
the broom that sweeps
the cobwebs away.

875
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,558
Well, it's what
the lady said.

876
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:59,811
You know, it's wonderful how they have
it all taped now, John.

877
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,318
I have music
for dipsomaniacs,

878
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:06,868
and music for melancholiacs,
and music for hypochondriacs.

879
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,831
I wonder what would happen
if somebody got their files mixed up.

880
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:25,762
I brought a lot of other things,
and you can see what you like.

881
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,964
It shuts off automatically.

882
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:39,901
Oh, Johnny. Johnny, please try.
Try, Johnny.

883
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:43,187
You're not lost.
Mother is here.

884
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,114
Time?

885
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,203
Okay.

886
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,657
I'll be in again, John.

887
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,494
You want me
to shut that off?

888
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,857
Oh, John-O.

889
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,107
You don't even know
I'm here, do you?

890
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,233
But I'm here.

891
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,009
Nurse, could I see
the doctor for a moment?

892
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,340
Doctor, Miss Wood.

893
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,090
Won't you go in, please?

894
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:54,387
Yes, Miss Wood?

895
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:58,938
Doctor, how long is it going to take you
to pull him out of this?

896
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:02,563
Well, it's hard to say.
At least six months. Perhaps a year.

897
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,188
It really could
depend on him.

898
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,020
He won't talk.

899
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:09,778
No. He's suffering
from acute melancholia,

900
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,780
together with
a guilt complex.

901
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,514
He blames himself
for what happened to the woman.

902
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,497
We... We know little
of what went on before.

903
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,584
Well, I can give you one thing.
He was in love with her.

904
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:25,047
Oh, that does complicate
the problem, doesn't it?

905
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,375
I can give you
another complication,

906
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,301
he still is.

907
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:30,969
And you want to
know something, Doctor?

908
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:34,015
I don't think Mozart's
going to help at all.

909
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:05,939
Where'd you get this car?

910
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:07,688
- I beg your pardon?
- This... This car?

911
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:10,673
Why, I bought it from a man who used
to live here, in this apartment building,

912
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:14,281
Mr. Gavin Elster. I bought it
from him when he moved away.

913
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,155
Oh, you knew him
and his wife.

914
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,202
The poor thing.
I didn't know her.

915
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:21,246
Tell me, is it true
that she really...

916
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,995
I'm... I'm sorry.

917
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,518
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

918
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,950
Give me a scotch and soda,
will you.

919
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:54,960
Well, what is it?

920
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,233
Could I ask you
a couple of questions?

921
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:58,589
What for?
Who are you?

922
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,291
My name is John Ferguson.

923
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,570
Is this some kind
of Gallup poll?

924
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:03,210
Oh, no.

925
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,534
- There are just couple of things I'd like to ask.
- You live in this hotel?

926
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:09,175
No. I happened to see you
when you came in, so I thought...

927
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,431
Yeah, I thought so.
A pickup.

928
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:15,435
Well, you've got a nerve, following me right
into the hotel and up to my room.

929
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:16,936
Now, you beat it.
Go on and beat it.

930
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:19,313
No, please, please.
I just want to talk to you.

931
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:20,764
Listen, I'm gonna
yell in a minute.

932
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,610
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Honest. I promise.

933
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:27,948
Please.
Just let me talk to you.

934
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,994
- What about?
- You.

935
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,538
Why?

936
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,911
Because you remind me
of somebody.

937
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,581
I heard that one
before, too.

938
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,830
I remind you of someone you used
to be madly in love with,

939
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,007
but then she ditched you
for another guy,

940
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,927
and you've been carrying
the torch ever since.

941
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:47,676
Then you saw me
and something clicked.

942
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,762
Well, you're not
far wrong.

943
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,014
Well, it's not gonna work,
so you better go.

944
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,016
Please, let me come in.

945
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,980
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you. Please.

946
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:05,281
Well, I warn you,
I can yell awful loud.

947
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:07,278
Now, you won't have to.

948
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:13,827
Well, you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?

949
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,995
- I want to know your name.
- Judy Barton.

950
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,335
- Who you are?
- I'm just a girl. I work at Magnin's.

951
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,879
No, but, how do you
happen to be living here?

952
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,706
It's a place to live,
that's all.

953
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,541
No, but you haven't
lived here long?

954
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:25,922
Yeah, about three years.

955
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:27,344
Well, where did
you live before?

956
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:28,966
Salina, Kansas.

957
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,967
Listen, what is this?
What do you want?

958
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:35,393
I just want to know
who you are.

959
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,142
Well, I told you.

960
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:42,063
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.

961
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,611
I work at Magnin's,
and I live here.

962
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:47,989
My gosh, do I have
to prove it?

963
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:57,791
All right, mister,
my Kansas driver's license.

964
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:01,587
Judy Barton,
number Z296794,

965
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:04,711
425 Maple Avenue,
Salina, Kansas.

966
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:11,805
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.

967
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:16,268
A California license
issued May 25, 1954.

968
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:20,981
You want to check my thumbprints?
You satisfied?

969
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:26,313
And whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.

970
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:33,489
Gee, you have got it bad,
haven't you?

971
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,998
Do I really look like her?

972
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,247
She's... She's dead,
isn't she?

973
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,964
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

974
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,515
Yes, that's me
with my mother.

975
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:07,482
And that's my father.
He's dead.

976
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:10,155
My mother married again,
but I didn't like the guy,

977
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,825
so I decided I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.

978
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,079
I've been here three years.

979
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:18,906
Honest.

980
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,877
Will you have dinner with me?

981
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,177
Why?

982
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,676
Well, I just feel that
I owe you something after all this.

983
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:36,007
You don't owe me anything.

984
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,012
Well, then will you?
For me?

985
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:39,513
Dinner and what else?

986
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:41,015
Just dinner.

987
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:43,639
'Cause I remind you of her?

988
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:46,441
Because I'd like
to have dinner with you.

989
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:52,323
Well, I've been
on blind dates before.

990
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:57,035
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.

991
01:37:58,498 --> 01:37:59,534
Okay.

992
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:01,727
All right, I'll get my car.
I'll be back for you in half an hour.

993
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:04,789
Oh, no, you better give me time
to change and get fixed up.

994
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,120
An hour?

995
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,126
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

996
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,322
<i>Dearest Scottie.</i>

997
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,578
<i>And so you found me.</i>

998
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,251
<i>This is the moment that
I dreaded and hoped for.</i>

999
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:14,173
<i>Wondering what I would say
and do if I ever saw you again.</i>

1000
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,251
<i>I wanted so to see you again,
just once.</i>

1001
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:20,304
<i>Now I'll go, and you can
give up your search.</i>

1002
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:22,176
<i>I want you to have
peace of mind.</i>

1003
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,804
<i>You've nothing
to blame yourself for.</i>

1004
01:40:24,894 --> 01:40:26,385
<i>You were the victim.</i>

1005
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:31,349
<i>I was the tool, and you were the victim
of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.</i>

1006
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:36,028
<i>He chose me to play the part because I looked
like her. He dressed me up like her.</i>

1007
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:40,357
<i>It was quite safe because she lived
in the country and rarely came to town.</i>

1008
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:43,319
<i>He chose you to be the witness
to a suicide.</i>

1009
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,864
<i>The Carlotta story was part real,
part invented,</i>

1010
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:50,577
<i>to make you testify that Madeleine wanted
to kill herself.</i>

1011
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:55,373
<i>He knew of your illness. He knew you'd never
get up the stairs to the tower.</i>

1012
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:58,379
<i>He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.</i>

1013
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:02,421
<i>I made the mistake.
I fell in love.</i>

1014
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:05,216
<i>That wasn't part of the plan.</i>

1015
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:09,641
<i>I'm still in love with you,
and I want you so to love me.</i>

1016
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,518
<i>If I had the nerve,
I'd stay and lie,</i>

1017
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:15,225
<i>hoping that I could make
you love me again</i>

1018
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,187
<i>as I am for myself.</i>

1019
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:21,570
<i>And so forget the other
and forget the past.</i>

1020
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:26,074
<i>But I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.</i>

1021
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:45,042
Oh, here.
Here, I'll do it.

1022
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,052
There you are.

1023
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:49,675
Thanks again.
Good night.

1024
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:51,631
Can I see you tomorrow?

1025
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,225
Tomorrow night? Well...

1026
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:56,473
No, I mean
tomorrow morning.

1027
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:01,058
But I have to go to work.
I've got a job.

1028
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:02,313
Don't go to your job.

1029
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:05,362
And what'll I live on?
My oil wells in Texas?

1030
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:07,656
Let me take care
of you, Judy.

1031
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,993
Thanks very much,
but no thanks.

1032
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:14,871
No, Judy,
you don't understand.

1033
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:16,744
Oh, I understand,
all right.

1034
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:19,417
I've been understanding
since I was 17.

1035
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:22,754
- And the next step is?
- No, no. No, no.

1036
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,253
No? Then what?

1037
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:28,961
We could just see
a lot of each other.

1038
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:31,505
Why?

1039
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:34,845
'Cause I remind you of her?

1040
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:42,015
It's not very complimentary.

1041
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,023
And nothing else?

1042
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:49,155
No.

1043
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:51,528
That's not very
complimentary, either.

1044
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:54,157
I just want to be with you
as much as I can, Judy.

1045
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:13,426
Well, I guess I could phone
the store in the morning

1046
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:17,224
and make some excuse.

1047
01:46:24,003 --> 01:46:25,539
There you are.

1048
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,713
I like that one.

1049
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:30,133
Like that?

1050
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,333
- Yes.
- All right.

1051
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,384
Well, that's very nice.

1052
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,006
It's beautiful.

1053
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:37,130
There we are.

1054
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:40,433
Now, we'll get this,
and then we'll buy you those clothes.

1055
01:46:40,519 --> 01:46:42,761
- Honest?
- Right over there's Ransohoffs.

1056
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:44,095
It's the best.
How much is that?

1057
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:46,310
That'll be 50 cents.
Thank you.

1058
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,686
Scottie,
you don't have to.

1059
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:49,233
But I want to.

1060
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:14,134
No, that's not it.
Nothing like it.

1061
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:16,006
But you said gray, sir.

1062
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:19,089
Now, look. I just want
an ordinary, simple gray suit.

1063
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:21,596
But I like
that one, Scottie.

1064
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,597
No, no.
It's not right.

1065
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:26,304
Gentleman seems
to know what he wants.

1066
01:47:27,358 --> 01:47:29,350
All right. We'll find it.

1067
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:37,822
Scottie, what
are you doing?

1068
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:39,450
I'm trying
to buy you a suit.

1069
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:44,156
But... But I love the
second one she wore.

1070
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:45,615
And this one,
it's beautiful.

1071
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:48,076
No, no. They're
none of them right.

1072
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:51,879
Oh, I think I know the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.

1073
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,379
Let me go and see.
We may still have that model.

1074
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,800
Thank you.

1075
01:47:57,972 --> 01:48:01,056
You're looking for the suit
that she wore, for me.

1076
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,501
You want me to be
dressed like her.

1077
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:03,925
Judy, I just want you
to look nice.

1078
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:05,705
I know the kind of suit
that'd look well on you.

1079
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:08,517
Oh, no. No, I won't do it!

1080
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:12,351
Judy.

1081
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:16,383
Judy, it can't make that much difference
to you. I just want to see...

1082
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:19,821
No, I don't want any clothes.
I don't want anything. I want to get out of here.

1083
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,401
Judy, do this for me.

1084
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,077
Here we are.

1085
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:24,163
Yes, that's it.

1086
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:25,659
I thought so.

1087
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,666
- I don't like it.
- No, we'll take it.

1088
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:29,913
Will the thing fit?

1089
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:34,374
Well, yes. It might need some
slight alterations, but it's madam's size.

1090
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:37,209
All right, dear. We'll have it
for you to try on in a moment.

1091
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:38,713
How long will the
alterations take?

1092
01:48:38,804 --> 01:48:40,295
Well...

1093
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:41,630
May we have it
by tonight?

1094
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:43,807
Well, if it's
absolutely necessary.

1095
01:48:43,892 --> 01:48:47,431
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like to look
at a dinner dress, an evening dress.

1096
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:51,606
Short, black, with long sleeves,
and a kind of square neck.

1097
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:52,899
Scottie!

1098
01:48:52,985 --> 01:48:57,901
My! You certainly do know what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.

1099
01:49:06,498 --> 01:49:08,865
All right. That's it.
Do you have them in brown?

1100
01:49:08,959 --> 01:49:10,791
- Yes, we have.
- Fine.

1101
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,864
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.

1102
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:21,924
Stop.

1103
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,013
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

1104
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:28,968
I don't know.

1105
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:31,976
I don't know. No good, I guess.
I don't know.

1106
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:38,440
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.

1107
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,113
You can, you know.

1108
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:45,736
No. You wouldn't let me.

1109
01:49:47,956 --> 01:49:50,915
And I don't wanna go.

1110
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:54,331
Oh, Judy. Judy,
I tell you this.

1111
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:57,539
These past few days have been
the first happy days I've known in a year.

1112
01:49:57,633 --> 01:50:00,046
I know. I know because...

1113
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,837
'Cause I remind you of her.

1114
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:08,049
And not even that very much.

1115
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:13,935
No. No, Judy.
Judy, it's you, too.

1116
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:16,357
There's something
in you that...

1117
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:22,104
You don't even want
to touch me.

1118
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:23,693
Yes. Yes, I do.

1119
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:29,662
Couldn't you like me,
just me, the way I am?

1120
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:34,959
When we first started out,
it was so good. We had fun.

1121
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:39,543
And... And then you started
in on the clothes.

1122
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:44,545
Well, I'll wear the darned clothes
if you want me to,

1123
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:47,597
if you'll just like me.

1124
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:54,979
The color of your hair.

1125
01:50:55,065 --> 01:50:56,431
Oh, no.

1126
01:51:01,446 --> 01:51:04,029
Judy, please.
It can't matter to you.

1127
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:12,364
If...

1128
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:17,581
If I let you change me,
will that do it?

1129
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:20,330
If I do what you tell me,

1130
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:23,708
will you love me?

1131
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:24,918
Yes.

1132
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,471
- Yes.
- All right.

1133
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:33,764
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.

1134
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:45,901
Here, come on.
We'll sit by the fire.

1135
01:52:06,553 --> 01:52:08,636
I'm afraid it's going
to take several hours.

1136
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,283
The young lady thought perhaps
you'd like to go home.

1137
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:12,285
And then she'll come there
as soon as she's finished.

1138
01:52:12,309 --> 01:52:16,269
Well, no. You tell her I'll go to
her hotel and wait for her there.

1139
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:18,813
Oh, and you're sure
about the color of the hair?

1140
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:20,310
Oh, yes.
It's an easy color.

1141
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,767
- And all the rest of...
- Yes, sir, we know what you want.

1142
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:24,227
Thank you.

1143
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,499
Well?

1144
01:54:09,593 --> 01:54:12,006
It should be back from your face
and pinned at the neck.

1145
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,428
I told her that.
I told you that.

1146
01:54:15,223 --> 01:54:18,591
We tried it.
It just didn't seem to suit me.

1147
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:26,057
Please, Judy.

1148
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:32,911
Where shall
we go for dinner?

1149
01:57:33,004 --> 01:57:34,540
Anywhere you like.

1150
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:35,997
Ernie's?

1151
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:38,799
You have a thing
about Ernie's, don't you?

1152
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:41,468
Well, after all,
it's our place.

1153
01:57:44,724 --> 01:57:46,681
Hello, my love.
Like me?

1154
01:57:47,018 --> 01:57:48,134
Mmm-hmm.

1155
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:50,561
Is that the best
you can do?

1156
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,933
Come here.

1157
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:53,889
Oh, no. You'll muss me.

1158
01:57:53,984 --> 01:57:56,943
Well, that's what I had in mind.
Now, come here.

1159
01:57:57,028 --> 01:57:58,564
It's too late.
I got my face on.

1160
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:03,525
And I'm suddenly hungry.
Would you rather go somewhere else?

1161
01:58:03,618 --> 01:58:05,610
No, no. Ernie's is fine.

1162
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,325
I'm gonna have...

1163
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:12,037
I'm gonna have one of those big,
beautiful steaks.

1164
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:16,003
Let me see.
To start, I think I'll...

1165
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,958
Help me with this,
will you?

1166
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:24,045
I have it.

1167
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:26,467
How do you work
this thing?

1168
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:28,140
Can't you see?

1169
01:58:28,226 --> 01:58:30,593
Oh. Now,
there you are.

1170
01:58:30,687 --> 01:58:33,646
Thank you.
I'm just about ready.

1171
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:36,349
All I've got to do
is find my lipstick.

1172
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:40,153
Where did I put it?
I had it a minute ago.

1173
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:55,243
I wonder if it's here.
Here it is.

1174
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,996
There, I'm ready.

1175
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:02,959
But first,
muss me a little?

1176
01:59:06,931 --> 01:59:09,844
Scottie, I do
have you now, don't I?

1177
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:16,731
How would you like to go someplace
out of town for dinner?

1178
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:18,978
Maybe we could drive
down the peninsula.

1179
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:21,106
All right. If you'd like.

1180
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:40,789
We're going awfully far.

1181
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:45,001
I just feel like driving.
You terribly hungry?

1182
01:59:45,095 --> 01:59:47,178
No. No, it's all right.

1183
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:09,070
Where're you going?

1184
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,952
One final thing
I have to do.

1185
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:20,373
And then, I'll be
free of the past.

1186
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:43,647
Scottie, why are we here?

1187
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,103
I told you.

1188
02:00:47,323 --> 02:00:49,531
I have to go back
into the past once more.

1189
02:00:49,617 --> 02:00:53,987
Just once more,
for the last time.

1190
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,242
Why? Why here?

1191
02:00:56,332 --> 02:00:58,369
Madeleine died here, Judy.

1192
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:04,046
- I don't wanna go. I'd rather wait here.
- No, I need you.

1193
02:01:04,132 --> 02:01:05,168
Why?

1194
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:09,590
I need you to be
Madeleine for a while.

1195
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,296
And when it's done,
we'll both be free.

1196
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:16,930
- I'm scared.
- Oh, no. I have to tell you about Madeleine now.

1197
02:01:17,604 --> 02:01:19,015
Right there.

1198
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:22,853
We stood there, and I kissed her
for the last time.

1199
02:01:22,942 --> 02:01:24,353
And she said,
"If you lose me,

1200
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:25,671
- "you'll know that I loved you..."
- Scottie.

1201
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:27,436
"...and wanted to
keep on loving you."

1202
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:31,365
And I said, "I won't lose you."
But I did.

1203
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:34,360
And then she turned

1204
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:37,871
and ran into the church.

1205
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:53,463
And when I followed her,
it was too late.

1206
02:01:58,102 --> 02:01:59,843
I don't wanna go in there!

1207
02:01:59,938 --> 02:02:01,520
It's too late.

1208
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,358
Scottie, I...

1209
02:02:09,405 --> 02:02:13,445
I couldn't find her, and then I heard
footsteps on the stairs.

1210
02:02:13,535 --> 02:02:15,652
She was running
up the tower.

1211
02:02:15,745 --> 02:02:17,077
Right here.

1212
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:20,455
- Scottie...
- See? She was running up the stairs,

1213
02:02:20,542 --> 02:02:23,455
through the trapdoor
at the top of the tower.

1214
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,629
And I tried to follow her,
but I couldn't get to the top.

1215
02:02:26,714 --> 02:02:29,331
I tried, but I couldn't
get to the top.

1216
02:02:29,425 --> 02:02:31,792
One doesn't often
get a second chance.

1217
02:02:31,886 --> 02:02:34,003
I want to stop
being haunted.

1218
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:38,223
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.

1219
02:02:38,309 --> 02:02:40,141
Take me away!

1220
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:43,847
You look like Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.

1221
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:46,102
- No!
- Go up the stairs.

1222
02:02:48,528 --> 02:02:50,440
Go up the stairs, Judy.

1223
02:02:52,282 --> 02:02:53,898
And I'll follow.

1224
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:56,760
This was as far as I could get,
but you went on.

1225
02:03:58,181 --> 02:03:59,422
Remember?

1226
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:04,094
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.

1227
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:05,894
I remembered the necklace.

1228
02:04:06,022 --> 02:04:08,605
- Let me go!
- No. We're going up the tower, Madeleine.

1229
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:10,683
You can't!
You're afraid!

1230
02:04:11,402 --> 02:04:15,021
Now, we'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.

1231
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:16,195
Scottie, please!

1232
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:19,122
But you knew that day that I wouldn't
be able to follow you, didn't you?

1233
02:04:19,202 --> 02:04:21,615
Who was up there when you got up there?
Elster and his wife?

1234
02:04:21,704 --> 02:04:23,787
- Yes.
- Yes, and she was the one who died.

1235
02:04:23,873 --> 02:04:25,705
The real wife, not you.

1236
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:28,250
You were the copy. You were
the counterfeit, weren't you?

1237
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:31,018
- Was she dead or alive when...
- Dead! Dead! He'd broken her neck.

1238
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:34,298
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?

1239
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:36,717
So, when you got up there,
he pushed her off the tower,

1240
02:04:36,803 --> 02:04:39,170
but it was you that screamed.
Why did you scream?

1241
02:04:39,263 --> 02:04:42,301
I wanted to stop it, Scottie.
I ran up to stop it. I...

1242
02:04:42,392 --> 02:04:44,725
If you wanted to stop it,
why did you scream,

1243
02:04:44,811 --> 02:04:46,803
since you tricked me
so well up to then?

1244
02:04:46,896 --> 02:04:50,981
You played the wife very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?

1245
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:54,435
He made you over just like
I made you over, only better.

1246
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,521
Not only the clothes
and the hair,

1247
02:04:56,614 --> 02:04:59,231
but the looks, and the manner,
and the words,

1248
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,987
and those beautiful
phony trances.

1249
02:05:01,077 --> 02:05:03,239
And you jumped into
the Bay, didn't you?

1250
02:05:03,329 --> 02:05:06,413
I'll bet you're a wonderful swimmer,
aren't you? Aren't you?

1251
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:08,206
- Aren't you?
- Yes!

1252
02:05:08,292 --> 02:05:12,912
And then what did he do?
Did he train you? Did he rehearse you?

1253
02:05:13,006 --> 02:05:15,999
Did he tell you exactly
what to do, what to say?

1254
02:05:16,092 --> 02:05:20,507
You were a very apt pupil, too, weren't you?
You were a very apt pupil.

1255
02:05:20,596 --> 02:05:22,963
Why did you pick on me?
Why me?

1256
02:05:23,057 --> 02:05:24,889
Your accident!
Your accident.

1257
02:05:24,976 --> 02:05:27,093
My accident...

1258
02:05:27,186 --> 02:05:29,178
I was the setup,
wasn't I?

1259
02:05:29,272 --> 02:05:32,856
I was the setup.
I was a made-to-order witness. I...

1260
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,572
I made it.

1261
02:05:42,452 --> 02:05:44,910
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?

1262
02:05:47,623 --> 02:05:50,536
We're going up and look at the scene
of the crime.

1263
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:52,117
Come on, Judy.

1264
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:06,632
And this is
where it happened.

1265
02:06:08,478 --> 02:06:11,312
And the two of you hid back there
and waited for it to clear,

1266
02:06:11,397 --> 02:06:14,890
and then you sneaked down
and drove into town, is that it?

1267
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:17,818
And then?
You were his girl?

1268
02:06:18,488 --> 02:06:20,605
Well, what happened to you?

1269
02:06:20,823 --> 02:06:23,987
What happened to you?
Did he ditch you?

1270
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:26,865
Oh, Judy, with all of his wife's money,
and all that freedom,

1271
02:06:26,954 --> 02:06:30,163
and that power, and he ditched you.
What a shame.

1272
02:06:30,249 --> 02:06:34,789
But he knew he was safe. He knew
you couldn't talk. Did he give you anything?

1273
02:06:34,879 --> 02:06:36,040
Some money.

1274
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:39,248
And the necklace,
Carlotta's necklace.

1275
02:06:40,218 --> 02:06:42,756
And there was where you
made your mistake, Judy.

1276
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:45,679
You shouldn't keep
souvenirs of a killing.

1277
02:06:46,682 --> 02:06:48,765
You shouldn't have been...

1278
02:06:50,103 --> 02:06:52,846
You shouldn't have been
that sentimental.

1279
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:58,354
I loved you so, Madeleine.

1280
02:07:00,071 --> 02:07:01,357
Scottie.

1281
02:07:02,824 --> 02:07:04,861
I was safe
when you found me.

1282
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:07,193
There was nothing
that you could prove.

1283
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:11,872
When I saw you again,
I couldn't run away. I loved you so.

1284
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:14,496
I walked into danger and let you
change me because I loved you,

1285
02:07:14,585 --> 02:07:16,622
and I wanted you.

1286
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:20,422
Oh, Scottie.
Oh, Scottie, please.

1287
02:07:20,758 --> 02:07:23,421
You loved me.
Now, keep me safe.

1288
02:07:23,511 --> 02:07:24,797
- Please!
- Too late.

1289
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:27,595
It's too late.
There's no bringing her back.

1290
02:07:27,682 --> 02:07:28,889
Please.

1291
02:07:40,736 --> 02:07:42,398
- No!
- I heard voices.

1292
02:07:46,826 --> 02:07:48,408
God have mercy.
