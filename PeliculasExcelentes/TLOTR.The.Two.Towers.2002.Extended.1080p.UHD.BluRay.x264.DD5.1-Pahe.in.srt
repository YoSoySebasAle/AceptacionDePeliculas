1
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:20,498
<i>- You cannot pass!</i>
<i>- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:30,675
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,394
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:46,107
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:54,532
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,353
No! No!

7
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,563
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:34,822
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,325
No!

10
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,371
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,858
Gandalf!

12
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,153
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,781
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,166
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,513
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,934
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,906
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,952
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,290
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,673
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,093
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,349
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:08,768
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:12,230
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,899
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:16,776
You never know.

27
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:20,238
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,827
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,080
It is special.

30
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,877
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,591
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,554
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:49,267
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,853
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,147
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,275
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:08,369
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,971
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,348
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,851
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,314
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,360
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:46,324
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,618
...but they did.

45
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,715
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,054
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,641
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,989
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,784
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,703
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,416
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,137
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,307
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,687
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,820
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,857
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:45,943
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,696
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,282
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,659
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,745
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,041
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,755
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:23,481
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,610
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,446
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,324
Where is it?

68
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,244
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:41,624
My precious.

70
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,753
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,007
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,856
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,566
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,235
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:58,784
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,635
It burns!

77
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:19,096
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,099
It freezes!

79
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,103
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,939
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,614
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,408
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:43,162
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,040
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,752
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,633
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:03,933
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,936
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:13,984
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,153
We swears.

91
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,822
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,285
We swears...

93
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:28,249
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,211
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,338
...on the precious.

96
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,715
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:41,011
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,180
Yes...

99
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,267
...on the precious.

100
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,063
On the precious.

101
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,732
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:59,238
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,156
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,368
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:20,342
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,014
You've been there before?

107
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,599
Yes.

108
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,113
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:53,542
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:58,547
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:03,010
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,638
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:12,770
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,814
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:21,111
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:27,910
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,539
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,917
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,628
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,421
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,715
Follow me!

122
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,939
Merry!

123
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,400
Merry!

124
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,742
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,744
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,166
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,295
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,632
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,223
Merry!

130
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,725
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,064
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,151
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,864
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,743
Stop it!

135
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,582
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,879
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,299
You want some? Huh?

138
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,886
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,391
Merry.

140
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,727
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,981
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,692
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,196
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,617
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,913
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,207
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,711
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,922
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,467
Let's move!

150
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,576
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,579
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,498
Hurry!

153
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,962
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,009
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,137
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:38,308
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,010
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,638
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,142
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,230
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:29,693
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,530
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,960
Rohan.

164
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,921
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,675
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,845
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,973
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,065
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,817
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,820
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:15,947
Saruman.

172
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,542
<i>The world is changing.</i>

173
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:33,340
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...</i>

174
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,760
<i>...and Mordor?</i>

175
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:44,059
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

176
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,896
<i>...and the union of the two towers?</i>

177
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:57,364
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

178
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,118
<i>...we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

179
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:21,388
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

180
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,225
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

181
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,980
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

182
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:35,944
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

183
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:40,157
<i>...and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

184
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,797
I want them armed
and ready to march within two weeks!

185
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,632
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,802
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,181
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,184
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,773
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,526
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,529
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,698
Swear it.

193
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,963
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,050
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:44,763
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,348
Murderers!

197
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,392
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,353
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:59,736
<i>We have only to
remove those who oppose us.</i>

200
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,781
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

201
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:07,035
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

202
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,037
<i>But no more.</i>

203
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,456
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,294
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,339
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,174
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,344
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,055
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:30,225
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:34,104
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,777
Quickly!

212
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,702
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,550
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

214
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,720
<i>...is ready to fall.</i>

215
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,482
Théodred.

216
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,318
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:43,840
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:47,510
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,021
He's alive.

220
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,054
Théodred.

221
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,445
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,407
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:55,537
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,415
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:05,463
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,134
Gríma.

227
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,470
Gríma.

228
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,558
Gríma.

229
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,437
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,441
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,944
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:41,583
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,210
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:49,424
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,135
...your warmongering.

236
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,306
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,641
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,853
What was the promised price, Gríma?

239
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,774
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,872
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,041
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:35,428
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:36,763
Too much.

244
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:43,895
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:48,858
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,653
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,280
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:58,660
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,037
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,249
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,491
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,410
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:48,376
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,561
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,730
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,232
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,905
Merry!

258
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,615
Merry!

259
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:25,496
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:37,133
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,178
It's the trees.

262
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:41,971
What?

263
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:46,142
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:50,813
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,523
...and come alive.

266
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,442
Alive?

267
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,028
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,490
...talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,533
...even move.

270
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,371
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:10,667
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,252
Yeah!

273
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,713
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,301
What about them?

275
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,345
They're fresh.

276
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,808
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,732
What about their legs?

278
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,235
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,864
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,579
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,873
Alive?

282
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:58,131
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,886
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:07,098
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,853
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.

286
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,439
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,276
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:19,652
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:30,038
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:37,879
Pippin.

291
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,756
Let's go.

292
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,724
Go on.

293
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,392
Call for help.

294
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:53,853
Squeal.

295
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:57,273
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,867
Pippin!

297
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,602
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:38,022
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,139
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,975
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:46,132
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,176
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:53,181
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,901
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,695
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,823
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,417
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:25,963
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,425
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:34,847
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,266
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,731
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,858
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,821
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,740
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:58,120
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,207
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,459
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:09,090
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,467
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,595
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,223
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,476
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,813
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,983
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,280
We left none alive.

327
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,866
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,582
Dead?

329
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,295
I am sorry.

330
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,136
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:57,013 --> 00:35:01,642
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,520
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,944
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,614
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,868
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,078
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,589
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,355
We failed them.

339
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:45,621
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,125
And the other.

341
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,470
They crawled.

342
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,768
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,741
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,300
They ran over here.

345
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,180
They were followed.

346
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,101
The belt!

347
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,190
Run!

348
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,195
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,202
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,496
Fangorn?

351
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:11,290
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:32,019
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:42,154
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:49,370
Come here!

355
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,461
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,556
He's gone.

357
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,945
Merry!

358
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:38,794
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,469
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:57,313 --> 00:40:01,609
Little Orcs.

361
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,111
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,155
Tree?

363
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,325
I am no tree!

364
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,744
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,455
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,957
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:18,459
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,461
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:24,882
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,009
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,261
Side?

372
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,348
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:38,020
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:43,484
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,236
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,697
Hobbits?

377
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:54,870
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:59,291
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,878
They come with fire.

380
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,673
They come with axes.

381
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:10,678
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:14,682
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,685
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,687
Halflings!

385
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,021
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,524
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:27,444
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:32,449
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,202
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:38,205
Saruman.

391
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,469
See? See?

392
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:55,055
We've led you out.

393
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,766
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:03,439
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,780
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:17,953
Oh! It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,748
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:26,253
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:32,009
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,890
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,768
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:44,480
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:48,734
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,360
Come quickly.

405
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,615
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:59,119
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:01,538
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:05,125
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:09,630
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:13,092
And we are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:17,554
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:34,029
Here.

413
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,241
What does it eats?

414
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,368
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:47,292
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:51,213
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:56,969
We must starve!

418
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:59,555
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:02,516
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:05,561
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:10,566
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,986
Not like master.

423
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:17,447
Master cares.

424
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,492
Master knows.

425
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,913
Yes.

426
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,708
Precious.

427
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:34,923
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:40,971
...it never lets go.

429
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:42,806
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,174
There are dead things!

431
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,134
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:27,935
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:32,231
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:36,026
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,570
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,490
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,952
This way.

438
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,871
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:53,460
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:57,798
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:25,492
Frodo!

442
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:14,666
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,626
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:18,754
Are you all right?

445
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:50,577
So bright.

446
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:54,581
So beautiful.

447
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,585
Our precious.

448
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:01,505
What did you say?

449
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:03,965
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:08,220
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,433
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,102
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,145
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:21,358
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

455
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:23,110
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,823
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

457
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,992
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,953
Were you?

459
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:37,374
Sméagol.

460
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:44,631
What did you call me?

461
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:48,718
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,638
A long time ago.

463
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:54,641
My name.

464
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:57,227
My name.

465
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:06,653
Sméagol.

466
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,367
Black Riders!

467
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:13,869
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,756
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:30,552
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:34,014
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:37,100
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,378
Wraiths!

473
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,756
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,807
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:21,478
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,815
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,234
I'm here.

478
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,793
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:49,256
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,014
Orc blood.

481
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,776
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,029
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,658
This forest is old.

484
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:19,494
Very old.

485
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:23,498
Full of memory...

486
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:28,503
...and anger.

487
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:37,512
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,180
Gimli!

489
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,308
Lower your ax.

490
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:46,855
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,399
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:54,321
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:57,157
Talking trees.

494
00:51:57,824 --> 00:52:00,827
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:04,247
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,294
Something's out there.

497
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,636
What do you see?

498
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:20,639
The White Wizard approaches.

499
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:31,107
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

500
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,952
We must be quick.

501
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,180
You are tracking
the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

502
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:04,182
Where are they?

503
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:07,894
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

504
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:12,357
They met someone they did not expect.

505
00:53:12,524 --> 00:53:14,651
Does that comfort you?

506
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:16,778
Who are you?

507
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:20,240
Show yourself!

508
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:31,126
It cannot be.

509
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,130
Forgive me.

510
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:38,633
I mistook you for Saruman.

511
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:42,178
I am Saruman.

512
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:47,642
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

513
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,061
You fell.

514
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:54,065
Through fire...

515
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:55,525
...and water.

516
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:59,529
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

517
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:03,450
<i>...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

518
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,010
<i>Until at last
I threw down my enemy...</i>

519
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:26,681
<i>...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

520
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:35,231
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

521
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:40,069
<i>...and I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

522
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,907
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

523
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:48,703
<i>...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.</i>

524
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,916
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

525
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:56,002
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

526
00:54:57,921 --> 00:55:00,465
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

527
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:02,217
...until my task is done.

528
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:04,511
Gandalf.

529
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,222
Gandalf?

530
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:09,390
Yes.

531
00:55:12,227 --> 00:55:13,978
That was what they used to call me.

532
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:19,108
Gandalf the Grey.

533
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:22,237
That was my name.

534
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,822
Gandalf.

535
00:55:25,782 --> 00:55:27,867
I am Gandalf the White.

536
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,957
And I come back to you now...

537
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:36,626
...at the turn of the tide.

538
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:40,755
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

539
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:44,634
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

540
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:47,595
That is no short distance!

541
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:51,057
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

542
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,351
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

543
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:56,938
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

544
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:59,107
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

545
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:03,194
...in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested--?

546
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:09,284
I mean, charming...

547
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,203
...quite charming forest.

548
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:16,416
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

549
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:20,920
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

550
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:24,549
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

551
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:28,052
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

552
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,388
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

553
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:34,976
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.

554
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:44,235
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

555
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:48,031
The Ents are going to wake up...

556
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:53,077
- ...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

557
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:54,996
Oh, that's good.

558
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:57,874
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

559
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,210
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

560
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:05,048
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

561
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:08,968
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

562
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:32,659
That is one of the Mearas...

563
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,620
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

564
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:55,515
Shadowfax.

565
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:00,687
He is the lord of all horses...

566
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:06,234
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

567
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:24,085
<i>O rowan mine</i>

568
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:28,047
<i>I saw you shine</i>

569
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:31,759
<i>Upon a summer's day</i>

570
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:37,348
<i>Upon your head
How golden-red</i>

571
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:42,228
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

572
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:44,814
Such a beautiful verse.

573
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:49,902
- Is it much further?
- Bru-Ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

574
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:53,322
You might call it far, perhaps.

575
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,036
My home lies deep in the forest...

576
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:02,123
...near the roots of the mountain.

577
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:07,128
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

578
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:11,340
And safe is where I'll keep you.

579
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:15,970
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

580
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,348
It's one of my own compositions.

581
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,725
Right.

582
00:59:20,892 --> 00:59:27,023
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

583
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:32,070
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

584
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:38,701
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

585
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:42,997
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

586
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:46,084
<i>Come back to me</i>

587
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:51,089
<i>Come back to me</i>

588
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:57,678
<i>And say my land is best</i>

589
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,140
Oh.

590
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:08,815
Sleep, little Shirelings.

591
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:12,568
Heed no nightly noise.

592
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:16,656
Sleep till morning light.

593
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:22,453
I have business in the forest.

594
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:28,167
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

595
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:34,048
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

596
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:39,929
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

597
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,734
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

598
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:57,155
Sauron will suffer no rival.

599
01:00:57,572 --> 01:01:01,868
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

600
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:05,454
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

601
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:08,457
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

602
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:11,210
The rumor has reached him.

603
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:14,338
The heir of Númenor still lives.

604
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:18,134
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

605
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,637
He fears what you may become.

606
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:26,309
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

607
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:30,104
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

608
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,772
War is coming.

609
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:35,526
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

610
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:38,112
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

611
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:41,991
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

612
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:45,244
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

613
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:50,124
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

614
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:53,085
But for all their cunning...

615
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:55,838
...we have one advantage.

616
01:01:57,965 --> 01:02:00,551
The Ring remains hidden.

617
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:03,554
And that we should seek to destroy it...

618
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:06,682
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

619
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,603
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

620
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,271
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

621
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:16,525
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

622
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,320
We must trust now in Frodo.

623
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,322
Everything depends upon speed...

624
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:24,492
...and the secrecy of his quest.

625
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:29,789
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

626
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:33,417
Frodo must finish this task alone.

627
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,462
He's not alone.

628
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:38,339
Sam went with him.

629
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,216
Did he?

630
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:45,012
Did he, indeed? Good.

631
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,057
Yes, very good.

632
01:02:56,065 --> 01:03:00,945
The Black Gate of Mordor.

633
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,242
Oh, save us.

634
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:15,251
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

635
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:21,966
Master says to
show him the way into Mordor.

636
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:25,553
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

637
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,971
I did.

638
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,732
That's it, then.

639
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:40,568
We can't get past that.

640
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,114
Look!

641
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,741
The gate.

642
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,117
It's opening!

643
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,543
I can see a way down.

644
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,380
Sam, no!

645
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:45,925
Master!

646
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:13,304
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

647
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:17,224
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

648
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,518
- Now!
- No!

649
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,062
No! No, master!

650
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:25,232
They catch you! They catch you!

651
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:29,069
Don't take it to him.

652
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:34,742
He wants the precious.

653
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:37,953
Always he is looking for it.

654
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:42,041
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

655
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:46,170
But we mustn't let him have it.

656
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,678
No! There's another way.

657
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,515
More secret. A dark way.

658
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:01,477
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

659
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:03,062
He's up to something.

660
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:06,232
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

661
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,151
Yes. There's a path...

662
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:11,820
...and some stairs.

663
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:13,697
And then...

664
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:17,201
...a tunnel.

665
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,967
He's led us this far, Sam.

666
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,552
Mr. Frodo, no.

667
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:37,137
He's been true to his word.

668
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:43,227
No.

669
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:46,981
Lead the way, Sméagol.

670
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:51,527
Good Sméagol always helps.

671
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,520
Hello?

672
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,025
Treebeard?

673
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,027
Where has he gone?

674
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,654
I had the loveliest dream last night.

675
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,991
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

676
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:41,660
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

677
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:44,079
...you were sick.

678
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:48,542
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

679
01:08:52,046 --> 01:08:53,964
Did you hear that?

680
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,556
There it is again.

681
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:06,977
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

682
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,735
You just said something...Treeish.

683
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:18,906
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

684
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,332
You're taller.

685
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,376
- Who?
- You!

686
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,169
- Than what?
- Than me!

687
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,797
I've always been taller than you.

688
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:39,593
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

689
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:41,970
Please, Merry.

690
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:45,974
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

691
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,727
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

692
01:09:51,522 --> 01:09:53,774
3'8"!

693
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:57,611
Three-foot-eight.

694
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,533
You did something.

695
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,915
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

696
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:12,334
Merry!

697
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:14,837
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

698
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:18,924
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

699
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:21,260
Give me it back. Merry!

700
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,430
What's happening?!

701
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:26,765
It's got my leg!

702
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:28,642
Merry!

703
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,360
No!

704
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,663
Help!

705
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:58,213
Away with you.

706
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,174
You should not be waking.

707
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:05,679
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

708
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:08,807
Go to sleep.

709
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,976
Away with you.

710
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:14,480
Come, the forest is waking up.

711
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:16,982
It isn't safe.

712
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:23,530
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

713
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:26,742
Anger festers in their hearts.

714
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:29,203
Black are their thoughts.

715
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:31,914
Strong is their hate.

716
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,833
They will harm you if they can.

717
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,587
There are too few of us now.

718
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:42,758
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

719
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:46,011
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

720
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,389
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-Ra-hroom.

721
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:55,187
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

722
01:11:55,354 --> 01:12:00,609
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

723
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,277
Oh, I'm sorry.

724
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:06,365
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

725
01:12:06,532 --> 01:12:09,785
We lost them.

726
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:15,040
And now we cannot find them.

727
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:21,421
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

728
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:24,174
Can't say that I have.

729
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:26,760
You, Pip?

730
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:30,556
What do they look like?

731
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:37,688
I don't remember now.

732
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:58,000
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

733
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,420
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

734
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:05,007
<i>...whose mind is overthrown.</i>

735
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:09,428
<i>Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

736
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:13,265
My lord, your son...

737
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:15,601
...he is dead.

738
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:18,937
My lord?

739
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,356
Uncle?

740
01:13:28,155 --> 01:13:30,449
Will you not go to him?

741
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:35,954
Will you do nothing?

742
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,123
Be careful what you say.

743
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:40,459
Do not look for welcome here.

744
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:08,695
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

745
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:11,031
What a tragedy for the king...

746
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:14,201
...to lose his only son and heir.

747
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:19,831
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

748
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:24,920
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

749
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:26,546
Leave me alone, snake!

750
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,675
Oh, but you are alone.

751
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:36,056
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

752
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:39,685
...in the bitter watches of the night...

753
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,522
...when all your life seems to shrink.

754
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:47,901
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

755
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:52,656
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

756
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:56,785
So fair.

757
01:14:58,036 --> 01:14:59,413
So cold.

758
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:03,417
Like a morning of pale spring...

759
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:07,045
...still clinging to winter's chill.

760
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:23,311
Your words are poison.

761
01:16:55,821 --> 01:16:58,323
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

762
01:17:11,545 --> 01:17:12,587
Ah.

763
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:16,550
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

764
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,595
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

765
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:40,907
- Your staff.
- Hm? Oh...

766
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:46,580
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

767
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:08,268
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

768
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:18,195
He's a herald of woe.

769
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:22,741
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

770
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:25,285
...Théoden King.

771
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:28,538
He's not welcome.

772
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:34,753
Why should I welcome you...

773
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:38,924
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

774
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:42,427
A just question, my liege.

775
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:45,430
Late is the hour...

776
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:49,643
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

777
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,437
Láthspell I name him.

778
01:18:52,646 --> 01:18:55,523
Ill news is an ill guest.

779
01:18:55,690 --> 01:19:00,278
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

780
01:19:00,445 --> 01:19:02,364
I have not passed
through fire and death...

781
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:05,784
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

782
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,870
His staff.

783
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:13,166
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

784
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:18,463
Théoden...

785
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:21,591
...son of Thengel...

786
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:25,720
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

787
01:19:28,682 --> 01:19:31,977
I would stay still if I were you.

788
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:34,229
Hearken to me!

789
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:41,861
I release you...

790
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:43,989
...from the spell.

791
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:58,586
You have no power here...

792
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:02,382
...Gandalf the Grey.

793
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:12,851
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

794
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:23,820
Wait.

795
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:29,075
If I go, Théoden dies.

796
01:20:29,784 --> 01:20:31,995
You did not kill me...

797
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:34,372
...you will not kill him.

798
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,961
Rohan is mine.

799
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:42,797
Be gone.

800
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,469
I know your face.

801
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:35,308
Éowyn.

802
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:38,853
Éowyn.

803
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:48,321
Gandalf?

804
01:21:48,863 --> 01:21:51,741
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

805
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:07,715
Dark have been my dreams of late.

806
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:15,640
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

807
01:22:15,849 --> 01:22:18,768
...if they grasped your sword.

808
01:23:03,897 --> 01:23:05,899
I've only...

809
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:09,110
...ever served you, my lord.

810
01:23:09,277 --> 01:23:14,282
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

811
01:23:15,283 --> 01:23:17,243
Send me not from your sight.

812
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:22,248
No, my lord! No, my lord.

813
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:23,666
Let him go.

814
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:27,587
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

815
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:39,057
Get out of my way!

816
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:44,437
Hail, Théoden King!

817
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:11,631
Where is Théodred?

818
01:24:14,634 --> 01:24:17,136
Where is my son?

819
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:46,100
Simbelmynë.

820
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:54,859
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

821
01:25:58,696 --> 01:26:01,658
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

822
01:26:03,785 --> 01:26:07,664
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

823
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:12,835
The young perish and the old linger.

824
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,546
That I should live...

825
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:19,092
...to see the last days of my house.

826
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:24,180
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

827
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:30,603
No parent should have to bury
their child.

828
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:49,205
He was strong in life.

829
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:53,876
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

830
01:27:38,463 --> 01:27:40,339
They had no warning.

831
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:42,925
They were unarmed.

832
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:47,430
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

833
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:50,308
Rick, cot and tree.

834
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:52,810
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.

835
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:57,857
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

836
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:02,445
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

837
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:07,033
Ride out and meet him head on.

838
01:28:07,784 --> 01:28:11,287
Draw him away from your women
and children.

839
01:28:11,621 --> 01:28:13,247
You must fight.

840
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:17,251
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

841
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:19,045
Éomer is loyal to you.

842
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:21,923
His men will return
and fight for their king.

843
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:26,010
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

844
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:31,891
Éomer cannot help us.

845
01:28:32,517 --> 01:28:34,310
I know what it is you want of me...

846
01:28:34,477 --> 01:28:37,730
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

847
01:28:39,398 --> 01:28:41,108
I will not risk open war.

848
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:46,739
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

849
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:52,578
When last I looked...

850
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:56,666
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

851
01:29:03,548 --> 01:29:05,800
Then what is the king's decision?

852
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:12,765
<i>By order of the king...</i>

853
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:14,350
...the city must empty.

854
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:18,396
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

855
01:29:18,688 --> 01:29:22,567
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

856
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:24,277
Helm's Deep.

857
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:27,989
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

858
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:30,116
Who will defend them if not their king?

859
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:32,743
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

860
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,745
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

861
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:38,791
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

862
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:41,168
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

863
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:43,504
What they will get is a massacre.

864
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:47,550
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

865
01:29:48,426 --> 01:29:51,804
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

866
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:55,099
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

867
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:58,352
The people of Rohan will need you.

868
01:29:58,728 --> 01:30:01,188
The defenses have to hold.

869
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:04,358
They will hold.

870
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:10,656
The Grey Pilgrim.

871
01:30:10,823 --> 01:30:13,451
That's what they used to call me.

872
01:30:13,618 --> 01:30:18,748
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

873
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:22,543
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

874
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:26,380
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

875
01:30:27,256 --> 01:30:29,967
At dawn, look to the east.

876
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:31,677
Go.

877
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:02,375
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

878
01:31:41,414 --> 01:31:43,457
His name is Brego.

879
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:46,919
He was my cousin's horse.

880
01:31:47,086 --> 01:31:48,921
Brego.

881
01:31:50,423 --> 01:31:53,175
Your name is kingly.

882
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:06,063
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

883
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:09,525
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

884
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:12,987
You speak as one of their own.

885
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:17,241
I was raised in Rivendell...

886
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:19,035
...for a time.

887
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:24,373
Turn this fellow free.

888
01:32:24,999 --> 01:32:27,501
He's seen enough of war.

889
01:32:39,263 --> 01:32:42,099
Gandalf the White.

890
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:44,643
Gandalf the Fool!

891
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:50,232
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

892
01:32:51,192 --> 01:32:55,154
There were three
who followed the wizard.

893
01:32:55,571 --> 01:33:00,910
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

894
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:04,080
You stink of horse.

895
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:11,212
The Man...

896
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:17,468
- ...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

897
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:21,430
One of the Dúnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

898
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:23,390
His cloth was poor.

899
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:29,438
And yet he bore a strange ring.

900
01:33:30,523 --> 01:33:34,068
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

901
01:33:34,235 --> 01:33:40,074
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

902
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:42,159
The Ring of Barahir.

903
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:46,705
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

904
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:50,209
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

905
01:33:50,376 --> 01:33:53,129
The line was broken years ago.

906
01:33:54,547 --> 01:33:56,006
It matters not.

907
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:58,717
The world of Men shall fall.

908
01:33:58,884 --> 01:34:00,761
It will begin at Edoras.

909
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:11,897
I am ready, Gamling.

910
01:34:12,064 --> 01:34:14,567
Bring my horse.

911
01:34:17,695 --> 01:34:19,071
This is not a defeat.

912
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,700
We will return.

913
01:34:28,164 --> 01:34:30,583
We will return.

914
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:55,900
You have some skill with a blade.

915
01:35:04,408 --> 01:35:06,493
Women of this country learned long ago:

916
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,288
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

917
01:35:09,455 --> 01:35:11,290
I fear neither death nor pain.

918
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,668
What do you fear, my lady?

919
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:19,882
A cage.

920
01:35:21,175 --> 01:35:25,012
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

921
01:35:25,179 --> 01:35:29,141
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

922
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:34,563
You're a daughter of kings...

923
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:39,151
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

924
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:46,951
I do not think that would be your fate.

925
01:36:19,984 --> 01:36:23,028
<i>Théoden will not stay at Edoras.</i>

926
01:36:23,195 --> 01:36:25,322
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

927
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:28,367
He will expect an attack on the city.

928
01:36:29,702 --> 01:36:32,955
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

929
01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:35,457
...the great fortress of Rohan.

930
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:41,046
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

931
01:36:42,506 --> 01:36:44,216
<i>They will be slow.</i>

932
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:49,013
They will have women and children
with them.

933
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,227
Send out your Warg-riders.

934
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:12,953
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

935
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,789
- Why do you do that?
- What?

936
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:18,500
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

937
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:20,961
Because.

938
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:24,631
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

939
01:37:24,798 --> 01:37:27,009
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

940
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:30,220
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

941
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:32,639
You have no idea what it did to him...

942
01:37:32,806 --> 01:37:35,309
...what it's still doing to him.

943
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:39,605
I want to help him, Sam.

944
01:37:39,772 --> 01:37:41,065
Why?

945
01:37:46,362 --> 01:37:49,490
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

946
01:37:53,786 --> 01:37:55,662
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

947
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:58,582
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

948
01:38:05,506 --> 01:38:09,718
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

949
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:11,678
I do.

950
01:38:13,722 --> 01:38:15,599
It's the Ring.

951
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:17,726
You can't take your eyes off it.

952
01:38:18,435 --> 01:38:20,437
I've seen you.

953
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:24,733
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

954
01:38:26,485 --> 01:38:28,737
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

955
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:31,615
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

956
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:34,701
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

957
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:36,620
Mine! My own!

958
01:38:37,454 --> 01:38:39,581
Can't you hear yourself?

959
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:41,417
Don't you know who you sound like?

960
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:53,804
We wants it.

961
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:56,682
We needs it.

962
01:38:56,849 --> 01:39:01,645
Must have the precious.

963
01:39:01,854 --> 01:39:05,274
They stole it from us.

964
01:39:05,441 --> 01:39:08,819
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

965
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:12,865
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

966
01:39:13,031 --> 01:39:16,326
No. Not master.

967
01:39:16,493 --> 01:39:20,330
Yes, precious. False.

968
01:39:20,497 --> 01:39:25,002
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

969
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:28,589
Master's my friend.

970
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:33,886
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

971
01:39:35,095 --> 01:39:37,598
Not listening. I'm not listening.

972
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:41,768
You're a liar and a thief.

973
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:43,979
No.

974
01:39:44,897 --> 01:39:47,774
Murderer.

975
01:39:50,235 --> 01:39:51,278
Go away.

976
01:39:51,445 --> 01:39:53,822
Go away?

977
01:39:55,824 --> 01:39:58,619
I hate you.

978
01:39:58,785 --> 01:40:01,205
I hate you.

979
01:40:01,497 --> 01:40:04,791
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

980
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:06,793
I saved us.

981
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,507
It was me. We survived because of me.

982
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:16,303
Not anymore.

983
01:40:17,638 --> 01:40:19,223
What did you say?

984
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:25,103
Master looks after us now.

985
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:28,774
We don't need you.

986
01:40:29,483 --> 01:40:31,068
What?

987
01:40:31,235 --> 01:40:32,986
Leave now...

988
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:36,949
...and never come back.

989
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:38,158
No.

990
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:42,871
Leave now and never come back.

991
01:40:45,457 --> 01:40:51,380
Leave now and never come back!

992
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:06,061
We told him to go away.

993
01:41:06,228 --> 01:41:09,189
And away he goes, precious.

994
01:41:09,356 --> 01:41:11,358
Gone! Gone! Gone!

995
01:41:11,525 --> 01:41:13,318
Sméagol is free!

996
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,741
Look.

997
01:41:19,908 --> 01:41:24,413
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

998
01:41:33,922 --> 01:41:35,340
They are young.

999
01:41:35,507 --> 01:41:38,051
They are tender. They are nice.

1000
01:41:38,218 --> 01:41:41,763
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1001
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,059
You'll make him sick, you will...

1002
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:49,521
...behaving like that.

1003
01:41:51,857 --> 01:41:54,651
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1004
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:00,407
What's it doing?

1005
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:03,785
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1006
01:42:03,952 --> 01:42:06,163
It ruins it.

1007
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:09,958
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1008
01:42:14,087 --> 01:42:16,673
What we need is a few good taters.

1009
01:42:17,549 --> 01:42:20,594
What's taters, precious?

1010
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:22,512
What's taters? Eh?

1011
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:24,389
Po-ta-toes.

1012
01:42:24,723 --> 01:42:27,976
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1013
01:42:29,478 --> 01:42:34,983
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1014
01:42:36,276 --> 01:42:38,195
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1015
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,697
Oh, yes, we could.

1016
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:44,368
Spoil a nice fish.

1017
01:42:45,661 --> 01:42:48,288
Give it to us raw...

1018
01:42:48,455 --> 01:42:51,500
...and wriggling.

1019
01:42:51,667 --> 01:42:54,795
You keep nasty chips.

1020
01:42:55,712 --> 01:42:57,798
You're hopeless.

1021
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,812
Mr. Frodo?

1022
01:43:29,705 --> 01:43:32,374
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1023
01:43:32,541 --> 01:43:35,001
Servants of Sauron.

1024
01:43:35,794 --> 01:43:38,004
They are called to Mordor.

1025
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:41,216
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1026
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:44,553
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1027
01:43:46,138 --> 01:43:49,766
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1028
01:43:49,933 --> 01:43:55,147
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1029
01:43:55,397 --> 01:43:57,232
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1030
01:43:58,650 --> 01:43:59,860
Mr. Frodo.

1031
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,987
Look.

1032
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:07,951
It's an oliphaunt.

1033
01:44:16,168 --> 01:44:19,171
No one at home will believe this.

1034
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:32,184
Sméagol?

1035
01:45:12,516 --> 01:45:15,018
We've lingered here too long.

1036
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:19,356
Come on, Sam.

1037
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:32,661
No!

1038
01:45:32,828 --> 01:45:35,497
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1039
01:45:37,249 --> 01:45:42,337
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1040
01:45:42,504 --> 01:45:45,382
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1041
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:50,136
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1042
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:52,389
The enemy?

1043
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:57,936
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1044
01:46:00,397 --> 01:46:02,524
You wonder what his name is...

1045
01:46:04,025 --> 01:46:06,278
...where he came from.

1046
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,699
And if he was really evil at heart.

1047
01:46:12,367 --> 01:46:15,829
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1048
01:46:17,414 --> 01:46:19,916
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1049
01:46:22,085 --> 01:46:23,628
...in peace.

1050
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:30,218
War will make corpses of us all.

1051
01:46:30,385 --> 01:46:32,429
Bind their hands.

1052
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:44,113
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1053
01:46:44,322 --> 01:46:47,950
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1054
01:46:48,117 --> 01:46:51,329
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1055
01:46:51,662 --> 01:46:53,581
It's the beards.

1056
01:46:53,831 --> 01:46:55,917
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1057
01:46:56,084 --> 01:46:58,961
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1058
01:46:59,128 --> 01:47:03,383
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1059
01:47:05,051 --> 01:47:06,427
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1060
01:47:13,017 --> 01:47:15,353
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1061
01:47:15,728 --> 01:47:17,730
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1062
01:47:19,649 --> 01:47:23,486
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1063
01:47:23,778 --> 01:47:26,531
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1064
01:47:26,697 --> 01:47:28,991
Cut down by Orcs.

1065
01:47:29,158 --> 01:47:32,161
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1066
01:47:32,787 --> 01:47:37,500
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1067
01:47:37,667 --> 01:47:42,213
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1068
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:54,559
Gimli.

1069
01:47:54,725 --> 01:47:56,811
No, I couldn't.

1070
01:47:56,978 --> 01:47:58,813
I really couldn't.

1071
01:48:03,317 --> 01:48:04,944
I made some stew.

1072
01:48:05,111 --> 01:48:08,406
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1073
01:48:16,205 --> 01:48:18,249
Thank you.

1074
01:48:38,769 --> 01:48:41,314
- It's good.
- Really?

1075
01:48:45,276 --> 01:48:48,654
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1076
01:48:49,947 --> 01:48:54,035
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1077
01:48:54,452 --> 01:48:56,954
But he must be mistaken.

1078
01:48:57,163 --> 01:49:01,584
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1079
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:05,963
Then you must be at least 60.

1080
01:49:08,007 --> 01:49:09,592
Seventy?

1081
01:49:10,009 --> 01:49:11,677
But you cannot be 80!

1082
01:49:15,014 --> 01:49:16,390
Eighty-seven.

1083
01:49:19,477 --> 01:49:21,604
You are one of the Dúnedain.

1084
01:49:22,647 --> 01:49:25,775
A descendant of Númenor,
blessed with long life.

1085
01:49:26,984 --> 01:49:29,612
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1086
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:32,031
There are few of us left.

1087
01:49:32,198 --> 01:49:35,034
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1088
01:49:35,785 --> 01:49:39,205
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1089
01:49:53,844 --> 01:49:58,015
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

1090
01:49:58,766 --> 01:50:02,228
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

1091
01:50:04,021 --> 01:50:06,440
<i>Like my heart.</i>

1092
01:50:07,858 --> 01:50:10,570
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

1093
01:50:10,736 --> 01:50:13,239
I am asleep.

1094
01:50:19,704 --> 01:50:21,664
This is a dream.

1095
01:50:23,874 --> 01:50:27,086
Then it is a good dream.

1096
01:50:39,098 --> 01:50:41,183
Sleep.

1097
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:07,793
You told me once...

1098
01:51:10,212 --> 01:51:12,423
this day would come.

1099
01:51:13,424 --> 01:51:16,052
This is not the end...it is the beginning.

1100
01:51:16,218 --> 01:51:18,387
You must go with Frodo.

1101
01:51:19,096 --> 01:51:21,223
That is your path.

1102
01:51:31,567 --> 01:51:34,278
My path is hidden from me.

1103
01:51:34,987 --> 01:51:38,574
It is already laid before your feet.

1104
01:51:38,741 --> 01:51:42,078
You cannot falter now.

1105
01:51:44,163 --> 01:51:46,082
Arwen...

1106
01:51:48,584 --> 01:51:50,878
If you trust nothing else...

1107
01:51:51,253 --> 01:51:53,297
trust this...

1108
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:56,592
trust us.

1109
01:52:35,548 --> 01:52:37,383
Where is she?

1110
01:52:38,551 --> 01:52:40,970
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1111
01:52:44,306 --> 01:52:47,059
<i>Our time here is ending.</i>

1112
01:52:47,727 --> 01:52:50,312
Arwen's time is ending.

1113
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:52,314
Let her go.

1114
01:52:52,481 --> 01:52:54,483
Let her take the ship into the west.

1115
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:57,737
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1116
01:52:57,903 --> 01:52:59,697
There it will be ever green.

1117
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:03,576
But never more than memory.

1118
01:53:04,827 --> 01:53:07,872
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1119
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:11,709
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1120
01:53:11,876 --> 01:53:14,211
She belongs with her people.

1121
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,560
Is this how you would take your leave?

1122
01:53:29,727 --> 01:53:32,897
Did you think you could slip away at
first light - unnoticed?

1123
01:53:35,733 --> 01:53:38,027
I will not be coming back.

1124
01:53:38,986 --> 01:53:40,780
You underestimate your skill in battle.

1125
01:53:40,946 --> 01:53:42,406
You will come back.

1126
01:53:42,573 --> 01:53:44,617
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

1127
01:53:44,784 --> 01:53:47,203
What do you speak of?

1128
01:53:52,416 --> 01:53:55,503
You have a chance for another life...

1129
01:53:57,463 --> 01:54:02,009
away from war...grief...despair.

1130
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:04,345
Why are you saying this?

1131
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:09,099
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1132
01:54:10,559 --> 01:54:13,229
It was a dream, Arwen.

1133
01:54:13,646 --> 01:54:15,022
Nothing more.

1134
01:54:16,398 --> 01:54:19,610
I don't believe you.

1135
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:30,454
This belongs to you.

1136
01:54:33,207 --> 01:54:34,792
It was a gift.

1137
01:54:37,461 --> 01:54:38,963
Keep it.

1138
01:54:41,465 --> 01:54:42,675
My lord?

1139
01:54:45,469 --> 01:54:50,057
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1140
01:55:13,497 --> 01:55:14,999
What is it?

1141
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,544
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

1142
01:55:35,102 --> 01:55:37,187
Wargs!

1143
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:51,368
A scout!

1144
01:55:57,708 --> 01:56:00,210
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1145
01:56:01,545 --> 01:56:03,756
Get them out of here!

1146
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:10,554
All riders to the head of the column.

1147
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:13,223
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1148
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:15,142
Come on!

1149
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:29,406
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1150
01:56:29,573 --> 01:56:31,075
- I can fight.
- No!

1151
01:56:33,744 --> 01:56:35,829
You must do this, for me.

1152
01:56:37,831 --> 01:56:39,416
Follow me! Hyah!

1153
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:47,257
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1154
01:56:47,424 --> 01:56:50,094
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1155
01:58:02,332 --> 01:58:04,626
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1156
01:58:07,421 --> 01:58:09,006
That one counts as mine!

1157
01:58:25,689 --> 01:58:27,316
Stinking creature.

1158
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:56,446
Aragorn!

1159
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:02,619
Aragorn?

1160
02:00:16,633 --> 02:00:19,553
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1161
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,138
He's...

1162
02:00:21,722 --> 02:00:23,307
...dead.

1163
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:26,852
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1164
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:31,773
You lie.

1165
02:01:05,682 --> 02:01:07,309
Get the wounded on horses.

1166
02:01:08,602 --> 02:01:11,772
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1167
02:01:12,189 --> 02:01:14,316
Leave the dead.

1168
02:01:21,698 --> 02:01:23,200
Come.

1169
02:01:33,377 --> 02:01:35,003
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1170
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:38,048
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1171
02:01:40,592 --> 02:01:42,427
We're safe!

1172
02:01:43,929 --> 02:01:46,807
We're safe, my lady.

1173
02:01:46,974 --> 02:01:48,183
Thank you.

1174
02:02:32,519 --> 02:02:33,937
- Mama!
- Éothain!

1175
02:02:34,104 --> 02:02:35,647
Freda!

1176
02:02:41,403 --> 02:02:44,239
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1177
02:02:48,076 --> 02:02:49,411
Take it to the caves.

1178
02:02:49,578 --> 02:02:52,414
Make way for the king.

1179
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:57,252
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1180
02:03:05,135 --> 02:03:08,889
So few. So few of you have returned.

1181
02:03:11,641 --> 02:03:13,935
Our people are safe.

1182
02:03:15,270 --> 02:03:17,814
We have paid for it with many lives.

1183
02:03:18,648 --> 02:03:20,192
My lady.

1184
02:03:23,904 --> 02:03:26,156
Lord Aragorn...

1185
02:03:26,323 --> 02:03:27,574
...where is he?

1186
02:03:29,576 --> 02:03:31,119
He fell.

1187
02:03:53,809 --> 02:03:56,770
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1188
02:03:56,937 --> 02:03:59,856
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1189
02:04:00,107 --> 02:04:03,193
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1190
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,987
Get them into the caves.

1191
02:04:06,863 --> 02:04:11,701
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1192
02:04:13,745 --> 02:04:17,165
<i>Helm's Deep has one weakness.</i>

1193
02:04:17,332 --> 02:04:19,668
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

1194
02:04:19,835 --> 02:04:22,921
<i>...but for a small culvert
at its base...</i>

1195
02:04:23,088 --> 02:04:25,882
<i>...which is little more than a drain.</i>

1196
02:04:28,718 --> 02:04:32,889
How? How can fire undo stone?

1197
02:04:33,056 --> 02:04:37,602
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1198
02:04:41,231 --> 02:04:45,235
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1199
02:04:45,402 --> 02:04:48,905
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1200
02:04:49,072 --> 02:04:51,658
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1201
02:04:51,825 --> 02:04:53,243
Tens of thousands.

1202
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:57,497
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1203
02:05:09,426 --> 02:05:12,512
A new power is rising.

1204
02:05:12,679 --> 02:05:15,682
Its victory is at hand.

1205
02:05:21,354 --> 02:05:23,440
This night...

1206
02:05:23,857 --> 02:05:28,195
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1207
02:05:28,361 --> 02:05:31,698
March to Helm's Deep!

1208
02:05:31,865 --> 02:05:35,368
Leave none alive!

1209
02:05:37,871 --> 02:05:40,373
To war!

1210
02:05:44,294 --> 02:05:48,757
There will be no dawn for Men.

1211
02:06:05,941 --> 02:06:07,984
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1212
02:06:08,151 --> 02:06:11,321
There is always smoke rising...

1213
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:15,367
...from Isengard these days.

1214
02:06:15,617 --> 02:06:17,202
Isengard?

1215
02:06:17,410 --> 02:06:19,287
There was a time...

1216
02:06:19,621 --> 02:06:23,166
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1217
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:26,670
But now he has a mind of metal...

1218
02:06:27,337 --> 02:06:29,798
...and wheels.

1219
02:06:30,549 --> 02:06:35,053
He no longer cares for growing things.

1220
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:37,013
What is it?

1221
02:06:42,018 --> 02:06:44,229
It's Saruman's army.

1222
02:06:44,396 --> 02:06:45,981
The war has started.

1223
02:07:24,269 --> 02:07:28,648
<i>May the grace of the Valar
protect you.</i>

1224
02:08:00,930 --> 02:08:02,807
Brego.

1225
02:08:28,917 --> 02:08:30,085
Arwen.

1226
02:08:31,419 --> 02:08:33,296
It is time.

1227
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:39,219
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.

1228
02:08:39,969 --> 02:08:41,763
I have made my choice.

1229
02:08:48,186 --> 02:08:51,064
He is not coming back.

1230
02:08:52,482 --> 02:08:55,819
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1231
02:08:56,736 --> 02:08:59,739
There is still hope.

1232
02:09:03,868 --> 02:09:07,664
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1233
02:09:11,042 --> 02:09:14,003
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1234
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:16,673
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

1235
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:21,553
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1236
02:09:21,845 --> 02:09:24,848
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1237
02:09:25,014 --> 02:09:27,934
...Aragorn will die.

1238
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:33,356
<i>And there will be no comfort
for you...</i>

1239
02:09:33,523 --> 02:09:37,736
<i>...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.</i>

1240
02:09:40,530 --> 02:09:43,283
<i>He will come to death...</i>

1241
02:09:43,450 --> 02:09:46,035
<i>...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...</i>

1242
02:09:46,202 --> 02:09:50,874
<i>...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.</i>

1243
02:09:59,966 --> 02:10:03,928
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

1244
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:09,768
<i>...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...</i>

1245
02:10:09,934 --> 02:10:14,022
<i>...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.</i>

1246
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:18,818
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

1247
02:10:18,985 --> 02:10:23,907
<i>...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...</i>

1248
02:10:25,617 --> 02:10:27,619
<i>...until all the world is changed...</i>

1249
02:10:27,786 --> 02:10:32,290
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1250
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:42,008
Arwen.

1251
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:50,934
There is nothing for you here...

1252
02:10:51,601 --> 02:10:53,686
...only death.

1253
02:11:14,457 --> 02:11:17,627
Do I not also have your love?

1254
02:11:19,212 --> 02:11:20,964
You have my love, father.

1255
02:12:27,113 --> 02:12:30,742
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.</i>

1256
02:12:30,909 --> 02:12:33,536
<i>Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...</i>

1257
02:12:33,703 --> 02:12:37,165
<i>...to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

1258
02:12:39,208 --> 02:12:42,879
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

1259
02:12:47,175 --> 02:12:50,553
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...</i>

1260
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:54,682
<i>...the last free kingdom of Men.</i>

1261
02:12:54,849 --> 02:12:59,228
<i>His war on this country
will come swiftly.</i>

1262
02:13:02,941 --> 02:13:06,069
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

1263
02:13:06,235 --> 02:13:09,697
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.</i>

1264
02:13:09,864 --> 02:13:13,910
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...</i>

1265
02:13:15,453 --> 02:13:19,332
...the quest will claim his life.

1266
02:13:19,499 --> 02:13:21,668
You know this.

1267
02:13:22,251 --> 02:13:25,088
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

1268
02:13:27,215 --> 02:13:30,677
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

1269
02:13:35,056 --> 02:13:39,268
<i>In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.</i>

1270
02:13:40,436 --> 02:13:44,857
<i>It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.</i>

1271
02:13:45,024 --> 02:13:50,488
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.</i>

1272
02:13:50,697 --> 02:13:54,283
<i>The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...</i>

1273
02:13:54,450 --> 02:13:58,538
<i>...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.</i>

1274
02:14:00,957 --> 02:14:02,792
<i>It is close now.</i>

1275
02:14:02,959 --> 02:14:07,213
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

1276
02:14:10,299 --> 02:14:13,970
<i>For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...</i>

1277
02:14:14,137 --> 02:14:18,266
<i>...even unto the ending
of the world.</i>

1278
02:14:20,101 --> 02:14:21,936
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

1279
02:14:22,145 --> 02:14:24,063
<i>...is over.</i>

1280
02:14:24,897 --> 02:14:28,484
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?</i>

1281
02:14:30,445 --> 02:14:33,698
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

1282
02:14:38,327 --> 02:14:39,662
What news?

1283
02:14:39,829 --> 02:14:42,665
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1284
02:14:42,832 --> 02:14:45,668
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1285
02:14:45,835 --> 02:14:49,881
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1286
02:14:50,048 --> 02:14:52,467
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1287
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,927
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1288
02:14:55,094 --> 02:14:58,514
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1289
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:03,186
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1290
02:15:03,352 --> 02:15:06,397
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1291
02:15:08,524 --> 02:15:10,693
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1292
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:13,571
Sauron from Mordor.

1293
02:15:14,864 --> 02:15:18,117
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1294
02:15:18,284 --> 02:15:19,994
Gondor is weak.

1295
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:23,289
Sauron will strike us soon.

1296
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:25,875
And he will strike hard.

1297
02:15:26,334 --> 02:15:30,421
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1298
02:15:44,352 --> 02:15:46,562
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1299
02:15:46,729 --> 02:15:49,482
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1300
02:15:49,649 --> 02:15:51,901
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1301
02:15:58,783 --> 02:16:00,535
Speak.

1302
02:16:01,619 --> 02:16:04,247
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1303
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:07,583
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1304
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,544
Your bodyguard?

1305
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:11,504
His gardener.

1306
02:16:12,088 --> 02:16:14,090
And where is your skulking friend?

1307
02:16:15,591 --> 02:16:17,927
That gangrel creature.

1308
02:16:18,261 --> 02:16:20,221
He had an ill-favored look.

1309
02:16:21,931 --> 02:16:23,850
There was no other.

1310
02:16:27,937 --> 02:16:30,273
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1311
02:16:33,609 --> 02:16:36,696
One we lost in Moria...

1312
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:39,282
...two were my kin...

1313
02:16:39,448 --> 02:16:43,202
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1314
02:16:43,369 --> 02:16:47,290
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1315
02:16:52,295 --> 02:16:54,046
You're a friend of Boromir?

1316
02:16:56,465 --> 02:16:57,967
Yes.

1317
02:16:59,051 --> 02:17:00,136
For my part.

1318
02:17:06,642 --> 02:17:09,604
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1319
02:17:11,647 --> 02:17:13,107
Dead?

1320
02:17:13,274 --> 02:17:15,318
How? When?

1321
02:17:15,568 --> 02:17:18,237
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1322
02:17:18,529 --> 02:17:22,366
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1323
02:17:25,119 --> 02:17:31,584
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1324
02:17:31,792 --> 02:17:34,879
It was cloven in two.

1325
02:17:36,547 --> 02:17:39,967
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1326
02:17:42,011 --> 02:17:43,804
He was my brother.

1327
02:18:32,687 --> 02:18:35,731
Boromir!

1328
02:18:36,232 --> 02:18:38,109
Boromir!

1329
02:18:42,363 --> 02:18:46,117
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1330
02:18:46,284 --> 02:18:49,954
A place of light and beauty and music.

1331
02:18:50,121 --> 02:18:52,456
And so it shall be once more!

1332
02:18:55,001 --> 02:18:57,670
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1333
02:18:57,837 --> 02:19:02,216
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1334
02:19:06,012 --> 02:19:11,684
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1335
02:19:12,059 --> 02:19:14,020
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1336
02:19:14,186 --> 02:19:17,023
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1337
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:28,492
Good speech. Nice and short.

1338
02:19:28,659 --> 02:19:31,579
Leaves more time for drinking!

1339
02:19:31,871 --> 02:19:36,125
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1340
02:19:39,587 --> 02:19:41,756
Remember today, little brother.

1341
02:19:41,922 --> 02:19:44,925
Today, life is good.

1342
02:19:49,096 --> 02:19:50,681
What?

1343
02:19:51,057 --> 02:19:52,516
He's here.

1344
02:19:55,728 --> 02:19:58,773
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?

1345
02:19:58,939 --> 02:20:02,401
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1346
02:20:02,943 --> 02:20:04,653
Father!

1347
02:20:09,492 --> 02:20:11,869
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1348
02:20:12,036 --> 02:20:15,456
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1349
02:20:16,916 --> 02:20:19,835
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1350
02:20:20,628 --> 02:20:22,922
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1351
02:20:23,089 --> 02:20:25,132
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1352
02:20:25,299 --> 02:20:27,009
Oh, too few.

1353
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:29,887
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1354
02:20:32,098 --> 02:20:35,184
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1355
02:20:35,351 --> 02:20:37,603
That is not my intent.

1356
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:41,524
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1357
02:20:44,902 --> 02:20:47,822
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1358
02:20:47,988 --> 02:20:50,741
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1359
02:20:50,908 --> 02:20:54,537
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1360
02:20:55,704 --> 02:20:58,124
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1361
02:20:58,290 --> 02:21:01,168
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1362
02:21:01,335 --> 02:21:05,131
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1363
02:21:07,341 --> 02:21:09,635
The One Ring.

1364
02:21:12,388 --> 02:21:17,059
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1365
02:21:17,226 --> 02:21:20,855
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1366
02:21:21,021 --> 02:21:25,151
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1367
02:21:26,944 --> 02:21:29,613
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1368
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:33,492
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1369
02:21:33,659 --> 02:21:37,621
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1370
02:21:37,788 --> 02:21:43,085
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1371
02:21:43,252 --> 02:21:48,340
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1372
02:21:48,507 --> 02:21:50,009
He will return.

1373
02:21:50,176 --> 02:21:53,929
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1374
02:21:54,096 --> 02:21:56,640
You must go.

1375
02:21:57,808 --> 02:21:59,935
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1376
02:22:00,769 --> 02:22:06,275
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1377
02:22:06,442 --> 02:22:10,112
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1378
02:22:10,279 --> 02:22:13,282
- ...send me in his stead.
- You?

1379
02:22:14,450 --> 02:22:16,368
Oh, I see.

1380
02:22:16,535 --> 02:22:20,748
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1381
02:22:21,165 --> 02:22:23,167
I think not.

1382
02:22:23,334 --> 02:22:26,212
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1383
02:22:26,378 --> 02:22:29,298
The one who will not fail me.

1384
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:49,610
Remember today, little brother.

1385
02:23:07,962 --> 02:23:09,964
Captain Faramir!

1386
02:23:11,215 --> 02:23:13,342
We found the third one.

1387
02:23:24,853 --> 02:23:26,855
You must come with me. Now.

1388
02:23:38,075 --> 02:23:39,201
Down there.

1389
02:23:54,091 --> 02:23:56,969
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1390
02:24:07,563 --> 02:24:09,064
They wait for my command.

1391
02:24:14,570 --> 02:24:15,654
Shall I shoot?

1392
02:24:16,905 --> 02:24:19,908
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

1393
02:24:20,075 --> 02:24:21,910
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1394
02:24:22,578 --> 02:24:25,539
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

1395
02:24:25,706 --> 02:24:28,417
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1396
02:24:35,424 --> 02:24:36,800
Wait.

1397
02:24:38,302 --> 02:24:41,138
This creature is bound to me.

1398
02:24:41,764 --> 02:24:43,682
And I to him.

1399
02:24:46,935 --> 02:24:48,270
He is our guide.

1400
02:24:52,983 --> 02:24:54,401
Please...

1401
02:24:54,568 --> 02:24:56,445
...let me go down to him.

1402
02:25:07,706 --> 02:25:09,375
Sméagol.

1403
02:25:10,376 --> 02:25:12,628
Master is here.

1404
02:25:13,796 --> 02:25:14,963
Come, Sméagol.

1405
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:20,469
Trust master. Come.

1406
02:25:23,639 --> 02:25:27,476
We must go now?

1407
02:25:27,810 --> 02:25:31,271
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1408
02:25:31,438 --> 02:25:32,815
Follow me. Come on.

1409
02:25:34,024 --> 02:25:35,651
Come.

1410
02:25:38,153 --> 02:25:39,321
Come, Sméagol.

1411
02:25:39,822 --> 02:25:41,907
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1412
02:25:42,408 --> 02:25:43,951
Come on.

1413
02:25:48,330 --> 02:25:49,998
Don't hurt him!

1414
02:25:50,165 --> 02:25:52,918
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1415
02:25:53,085 --> 02:25:54,378
Master!

1416
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:21,947
That's enough.

1417
02:26:25,576 --> 02:26:27,745
Where are you leading them?

1418
02:26:29,538 --> 02:26:31,206
Answer me.

1419
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:35,252
Sméagol.

1420
02:26:38,714 --> 02:26:43,469
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1421
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:47,347
Cruel Men hurts us.

1422
02:26:47,514 --> 02:26:50,517
Master tricksed us.

1423
02:26:50,684 --> 02:26:54,229
Of course he did.

1424
02:26:54,605 --> 02:26:58,317
I told you he was tricksy.

1425
02:26:58,484 --> 02:27:01,528
I told you he was false.

1426
02:27:01,695 --> 02:27:04,406
Master is our friend.

1427
02:27:04,573 --> 02:27:06,909
Our friend.

1428
02:27:07,075 --> 02:27:09,244
Master betrayed us.

1429
02:27:09,411 --> 02:27:12,414
No. Not its business.

1430
02:27:13,499 --> 02:27:15,918
Leave us alone!

1431
02:27:16,084 --> 02:27:18,504
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1432
02:27:18,670 --> 02:27:20,964
They stole it from us!

1433
02:27:21,131 --> 02:27:22,591
No. No.

1434
02:27:23,133 --> 02:27:24,760
What did they steal?

1435
02:27:26,929 --> 02:27:32,267
My precious!

1436
02:27:35,938 --> 02:27:37,606
We have to get out of here.

1437
02:27:38,190 --> 02:27:40,150
You go. Go, now.

1438
02:27:42,778 --> 02:27:44,613
You can do it.

1439
02:27:46,073 --> 02:27:47,533
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1440
02:27:47,699 --> 02:27:49,493
Just this once.

1441
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:51,453
Put it on.

1442
02:27:51,870 --> 02:27:53,914
Disappear.

1443
02:27:54,957 --> 02:27:56,041
I can't.

1444
02:27:59,127 --> 02:28:01,338
You were right, Sam.

1445
02:28:02,798 --> 02:28:05,300
You tried to tell me but...

1446
02:28:09,972 --> 02:28:12,140
I'm sorry.

1447
02:28:16,687 --> 02:28:19,565
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1448
02:28:20,983 --> 02:28:22,651
If I put it on...

1449
02:28:22,818 --> 02:28:25,153
...he'll find me.

1450
02:28:26,822 --> 02:28:28,782
He'll see.

1451
02:28:29,992 --> 02:28:31,994
Mr. Frodo...

1452
02:28:36,915 --> 02:28:41,169
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1453
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:46,383
Here in the Wild I have you...

1454
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:48,468
...two Halflings...

1455
02:28:48,635 --> 02:28:51,805
...and a host of men at my call.

1456
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:58,604
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1457
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:12,034
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1458
02:29:13,619 --> 02:29:16,663
...to show his quality.

1459
02:29:37,768 --> 02:29:39,394
No!

1460
02:29:42,564 --> 02:29:43,899
Stop it!

1461
02:29:44,066 --> 02:29:45,108
Leave him alone.

1462
02:29:46,443 --> 02:29:48,946
Don't you understand?

1463
02:29:50,238 --> 02:29:52,157
He's got to destroy it!

1464
02:29:52,324 --> 02:29:55,577
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1465
02:29:55,744 --> 02:29:57,412
To the Mountain of Fire!

1466
02:29:58,455 --> 02:30:01,583
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1467
02:30:01,750 --> 02:30:04,753
Please. It's such a burden.

1468
02:30:06,922 --> 02:30:09,007
Will you not help him?

1469
02:30:10,342 --> 02:30:12,260
Captain?

1470
02:30:12,928 --> 02:30:15,138
Prepare to leave.

1471
02:30:20,102 --> 02:30:22,521
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1472
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:38,180
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1473
02:31:38,346 --> 02:31:41,391
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1474
02:31:41,558 --> 02:31:45,353
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1475
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:49,524
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1476
02:31:50,192 --> 02:31:51,693
Bless you, laddie.

1477
02:31:52,277 --> 02:31:54,029
Gimli, where is the king?

1478
02:32:03,038 --> 02:32:04,081
You're late.

1479
02:32:07,793 --> 02:32:09,127
You look terrible.

1480
02:32:50,877 --> 02:32:52,921
A great host, you say?

1481
02:32:53,088 --> 02:32:54,548
All Isengard is emptied.

1482
02:32:54,714 --> 02:32:55,757
How many?

1483
02:32:56,424 --> 02:32:59,427
Ten thousand strong at least.

1484
02:33:00,971 --> 02:33:02,430
Ten thousand?

1485
02:33:02,848 --> 02:33:05,350
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1486
02:33:08,019 --> 02:33:10,147
To destroy the world of Men.

1487
02:33:12,649 --> 02:33:14,651
They will be here by nightfall.

1488
02:33:20,490 --> 02:33:21,783
Let them come!

1489
02:33:23,285 --> 02:33:26,079
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1490
02:33:26,246 --> 02:33:29,374
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1491
02:33:37,632 --> 02:33:40,552
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1492
02:33:40,719 --> 02:33:43,138
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1493
02:33:43,305 --> 02:33:46,057
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1494
02:33:46,224 --> 02:33:48,643
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1495
02:33:49,227 --> 02:33:51,438
These are Uruk-hai.

1496
02:33:51,605 --> 02:33:55,025
Their Armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1497
02:33:56,651 --> 02:34:00,322
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1498
02:34:00,488 --> 02:34:04,117
I know how to defend my own keep.

1499
02:34:10,707 --> 02:34:14,127
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1500
02:34:14,294 --> 02:34:19,507
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1501
02:34:19,716 --> 02:34:22,385
Crops can be resown...

1502
02:34:22,552 --> 02:34:25,555
...homes rebuilt.

1503
02:34:26,181 --> 02:34:28,725
Within these walls...

1504
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:30,602
...we will outlast them.

1505
02:34:30,769 --> 02:34:33,188
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1506
02:34:33,355 --> 02:34:34,898
They come to destroy its people...

1507
02:34:35,065 --> 02:34:37,567
...down to the last child.

1508
02:34:38,443 --> 02:34:40,695
What would you have me do?

1509
02:34:40,862 --> 02:34:42,614
Look at my men.

1510
02:34:42,781 --> 02:34:44,532
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1511
02:34:46,701 --> 02:34:51,122
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1512
02:34:51,289 --> 02:34:54,334
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1513
02:34:57,963 --> 02:34:59,881
Send out riders, my lord.

1514
02:35:00,173 --> 02:35:03,051
You must call for aid.

1515
02:35:06,304 --> 02:35:08,556
And who will come?

1516
02:35:08,974 --> 02:35:10,558
Elves?

1517
02:35:10,725 --> 02:35:12,811
Dwarves?

1518
02:35:13,561 --> 02:35:16,439
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1519
02:35:17,274 --> 02:35:19,567
The old alliances are dead.

1520
02:35:19,985 --> 02:35:22,779
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1521
02:35:22,946 --> 02:35:25,156
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1522
02:35:26,116 --> 02:35:29,369
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1523
02:35:29,536 --> 02:35:31,454
Where was Gon--?

1524
02:35:34,124 --> 02:35:36,084
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1525
02:35:37,669 --> 02:35:40,130
...we are alone.

1526
02:35:47,012 --> 02:35:48,763
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1527
02:35:48,930 --> 02:35:50,181
We need more time
to lay provisions--

1528
02:35:50,348 --> 02:35:53,852
There is no time. War is upon us.

1529
02:35:54,102 --> 02:35:55,812
Secure the gate.

1530
02:36:01,026 --> 02:36:03,111
We Ents have not troubled...

1531
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:06,698
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1532
02:36:07,449 --> 02:36:10,452
...for a very long time.

1533
02:36:11,703 --> 02:36:16,458
But now, something
is about to happen...

1534
02:36:16,624 --> 02:36:18,960
...that has not happened...

1535
02:36:19,169 --> 02:36:21,629
...for an age.

1536
02:36:22,839 --> 02:36:25,133
Entmoot.

1537
02:36:25,508 --> 02:36:26,551
What's that?

1538
02:36:26,968 --> 02:36:29,804
'Tis a gathering.

1539
02:36:30,972 --> 02:36:33,558
A gathering of what?

1540
02:36:51,493 --> 02:36:53,828
Beech. Oak.

1541
02:36:53,995 --> 02:36:55,914
Chestnut. Ash.

1542
02:36:56,164 --> 02:36:58,166
Good. Good. Good.

1543
02:36:58,333 --> 02:37:00,668
Many have come.

1544
02:37:08,218 --> 02:37:11,012
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1545
02:37:11,179 --> 02:37:13,723
...will go to war.

1546
02:37:22,690 --> 02:37:25,735
Move back! Move to the caves!

1547
02:37:28,196 --> 02:37:30,281
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1548
02:37:30,698 --> 02:37:32,992
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1549
02:37:33,159 --> 02:37:35,453
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1550
02:37:35,620 --> 02:37:38,748
Aragorn, you must rest.

1551
02:37:38,915 --> 02:37:40,417
You're no use to us half alive.

1552
02:37:41,793 --> 02:37:43,002
Aragorn!

1553
02:37:46,381 --> 02:37:49,426
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1554
02:37:49,592 --> 02:37:51,261
That is an honorable charge.

1555
02:37:51,428 --> 02:37:54,305
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1556
02:37:54,472 --> 02:37:56,182
What renown is there in that?

1557
02:37:56,349 --> 02:38:00,061
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1558
02:38:00,311 --> 02:38:03,106
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1559
02:38:03,273 --> 02:38:08,278
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1560
02:38:08,570 --> 02:38:11,406
You do not command
the others to stay!

1561
02:38:11,573 --> 02:38:15,326
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1562
02:38:16,494 --> 02:38:18,705
Because they love you.

1563
02:38:25,795 --> 02:38:27,338
I'm sorry.

1564
02:39:33,238 --> 02:39:36,533
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1565
02:39:37,617 --> 02:39:39,410
These are no soldiers.

1566
02:39:41,663 --> 02:39:45,166
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1567
02:39:49,087 --> 02:39:52,006
Look at them. They're frightened.

1568
02:39:52,173 --> 02:39:53,633
I can see it in their eyes.

1569
02:39:58,846 --> 02:40:00,848
And they should be...

1570
02:40:01,015 --> 02:40:04,143
Three hundred... against ten thousand!

1571
02:40:05,853 --> 02:40:07,939
They have more hope of
defending themselves here than at Edoras...

1572
02:40:08,106 --> 02:40:09,357
Aragorn.

1573
02:40:09,524 --> 02:40:12,193
They cannot win this fight.

1574
02:40:13,111 --> 02:40:14,404
They are all going to die!

1575
02:40:14,571 --> 02:40:16,781
Then I shall die as one of them!

1576
02:40:23,204 --> 02:40:25,039
Let him go, lad.

1577
02:40:25,623 --> 02:40:27,542
Let him be.

1578
02:40:29,043 --> 02:40:34,549
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1579
02:40:38,803 --> 02:40:40,722
My lord?

1580
02:40:42,765 --> 02:40:45,351
Who am I, Gamling?

1581
02:40:48,730 --> 02:40:52,609
You are our king, sire.

1582
02:40:55,612 --> 02:40:58,906
And do you trust your king?

1583
02:41:00,408 --> 02:41:03,578
Your men, my lord...

1584
02:41:03,745 --> 02:41:06,581
...will follow you to whatever end.

1585
02:41:13,421 --> 02:41:15,340
To whatever end.

1586
02:41:25,183 --> 02:41:28,770
Where is the horse and the rider?

1587
02:41:28,936 --> 02:41:31,981
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1588
02:41:33,483 --> 02:41:37,945
<i>They have passed like rain
on the mountains.</i>

1589
02:41:38,946 --> 02:41:42,158
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

1590
02:41:45,828 --> 02:41:49,624
The days have gone down in the West...

1591
02:41:50,291 --> 02:41:52,960
<i>...behind the hills...</i>

1592
02:41:54,837 --> 02:41:56,464
<i>...into Shadow.</i>

1593
02:42:04,931 --> 02:42:08,351
How did it come to this?

1594
02:42:24,659 --> 02:42:26,285
Huh?

1595
02:42:29,664 --> 02:42:31,499
It's been going for hours.

1596
02:42:32,667 --> 02:42:35,086
They must have decided something
by now.

1597
02:42:35,253 --> 02:42:39,340
Decided? No.

1598
02:42:39,507 --> 02:42:44,679
We only just finished saying...

1599
02:42:45,847 --> 02:42:47,724
...good morning.

1600
02:42:49,058 --> 02:42:52,270
But it's nighttime already.

1601
02:42:52,437 --> 02:42:54,230
You can't take forever.

1602
02:42:55,231 --> 02:42:57,316
Don't be hasty.

1603
02:42:57,734 --> 02:43:00,153
We're running out of time!

1604
02:43:03,197 --> 02:43:06,117
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1605
02:43:23,676 --> 02:43:25,011
Give me your sword.

1606
02:43:34,479 --> 02:43:35,688
What is your name?

1607
02:43:36,230 --> 02:43:38,566
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1608
02:43:40,735 --> 02:43:43,362
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1609
02:43:45,323 --> 02:43:47,283
They say that it is hopeless.

1610
02:44:05,092 --> 02:44:06,761
This is a good sword.

1611
02:44:08,763 --> 02:44:11,098
Haleth, son of Háma...

1612
02:44:15,436 --> 02:44:17,605
...there is always hope.

1613
02:44:40,586 --> 02:44:43,965
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1614
02:44:44,131 --> 02:44:45,675
Forgive me.

1615
02:44:45,842 --> 02:44:47,301
I was wrong to despair.

1616
02:44:50,471 --> 02:44:52,974
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1617
02:44:56,143 --> 02:44:59,313
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1618
02:45:02,733 --> 02:45:04,819
It's a little tight across the chest.

1619
02:45:10,992 --> 02:45:12,952
That is no Orc horn.

1620
02:45:18,624 --> 02:45:20,459
Send for the king.

1621
02:45:20,626 --> 02:45:24,213
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1622
02:45:55,870 --> 02:45:57,538
How is this possible?

1623
02:45:58,539 --> 02:46:02,209
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1624
02:46:02,376 --> 02:46:05,588
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1625
02:46:06,297 --> 02:46:10,551
Long ago we fought and died together.

1626
02:46:12,803 --> 02:46:15,723
We come to honor that allegiance.

1627
02:46:24,190 --> 02:46:26,108
You are most welcome.

1628
02:46:31,489 --> 02:46:35,284
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1629
02:47:09,068 --> 02:47:12,321
You could have picked a better spot.

1630
02:47:17,159 --> 02:47:21,372
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1631
02:47:27,503 --> 02:47:29,296
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1632
02:47:29,922 --> 02:47:32,425
Let's hope they last the night.

1633
02:48:32,401 --> 02:48:36,155
Show them no mercy...

1634
02:48:37,156 --> 02:48:39,450
for you shall receive none!

1635
02:49:13,859 --> 02:49:16,695
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1636
02:49:17,947 --> 02:49:19,740
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1637
02:49:59,238 --> 02:50:00,447
HOLD!

1638
02:50:22,928 --> 02:50:24,763
So it begins.

1639
02:50:30,644 --> 02:50:31,812
Prepare to fire!

1640
02:50:40,821 --> 02:50:43,032
Their Armour is weak at the neck...

1641
02:50:43,199 --> 02:50:44,700
and beneath the arm.

1642
02:50:44,909 --> 02:50:46,660
Release Arrows!

1643
02:50:51,624 --> 02:50:52,958
Did they hit anything?

1644
02:50:53,626 --> 02:50:55,628
Give them a volley.

1645
02:50:55,794 --> 02:50:57,922
- Fire!
- Fire!

1646
02:51:13,646 --> 02:51:15,314
Send them to me! Come on!

1647
02:51:34,875 --> 02:51:35,918
Ladders!

1648
02:51:36,126 --> 02:51:37,169
Good!

1649
02:51:43,968 --> 02:51:46,971
Swords! Swords!

1650
02:52:25,050 --> 02:52:27,177
Legolas! Two already!

1651
02:52:27,344 --> 02:52:29,471
I'm on 17!

1652
02:52:29,638 --> 02:52:32,224
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1653
02:52:39,023 --> 02:52:40,733
Nineteen!

1654
02:53:06,717 --> 02:53:08,135
Merry.

1655
02:53:12,556 --> 02:53:16,352
We have just agreed.

1656
02:53:26,362 --> 02:53:27,821
Yes?

1657
02:53:29,323 --> 02:53:33,494
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1658
02:53:34,620 --> 02:53:37,873
...and we have agreed...

1659
02:53:38,332 --> 02:53:42,378
...you are not Orcs.

1660
02:53:44,129 --> 02:53:46,256
Well, that's good news.

1661
02:53:46,423 --> 02:53:50,552
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1662
02:53:51,178 --> 02:53:54,973
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1663
02:53:55,140 --> 02:53:56,683
Hasty?

1664
02:53:57,476 --> 02:53:59,353
Our friends are out there.

1665
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:03,690
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1666
02:54:04,024 --> 02:54:06,318
War? Yes.

1667
02:54:06,485 --> 02:54:08,362
It affects us all.

1668
02:54:08,529 --> 02:54:11,532
Tree, root and twig.

1669
02:54:12,408 --> 02:54:16,453
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1670
02:54:16,662 --> 02:54:18,580
...it takes a long time...

1671
02:54:18,747 --> 02:54:23,669
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1672
02:54:23,836 --> 02:54:28,048
...and we never say anything...

1673
02:54:28,215 --> 02:54:32,136
...unless it is worth taking...

1674
02:54:32,302 --> 02:54:36,348
...a long time to say.

1675
02:54:37,141 --> 02:54:40,436
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1676
02:54:40,602 --> 02:54:41,687
Nineteen!

1677
02:54:42,229 --> 02:54:44,106
Twenty!

1678
02:54:44,273 --> 02:54:45,941
Twenty-one!

1679
02:54:56,034 --> 02:54:57,077
Causeway!

1680
02:55:05,794 --> 02:55:08,172
Is this it?

1681
02:55:08,338 --> 02:55:11,258
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

1682
02:55:37,659 --> 02:55:39,036
Bring him down, Legolas!

1683
02:55:42,372 --> 02:55:43,207
Kill him!

1684
02:55:43,373 --> 02:55:44,416
Kill him!

1685
02:56:37,261 --> 02:56:38,637
Brace the gate!

1686
02:56:56,947 --> 02:56:59,199
Hold them! Stand firm!

1687
02:57:07,082 --> 02:57:08,417
Aragorn!

1688
02:57:13,046 --> 02:57:14,256
Gimli!

1689
02:57:24,850 --> 02:57:25,934
Charge!

1690
02:58:03,013 --> 02:58:06,933
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1691
02:58:07,726 --> 02:58:11,730
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1692
02:58:12,564 --> 02:58:14,650
How can that be your decision?!

1693
02:58:15,317 --> 02:58:18,945
This is not our war.

1694
02:58:19,237 --> 02:58:21,448
But you're part of this world!

1695
02:58:25,577 --> 02:58:27,412
Aren't you?!

1696
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:33,877
You must help. Please.

1697
02:58:35,170 --> 02:58:37,923
You must do something.

1698
02:58:38,215 --> 02:58:42,511
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1699
02:58:43,720 --> 02:58:47,432
But your part in this tale is over.

1700
02:58:47,599 --> 02:58:49,851
Go back to your home.

1701
02:58:59,861 --> 02:59:02,114
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1702
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:04,157
We don't belong here, Merry.

1703
02:59:04,324 --> 02:59:06,618
It's too big for us.

1704
02:59:06,785 --> 02:59:09,454
What can we do in the end?

1705
02:59:11,748 --> 02:59:14,376
We've got the Shire.

1706
02:59:14,918 --> 02:59:17,462
Maybe we should go home.

1707
02:59:19,297 --> 02:59:22,509
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1708
02:59:22,676 --> 02:59:27,597
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1709
02:59:27,764 --> 02:59:29,349
And...

1710
02:59:31,143 --> 02:59:34,229
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1711
02:59:37,774 --> 02:59:40,694
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1712
03:00:00,213 --> 03:00:01,465
Aragorn!

1713
03:00:01,631 --> 03:00:04,009
Fall back to the Keep!

1714
03:00:04,176 --> 03:00:07,262
Get your men out of there!

1715
03:00:08,388 --> 03:00:09,890
To the Keep!

1716
03:00:14,728 --> 03:00:16,354
Pull back to the Keep!

1717
03:00:16,897 --> 03:00:18,565
Haldir!

1718
03:00:19,357 --> 03:00:20,817
To the Keep!

1719
03:00:22,694 --> 03:00:25,947
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1720
03:00:45,175 --> 03:00:46,384
Haldir!

1721
03:01:29,094 --> 03:01:30,595
Brace the gate!

1722
03:01:32,806 --> 03:01:34,099
Hold them!

1723
03:01:35,934 --> 03:01:39,312
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1724
03:02:07,465 --> 03:02:09,384
Make way!

1725
03:02:12,304 --> 03:02:14,014
We cannot hold much longer!

1726
03:02:19,978 --> 03:02:23,565
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1727
03:02:23,732 --> 03:02:26,318
As long as you can give me.

1728
03:02:26,484 --> 03:02:28,153
Gimli!

1729
03:02:29,613 --> 03:02:30,989
Timbers!

1730
03:02:31,156 --> 03:02:33,116
Brace the gate!

1731
03:02:47,881 --> 03:02:49,591
Come on. We can take them.

1732
03:02:50,425 --> 03:02:52,052
It's a long way.

1733
03:02:57,307 --> 03:02:59,059
Toss me.

1734
03:03:00,226 --> 03:03:02,062
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1735
03:03:02,228 --> 03:03:03,813
You'll have to toss me!

1736
03:03:09,402 --> 03:03:10,695
Don't tell the Elf.

1737
03:03:11,196 --> 03:03:12,989
Not a word.

1738
03:03:28,213 --> 03:03:29,673
Shore up the door!

1739
03:03:29,839 --> 03:03:31,925
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1740
03:03:32,092 --> 03:03:33,176
Watch our backs!

1741
03:03:37,305 --> 03:03:39,557
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1742
03:04:29,482 --> 03:04:30,900
Hold fast the gate!

1743
03:04:35,113 --> 03:04:38,074
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1744
03:04:42,787 --> 03:04:44,414
Aragorn!

1745
03:05:17,822 --> 03:05:20,283
Pull everybody back.

1746
03:05:20,658 --> 03:05:22,452
Pull them back.

1747
03:05:22,994 --> 03:05:24,454
Fall back!

1748
03:05:24,621 --> 03:05:27,123
Fall back!

1749
03:05:28,291 --> 03:05:29,876
They have broken through!

1750
03:05:30,043 --> 03:05:32,420
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1751
03:05:32,587 --> 03:05:34,839
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1752
03:05:35,006 --> 03:05:37,592
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1753
03:05:37,759 --> 03:05:40,011
Into the Keep!

1754
03:05:51,481 --> 03:05:56,444
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1755
03:05:56,611 --> 03:06:01,324
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1756
03:06:07,038 --> 03:06:08,331
Wait! Stop!

1757
03:06:09,207 --> 03:06:10,708
Stop!

1758
03:06:13,837 --> 03:06:15,547
Turn around.

1759
03:06:16,464 --> 03:06:19,175
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1760
03:06:19,342 --> 03:06:24,347
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1761
03:06:24,681 --> 03:06:27,392
Yes. Exactly.

1762
03:06:27,559 --> 03:06:30,770
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1763
03:06:30,937 --> 03:06:33,606
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1764
03:06:33,773 --> 03:06:35,775
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1765
03:06:38,403 --> 03:06:41,406
That doesn't make sense to me.

1766
03:06:41,573 --> 03:06:42,740
But then...

1767
03:06:42,907 --> 03:06:45,618
...you are very small.

1768
03:06:46,077 --> 03:06:47,871
Perhaps you're right.

1769
03:06:50,498 --> 03:06:52,041
South it is, then.

1770
03:06:53,543 --> 03:06:56,880
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1771
03:06:58,923 --> 03:07:01,676
I always like going south.

1772
03:07:01,843 --> 03:07:06,139
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1773
03:07:06,764 --> 03:07:09,225
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1774
03:07:09,392 --> 03:07:11,311
No, we won't.

1775
03:07:12,061 --> 03:07:14,314
Not this time.

1776
03:07:20,945 --> 03:07:21,988
Look!

1777
03:07:23,615 --> 03:07:26,075
Osgiliath burns!

1778
03:07:26,242 --> 03:07:27,660
Mordor has come.

1779
03:07:28,786 --> 03:07:31,206
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1780
03:07:32,540 --> 03:07:34,751
It has only the power to destroy.

1781
03:07:35,627 --> 03:07:37,086
Please...

1782
03:07:37,253 --> 03:07:38,880
...let me go.

1783
03:07:39,923 --> 03:07:41,507
Hurry.

1784
03:07:44,969 --> 03:07:46,387
Faramir!

1785
03:07:46,554 --> 03:07:48,890
You must let me go!

1786
03:07:49,474 --> 03:07:52,936
And those little family of field mice...

1787
03:07:53,102 --> 03:07:55,939
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1788
03:07:56,648 --> 03:07:59,984
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1789
03:08:11,162 --> 03:08:14,082
Many of these trees were my friends.

1790
03:08:14,791 --> 03:08:19,420
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1791
03:08:20,588 --> 03:08:21,798
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1792
03:08:21,965 --> 03:08:24,717
They had voices of their own.

1793
03:08:26,970 --> 03:08:29,514
Saruman.

1794
03:08:29,847 --> 03:08:32,934
A wizard should know better!

1795
03:08:47,198 --> 03:08:50,868
There is no curse in Elvish...

1796
03:08:51,035 --> 03:08:53,705
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1797
03:08:53,871 --> 03:08:56,207
...for this treachery.

1798
03:08:57,625 --> 03:09:00,461
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1799
03:09:05,174 --> 03:09:06,384
Where are they going?

1800
03:09:06,884 --> 03:09:10,138
They have business with the Orcs.

1801
03:09:10,596 --> 03:09:14,892
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1802
03:09:15,059 --> 03:09:17,687
...with rock and stone.

1803
03:09:41,586 --> 03:09:42,754
Yes.

1804
03:09:43,838 --> 03:09:45,256
Come, my friends.

1805
03:09:46,591 --> 03:09:50,803
The Ents are going to war.

1806
03:09:50,970 --> 03:09:52,764
It is likely...

1807
03:09:52,930 --> 03:09:56,434
...that we go to our doom.

1808
03:09:57,852 --> 03:10:00,313
Last march...

1809
03:10:00,855 --> 03:10:02,899
...of the Ents.

1810
03:10:50,988 --> 03:10:54,742
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1811
03:10:54,909 --> 03:10:56,994
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1812
03:10:59,747 --> 03:11:01,207
Mr. Frodo?

1813
03:11:01,499 --> 03:11:05,628
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1814
03:11:05,795 --> 03:11:08,297
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1815
03:11:22,603 --> 03:11:24,021
Take them to my father.

1816
03:11:25,565 --> 03:11:28,568
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1817
03:11:30,987 --> 03:11:34,031
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1818
03:11:35,199 --> 03:11:37,869
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1819
03:11:38,536 --> 03:11:41,289
You want to know
why your brother died?

1820
03:11:41,789 --> 03:11:45,543
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1821
03:11:45,710 --> 03:11:47,587
He tried to kill him!

1822
03:11:47,753 --> 03:11:50,089
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1823
03:11:50,882 --> 03:11:52,717
Watch out!

1824
03:12:03,644 --> 03:12:04,770
Mr. Frodo?

1825
03:12:07,398 --> 03:12:09,233
They're here.

1826
03:12:12,361 --> 03:12:14,822
They've come.

1827
03:12:17,408 --> 03:12:19,285
Nazgûl!

1828
03:12:41,432 --> 03:12:43,601
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1829
03:12:45,394 --> 03:12:47,605
Take cover!

1830
03:13:04,956 --> 03:13:06,499
The fortress is taken.

1831
03:13:07,291 --> 03:13:08,459
It is over.

1832
03:13:08,626 --> 03:13:12,588
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1833
03:13:12,755 --> 03:13:15,675
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1834
03:13:18,427 --> 03:13:19,804
They're breaking in!

1835
03:13:22,473 --> 03:13:24,976
They're past the door!

1836
03:13:28,312 --> 03:13:32,441
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1837
03:13:35,111 --> 03:13:37,029
Is there no other way?

1838
03:13:38,614 --> 03:13:41,659
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1839
03:13:42,326 --> 03:13:44,537
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1840
03:13:49,417 --> 03:13:51,836
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1841
03:13:52,003 --> 03:13:54,839
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1842
03:13:57,008 --> 03:14:00,428
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1843
03:14:05,099 --> 03:14:06,517
Ride out with me.

1844
03:14:10,646 --> 03:14:12,273
Ride out and meet them.

1845
03:14:13,024 --> 03:14:15,192
For death and glory.

1846
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:16,777
For Rohan.

1847
03:14:18,279 --> 03:14:19,739
For your people.

1848
03:14:20,489 --> 03:14:22,408
The sun is rising.

1849
03:14:26,912 --> 03:14:29,915
<i>Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.</i>

1850
03:14:30,082 --> 03:14:31,500
<i>At dawn...</i>

1851
03:14:31,667 --> 03:14:33,377
<i>...look to the east.</i>

1852
03:14:37,548 --> 03:14:39,216
Yes.

1853
03:14:41,677 --> 03:14:43,346
Yes.

1854
03:14:44,680 --> 03:14:47,058
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1855
03:14:47,224 --> 03:14:50,061
...shall sound in the Deep...

1856
03:14:50,478 --> 03:14:52,480
...one last time.

1857
03:14:52,647 --> 03:14:54,148
Yes!

1858
03:14:57,193 --> 03:15:00,988
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1859
03:15:08,746 --> 03:15:10,081
Fell deeds, awake.

1860
03:15:11,290 --> 03:15:12,416
Now for wrath...

1861
03:15:12,583 --> 03:15:15,961
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1862
03:15:23,010 --> 03:15:25,262
Forth Eorlingas!

1863
03:16:13,060 --> 03:16:14,311
Gandalf.

1864
03:16:21,569 --> 03:16:25,239
Théoden King stands alone.

1865
03:16:25,823 --> 03:16:27,992
Not alone.

1866
03:16:28,409 --> 03:16:29,535
Rohirrim!

1867
03:16:35,458 --> 03:16:36,625
Éomer.

1868
03:16:36,792 --> 03:16:39,336
To the king!

1869
03:17:56,914 --> 03:17:58,707
Yes!

1870
03:18:07,842 --> 03:18:11,136
A hit. A fine hit.

1871
03:18:35,828 --> 03:18:38,289
Break the dam!

1872
03:18:38,455 --> 03:18:41,917
Release the river!

1873
03:19:09,236 --> 03:19:11,989
Pippin! Hold on!

1874
03:19:17,244 --> 03:19:20,164
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1875
03:20:01,538 --> 03:20:03,540
What are you doing?

1876
03:20:12,132 --> 03:20:13,717
Where are you going?

1877
03:21:11,859 --> 03:21:13,193
It's me.

1878
03:21:15,696 --> 03:21:17,906
It's your Sam.

1879
03:21:22,244 --> 03:21:24,872
Don't you know your Sam?

1880
03:21:42,598 --> 03:21:45,976
I can't do this, Sam.

1881
03:21:46,852 --> 03:21:48,854
I know.

1882
03:21:49,855 --> 03:21:52,232
It's all wrong.

1883
03:21:52,983 --> 03:21:54,985
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1884
03:22:02,409 --> 03:22:04,495
But we are.

1885
03:22:10,918 --> 03:22:13,962
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1886
03:22:14,129 --> 03:22:16,507
The ones that really mattered.

1887
03:22:17,549 --> 03:22:20,552
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1888
03:22:20,719 --> 03:22:23,680
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1889
03:22:23,847 --> 03:22:26,809
...because how could the end be happy?

1890
03:22:29,353 --> 03:22:31,563
<i>How could the world go back
to the way it was...</i>

1891
03:22:31,730 --> 03:22:35,234
<i>...when so much bad had happened?</i>

1892
03:22:36,068 --> 03:22:37,986
Victory!

1893
03:22:38,153 --> 03:22:39,696
We have victory!

1894
03:22:39,863 --> 03:22:43,826
<i>But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...</i>

1895
03:22:43,992 --> 03:22:45,327
<i>...this shadow.</i>

1896
03:22:45,494 --> 03:22:47,871
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

1897
03:22:48,038 --> 03:22:50,749
<i>A new day will come.</i>

1898
03:22:50,916 --> 03:22:54,878
<i>And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.</i>

1899
03:22:56,797 --> 03:22:59,174
<i>Those were the stories
that stayed with you...</i>

1900
03:22:59,341 --> 03:23:01,093
<i>...that meant something.</i>

1901
03:23:01,260 --> 03:23:03,846
<i>Even if you were too small
to understand why.</i>

1902
03:23:05,222 --> 03:23:09,059
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

1903
03:23:09,226 --> 03:23:10,811
<i>I know now.</i>

1904
03:23:11,645 --> 03:23:13,856
Folk in those stories...

1905
03:23:14,022 --> 03:23:18,152
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1906
03:23:18,318 --> 03:23:20,571
They kept going...

1907
03:23:21,238 --> 03:23:24,491
...because they were holding
on to something.

1908
03:23:26,076 --> 03:23:28,412
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1909
03:23:40,340 --> 03:23:44,261
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1910
03:23:44,553 --> 03:23:47,181
And it's worth fighting for.

1911
03:24:14,082 --> 03:24:18,378
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1912
03:24:19,129 --> 03:24:23,091
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1913
03:24:23,258 --> 03:24:25,469
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1914
03:24:29,806 --> 03:24:31,225
Then it is forfeit.

1915
03:24:33,977 --> 03:24:35,771
Release them.

1916
03:24:47,824 --> 03:24:49,868
Stay out of the forest!

1917
03:24:50,035 --> 03:24:51,828
Keep away from the trees!

1918
03:25:42,671 --> 03:25:44,464
Final count...

1919
03:25:44,631 --> 03:25:47,551
- ...42.
- Forty-two?

1920
03:25:47,718 --> 03:25:53,765
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1921
03:25:54,558 --> 03:25:58,228
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1922
03:26:02,357 --> 03:26:05,652
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1923
03:26:06,403 --> 03:26:08,905
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1924
03:26:09,072 --> 03:26:13,702
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1925
03:26:15,996 --> 03:26:20,709
- He doesn't look happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1926
03:26:20,959 --> 03:26:24,504
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1927
03:26:24,671 --> 03:26:27,632
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1928
03:26:27,799 --> 03:26:30,635
I hear the staff are very good.

1929
03:26:36,308 --> 03:26:38,685
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1930
03:26:38,852 --> 03:26:43,106
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1931
03:26:43,273 --> 03:26:44,524
I'm starving.

1932
03:26:44,691 --> 03:26:47,778
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1933
03:26:47,944 --> 03:26:51,031
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1934
03:27:14,971 --> 03:27:17,391
Saruman's storeroom!

1935
03:27:19,726 --> 03:27:22,479
I don't believe it.

1936
03:27:22,646 --> 03:27:24,689
It can't be.

1937
03:27:25,315 --> 03:27:28,193
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1938
03:27:29,486 --> 03:27:31,822
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1939
03:27:32,155 --> 03:27:35,283
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1940
03:27:35,450 --> 03:27:36,576
Wait.

1941
03:27:37,327 --> 03:27:38,537
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1942
03:27:38,703 --> 03:27:40,247
Share it?

1943
03:27:42,082 --> 03:27:44,501
No. No.

1944
03:27:46,002 --> 03:27:47,337
Dead plant and all that.

1945
03:27:47,754 --> 03:27:49,923
Don't think he'd understand.

1946
03:27:51,174 --> 03:27:53,385
Could be a distant relative.

1947
03:27:54,177 --> 03:27:56,680
I get it.

1948
03:27:56,847 --> 03:27:59,683
Don't be hasty.

1949
03:28:00,767 --> 03:28:02,519
Exactly.

1950
03:28:03,603 --> 03:28:05,856
Bar-hrum.

1951
03:28:31,506 --> 03:28:32,799
This is the old sewer.

1952
03:28:32,966 --> 03:28:36,094
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1953
03:28:36,261 --> 03:28:38,013
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1954
03:28:39,055 --> 03:28:41,558
Captain Faramir...

1955
03:28:42,184 --> 03:28:44,019
...you have shown your quality, sir.

1956
03:28:46,521 --> 03:28:47,814
The very highest.

1957
03:28:48,315 --> 03:28:50,942
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

1958
03:28:51,109 --> 03:28:54,070
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

1959
03:28:55,238 --> 03:28:57,240
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1960
03:28:57,824 --> 03:28:59,409
Gollum says there's a path...

1961
03:28:59,576 --> 03:29:03,497
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1962
03:29:03,955 --> 03:29:05,707
Cirith Ungol?

1963
03:29:09,252 --> 03:29:11,796
- Is that its name?
- No.

1964
03:29:11,963 --> 03:29:13,632
No!

1965
03:29:14,466 --> 03:29:17,469
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1966
03:29:17,844 --> 03:29:21,389
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1967
03:29:22,265 --> 03:29:24,809
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1968
03:29:25,143 --> 03:29:31,441
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1969
03:29:32,943 --> 03:29:34,736
I must.

1970
03:29:38,281 --> 03:29:41,868
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1971
03:29:42,035 --> 03:29:44,079
Thank you.

1972
03:29:55,882 --> 03:30:00,011
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1973
03:30:12,482 --> 03:30:14,025
Come on, keep up.

1974
03:30:17,487 --> 03:30:20,282
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1975
03:30:20,907 --> 03:30:22,742
You know that, don't you?

1976
03:30:23,535 --> 03:30:25,120
He was trying to save you, see?

1977
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:27,163
Save me?

1978
03:30:27,497 --> 03:30:29,666
So there's no hard feelings.

1979
03:30:29,833 --> 03:30:34,963
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1980
03:30:35,130 --> 03:30:37,757
Gollum, Gollum.

1981
03:30:38,800 --> 03:30:40,552
Nice master.

1982
03:30:41,636 --> 03:30:44,472
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1983
03:30:44,639 --> 03:30:46,933
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1984
03:30:52,439 --> 03:30:57,652
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1985
03:31:04,784 --> 03:31:07,787
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1986
03:31:08,455 --> 03:31:12,000
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1987
03:31:17,130 --> 03:31:20,550
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1988
03:31:21,551 --> 03:31:24,763
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

1989
03:31:28,058 --> 03:31:31,478
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1990
03:31:31,645 --> 03:31:33,021
What?

1991
03:31:33,188 --> 03:31:37,150
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1992
03:31:37,317 --> 03:31:40,570
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1993
03:31:40,737 --> 03:31:43,698
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1994
03:31:43,865 --> 03:31:45,533
"Yes, my boy.

1995
03:31:45,700 --> 03:31:49,496
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1996
03:31:49,663 --> 03:31:52,207
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1997
03:31:52,374 --> 03:31:54,250
"Samwise the Brave."

1998
03:31:54,417 --> 03:31:57,170
I want to hear more about Sam.

1999
03:32:01,466 --> 03:32:04,469
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

2000
03:32:05,804 --> 03:32:09,849
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

2001
03:32:10,934 --> 03:32:12,310
So was I.

2002
03:32:21,194 --> 03:32:23,905
"Samwise the Brave."

2003
03:32:28,159 --> 03:32:29,494
Sméagol?

2004
03:32:29,661 --> 03:32:32,580
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

2005
03:32:32,747 --> 03:32:34,666
Master.

2006
03:32:34,833 --> 03:32:37,794
Master looks after us.

2007
03:32:38,586 --> 03:32:41,381
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2008
03:32:41,548 --> 03:32:44,008
Master broke his promise.

2009
03:32:44,175 --> 03:32:46,344
Don't ask Sméagol.

2010
03:32:46,511 --> 03:32:49,723
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2011
03:32:49,889 --> 03:32:52,726
Master betrayed us.

2012
03:32:52,892 --> 03:32:55,979
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2013
03:32:56,146 --> 03:33:00,066
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2014
03:33:00,233 --> 03:33:02,986
Kill him! Kill him!

2015
03:33:03,153 --> 03:33:04,654
Kill them both!

2016
03:33:04,821 --> 03:33:08,450
And then we take the precious...

2017
03:33:08,616 --> 03:33:12,162
...and we be the master!

2018
03:33:12,829 --> 03:33:15,498
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2019
03:33:15,665 --> 03:33:18,334
Eyes always watching.

2020
03:33:18,501 --> 03:33:22,046
Then we stabs them out.

2021
03:33:22,213 --> 03:33:26,718
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2022
03:33:26,885 --> 03:33:30,346
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2023
03:33:30,513 --> 03:33:33,224
Kill them both.

2024
03:33:33,391 --> 03:33:35,894
Yes. No! No!

2025
03:33:36,060 --> 03:33:39,773
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2026
03:33:40,482 --> 03:33:43,067
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2027
03:33:43,234 --> 03:33:45,862
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

2028
03:33:46,029 --> 03:33:51,409
We could let her do it.

2029
03:33:52,368 --> 03:33:56,539
Yes. She could do it.

2030
03:33:56,706 --> 03:34:01,252
Yes, precious, she could.

2031
03:34:01,419 --> 03:34:07,467
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2032
03:34:08,384 --> 03:34:10,136
Once they're dead.

2033
03:34:10,303 --> 03:34:12,305
Shh.

2034
03:34:15,642 --> 03:34:19,354
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2035
03:34:19,521 --> 03:34:21,564
Sméagol will show you the way.

2036
03:34:21,731 --> 03:34:23,983
Follow me.
