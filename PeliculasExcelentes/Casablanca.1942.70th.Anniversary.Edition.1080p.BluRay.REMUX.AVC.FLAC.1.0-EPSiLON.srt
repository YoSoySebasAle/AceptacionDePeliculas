Narrator: With the coming
of the Second World War...

2
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,696
... many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

3
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,707
... toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,578
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:27,959
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,044
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,718
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,394
... across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:55,195
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

10
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,897
... to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,655
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

12
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,331
... might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,951
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,337
But the others wait in Casablanca.

good luck with your roulette wheel.

172
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,562
Just a moment.

173
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:27,781
I heard a rumor those two German
couriers were carrying letters of transit.

174
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,497
Huh?

175
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:34,036
Oh. I've heard that
rumor too. Poor devils.

176
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,203
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

197
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,875
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

198
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,541
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

199
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,966
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

200
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,723
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

201
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,052
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

202
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,187
In refugees alone
we could make a fortune...

203
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,307
...if you'd work with me
in the black market.

204
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,892
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

205
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,151
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

206
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,403
Suppose we do.

207
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,981
When will you realize
that in this world today...

208
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,575
...isolationism is no longer
a practical policy?

209
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,499
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

210
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,744
Oh, I like it fine here.

211
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,369
He'll double what I pay you.

212
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,828
I ain't got time to spend
what I make here.

213
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,296
Sorry.

214
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,468

215

...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

216
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:54,263
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

217
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,466
Uh-oh.

218
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,679
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.

219
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,609
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

220
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,109
Where were you last night?

221
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,572
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

222
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,244
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

223
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,784
Give me another.

224
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,710
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

225
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,085
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

226
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,788
- Rick, I'm tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

227
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,338
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

228
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,083
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

229
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,515
Hey, taxi.

230
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,390
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

231
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,306
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

232
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,520
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

233
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,361
- And come right back.
- Yes, boss.

234
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,823
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,288
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

236
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,161
Someday they may be scarce.

237
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,627
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

238
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,416
Maybe get her on the rebound.

239
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,713
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

240
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,346
[speaking in French]

241
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,021
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

242
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,263
[plane engine roaring]

243
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,020
The plane to Lisbon.

244
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,492
You would like to be on it?

245
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,362
Why? What's in Lisbon?

246
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,578
The clipper to America.

247
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,494
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

248
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,624
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

249
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,716
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

250
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,544
It's a combination of all three.

251
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,216
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

252
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,843
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

253
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,307
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

254
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,302
- I was misinformed.
- Hm.

255
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,644
EMIL:
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

256
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,651
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

257
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,234
...and the cashier
would like some money.

258
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,818
I'll get it from the safe.

259
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,568
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I...

260
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,364
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

261
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,323
EMIL:
I'm awfully sorry.

262
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,586
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

263
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,465
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

264
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,052
A murderer, no less.

265
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,260
If you're thinking of warning him, don't
put yourself out. He cannot escape.

266
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,258
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

267
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,770
[speaks in French]

268
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,561
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

269
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,857
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

270
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,521
It will amuse your customers.

271
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,189
Our entertainment's enough.

272
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,817
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

273
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,526
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

274
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,863
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

275
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,614
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

276
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,702
RICK: I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

277
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,787
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

278
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,121
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

279
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,423
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

280
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,470
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

281
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,133
How observant you are.

282
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,178
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

283
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,342
Yeah?

284
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,933
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

285
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,057
There are many exit visas
sold in this café...

286
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,066
...but we know
that you've never sold one.

287
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,728
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

288
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,193
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

289
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,610
That is another reason.

290
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,578
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

291
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,657
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

292
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,322
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

293
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,120
Victor Laszlo?

294
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,868
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

295
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,040
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

296
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,667
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

297
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,845
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

298
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,097
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

299
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,432
- Manages what?
- His escape.

300
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,517
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

301
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,562
He escaped from a concentration camp.

302
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,682
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

303
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,649
- This is the end of the chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

304
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,192
Is that a serious offer?

305
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,689
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

306
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,703
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

307
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,699
- Okay.
- Done.

308
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,911
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

309
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,416
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

310
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,333
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

311
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,253
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

312
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,878
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

313
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,218
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

314
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,681
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

315
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,892
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

316
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,438
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

317
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,353
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

318
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,904
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

319
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,232
Let me point out just two items:

320
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,572
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

321
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,661
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

322
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,163
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

323
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,666
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

324
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,956
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

325
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,338
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

326
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,295
I have my orders.

327
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,922
I see. Gestapo spank.

328
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,927
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

329
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,475
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

330
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,764
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

331
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,098
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

332
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,482
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

333
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,490
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

334
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,582
I have already given him the best...

335
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,282
...knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

336
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,541
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

337
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,548
Yes, sir.

338
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,593
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

339
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,639
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

340
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,808
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

341
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,651
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

342
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,527
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

343
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,364
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir.

344
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,865
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

345
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,665
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

346
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,379
I expected no less, captain.

347
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,171
Monsieur Ugarte.

348
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,041
Oh. Yes?

349
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,589
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

350
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,844
May I first please cash my chips?

351
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,715
[dealer speaking in French]

352
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,608
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

353
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,781
Thank you.

Rick! Rick, help me!

356
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,718
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

357
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,722
Excellent, captain.

358
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,564
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

359
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,807
I stick my neck out for nobody.

360
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,850
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

361
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,072
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

362
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,657
Okay, boss.

363
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:50,494
[♪ band playing]

364
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,116
RENAULT:
Rick.

365
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,866
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

366
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,917
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

367
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,246
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

368
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,915
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

369
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,090
We are very honored tonight.

370
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:14,428
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

371
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,557
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

372
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,345
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

373
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,561
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

374
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,317
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

375
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,110
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

376
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,741
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

377
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,576
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

378
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,291
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

379
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,203
There seems to be no secret about that.

380
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,880
Are you one of those people...

381
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,840
...who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

382
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,959
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

383
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,052
Can you imagine us in London?

384
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,675
When you get there, ask me.

385
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,303
Diplomatist.

386
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,639
How about New York?

387
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,135
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

388
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,098
...that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

389
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,311
Uh-huh.

390
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,110
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

391
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,566
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

392
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,937
And that takes in the field
of women too.

393
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,364
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

394
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,401
We have a complete dossier on you.

395
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:19,410
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

396
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,168
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

397
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,963
And also we know why you left Paris.

398
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,083
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

399
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,504
Are my eyes really brown?

400
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,880
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

401
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,296
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

402
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,474
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

403
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:41,683
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

404
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,644
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

405
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,312
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

406
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,489
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

407
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,237
...until the day we marched in.

408
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,739
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

409
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,626
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

410
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,045
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

411
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:09,128
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

412
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,751
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

413
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,797
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

414
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,964
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

415
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,717
Perhaps.

416
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,762
Yes, monsieur?

417
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:28,808
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

418
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,715
Two Cointreaux, please.

419
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,217
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

420
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,515
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

421
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,608
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

422
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,979
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

423
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,532
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

424
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,689
Well?

425
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,203
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

426
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,906
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

427
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,583
The ring is quite unique.

428
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:31,378
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

429
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:32,956
What is your name?

430
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,464
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

431
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,834
Victor.

432
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,213
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

433
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,970
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

434
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,302
BERGER: Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

435
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,145
I'm sorry, it is.

436
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,147
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

437
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,353
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

438
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,692
Yes, what is it you want?

439
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:56,989
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

440
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,905
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

441
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,527
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

442
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,246
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

443
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,333
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

444
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,005
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

445
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,965
That was a gross understatement.

446
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,458
You're very kind.

447
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,168
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

448
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,676
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

449
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,680
- Captain, please.
- It's a game we play.

450
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,896
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

451
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,562
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

452
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,694
Somewhere I've seen him.

453
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,447
RENAULT: Sam?
- Yes.

454
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,358
He came from Paris with Rick.

455
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,991
Rick? Who is he?

456
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,781
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is...

457
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,489
- Is what?
- Mademoiselle...

458
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,291
...he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

459
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,907
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

460
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:53,662
But what a fool I am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

461
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,123
Excuse me.

462
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,128
Major.

463
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,798
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

464
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,005
How do you do?

465
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,177
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

466
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,885
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

467
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,222
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

468
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:15,527
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you are a subject of the German Reich.

469
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,147
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

470
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:24,114
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

471
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,911
This is hardly the time or place.

472
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,328
Then we shall state
another time and place.

473
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,534
Tomorrow at 10:00 in the prefect's office.

474
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,949
With mademoiselle.

475
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,672
Captain, I am under your authority.

476
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,917
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

477
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,961
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

478
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,008
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.

479
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,098
Mademoiselle.

480
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:51,729
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

481
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,980
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

482
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,072
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

00:54:15,004 --> 00:54:16,878
...or died trying to escape.

836
00:54:18,508 --> 00:54:21,212
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

837
00:54:21,427 --> 00:54:22,922
Good day.

838
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:29,978
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

839
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,135
Excuse me, captain.

840
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:34,355
Another visa problem has come up.

841
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:37,733
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

842
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,447
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

843
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:52,375
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

844
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:54,749
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

845
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:57,541
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

846
00:54:57,756 --> 00:54:59,832
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

847
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:02,168
MAN:
Thanks.

848
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:15,397
FERRARI:
Don't be too downhearted.

849
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:17,683
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

850
00:55:17,858 --> 00:55:19,187
Thank you very much, signor.

851
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,769
RICK: Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

852
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:24,104
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

853
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:26,364
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

854
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:27,863
I never drink in the morning.

855
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:30,746
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

856
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,871
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

857
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,370
Here, sit down.

858
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:37,211
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

859
00:55:37,378 --> 00:55:39,003
Bourbon.

860
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:41,212
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

861
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,550
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

862
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:47,757
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

863
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,970
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

864
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,422
Practically no one.

865
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,885
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

866
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:56,227
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

867
00:55:56,439 --> 00:55:58,764
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

868
00:55:58,899 --> 00:56:00,478
I'll handle the entire transaction.

869
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:03,314
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

870
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,023
And the carrying charges?

871
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:07,949
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

872
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:11,068
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

873
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:12,788
I'll tell him when he comes in.

874
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:15,577
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

875
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:19,079
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

876
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,795
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

877
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,304
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

878
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,431
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

879
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,052
LASZLO:
Morning.

880
00:56:38,189 --> 00:56:40,762
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

881
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:48,068
MAN: You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

882
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:49,563
Only 700 francs.

883
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:52,950
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

884
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:56,240
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

885
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,948
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

886
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:02,792
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

887
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:03,954
Doesn't matter.

888
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:08,082
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

889
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:11,298
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

890
00:57:11,472 --> 00:57:13,097
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

891
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,970
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

892
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:19,762
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

893
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:20,970
Yes.

894
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:23,475
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

895
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,277
I don't think I will, Rick.

896
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:28,019
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

897
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:29,733
I think I'm entitled to know.

898
00:57:29,907 --> 00:57:32,114
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

899
00:57:32,785 --> 00:57:35,989
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

900
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,738
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

901
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:43,330
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

902
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:48,509
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

903
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,004
If we leave it that way...

904
00:57:50,136 --> 00:57:53,506
...maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

905
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:55,089
Not last night.

906
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:59,017
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

907
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:02,058
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

908
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:03,939
You can believe that if you want to.

909
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,855
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

910
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:08,854
Above a saloon, it's true...

911
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:10,489
...but walk up a flight...

912
00:58:10,656 --> 00:58:12,364
...I'll be expecting you.

913
00:58:14,452 --> 00:58:17,239
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

914
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,156
You'll be there.

915
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:21,697
No, Rick.

916
00:58:23,127 --> 00:58:25,370
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

917
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:30,006
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

918
00:58:34,555 --> 00:58:39,135
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

919
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:41,219
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

920
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:44,183
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

921
00:58:44,315 --> 00:58:45,976
...I am influential and respected.

922
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,566
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

923
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:51,564
You, however, are a different matter.

924
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:56,408
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

925
00:58:56,827 --> 00:58:59,947
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

926
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:03,415
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

927
00:59:03,584 --> 00:59:05,412
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

928
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:09,039
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

929
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:11,631
We are only interested in two visas.

930
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:14,090
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

931
00:59:14,428 --> 00:59:16,504
You two will want to discuss this.

932
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:18,638
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

933
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,312
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

934
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,850
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

935
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,900
But if the situation were different...

936
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,607
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

937
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,108
...would you take it?

938
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:36,397
Yes, I would.

939
00:59:37,618 --> 00:59:38,781
Yes, I see.

940
00:59:39,955 --> 00:59:43,868
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

941
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:46,249
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

942
00:59:46,377 --> 00:59:50,079
...and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

943
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:53,874
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

944
00:59:56,345 --> 00:59:57,804
I love you very much, Ilsa.

945
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:01,138
Your secret will be safe with me.

946
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:04,308
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

947
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,804
Not more than 50 francs.

948
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,319
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

949
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:16,856
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

950
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:18,990
Well, good luck, but be careful.

951
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,996
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

952
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:25,366
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

953
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:28,289
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

954
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:30,334
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

955
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:33,714
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

956
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:34,873
Yes, something.

957
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:38,254
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

958
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:40,423
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

959
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,677
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

960
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:45,384
Rick?

961
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,764
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

962
01:00:48,981 --> 01:00:50,606
But it is worth a chance.

963
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:53,979
Thank you very much.
Good day.

964
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:56,437
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

965
01:00:56,572 --> 01:00:58,447
I shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

966
01:00:58,574 --> 01:01:00,947
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

967
01:01:01,118 --> 01:01:03,527
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

969
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:14,589
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

970
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:16,918
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

971
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:20,884
I have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

972
01:01:21,055 --> 01:01:23,381
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

973
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,722
- Goodbye.
- It has been a pleasure to meet you.

974
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,553
I'm sorry.

975
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:47,076
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best customer.

976
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:51,498
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

977
01:01:51,669 --> 01:01:53,579
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

978
01:01:53,754 --> 01:01:56,081
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

979
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:58,250
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

980
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:00,715
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

981
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:03,010
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

982
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,091
You know how
that impresses Germans.

983
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,760
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

984
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,227
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

985
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:16,316
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

986
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:19,107
- It looks like you're a little late.
- Huh?

987
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,072
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

988
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:31,997
Who knows? In her own way, she
may constitute an entire second front.

989
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:35,917
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

Would you kindly repeat it?

- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

1180

See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1181
01:14:06,737 --> 01:14:09,193
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1182
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:11,358
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1183
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,613
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1184
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:15,985
The place is to be closed.

1185
01:14:16,164 --> 01:14:19,201
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1186
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:24,286
[whistle blows]

1187
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:25,750
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1188
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:28,213
This café is closed until further notice.

1189
01:14:28,467 --> 01:14:30,045
Clear the room at once.

1190
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:34,844
How can you close me up?

1191
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:38,509
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1192
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:40,596
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1193
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:42,017
Everybody out at once.

1194
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:50,400
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1195
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:53,360
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1196
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:56,488
That is also true, except for one
destination: Occupied France.

1197
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:59,576
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1198
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:00,823
Of what value is that?

1199
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,037
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1200
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:07,462
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1201
01:15:07,632 --> 01:15:09,625
The French authorities
may find a reason...

1202
01:15:09,759 --> 01:15:11,917
...to put him
in the concentration camp here.

1203
01:15:12,094 --> 01:15:13,209
The other alternative?

1204
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:15,713
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed...

1205
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:18,138
...that in Casablanca
human life is cheap.

1206
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,638
Good night, mademoiselle.

1207
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:33,862
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1208
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,757
Our faithful friend is still there.

1209
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,847
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1210
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:03,183
I must.

1211
01:16:03,354 --> 01:16:06,806
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1212
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:10,316
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1213
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:12,355
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1214
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:14,937
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1215
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:16,783
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1216
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:19,871
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1217
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:23,665
Victor, why don't you tell me
about Rick? What did you find out?

1218
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:26,206
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1219
01:16:26,377 --> 01:16:27,956
But no intention of selling them.

1220
01:16:28,129 --> 01:16:31,794
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1221
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:33,544
Did he give any reason?

1222
01:16:33,759 --> 01:16:37,009
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1223
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:39,380
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1224
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,142
I don't know why he said that.

1225
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,408
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1226
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,611
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1227
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:05,154
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1228
01:17:06,459 --> 01:17:08,702
When I was in the concentration camp...

1229
01:17:09,295 --> 01:17:11,833
...were you lonely in Paris?

1230
01:17:13,299 --> 01:17:15,292
Yes, Victor, I was.

1231
01:17:16,259 --> 01:17:19,214
I know how it is to be lonely.

1232
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:22,631
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1233
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:26,636
No, Victor, there isn't.

1234
01:17:31,275 --> 01:17:33,813
I love you very much, my dear.

1235
01:17:35,154 --> 01:17:36,648
Yes.

1236
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:39,149
Yes, I know.

1237
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,400
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I..?

1238
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:45,284
You don't even have to say it.

1239
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:47,200
I'll believe.

1240
01:17:49,335 --> 01:17:50,664
Good night, dear.

1241
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:54,000
Good night.

1242
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,725
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1243
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:10,397
Be careful.

1244
01:18:11,983 --> 01:18:13,561
Of course I'll be careful.

1245
01:18:56,902 --> 01:19:00,106
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1246
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:02,073
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1247
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:04,022
Two weeks, maybe three.

1248
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,451
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1249
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:08,904
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1250
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:10,458
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1251
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,958
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1252
01:19:14,545 --> 01:19:17,380
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1253
01:19:17,548 --> 01:19:20,668
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1254
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:22,041
I won't.

1255
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,300
Good night.

1256
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:27,009
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1257
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:47,074
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1258
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:50,579
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1259
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:51,994
Well, won't you sit down?

1260
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:56,081
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1261
01:19:56,254 --> 01:19:59,540
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1262
01:19:59,757 --> 01:20:02,462
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1263
01:20:02,634 --> 01:20:05,256
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1264
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,003
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1265
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:10,301
I know how you feel about me...

1266
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:13,229
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1267
01:20:13,396 --> 01:20:15,852
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1268
01:20:16,023 --> 01:20:18,017
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1269
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:19,521
It was your cause too.

1270
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:22,191
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1271
01:20:22,655 --> 01:20:25,360
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1272
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:27,567
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1273
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:33,945
Richard.

1274
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:37,702
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you...

1275
01:20:37,878 --> 01:20:40,796
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1276
01:20:40,965 --> 01:20:44,416
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1277
01:20:44,594 --> 01:20:46,670
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1278
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:49,882
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1279
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,855
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1280
01:20:57,023 --> 01:20:59,774
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1281
01:21:00,401 --> 01:21:01,646
One woman has hurt you...

1282
01:21:01,777 --> 01:21:04,529
...and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1283
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:07,235
You're a coward and a weakling.

1284
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:13,491
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1285
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:17,537
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1286
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:20,416
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1287
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:21,620
What of it?

1288
01:21:21,797 --> 01:21:24,467
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1289
01:21:31,308 --> 01:21:33,134
Now, if you'll...

1290
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,800
All right.

1291
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:39,020
I tried to reason with you.

1292
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:41,433
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1293
01:21:41,817 --> 01:21:44,937
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1294
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,404
Put them on the table.

1295
01:21:50,243 --> 01:21:51,274
No.

1296
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,487
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1297
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:59,788
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1298
01:22:01,212 --> 01:22:03,205
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1299
01:22:05,633 --> 01:22:09,333
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1300
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:16,141
Richard...

1301
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,683
...I tried to stay away.

1302
01:22:19,063 --> 01:22:21,732
I thought I would never see you again.

1303
01:22:22,858 --> 01:22:25,314
That you were out of my life.

1304
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,629
The day you left Paris...

1305
01:22:49,176 --> 01:22:51,169
...if you knew what I went through.

1306
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:55,517
If you knew how much I loved you.

1307
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:59,353
How much I still love you.

1308
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:14,273
And then?

1309
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:20,659
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1310
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:24,369
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1311
01:23:24,545 --> 01:23:26,253
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1312
01:23:26,422 --> 01:23:29,043
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1313
01:23:30,217 --> 01:23:32,543
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1314
01:23:32,845 --> 01:23:34,043
Then it came.

1315
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:36,422
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1316
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:40,216
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1317
01:23:41,646 --> 01:23:43,057
Then I met you.

1318
01:23:43,397 --> 01:23:46,731
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1319
01:23:46,943 --> 01:23:50,027
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1320
01:23:50,237 --> 01:23:52,729
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1321
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,153
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1322
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:59,654
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1323
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,374
...and for those working with us.

1324
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,325
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1325
01:24:05,378 --> 01:24:07,916
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1326
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,497
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1327
01:24:10,675 --> 01:24:13,794
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1328
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:16,129
He was sick. He needed me.

1329
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:20,345
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1330
01:24:20,519 --> 01:24:24,469
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1331
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:27,267
Well...

1332
01:24:27,608 --> 01:24:29,269
...well, you know the rest.

1333
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:35,274
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1334
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:36,612
What about now?

1335
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:38,816
Now?

1336
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:41,163
I don't know.

1337
01:24:41,832 --> 01:24:44,868
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1338
01:24:46,085 --> 01:24:47,117
And Laszlo?

1339
01:24:47,503 --> 01:24:50,753
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1340
01:24:50,923 --> 01:24:54,257
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1341
01:24:54,426 --> 01:24:55,921
All except one.

1342
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:58,799
He won't have you.

1343
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:02,719
I can't fight it anymore.

1344
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,805
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1345
01:25:09,817 --> 01:25:12,854
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1346
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:15,105
You have to think for both of us.

1347
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:17,491
For all of us.

1348
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:23,790
All right. I will.

1349
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:29,626
Here's looking at you, kid.

1350
01:25:31,422 --> 01:25:34,506
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1351
01:25:46,896 --> 01:25:48,973
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1352
01:25:49,148 --> 01:25:51,142
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1353
01:25:51,275 --> 01:25:52,307
Come inside.

1354
01:25:56,615 --> 01:26:01,491
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1355
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,495
LASZLO:
Thank you.

1356
01:26:20,931 --> 01:26:23,088
RICK:
Carl, what happened?

1357
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:25,306
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1358
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:26,894
We escaped at the last moment.

1359
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:29,392
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1360
01:26:29,563 --> 01:26:32,897
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1361
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:35,772
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1362
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:38,729
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1363
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:49,914
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1364
01:27:00,886 --> 01:27:04,006
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1365
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:05,925
This might come in handy.

1366
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,256
Thank you.

1367
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:10,099
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1368
01:27:12,106 --> 01:27:14,858
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1369
01:27:15,026 --> 01:27:16,936
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1370
01:27:17,945 --> 01:27:20,068
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1371
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,782
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1372
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,405
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1373
01:27:24,578 --> 01:27:26,819
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1374
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,154
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1375
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:31,574
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

1376
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:33,999
...of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1377
01:27:34,128 --> 01:27:37,295
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1378
01:27:37,798 --> 01:27:40,336
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1379
01:27:40,676 --> 01:27:43,796
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1380
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:45,549
...and that you'll never succeed.

1381
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:47,965
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1382
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,342
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1383
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:54,937
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

1384
01:27:55,149 --> 01:27:56,893
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1385
01:27:57,068 --> 01:27:59,985
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1386
01:28:00,154 --> 01:28:02,312
The first evening I came into this café...

1387
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:04,815
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1388
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:07,320
Since no one is to blame...

1389
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,738
...I demand no explanation.

1390
01:28:09,915 --> 01:28:13,200
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1391
01:28:13,376 --> 01:28:14,954
All right.

1392
01:28:15,127 --> 01:28:17,038
But I want my wife to be safe.

1393
01:28:17,338 --> 01:28:18,750
I ask you as a favor...

1394
01:28:18,923 --> 01:28:21,840
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1395
01:28:22,009 --> 01:28:23,125
You love her that much?

1396
01:28:23,344 --> 01:28:26,097
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1397
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:29,259
Well, I am also a human being.

1398
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:31,595
Yes, I love her that much.

1399
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:33,229
[clattering]

1400
01:28:39,402 --> 01:28:40,683
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1401
01:28:40,861 --> 01:28:43,399
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1402
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:44,562
On what charge?

1403
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,948
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1404
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,870
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1405
01:29:01,632 --> 01:29:05,796
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1406
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:08,295
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1407
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:10,056
You might as well let him go now.

1408
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:13,226
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1409
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:14,889
If you were to help him escape...

1410
01:29:15,062 --> 01:29:17,470
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1411
01:29:17,648 --> 01:29:20,104
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1412
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:23,396
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1413
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:26,655
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1414
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,699
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1415
01:29:28,869 --> 01:29:30,244
They're all excellent reasons.

1416
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:32,369
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1417
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:35,990
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1418
01:29:36,334 --> 01:29:40,913
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1419
01:29:41,088 --> 01:29:42,583
Yes, I have the letters.

1420
01:29:42,757 --> 01:29:44,584
But I intend using them myself.

1421
01:29:44,967 --> 01:29:48,502
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1422
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,765
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1423
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:53,891
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1424
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:57,643
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1425
01:29:57,813 --> 01:29:59,854
The last man I want to see in America.

1426
01:30:00,107 --> 01:30:03,274
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1427
01:30:03,444 --> 01:30:06,611
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1428
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:09,451
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1429
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:13,829
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1430
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:16,038
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1431
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,331
...but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1432
01:30:18,459 --> 01:30:20,120
...in spite of their legal rights.

1433
01:30:20,253 --> 01:30:22,126
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1434
01:30:22,255 --> 01:30:23,287
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1435
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:26,133
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1436
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,842
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1437
01:30:28,009 --> 01:30:31,545
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1438
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:34,973
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1439
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:37,765
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

1440
01:30:37,937 --> 01:30:40,095
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

1441
01:30:40,273 --> 01:30:41,305
Then release him.

1442
01:30:41,482 --> 01:30:44,151
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1443
01:30:44,318 --> 01:30:46,810
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1444
01:30:47,029 --> 01:30:49,651
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1445
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:52,196
You get him, and we get away.

1446
01:30:52,369 --> 01:30:55,286
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1447
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:58,284
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1448
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,168
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1449
01:31:01,335 --> 01:31:03,661
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1450
01:31:03,838 --> 01:31:06,507
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1451
01:31:07,091 --> 01:31:09,500
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1452
01:31:09,676 --> 01:31:12,512
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1453
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:13,925
I'm gonna miss you.

1454
01:31:14,057 --> 01:31:17,176
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than I.

1455
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:18,681
Oh, thanks.

1456
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:20,433
Go ahead, Ricky.

1457
01:31:20,646 --> 01:31:23,352
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

1458
01:31:23,482 --> 01:31:25,393
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1459
01:31:25,526 --> 01:31:27,520
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1460
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,692
FERRARI: Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1461
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:41,123
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1462
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:44,751
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1463
01:31:44,962 --> 01:31:50,383
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1464
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:53,338
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1465
01:31:53,512 --> 01:31:56,466
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1466
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:59,090
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1467
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:00,598
Well, so long.

1468
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:03,807
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1469
01:32:03,981 --> 01:32:06,473
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1470
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:17,358
Stepping

1471
01:32:26,712 --> 01:32:28,706
[knocking]

1472
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:42,341
RICK:
You're late.

1473
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:45,645
I was informed when Laszlo
left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.

1474
01:32:45,815 --> 01:32:48,852
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1475
01:32:49,026 --> 01:32:51,103
This place will never be
the same without you.

1476
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:54,855
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1477
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,785
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1478
01:32:57,953 --> 01:33:00,110
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1479
01:33:00,289 --> 01:33:01,451
Sam's piano.

1480
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:04,116
Serves me right for not being musical.
[tires squealing]

1481
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:05,449
Here they are.

1482
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,668
You better wait in my office.

1483
01:33:15,886 --> 01:33:17,215
Here.

1484
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:19,961
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1485
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:21,172
Not yet.

1486
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,934
But you were able to
arrange everything?

1487
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:24,141
Everything is quite all right.

1488
01:33:24,312 --> 01:33:27,312
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1489
01:33:27,481 --> 01:33:29,309
Please trust me.

1490
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,605
Yes, I will.

1491
01:33:37,826 --> 01:33:41,905
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1492
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:46,827
LASZLO: I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1493
01:33:47,209 --> 01:33:49,120
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1494
01:33:49,295 --> 01:33:52,581
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1495
01:33:52,757 --> 01:33:55,083
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1496
01:33:55,259 --> 01:33:57,667
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1497
01:33:57,845 --> 01:33:59,256
RENAULT:
Victor Laszlo.

1498
01:33:59,806 --> 01:34:02,509
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1499
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:06,887
The charge of accessory to the murder...

1500
01:34:07,021 --> 01:34:09,145
...of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

1501
01:34:09,732 --> 01:34:12,982
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1502
01:34:13,194 --> 01:34:16,148
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1503
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:21,360
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1504
01:34:21,536 --> 01:34:23,528
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1505
01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:25,863
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1506
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,868
...but I will if you take one more step.

1507
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:30,827
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1508
01:34:34,048 --> 01:34:37,547
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1509
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:39,877
I do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

1510
01:34:40,054 --> 01:34:41,632
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1511
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:44,426
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1512
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:47,008
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1513
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:49,262
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1514
01:34:56,821 --> 01:34:59,775
- Hello? Is that the airport?
- Huh?

1515
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,859
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1516
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:04,615
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1517
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:06,579
There's to be no trouble about them.

1518
01:35:06,999 --> 01:35:08,029
Good.

1519
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:10,949
Hello? Hello?

1520
01:35:12,211 --> 01:35:13,790
[buzzing]

1521
01:35:14,755 --> 01:35:15,835
My car, quickly!

1522
01:35:15,965 --> 01:35:17,376
[speaks in German]

1523
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,916
This is Major Strasser.

1524
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:21,549
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1525
01:35:21,721 --> 01:35:23,001
At once, do you hear?

1526
01:35:30,146 --> 01:35:32,186
MAN:
Hello, radio tower?

1527
01:35:32,356 --> 01:35:35,441
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1528
01:35:35,735 --> 01:35:38,190
Visibility, 1½ miles.

1529
01:35:38,362 --> 01:35:42,277
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1530
01:35:42,451 --> 01:35:45,202
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1531
01:35:57,715 --> 01:36:00,467
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1532
01:36:00,634 --> 01:36:02,378
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1533
01:36:02,595 --> 01:36:04,753
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

1534
01:36:04,889 --> 01:36:05,969
Yes, sir.

1535
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:07,130
This way, please.

1536
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:12,138
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1537
01:36:12,313 --> 01:36:14,353
You think of everything, don't you?

1538
01:36:14,523 --> 01:36:16,979
And the names are
Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1539
01:36:17,151 --> 01:36:20,734
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1540
01:36:20,905 --> 01:36:22,482
I don't understand.
What about you?

1541
01:36:22,658 --> 01:36:24,780
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1542
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:26,943
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

1543
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,912
Last night we said a great many things.

1544
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:30,990
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1545
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:33,834
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1546
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:35,995
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1547
01:36:36,128 --> 01:36:38,666
- Richard, no...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

1548
01:36:38,839 --> 01:36:41,710
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1549
01:36:41,884 --> 01:36:45,170
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1550
01:36:45,346 --> 01:36:47,634
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1551
01:36:47,808 --> 01:36:51,224
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1552
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:53,676
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1553
01:36:53,854 --> 01:36:56,180
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1554
01:36:56,357 --> 01:36:59,229
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1555
01:36:59,443 --> 01:37:02,943
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1556
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:05,899
But what about us?

1557
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:07,486
We'll always have Paris.

1558
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:10,662
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1559
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:12,699
We got it back last night.

1560
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:17,374
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1561
01:37:17,878 --> 01:37:19,374
But I've got a job to do too.

1562
01:37:19,589 --> 01:37:21,083
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

1563
01:37:21,215 --> 01:37:23,338
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

1564
01:37:23,926 --> 01:37:25,469
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1565
01:37:25,636 --> 01:37:29,088
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1566
01:37:29,266 --> 01:37:31,970
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1567
01:37:32,144 --> 01:37:34,681
Someday you'll understand that.

1568
01:37:35,855 --> 01:37:37,599
Now, now.

1569
01:37:39,233 --> 01:37:41,559
Here's looking at you, kid.

1570
01:37:50,537 --> 01:37:52,196
[horn honks]

1571
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:59,201
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1572
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,579
There's something you should know.

1573
01:38:01,797 --> 01:38:03,589
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1574
01:38:03,758 --> 01:38:06,877
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1575
01:38:07,053 --> 01:38:08,926
- You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
- Yes.

1576
01:38:09,096 --> 01:38:11,931
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1577
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:15,551
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1578
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:17,224
Yes.

1579
01:38:17,396 --> 01:38:19,437
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1580
01:38:19,607 --> 01:38:23,106
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1581
01:38:23,277 --> 01:38:25,815
But that was all over long ago.

1582
01:38:25,988 --> 01:38:29,274
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1583
01:38:29,785 --> 01:38:31,409
I understand.

1584
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:33,785
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1585
01:38:34,456 --> 01:38:36,283
I appreciate it.

1586
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,916
Welcome back to the fight.

1587
01:38:39,126 --> 01:38:41,618
This time I know our side will win.

1588
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:57,509
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1589
01:38:59,397 --> 01:39:00,772
Yes, I'm ready.

1590
01:39:03,901 --> 01:39:05,276
Goodbye, Rick.

1591
01:39:06,153 --> 01:39:08,027
God bless you.

1592
01:39:09,366 --> 01:39:12,070
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1593
01:39:30,136 --> 01:39:32,045
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1594
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:35,056
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1595
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:36,553
What you just did for Laszlo.

1596
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:39,133
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1597
01:39:39,312 --> 01:39:41,637
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1598
01:39:41,856 --> 01:39:43,849
But she knew you were lying.

1599
01:39:44,025 --> 01:39:45,982
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1600
01:39:46,152 --> 01:39:49,437
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1601
01:39:49,573 --> 01:39:50,770
Especially for you.

1602
01:39:50,907 --> 01:39:54,110
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1603
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:03,077
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1604
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,500
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1605
01:40:08,049 --> 01:40:10,172
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1606
01:40:10,344 --> 01:40:12,382
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1607
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:17,516
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1608
01:40:17,726 --> 01:40:20,976
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1609
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:24,517
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1610
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:26,564
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1611
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,161
Major Strasser has been shot.

1612
01:40:47,922 --> 01:40:50,591
Round up the usual suspects.

1613
01:40:58,290 --> 01:41:01,417
Allez. Cette voiture.
Vous allez là.

1614
01:41:14,283 --> 01:41:16,440
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

1615
01:41:16,576 --> 01:41:18,235
...but you've become a patriot.

1616
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,576
RICK: Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1617
01:41:20,706 --> 01:41:22,698
I think perhaps you're right.

1618
01:41:47,481 --> 01:41:51,183
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1619
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,816
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1620
01:41:53,988 --> 01:41:57,772
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1621
01:41:57,993 --> 01:41:59,237
I could use a trip.

1622
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:02,703
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1623
01:42:02,956 --> 01:42:05,827
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1624
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,910
RICK: "Our" expenses?
- Mm-hm.

1625
01:42:08,085 --> 01:42:12,297
RICK: Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
