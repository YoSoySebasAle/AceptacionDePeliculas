Sitting with your
head in the gutter!

19
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,302
The bus has been waiting
ten minutes!

20
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:09,173
Can't you hear the bus honking?

21
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:10,941
Every day we're late because of you.

22
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,608
You want... you want? Take.

23
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,226
Go and wash up.

24
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,225
Schoolbag in your room...
in your room.

25
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:35,489
Wash your hands first.

26
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,158
Put that down.

27
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:41,204
Whatever do you do in school? Look
at your hands, look at your face.

28
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:43,265
Ishaan, put that down.

29
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,573
At least, turn off the tap.

30
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:06,296
Weren't you going to get
your exam papers today?

31
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:08,689
Did you get them?

32
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:14,232
Are you listening?

33
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,372
Yohan?

34
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:25,506
Drama practice cancelled.

35
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:26,879
Lily Teacher has viral fever.

36
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,386
I topped in all subjects, Mom.

37
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:34,286
Algebra, geometry, physics, chem,
bio, history, english, geography...

38
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:35,616
And in Hindi?

39
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,456
Second in Hindi, by only two marks.

40
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:41,523
How did you do?

41
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:48,629
You've almost cracked it.

42
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:01,284
Finish your homework first!
No... your school uniform...

43
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:12,920
Look.

44
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:17,200
Ball! Get the ball... quick!

45
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:20,032
Over here!

46
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,307
Idiot! Duffer! Look
where you threw it!

47
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:35,347
Now go get it!

48
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:40,254
I told you to go. Don't you get it?

49
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:44,519
What're you looking at?

50
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,761
Don't you get it?

51
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,629
What're you looking at?

52
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:50,801
Get the ball. Move it!

53
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,632
What're you looking at?

54
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,966
I said, get the ball!
Don't you get it?

55
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:02,274
What're you waiting for? Go!

56
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:06,381
Ranjit! Thrash him!

57
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:08,365
Your son destroyed my plants.
Have you taught him no manners?

58
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:10,765
My son is hurt, look he's bleeding!

59
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:15,238
Haven't you taught your son
anything? How can he beat up my kid?

60
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:18,380
Have you no shame? Look how
badly my son is bruised!

61
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:20,975
Come here.

62
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:23,444
Come here right now

63
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:38,524
But Papa...

64
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:39,465
Shut up, Yohan.

65
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:41,672
He even tore my shirt.

66
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,472
He's lying!

67
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:46,269
Look, he's hitting my son
right in front of you!

68
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:47,501
Let go!

69
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:51,776
Please leave.
- I'm going to call the police!

70
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,412
This is the limit! Complaints
every day...

71
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:58,488
complaints from school, complaints
from neighbours.

72
00:15:58,589 --> 00:15:59,851
You step out and there's
a complaint.

73
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:02,821
If there's ever another complaint
about you, I'll...

74
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:07,928
Laughing! ...Shameless!

75
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,327
Shameless! If there's
another complaint...

76
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,535
One more complaint and I'll send
you away to a boarding school.

77
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,195
Right in front of us...

78
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,772
he picks a fight! Did you see what
he did to that boy... tore his shirt.

79
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,419
Worship him, that's all you do.

80
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:40,895
How many times have I told you
not to play with Ranjit.

81
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:46,729
But Mama... - Go, bathe.
I'll get some antiseptic.

82
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:52,567
Okay, you want to fight?

83
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:54,474
Fight. Come on

84
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:15,555
Papa, where are you going?

85
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,836
I'm going away. Forever.

86
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:28,509
Sorry Papa. I'm very sorry, Papa.
I won't do it next time, Papa.

87
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:31,547
Papa, I'm very sorry.

88
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,146
I'll never do it again.

89
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:35,942
Papa please. I'm sorry, Papa

90
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,553
Stop frightening the child.

91
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,957
Papa is going away for work.

92
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:44,718
Not because of you.

93
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,561
He'll be back by Sunday.

94
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:48,589
Any more cuts?

95
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:49,232
Show me.

96
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,474
Tie your laces, tighten that belt.

97
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:07,375
Prepare for battle...

98
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,416
...shoulder your burdens.

99
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:20,894
With files in hand and firm resolve...

100
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,966
...we'll take on the world.

101
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,932
We'll stand our ground.

102
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,903
It's the way of the world,
keep at it.

103
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:29,939
Your goal beckons...

104
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,565
...keep at it.

105
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:44,018
They sleep with one eye open,
falling behind is not an option.

106
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:47,955
Work your fingers to the bone,
do exactly as you're told.

107
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:59,126
They live on omelets,
vitamins and tonics...

108
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:01,303
...and a strict regimen
of work and rest.

109
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,373
Striding, striving, forging ahead.

110
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:06,068
It's the way of the world,
keep at it.

111
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:10,003
Your goal beckons, keep at it.

112
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,367
But here thrives another theme...

113
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:37,004
...of waking into music from a dream.

114
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,311
Where time comes to a standstill,

115
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:45,981
to make fantasy come alive at will.

116
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:56,993
They always wonder to themselves...

117
00:19:57,094 --> 00:20:00,029
why is the world's
motto "keep at it"?

118
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:03,990
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

119
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,040
Not slaves to time...

120
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:16,079
...they're carefree...

121
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,011
...having meetings with butterflies...

122
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:20,140
...and discussions with trees.

123
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,493
They spend time gathering the wind
and reading tales in raindrops...

124
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:35,395
. while painting a new world
on the canvas of the skies.

125
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:38,332
Why is the world's
motto "keep at it"?

126
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:42,129
Why this steady striving
towards a goal?

127
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,479
Quickly! - Madam, hurry up!
You're delaying us.

128
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:59,749
Come on... every day we're
late because of your boy.

129
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,276
We must also remember...

130
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:29,209
the old saying,

131
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:32,320
cleanliness is godliness.

132
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,880
On many occasions...

133
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:38,327
...while doing rounds, I have also found...

134
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:42,799
...that children don't keep the
school corridors clean.

135
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:48,664
It is our duty to keep our
school neat and tidy.

136
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,311
Unpolished shoes?

137
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:05,479
Out.

138
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:30,279
Turn to page 38, chapter
4, paragraph 3.

139
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,310
We're going to mark
adjectives today.

140
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,379
That goes for you as well,
Ishaan Awasthi.

141
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:41,313
Page 38, chapter 4, paragraph 3.

142
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:46,624
Can I have your attention, Ishaan?

143
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:54,727
I said, page 38, chapter
4, paragraph 3.

144
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:57,433
Read the first sentence and
point out the adjectives.

145
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:06,779
Page 38, Ishaan. Adit Lamba,
just help the boy.

146
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:12,449
The rest of you, look at your books.

147
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:18,657
Read the first sentence and
tell me all the adjectives.

148
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:29,599
Okay, let's mark the adjectives
together. Read the sentence for me.

149
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:35,438
Just read the sentence, Ishaan.

150
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:39,739
They're... dancing.

151
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,011
Speak in English.

152
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,447
The letters are dancing.

153
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:50,484
They're dancing, are they?

154
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:53,953
Then read the dancing letters.

155
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:56,459
Trying to be funny?

156
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,704
Read the sentence loud and proper!

157
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:10,911
I said loud and proper, Ishaan.
Loud and proper!

158
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,045
Loud and proper!

159
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:21,048
Stop it!

160
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,824
Stop it! Enough is enough!

161
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:27,754
Get out of my class!

162
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:28,922
Out!

163
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,466
You want to leave as well?
Who was laughing here?

164
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,665
Who wants to follow him?

165
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:42,708
I don't want to hear a titter in
my class. Look at your books.

166
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,674
Shameless boy.

167
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:49,009
Open your books.

168
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:51,418
Who's going to tell me what
the adjectives are?

169
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:53,453
I don't want a sound in this class.

170
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,518
Come on.

171
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:15,800
Punished again?

172
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,506
Why d'you get punished all the time?

173
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,600
This one's a regular.

174
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:33,647
Go in now.

175
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:45,896
Done your maths homework?

176
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:52,834
Got your test papers signed?
No?

177
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:54,000
Now, you're finished.

178
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:59,081
Yes, now you're gone.

179
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:30,838
A little sweet, a little sour.

180
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:34,878
A little close,

181
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:39,846
not too far.

182
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:47,054
All I need, all I need...

183
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,267
...all I need is...

184
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:58,698
...to be free.

185
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:35,608
It's close enough to touch...

186
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:47,123
...but disappears, like a mirage.

187
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:17,647
Woven of dreams, warm as a sweater...

188
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:22,724
...beyond the white clouds...

189
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:30,996
...is my world.

190
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:26,952
Let me in without a shout,
let me in, I have a doubt.

191
00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:39,932
There are more, many more,
many more like me.

192
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:45,672
I'm not alone...

193
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,306
...dream walking, wide-eyed.

194
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:56,809
...stepping... stumbling.

195
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:11,697
I'm not alone, dream walking,
wide-eyed...

196
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:16,672
...stepping... stumbling.

197
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:21,938
Yet I have no doubt...

198
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:27,015
...just like the setting
sun will rise again...

199
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,618
...my world once revealed...

200
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:35,954
...will astound everyone.

201
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:40,723
Open eyed how I run, how I
run to the other side...

202
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:55,770
Then I glide like a bird,
I just want to be.

203
00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:00,748
A thousand wings to fly...

204
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:04,082
...to explore open skies.

205
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:08,849
So many turns to take,
paths to follow...

206
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:15,825
...and discover... my world.

207
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:51,930
These few days of childhood...

208
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:59,104
...will never return.

209
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,803
So live it up now, my friend,

210
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:10,785
on credit, if you're broke.

211
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:17,088
Live it up.

212
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,458
Wash up, I'm serving dinner.

213
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:02,396
What's this?

214
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:05,531
Superb!

215
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,564
Done? Let's see.

216
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:37,733
What handwriting...

217
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:43,206
What's this,

218
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:44,506
every spelling wrong?

219
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:48,576
Table is "Tabl", then "Tabel"?

220
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,481
And "d" instead of "the"?

221
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:57,159
What is this? How many times
have we done this?

222
00:34:57,594 --> 00:35:01,291
We went over this yesterday. How
can you forget so quickly?

223
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:05,628
Enough fooling around. You'll
fail again this year.

224
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,803
All your friends will move ahead.

225
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,595
Will you like that?

226
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,768
Concentrate, son.

227
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,346
Stop fooling and fix your spellings!

228
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:19,042
No.

229
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:19,715
What?

230
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:21,077
No.

231
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:42,195
Brother...

232
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:46,632
Go to sleep.

233
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:49,772
No stories tonight, I'm tired.

234
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:55,711
Today I bunked school.

235
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:57,577
What?

236
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,188
I just walked out.

237
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:03,216
When?

238
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:04,350
After the first period.

239
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:05,785
Why?

240
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:10,294
I hadn't done my maths homework
nor my test papers signed.

241
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,364
Where did you go?

242
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:17,137
Nowhere, I just wandered the roads.

243
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:20,168
Roads? Alone?

244
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:22,335
No fear.

245
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,147
Look at your guts!

246
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:27,739
You know how dangerous that is?
Anything could've happened...

247
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:30,177
you could've had an accident,
or got kidnapped.

248
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:31,477
Papa's not at home too.

249
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,246
Idiot.

250
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:36,349
Did you tell Mom?

251
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,285
Shall I tell her?
- No, no.

252
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:40,486
Then?

253
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:45,460
Write me an absent-note, please?

254
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:46,826
What?

255
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:48,229
Absent-note.

256
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,331
No...

257
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,499
I'm not writing fake absent-notes.

258
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:55,176
Go to sleep, I'll
tell Mama tomorrow.

259
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,209
Dada, please

260
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:13,525
Absent-note, teacher.

261
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:27,303
How are you feeling?

262
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:32,478
99 degrees. Go

263
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,281
Children...

264
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:38,216
Surprise maths test

265
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:41,724
The marks on this test will count
in the final exam, so be careful.

266
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:43,589
Take one and pass the rest.

267
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:45,451
Here.

268
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:37,879
Fearless Captain Ishaan sets
out on mission impossible.

269
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:42,912
His mission... to take the third
planet from the Sun... Planet Earth...

270
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:47,813
and yank it "into" the ninth planet
in the solar system... Pluto.

271
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:49,552
Three into nine.

272
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:16,349
Goodness!

273
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:20,320
Scorching hot Mars will melt
Captain Ishaan's firm grip on Earth.

274
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:24,420
Saved!

275
00:39:25,628 --> 00:39:27,619
Hi Jupiter... bye Jupiter!

276
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,464
Hi Saturn, having fun? Bye.

277
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:43,710
And now 3 gets ready to go into 9.

278
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,378
Pluto is destroyed!

279
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:54,212
It's no longer a planet.

280
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:57,918
Fearless Captain Ishaan has
discovered the answer.

281
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:01,659
3 X 9 equals 3.

282
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:08,461
Time up.

283
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:18,810
How did the test go?

284
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,415
No fear.

285
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:30,483
Thanks, Yohan.

286
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:33,520
Papa's back.

287
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:45,469
Papa, when did you come?
- Late last night, You were asleep.

288
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:49,843
Bye Papa. Bye Inu.

289
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:50,970
Bye

290
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:53,906
What did you get me?

291
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,508
That.

292
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:57,544
Strawberries?

293
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:00,079
And for Dada?

294
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:01,514
Same.

295
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:02,782
For both?

296
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:08,587
Wash them first.

297
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:25,909
Papa, aquarium.

298
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,542
Let's go to the aquarium today.

299
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:41,587
We're going to the aquarium
today, okay?

300
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:51,471
Maya, did Ishaan have
fever on Thursday?

301
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:52,898
No.

302
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:57,469
What's this absent-note?

303
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:03,977
I didn't write this note.

304
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,149
Come here.

305
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:12,585
Come here.

306
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:18,027
Come here, right now!

307
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:22,561
What's this?

308
00:42:23,206 --> 00:42:24,537
What's the meaning of this note?

309
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,772
Answer, or I'll give you
such a thrashing...

310
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:31,875
Don't look down...

311
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:34,515
Iook up... in my eyes.

312
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:35,675
And answer me.

313
00:42:35,785 --> 00:42:37,446
Where the hell were you on Thursday?

314
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:40,816
Let me... where did you go, son?
- If not to school, then where?

315
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:41,787
Where, son?

316
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,085
Answer!

317
00:42:48,564 --> 00:42:49,588
What's he saying?
- Bunk.

318
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,924
What?

319
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:53,961
You bunked school?

320
00:42:57,607 --> 00:43:00,405
Bunked school and did what?

321
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:02,201
Where did you go?

322
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:05,639
Road.

323
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:12,278
What road? Which road? With whom?

324
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:14,054
Alone.

325
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,158
Alone? Are you out of your mind?

326
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:18,750
Are you out of your bloody mind?

327
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:22,827
Wandering the streets alone? Any
idea what could've happened?

328
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:26,158
What's going on? Did you hear that?

329
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:28,569
If he got lost, where'd
we go looking?

330
00:43:31,274 --> 00:43:32,605
And who wrote this,

331
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:33,834
who wrote this absent-note?

332
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:36,575
You can't even write properly!

333
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:39,671
If you could write, you'd pass!

334
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,710
Who wrote this note?
- Tell me. Who?

335
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:47,181
This is the last time I'm asking you

336
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,848
Who wrote this absent-note?

337
00:43:52,094 --> 00:43:53,618
Who wrote it? Speak up!

338
00:44:02,772 --> 00:44:05,764
No improvement in class-work
or homework.

339
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:07,904
He's still where he was last year.

340
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:10,073
Books are still his enemies.

341
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:13,639
Reading and writing are
like punishment for him.

342
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:17,676
Sometimes his English handwriting
resembles Russian.

343
00:44:18,888 --> 00:44:21,516
Repeats his mistakes on purpose,

344
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:23,717
never pays attention in class.

345
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,485
All the time asking for permission
to go to the toilet.

346
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:30,996
I'm thirsty, I want
to go to the toilet

347
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,599
Disturbs the whole class
with his silly pranks.

348
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:36,000
You must've seen his test papers?

349
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:38,701
Zeroes in all subjects.

350
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:41,807
You sent his test papers?

351
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:45,645
Last Wednesday, for parents'
signatures. They never came back.

352
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:48,674
They were a sight, I
tell you Mrs. Awasthi.

353
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,710
In fact, I sent a letter
specially to meet you

354
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:55,952
Look at this maths test.

355
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,627
Three into nine equals
three. That's all.

356
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:03,694
Not another question answered.

357
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:08,670
No one will believe
he's Yohan's brother.

358
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:17,745
Mr. Awasthi...
- Yes?

359
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:22,708
This is your son's second
year in third grade.

360
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:28,285
At this rate, I won't be
able to help you anymore.

361
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:32,761
Maybe he has a problem.

362
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,788
What do you mean?

363
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:37,323
Perhaps, he...

364
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:45,698
Some children are less fortunate.
For them, there are special schools.

365
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,675
Clear out, get out of my way!

366
00:45:58,754 --> 00:46:00,016
Worthless brats!

367
00:46:09,298 --> 00:46:10,765
She thinks my son is a retard.

368
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:12,962
She thinks my son is abnormal.

369
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:17,602
Sixty kids stuffed into a class...

370
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,799
...how can a teacher give
attention to each?

371
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:21,834
Nonsense!

372
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:27,748
What haven't I done?

373
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:30,809
I sacrificed my career
for the children.

374
00:46:31,787 --> 00:46:33,778
It's a daily struggle
to get him to study.

375
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:37,757
No Maya, it's not your fault.

376
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:41,830
He needs something else.

377
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,800
I'll be there in the morning.

378
00:46:48,804 --> 00:46:51,295
Thank you very much. Good night.

379
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:54,400
Done

380
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,940
But... in mid-term?

381
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,613
Suresh's uncle is the school's
founder trustee.

382
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:04,786
I'll pay the fees tomorrow.

383
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:06,080
No, I won't go!

384
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:09,858
Shut up and eat your dinner!

385
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,084
"Won't go."

386
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:15,863
Let's wait till next year...

387
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:19,829
He has never stayed away from me.

388
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:21,194
He'll have to learn.

389
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:23,830
You heard the principal.

390
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:26,902
Next year, she'll throw him out.

391
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,168
Then where do we go?

392
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:38,143
Look... Iook at him glaring.

393
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:40,151
No bloody regret on his face

394
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,324
Out there they'll beat
you into shape.

395
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:48,363
He got Yohan to write
that note. What next?

396
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:56,133
Trust me, I'm his father.

397
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,099
We can't afford it, but
we'll manage somehow.

398
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:04,170
Term begins after Diwali.

399
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:09,249
Please, don't send me away.

400
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:11,884
I won't go to boarding school.

401
00:48:13,189 --> 00:48:16,124
I don't want to go.

402
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,156
Please tell Papa. I don't want
to go to boarding school.

403
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:15,307
Hush.

404
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:16,441
Yes... wake up.

405
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:17,576
Mama?

406
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:19,184
I'm right here.

407
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:21,381
I don't want to go
to boarding school.

408
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,514
You have to.

409
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,252
I don't want to go.

410
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,054
It's a nice school.
- I don't want to be sent there.

411
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:33,861
I'm knowing, I'm trying, see...

412
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:35,266
Really, I know it all.

413
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:37,862
I can learn more.

414
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:40,271
I won't even ask for fireworks.
I won't celebrate Diwali.

415
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:47,611
But I don't want to go
to boarding school.

416
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:05,993
No fireworks this year? Scared
of going to boarding school?

417
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:08,934
Admit it.
- I'm not afraid.

418
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:10,938
You're afraid, I know.

419
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:12,934
I'm not afraid!
- You're afraid, I know it.

420
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:20,606
I'm not afraid.

421
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:23,942
He's crazy!

422
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,413
I won't go!

423
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,976
Your father tells me
you're very stubborn.

424
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,309
Let's get one thing straight.

425
00:50:58,954 --> 00:51:01,320
In this boarding school,
we live by one rule.

426
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:03,248
Discipline

427
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,325
Don't worry, Mr. Awasthi.

428
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:10,329
Here we've broken
the wildest horses.

429
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:23,535
Come on, we're getting late.

430
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:39,479
Done? Come on, child.

431
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:45,683
I've never told you,

432
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:50,688
how scared I am of the dark.

433
00:52:53,535 --> 00:52:58,563
I've never told you,

434
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:02,711
how much I care for you.

435
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,904
Get changed for dinner.

436
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:10,185
But you know, don't you, Ma?

437
00:53:12,354 --> 00:53:15,790
You know everything...

438
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:19,655
...my Ma.

439
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:30,732
Don't leave me alone in crowds...

440
00:53:31,774 --> 00:53:35,733
...l'll lose my way back home.

441
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:43,412
Don't send me to places far away...

442
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:48,545
...where you won't even remember me.

443
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:55,221
Am I so bad, Ma?

444
00:53:57,266 --> 00:54:00,633
Am I so bad...

445
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:07,299
You haven't changed yet? Come
on, change your clothes.

446
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:08,834
Come on.

447
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:39,337
Nine o'clock. Lights out.

448
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:41,333
Good night, sir.

449
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:47,808
When sometimes, Papa swings me.

450
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:56,349
...too high in the air...

451
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:04,359
...my eyes search for you...

452
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:12,035
...hoping you'll come
and hold me safe.

453
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:22,707
I don't tell him...

454
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:27,652
...but I get petrified.

455
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:35,524
I don't let it show...

456
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:40,600
...but my heart sinks.

457
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:47,071
You know everything, don't you Ma?

458
00:55:49,378 --> 00:55:52,541
You know everything...

459
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:56,749
...my Ma.

460
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:53,604
You aren't dressed for class yet?

461
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:57,439
Look at your tie. Didn't
Mummy teach you anything?

462
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:06,478
Boys,

463
00:57:07,255 --> 00:57:09,120
this is Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi.

464
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:14,156
Step forward... come on.

465
00:57:15,063 --> 00:57:16,496
With your bag.

466
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:23,161
From now on, your place is here,
in front of my eyes,

467
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:25,503
beside Rajan Damodaran.

468
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:29,168
Rajan Damodaran always
comes first in class.

469
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:34,839
His company will have a good
effect on you, I hope.

470
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,918
Understand? Sit down.

471
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:42,181
Today's subject, interpretation
of poetry.

472
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:45,522
Page 28, "Perspective".

473
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:51,458
Rajan Damodaran, you
will recite the poem,

474
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:57,531
and Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi,
you will interpret it.

475
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,664
Right?

476
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:01,533
Proceed, Rajan.

477
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:03,068
"Perspective"

478
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:06,543
"When I look from above, you are..."

479
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:09,476
"a cloud-filled piece of sky."

480
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:15,221
Until a thirsty elephant comes
by, or my friends jump in,

481
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:18,215
or a bicycle bell,
or a pebble or two...

482
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:21,221
...or even a blind man's
cane will do.

483
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:26,760
Then the picture dissolves and
you become our river again.

484
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:28,096
Excellent!

485
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:32,037
Now explain the meaning of the poem.

486
00:58:41,683 --> 00:58:46,518
What we see, we feel is...

487
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:50,648
And what we don't see, we feel isn't.

488
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:54,589
But sometimes...

489
00:58:54,696 --> 00:58:58,928
...what we see, actually isn't. And...
what we don't see...

490
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:02,595
...actually is. I mean...

491
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:05,605
What's all this..."is
- isn't"?

492
00:59:07,576 --> 00:59:08,668
Minu Patel, you explain.

493
00:59:09,578 --> 00:59:12,069
The poet says, when
he sees the river...

494
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,614
...he sees the sky in it.

495
00:59:14,716 --> 00:59:17,549
Using different objects, he
demolishes the reflection.

496
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:20,678
And then we realise it's a river.

497
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:24,088
Good. Very good. Minu
Patel, sit down.

498
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,801
You explained the true
meaning of the poem.

499
00:59:35,604 --> 00:59:37,765
Others just said what they crammed.

500
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:41,769
Tiwari-sir is very strict.

501
00:59:42,611 --> 00:59:45,978
So remember what he says,
and just parrot it.

502
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,616
How come you joined in
the middle of the term?

503
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:54,984
My father, he...

504
00:59:59,628 --> 01:00:01,653
Come on... art class.

505
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:17,740
You always come first in class, so
why did your parents send you here?

506
01:00:18,113 --> 01:00:19,137
Meaning?

507
01:00:19,648 --> 01:00:22,879
I mean, why did they send
you here to punish you?

508
01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:28,017
I'm not a boarder. My father is
the school's estate manager.

509
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:32,022
I live in the staff quarters,
with my parents.

510
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:36,795
And who told you everyone's
sent here to be punished?

511
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:50,374
Children, open your sketchbooks

512
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:52,712
And take out your pencils

513
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:58,712
Without using a ruler,
copy the shapes.

514
01:00:59,287 --> 01:01:04,850
The lines must be perfectly straight,
or five raps on your knuckles.

515
01:01:18,707 --> 01:01:19,731
Hey, new boy.

516
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:22,401
Eyes on the blackboard. Show us...

517
01:01:22,711 --> 01:01:24,076
...where did I make the dot?

518
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:28,206
Show us the dot.

519
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:31,876
Why are you staring like a frog?

520
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:33,215
Don't laugh

521
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:36,088
Where did I make the dot?

522
01:01:37,058 --> 01:01:38,082
Show us.

523
01:01:39,127 --> 01:01:40,151
I don't see it.

524
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:44,426
You don't see it?

525
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:46,896
Satyajit Bhatkal...
- Yes sir?

526
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:50,233
Come here and show him where I made
the point on the blackboard.

527
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,834
Now you see?

528
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,110
Very good.

529
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:00,405
Step forward.

530
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:02,743
Quickly.

531
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:09,121
Five raps on your knuckles, so
your attention never wanders.

532
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:10,782
Put out your hand.

533
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:13,785
Clench your fist.

534
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:25,273
Get on with your still life study.

535
01:02:26,174 --> 01:02:30,804
I want perfect shapes. Otherwise,
five on the other hand.

536
01:02:32,113 --> 01:02:33,137
Go!

537
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:46,886
Forward march!

538
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:50,765
Left, right, left... left,
right, left.

539
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:52,492
What are you doing?

540
01:02:52,934 --> 01:02:54,492
Halt

541
01:02:55,203 --> 01:02:57,831
You're ruining the marching order.

542
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:59,167
Out.

543
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:05,842
A noun is a naming word, a pronoun
is used instead of a noun

544
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:08,973
An adjective describes a noun, a
verb describes the action of a noun

545
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:10,779
An adverb describes the
action of a verb...

546
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:12,853
...a conjunction joins
two sentences

547
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:14,854
A preposition describes
the relationship...

548
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:16,321
...between a noun and a pronoun

549
01:03:16,424 --> 01:03:19,325
And an interjection is a word
thrown in to express feeling

550
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:23,386
Have you got it, Mr. Ishaan
Nandkishore Awasthi?

551
01:03:35,176 --> 01:03:37,269
Why?

552
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:41,079
Why can't you?

553
01:03:44,786 --> 01:03:45,810
Idiot

554
01:03:49,057 --> 01:03:50,217
Why can't you?

555
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:56,724
What's the problem?

556
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:01,295
Why are you so dumb?

557
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:15,772
Why zeroes in math?
And punishment daily?

558
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:18,114
Grammar pathetic, spelling
all wrong!

559
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:20,710
Are you tripping?!

560
01:04:20,822 --> 01:04:21,846
Idiot.
- Hey duffer!

561
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:22,980
Lazy!
- Crazy!

562
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:26,783
Garbled sentences...

563
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:27,759
...and answers all wrong?

564
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:31,056
Why don't you try?

565
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:14,774
You're a failure...

566
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:16,844
...your handwriting is terrible,
homework incomplete...

567
01:05:16,945 --> 01:05:18,310
...why's your attention adrift?

568
01:05:18,413 --> 01:05:21,314
Why?"

569
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:25,278
Idiot... duffer... lazy... crazy.

570
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,751
This child can drive anybody mad.

571
01:05:27,956 --> 01:05:30,220
Someone please call up his dad.

572
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:32,222
What's your problem, son?

573
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:33,985
King of the Morons!

574
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:37,296
Awful scores...

575
01:05:37,499 --> 01:05:38,523
...dreadful results.

576
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:39,765
Geography makes you dizzy?

577
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:41,333
Answer me, answer me!

578
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,264
Five on the knuckles!

579
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:18,072
Ishaan, open the door

580
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:20,733
Open up. Your Dada is here too.

581
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:22,066
Talk to him.

582
01:06:22,177 --> 01:06:24,202
Inu... champ, open the door

583
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:28,209
Please open the door.

584
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:18,428
What is it, champ?

585
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:25,663
Let's go.

586
01:07:25,773 --> 01:07:27,070
I've taken permission
from the house master.

587
01:07:36,517 --> 01:07:40,146
Don't be angry anymore.

588
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:45,148
Come... come along, son.

589
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:52,559
One extra mattress, please.

590
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:57,199
See what I got you. Water colours.
24-colour pack

591
01:08:38,513 --> 01:08:43,212
Hit it when it rises... excellent!
Stay focused... good Yohan!

592
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:49,714
My eyes are empty...

593
01:08:49,857 --> 01:08:54,226
...tears too have left me.

594
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:04,104
Silence fills my heart.

595
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:17,784
I feel pain no more, I'm numb.

596
01:09:20,221 --> 01:09:27,252
All feeling has left me, I'm empty.

597
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:34,464
You know everything...

598
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:36,594
...don't you, Ma?

599
01:10:19,747 --> 01:10:20,839
What are you up to?

600
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:23,276
What are you doing? Get down!

601
01:10:38,366 --> 01:10:39,390
Why did you climb up there?

602
01:10:42,303 --> 01:10:43,531
Come... we're late.

603
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:47,598
What's the matter?

604
01:10:49,177 --> 01:10:50,542
Oh, don't you know?

605
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:53,545
Holkar-sir is gone...

606
01:10:53,881 --> 01:10:56,213
to teach all of New
Zealand how to draw.

607
01:10:57,585 --> 01:11:00,349
We've got a new temporary teacher.

608
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:03,214
I hope he's different
from Holkar-sir.

609
01:11:04,592 --> 01:11:07,356
Come, we're late. Oh, come on.

610
01:12:59,173 --> 01:13:02,199
Look there, is that a tree?

611
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:06,203
Or a man covered by a cape?

612
01:13:18,926 --> 01:13:22,225
Is it raining? Or has the sky...

613
01:13:22,797 --> 01:13:26,130
left the taps on by mistake?

614
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:30,561
The world is what you make of it...

615
01:13:31,205 --> 01:13:34,572
...it's in the eye of the beholder.

616
01:13:34,675 --> 01:13:36,575
So free your mind...

617
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,577
...spread your wings...

618
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:40,579
...let the colours fly...

619
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:42,911
Come on, let's spin new dreams!

620
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:07,998
Shake it!

621
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,241
Swing-a-long!

622
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:12,241
Shake a leg!

623
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,575
It's fun!

624
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:22,416
Swing-a-long, shake a leg,
have lots of fun...

625
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:38,899
Who says fish don't fly?

626
01:14:40,107 --> 01:14:43,270
Ever thought of it?

627
01:14:43,778 --> 01:14:47,339
Does the sun bathe everyday?

628
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:51,350
Or does he just wet his hair
and pretend to be clean?

629
01:14:51,452 --> 01:14:55,354
These stars... are they twinkling?

630
01:14:55,656 --> 01:14:59,615
Or in anger, grumbling
at each other?

631
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:02,286
So free your mind...

632
01:15:02,396 --> 01:15:03,829
...spread your wings...

633
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:05,823
...let the colours fly...

634
01:15:06,267 --> 01:15:08,235
Come on, let's spin new dreams!

635
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:33,785
Why cram until your head is full?

636
01:15:33,994 --> 01:15:35,586
Head is full, head is full!

637
01:15:35,796 --> 01:15:37,730
In a blink, your mind goes blank!

638
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:39,593
Mind goes blank, mind goes blank!

639
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,597
Go ahead, unlock the doors...

640
01:15:41,802 --> 01:15:43,599
Unlock the doors, unlock the doors!

641
01:15:43,804 --> 01:15:45,601
And fearlessly, take wing!

642
01:15:45,806 --> 01:15:47,433
Take wing, take wing!

643
01:15:47,608 --> 01:15:48,540
I'm with you...

644
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:49,675
- I'm with you!

645
01:15:49,877 --> 01:15:51,242
You're with me...
- You're with me!

646
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:53,538
You and me, let's all together...

647
01:16:01,889 --> 01:16:03,618
...swing-a-long...

648
01:16:03,824 --> 01:16:05,314
...shake a leg...

649
01:16:05,493 --> 01:16:09,725
...let's have lots of fun!

650
01:16:11,365 --> 01:16:17,065
Why is the world so colourful?

651
01:16:19,106 --> 01:16:20,767
Ever wondered?

652
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:22,738
Lmagine...

653
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:26,744
Choosing these colours so lovingly...

654
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:30,680
...someone has decorated
this world with them.

655
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:34,480
So beautiful is our universe...

656
01:16:34,855 --> 01:16:38,882
I suspect its creator
is surely an artist.

657
01:16:39,527 --> 01:16:41,290
So free your mind...

658
01:16:41,529 --> 01:16:43,292
...spread your wings...

659
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:45,089
...let the colours fly!

660
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:48,425
Come on, come on...

661
01:16:48,536 --> 01:16:49,764
...let's spin new dreams!

662
01:17:20,634 --> 01:17:23,159
Here's one for each of you.

663
01:17:24,572 --> 01:17:26,597
Draw, paint, do whatever you like...

664
01:17:26,974 --> 01:17:28,942
...while I put this away.

665
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,634
But what do we paint, sir?

666
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:33,279
There's nothing on the table.

667
01:17:36,116 --> 01:17:37,140
This table?

668
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:44,557
This table is too small for
your beautiful imagination.

669
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:46,958
Peek into your mind...

670
01:17:47,194 --> 01:17:49,526
...and pull out an image...

671
01:17:49,964 --> 01:17:51,522
...then slap it onto the paper!

672
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:56,968
Have fun. In here, you're free.

673
01:18:44,652 --> 01:18:45,676
Lost somewhere, friend?

674
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:49,012
Looking for inspiration?

675
01:18:51,792 --> 01:18:54,352
No problem, there's no hurry.

676
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:06,757
What is the matter, child?

677
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:10,433
Don't you like painting?

678
01:20:17,745 --> 01:20:18,769
What's your name, son?

679
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:24,913
Sir, his name is Ishaan Awasthi.

680
01:20:51,311 --> 01:20:54,280
Where have you been?

681
01:20:55,182 --> 01:20:56,342
Your mother called.

682
01:20:57,051 --> 01:20:59,815
Wait by the phone.
She'll call again.

683
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,840
Is Ishaan there?

684
01:21:21,975 --> 01:21:24,967
Yes one moment, he's here.

685
01:21:25,746 --> 01:21:26,804
Here.

686
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:39,182
Say hello, son.

687
01:21:41,361 --> 01:21:42,385
Look Inu...

688
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:46,197
we can't come on Saturday.

689
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:50,533
On Sunday, Dada has his
inter-school tennis finals.

690
01:21:52,906 --> 01:21:54,931
I know you're very angry with Mama.

691
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,875
Mama is very bad.

692
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,540
I'm very sorry, Inu.

693
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:05,009
But what can Mama do?

694
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:08,221
Dada is very tense about
the final match.

695
01:22:10,124 --> 01:22:11,216
Will you talk to Dada?

696
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:12,883
Here, talk to Dada.

697
01:22:12,993 --> 01:22:15,359
And wish him all the best.

698
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:20,597
Inu, are you there?

699
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:27,030
I'll miss you at the finals.

700
01:22:30,277 --> 01:22:35,909
Son, talk to Mama.

701
01:22:43,423 --> 01:22:44,856
He's left.

702
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:47,051
He left?
- Yes.

703
01:22:47,427 --> 01:22:48,451
Sorry.

704
01:22:50,097 --> 01:22:51,325
What happened?

705
01:22:54,301 --> 01:22:55,393
He didn't say a word.

706
01:22:57,304 --> 01:22:59,067
Don't worry, we'll go next Sunday.

707
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:06,943
What are you putting in there?

708
01:23:08,448 --> 01:23:09,472
The kids' class-work.

709
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:13,883
So what? Holkar never used that
space. It's meant for books.

710
01:23:15,055 --> 01:23:16,079
So where do I keep these?

711
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:18,886
Return them to the boys.
What use are they anyway?

712
01:23:20,327 --> 01:23:22,887
What a racket they're making
in your class, Nikumbh.

713
01:23:22,996 --> 01:23:24,224
Like a fish market.

714
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:27,901
They're kids, it's natural.

715
01:23:28,535 --> 01:23:32,096
And if kids don't express emotions
in an art class, where will they?

716
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:37,309
That may be, but go easy. The
headmaster likes discipline.

717
01:23:40,948 --> 01:23:45,647
I believe you sang in class
yesterday and played a flute?

718
01:23:46,954 --> 01:23:48,979
Yes I sang, played a flute...

719
01:23:50,023 --> 01:23:51,456
kids happy, I'm happy.

720
01:23:52,226 --> 01:23:54,285
But our students aren't
like those kids.

721
01:23:56,496 --> 01:23:57,520
What do you mean?

722
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:04,970
You teach in Tulips School,
don't you...

723
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:08,006
mentally retarded, abnormal kids?

724
01:24:08,809 --> 01:24:11,710
In those schools, experiment all you
like, what difference will it make?

725
01:24:11,979 --> 01:24:14,004
They have no future, anyway.

726
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:15,541
No seriously, Nikumbh.

727
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:17,549
This is a formal school.

728
01:24:17,651 --> 01:24:20,347
Your singing-dancing style
won't work here.

729
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:24,015
Here, we prepare children
for life's race.

730
01:24:24,124 --> 01:24:26,957
Kids have to compete, succeed,
make a future.

731
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,028
Our school's motto is...

732
01:24:29,396 --> 01:24:32,229
"Order, Discipline, Labour".

733
01:24:33,305 --> 01:24:39,879
