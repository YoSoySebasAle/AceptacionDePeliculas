1
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,496
Derek.

2
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,999
Derek.

3
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,626
Derek.

4
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:13,004
- Fucking pervert, Dan.
- Jesus, what the fuck are you thinking?

5
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:16,007
There's a black guy outside.
He's breaking into your car.

6
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,802
- How long's he been there?
- I don't know.

7
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,347
- What's going on?
- Not right now, honey. How many?

8
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:26,184
- Danny, how many?
- One, I think.

9
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,269
- Is he strapped?
- Huh?

10
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,439
- Does he have a fucking gun, Danny?
- Man, I don't fucking know.

11
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,526
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on, Derek?

12
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,445
- Stay right here and be quiet.
- Jesus.

13
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:40,365
- Stay right here.
- Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

14
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,991
Derek.

15
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,745
Shh, shh, shh.

16
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,413
They're right here.

17
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,641
<i>I don't have a personal problem
with him, okay?</i>

18
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,352
Don't insult my intelligence, Murray.

19
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,314
You hate this child
and I think I know why.

20
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,032
I went out with his mother a few times.

21
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,326
That was three years ago. It was nothing.

22
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:49,827
Nothing. Really? Hmm.

23
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:53,122
That paper, Bob, it's a travesty.

24
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,167
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?

25
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,752
You've gotta draw the line.

26
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,004
Murray, you actually did this to yourself.

27
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,632
You told them they could
do a report on any book...

28
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,010
...that related to the struggle
for civil rights. In plain English.

29
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:11,849
I am not disputing the fact that the child
is confused and harbors some sick ideas...

30
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:14,644
...but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

31
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,438
His brother probably put him up to it.

32
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,609
I can guarantee you 100 percent
his brother did not put him up to this.

33
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,112
I find that hard to believe. Whatever.

34
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,365
I know he was a good kid
and it's a shame what he's been through...

35
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,784
- ...but that is dangerous.
- Dangerous in what way?

36
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,620
Bob, that goes too far.

37
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:36,415
This racist propaganda,
this <i>Mein Kampf</i> psychobabble?

38
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,502
He learned this nonsense, Murray,
and he can unlearn it too.

39
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,338
I will not give up on this child yet.

40
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,025
- I knew it was you.
- Danny, get in here.

41
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:07,238
I said, get in here. Get in here!

42
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,031
Five, four, three...

43
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,993
...two... Shut the door.

44
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,706
What's it gonna be, Danny?

45
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,167
What's what gonna be?

46
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,752
This petty crap you're pulling.

47
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:24,755
I don't know.

48
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,465
Have a seat.

49
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,557
How you doing?

50
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,186
Fine.

51
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,605
Things at home okay?

52
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:42,982
Yeah.

53
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,279
Derek got out this morning, did he not?

54
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,283
Yeah, he did.

55
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,786
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

56
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:59,624
Honors English.
He was a brilliant student.

57
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,961
Like you. But he hung out
with simple-minded fools.

58
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,297
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Also like you.

59
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,925
Look, did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

60
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,302
Because what happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

61
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,972
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

62
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,725
Look, I followed directions
and I wrote an A paper.

63
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,978
<i>"Mein Kampf"?</i>

64
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,482
- I should expel you.
- Go ahead.

65
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,653
- You don't think I could handle it?
- No, I think the street would kill you.

66
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:32,490
Your rhetoric and your propaganda
aren't gonna save you out there.

67
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,910
So here's the drill.

68
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,621
I'm your history teacher from now on.

69
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,333
We will discuss current events.

70
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,919
We will call this class...

71
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,839
...American History X.

72
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,842
We meet once a day.

73
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:56,681
All right, your first assignment is to
prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.

74
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,476
Oh, come on. It took me a week
to read <i>Mein Kampf</i>. That isn't fair.

75
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,447
- What do you want me to do it on?
- Your brother.

76
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,867
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

77
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,203
No, no, no. I'm not kidding.

78
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,709
I want you to analyze and interpret all the
events surrounding Derek's incarceration.

79
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:28,504
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

80
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:32,091
...concerning life
in contemporary America.

81
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:34,010
The impact on your life.

82
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,262
Your family's.

83
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,933
Whatever you wanna say, Danny...

84
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,397
...I'll be the only one reading it.

85
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,067
But if it's not on my desk...

86
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,028
...tomorrow morning...

87
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,073
...you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.

88
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,243
Are you clear?

89
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,204
Yeah, I'm clear.

90
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,253
Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating?

91
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,547
Is that what's happening?

92
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,842
- I never cheated in my life.
- Beat his motherfucking ass, Henry.

93
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,762
- I didn't say anything.
- Why you tripping on me?

94
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,767
Why you all kicking him like that?

95
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,602
What's up, man?

96
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,938
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

97
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,989
What's up?

98
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:41,285
Want some too, bitch?
Punk. What's wrong with you?

99
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,245
You wanna die?

100
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,540
Punk-ass white boy.

101
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,300
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

102
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,345
He don't wanna see me and the heater.

103
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,141
Lucky the bell rung.
I would have clocked that white boy.

104
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,768
Punk-ass motherfucker.

105
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:06,977
We'd smoke that fool.

106
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,481
You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.

107
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,207
We got a whole file on skinheads.

108
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,335
- These all part of the same gang?
- Venice Beach Gang.

109
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,921
- Where's my buddy?
- He's doing a stretch at YA.

110
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,424
- This guy C.C.?
- Mm-hm.

111
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,176
- That him?
- Yeah, that's him right there.

112
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,348
This morning we have a guest coming in,
and there he is.

113
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,559
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

114
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,352
- Good to see you, pal.
- Morning.

115
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,646
Gentlemen, this here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

116
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,190
He's principal over at Venice Beach High.

117
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:58,112
He's been doing outreach work with gangs,
both in and out of the can.

118
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,781
Three years ago,
a local kid named Derek Vinyard...

119
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,452
...was sent up for murdering two Crips
who were trying to jack his car.

120
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:09,039
Bob taught Vinyard back in high school
and he's followed the case closely.

121
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,834
He was a skinhead, right?

122
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:16,172
He was more like the skinhead.
The protégé of Cameron Alexander.

123
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:19,049
- Who?
- Cameron Alexander.

124
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,385
Here you go. Have a look-see.

125
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:23,721
Cameron Alexander, well...

126
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,473
...he's a Venice Beach landmark.

127
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,226
He's probably the biggest distributor
of white-power literature and videos...

128
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,478
...in L.A. County.

129
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,147
He promotes white-power bands.
He writes reviews.

130
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:36,233
And, uh, in his spare time
this guy even writes hate columns.

131
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,693
Does he have a record?

132
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,069
He's pretty clean.

133
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,864
Been trying to pin something to him,
but it doesn't work.

134
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,742
Trust me. He's behind all of it.

135
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:47,203
He runs everything out of his house
down by the beach.

136
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,413
No white gangs in Venice Beach...

137
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,916
...before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

138
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,085
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

139
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:59,256
Essentially, he used Derek
to recruit a slew of insecure...

140
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,425
...frustrated and impressionable kids.

141
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:05,262
This kid Vinyard, well,
he's got a lot of baggage...

142
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,391
...as you'll see in this tape
that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

143
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,026
<i>L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard...</i>

144
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,696
<i>...was shot and killed battling a blaze
at a suspected Compton drug den.</i>

145
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,615
<i>We're at the Vinyard home right now...</i>

146
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:28,786
<i>...and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son,
Derek, has agreed to talk with us.</i>

147
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,748
<i>Derek, if you could come down here,
please, for just a second.</i>

148
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,794
<i>Look, I know this is tough,
but, um, how do you feel right now?</i>

149
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,463
<i>How do you think I feel?</i>

150
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,842
<i>- I think it's typical.
- Typical, how?</i>

151
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,721
<i>This country's becoming a haven
for criminals, so, what do you expect?</i>

152
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,140
<i>Decent, hardworking Americans
like my dad...</i>

153
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,394
<i>...are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.</i>

154
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,229
<i>Parasites?</i>

155
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,899
<i>Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever.</i>

156
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,192
<i>I don't understand.</i>

157
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,486
<i>You're saying your father's murder
was race-related?</i>

158
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,488
<i>Yeah, it's race-related.</i>

159
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,284
<i>Every problem in this country
is race-related, not just crime.</i>

160
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,204
<i>Immigration, AIDS, welfare. Those are
problems of the black community...</i>

161
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:15,332
<i>...the Hispanic community,
Asian community. Not white problems.</i>

162
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,501
<i>Aren't those issues
that deal more with poverty?</i>

163
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:21,589
<i>No. They're not products of their
environments, either. That's crap.</i>

164
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,966
<i>Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.</i>

165
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,552
<i>They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.</i>

166
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,972
<i>Millions of white European-Americans
came here and flourished.</i>

167
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,183
<i>Within a generation. What the fuck
is the matter with these people?</i>

168
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,936
<i>They have to go around shooting at firemen.</i>

169
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:41,233
<i>- What does this have to do with your father?
- My father was murdered doing his job.</i>

170
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,527
<i>Putting out a fire
in a nigger neighborhood...</i>

171
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,529
<i>...he shouldn't have given
a shit about.</i>

172
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:49,366
<i>He got shot by a fucking drug dealer
who probably collects a welfare check.</i>

173
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,327
<i>- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.</i>

174
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,371
Derek Vinyard was released
from Chino earlier this morning...

175
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,749
...after serving three and some-odd years.

176
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,460
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

177
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,420
If something happens to him...

178
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,048
...things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

179
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,466
Just keep it low.

180
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,887
<i>Venice Beach didn't always look like this.</i>

181
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:12,473
<i>It used to be a great neighborhood.</i>

182
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,475
<i>The boardwalk's always been a dump...</i>

183
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,518
<i>...but when my dad moved us out here...</i>

184
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,188
<i>...Venice was a nice, quiet place
to grow up.</i>

185
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,817
<i>Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.</i>

186
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,070
<i>The gangs are like a plague.</i>

187
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,947
<i>They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central...</i>

188
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,532
<i>...and basically took over.</i>

189
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,993
It ain't fouling you.
What's wrong with you?

190
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,498
Fuck all y'all.

191
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,585
I ain't got time for all the bullshit.

192
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,587
Fuck y'all.

193
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,048
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

194
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:50,302
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

195
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,930
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

196
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,562
Yeah, man, that's him.

197
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,448
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

198
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,784
<i>That's why Derek started the D.O.C.</i>

199
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:18,288
<i>He said white kids shouldn't have to walk
around scared in their own neighborhood.</i>

200
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:22,376
<i>For a while there, he really made it
like it was ours again.</i>

201
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,962
- Throw the ball. Throw the ball.
- Come on, Seth. Block.

202
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:28,966
Come on, Curtis. Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

203
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,468
- Pass that thing.
- D up.

204
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,637
- Here we go.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

205
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:34,847
Come on.

206
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:39,143
Look at this fucking jungle bunny.
He does a spin move every time. Every time.

207
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,106
- You ain't getting shit, motherfucker.
- Over here. Over here.

208
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,649
This one's for you, boy!

209
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,819
- Fuck you—?
- Stop that.

210
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,446
Who you calling a boy, motherfucker?

211
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,907
You lucky motherfucker! I'm through
monkeying around with your ass!

212
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,535
You pale, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker...

213
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,662
...a hundred bucks say
I make you my bitch.

214
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,669
Hear that? He's trying to make ends meet
for his cut in welfare. You're fucking on!

215
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,841
- It's 8-6, Seth.
- When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.

216
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,510
Come on, guys, I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

217
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,014
- You have a big fucking mouth, Seth.
- I can take this niglet down.

218
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,600
You can't take a shit.
The fuck are you thinking?

219
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,519
- I will beat him. Give me the money.
- Shut up. Shut up.

220
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,938
You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
Shut up!

221
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,448
I'll take care of this.

222
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,618
Hey.

223
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,038
I got a bet.

224
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:46,794
I come in this game right now. Same score,
but we play black guys against white guys.

225
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,047
Motherfucker.

226
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,132
Oh, shit.

227
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,176
Name your price, cracker.

228
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,512
No money. No money. For these courts.

229
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,472
And not just today. For good.

230
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,851
If you win, we will walk away.
But if we win...

231
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,145
...no bitching, no fighting...

232
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:09,233
...here in front of everybody, pack your
shit and get your black asses out of here.

233
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,318
Man, fuck that. Take this bet, man.

234
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,861
Eight to six, our ball.

235
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,989
Let's go.

236
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,256
Pick him up. Pick him up.

237
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,556
Seth, get back and play some D!

238
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,516
Come on, Seth.

239
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,436
Come on, let's go.

240
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,406
All right. Defense!

241
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,914
All right.

242
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,292
Pass the fucking ball, I was wide open.

243
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,505
Damn!

244
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,883
Let's go. Let's go, yo. Let's go.

245
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,718
Pick, pick, Derek!

246
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,058
Bullshit! That's offense.

247
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,437
- Get out of here. He moved his feet.
- If you want to go, I'm ready!

248
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,063
- Don't throw elbows!
- Want to go?

249
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,316
Adolf Hitler-wannabe motherfucker?
What?

250
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,819
Kill that motherfucker! Dead!

251
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,654
Chill out, bro. Chill out.

252
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,158
- Wait, it's cool. It's cool.
- Relax.

253
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,246
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me some water.

254
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:50,167
- You gotta call offense on that shit, Der.
- Not on game point, Danny.

255
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,461
You can't let niggers
get away with that shit.

256
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:56,423
- Honey, it's game point.
- Shut them down, Derek. Kick some ass.

257
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,175
Watch this.

258
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,707
Get that ball.

259
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,126
Pass the ball, baby. Pass the ball.

260
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,801
Yeah!

261
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,562
Bye-bye.

262
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,564
Get the fuck off my court.

263
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,984
- This is my house.
- Fuck you, bitch.

264
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,031
- What happened?
- I dropped the ball!

265
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,241
Yeah!

266
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:13,750
Get the fuck out of here!
This is my court! Yes!

267
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,174
Yeah.

268
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,887
<i>Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.</i>

269
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,098
<i>He said it would make it
too hard for him...</i>

270
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,435
<i>...and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.</i>

271
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,855
<i>Three years without him,
just wondering...</i>

272
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,776
<i>...and then at 7:00 this morning...</i>

273
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,529
<i>...we picked him up outside the gate.</i>

274
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,576
- Come on, Danny.
- Der.

275
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:51,246
<i>The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.</i>

276
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:55,959
<i>I wanted to stay home, but he said,
"No, go to school. I'll see you later."</i>

277
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,767
Oh, come on. Give the guy a break.

278
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,144
What's the matter?
You too big to give me a hug?

279
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,353
No, man.

280
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,566
I just know you'll need someone to look after
you while you adjust to all this space.

281
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,068
Yeah, right.

282
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,821
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

283
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,324
- How you doing? How's school?
- It's good. It's good.

284
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,494
You gotta do something about that hair.
That 'do has gotta go.

285
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,789
- I don't know. The girls like it, so...
- Well, I don't.

286
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,208
You're keeping it pretty close.
All the way down, huh?

287
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,918
Yeah.

288
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,962
Shit, look, I forgot, man.

289
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:45,175
- It hurt like shit while they put it on.
- When did you get that?

290
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,719
I got it about a month ago.

291
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,304
Cameron made it official.

292
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:52,474
- Cameron?
- Yeah.

293
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,686
- He put this on you?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

294
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,359
- Hello?
- What?

295
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,027
Hi. Just hang on a second.

296
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,279
Derek, it's for you.

297
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,824
Nothing. Nothing.

298
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,430
- There a phone in the back?
- Mm-hm.

299
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,244
I'll get it in the back.

300
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,586
I got it.

301
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,047
Yeah? Oh, hey.

302
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,176
What?

303
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,056
<i>My eyes have seen the glory
Of the trampling at the zoo</i>

304
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:38,395
<i>We washed ourselves in niggers' blood
And all the mongrels' too</i>

305
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:43,567
<i>We're taking down the ZOG machine
Jew by Jew, by Jew</i>

306
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,237
<i>The white man marches on</i>

307
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,490
You think our friend was behind that?

308
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,577
You know what? I don't even care.

309
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,537
I'm gonna take care of that tonight.

310
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,038
Mwah.

311
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,249
My sweet kid. My baby boy.

312
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,419
God, what's with the love fest, you guys?

313
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,094
No, he'll do it.
He'll do it. I'll make sure he does it.

314
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:13,597
I'll get it.

315
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,939
- Came to see the man.
- Can you fit through the door?

316
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,608
Fuck you!

317
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,195
- Seth.
- What's up, Dan?

318
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,322
How you doing? Where's Derek?

319
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,531
He's on the phone.

320
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:35,076
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Vinyard, where the fuck are you?

321
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,912
- Vinyard!
- Hang on.

322
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,122
- Give me a minute.
- Vinyard!

323
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,583
No, I'll be out in a minute.

324
00:25:56,598 --> 00:26:00,977
I'm being careful. What am I gonna do? I
won't stay in my room the rest of my life.

325
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,230
Hold on.

326
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:06,566
Hey. Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

327
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,944
Did you invite him over?

328
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,738
No, he always comes over here.

329
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,658
All right. Danny, give me a minute.

330
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,953
Just give me one minute.

331
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:28,922
Yeah.

332
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,598
God, are you still here, Goodyear?

333
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,769
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

334
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,357
When was the last time
you were able to see your feet?

335
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:51,778
Come in here, Danny.

336
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,365
Seth.

337
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,618
Hey, man,
you going to Cam's party tonight?

338
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,704
Is Davina's ass watertight?

339
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,164
You're fucking sick, man.

340
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:06,209
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

341
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,296
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework to do.

342
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:13,049
Tell me some of the shit you've learned,
fuck-ass, before I pistol-whip you.

343
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:18,388
Okay. I believe in death, destruction,
chaos, filth and greed.

344
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:22,225
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I wanna hear, asshole.

345
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:28,231
- You mean that shit about your mother?
- You wanna get fucking beaten, Danny?

346
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:33,236
I'm not fucking talking to you, Davina.
Why don't you shut up?

347
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,448
Look, you got to let me do this
my own way, all right?

348
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,409
I'll take care of it.

349
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,619
Who do you hate, Danny?

350
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:44,497
I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.

351
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,874
Why?

352
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,543
They're a burden to the advancement
of the white race.

353
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,048
- Some of them are all right, I guess.
- None of them are fucking all right, Danny.

354
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,884
They're all fucking freeloaders.
Remember what Cam said?

355
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:59,888
"We don't know them. We don't wanna
know them. They're the fucking enemy."

356
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,060
What don't you like about them?
And say it with some fucking conviction.

357
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:08,355
I hate the fact that it's cool
to be black these days.

358
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,024
- Good.
- I hate this hip-hop...

359
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,610
...fucking influence
on white fucking suburbia.

360
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,613
- Good.
- And I hate Tabitha Soren...

361
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,157
...and all her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

362
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,034
...telling us we should get along.

363
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,912
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

364
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,955
...because it ain't gonna fucking happen.

365
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,792
That's the best shit I've heard
come out of your mouth.

366
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,628
Danny, no. I feel sorry for you, Danny.

367
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,213
I know you don't believe that.

368
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,715
- Shut up, Davina!
- No, you shut the fuck up!

369
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,468
Get out of the house, you piece of shit!
Please go.

370
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,428
Is that any way to talk to a guest?

371
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:41,679
A friend of the family?

372
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:45,600
- Derek hates you and you don't realize it.
- Hey, how do you know who I hate?

373
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,769
Fucking A. Back from the dead.

374
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,438
God bless Jesus Christ, man.

375
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:54,234
I think you lost weight, man. I can get
my arms almost all the way around you.

376
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:58,488
Fifty fucking pounds, man.
Jesus, look at this hair. Holy shit.

377
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,658
- Yeah, I told him it's gotta go.
- It's good to have you back.

378
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,327
Grab your jacket,
let's get the fuck out of here.

379
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,663
All right. I wanna talk to him one second.

380
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,997
Look...

381
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,417
Hey, uh, listen...

382
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,669
...did you pull some shit
in school today?

383
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:16,172
- No, just the usual.
- I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome.

384
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,843
- Did you turn in a paper on <i>Mein Kampf?</i>
- Yeah.

385
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,249
- Awesome.
- You should've—

386
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,763
- Sweeney probably shit his pants.
- He did, man.

387
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,641
Did Cameron put you up to that?
Did he tell you to do that?

388
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,978
No, man, I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know, though?

389
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,855
- How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter how.

390
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,190
This kid is smart as hell.

391
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,276
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

392
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,153
Yeah, Sweeney called.

393
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,155
What are you talking to Sweeney for?

394
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,615
- Relax. Listen.
- He's got to get a fucking life.

395
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,535
- He pisses me off.
- Sweeney's a good teacher, all right?

396
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,329
Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip,
Vinyard.

397
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,582
That's what he was like
when we were there.

398
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,668
- And it'll never change. Fuck that nigger!
- Hey, Seth.

399
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,379
- Seth, go away. Go away.
- What? Are you kidding?

400
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:59,924
Go wait in Danny's room. I wanna
talk to my brother. I'm glad to see you.

401
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:02,635
- I'll be there in one minute.
- Hurry up. I'm starving.

402
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,808
Come here. Seriously, look...

403
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,562
Forget this yahoo. He kills bugs for a
living. You don't wanna be like that.

404
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,731
I'm serious. It's not funny.

405
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,025
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn from him.

406
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,402
So don't fuck it up
with small-fry shit like that.

407
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,070
You got to be smarter than that.

408
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,907
You gotta see the bullshit paper
he's making me write.

409
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:26,534
I know about it. He told me about it.
I don't care.

410
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,245
Do it. You do anything he tells
you to do. I mean it.

411
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:32,290
I don't want you in trouble in school,
trying to impress me...

412
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,709
...taking this shit in there, all right?

413
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,544
Do you understand what I'm saying?

414
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,111
I guess, but I was doing it
because I thought you'd be happy.

415
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,383
Well, I'm not.

416
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,221
Shit. Listen to that.

417
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,765
Yeah, I know. It's been getting worse.

418
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,602
All right, don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you about this later.

419
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,437
- Okay.
- Later.

420
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,484
She's coughing her lungs out and you're
blowing this shit in her face all day.

421
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,211
- Put it out.
- I'm putting it out.

422
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,445
All right. Come on.

423
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,698
Hey. Come on, I wanna talk to you.

424
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,705
Mommy, are you okay?

425
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,255
What are you doing? Put that out.

426
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,466
I'm yelling at him for blowing smoke
and you're here sucking on it.

427
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,426
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

428
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,178
Yeah.

429
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,265
You all right?

430
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,766
You all right?

431
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,399
Look...

432
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,068
...you gotta take it easy.
You gotta get some rest.

433
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:45,488
I want you to take Danny's and my room
and we'll hit the couch.

434
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:49,200
- Couch is fine for now.
- No, it's not fine. It's not. This is terrible.

435
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,327
We can't live like this.

436
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:53,538
We gotta get out of here.

437
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:57,250
Can I go with you?

438
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,795
Yeah, we all gotta get out of here.
That's the point.

439
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,338
I could drop out of school.

440
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:06,342
No. No, absolutely not. You gotta finish.
I'll work something out.

441
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:14,434
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

442
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,686
I don't give a shit!
Go wait in the living room!

443
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:19,355
- God.
- I want him out of my house.

444
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:22,066
I know, I know. Look.

445
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,500
He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot.

446
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,378
Whatever, dude. He can't help it.
I gotta do that paper.

447
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,881
Look, I'm gonna catch up with you
later tonight.

448
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,967
Not at Cameron's, all right?
I need you to stay away from there.

449
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:51,512
- Why? I thought we were gonna hang.
- Trust me. I'll explain it later.

450
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,641
I need you to stay away from the party,
all right?

451
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,309
- Whatever.
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

452
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,561
Promise me you'll stay
away from that party.

453
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,147
I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?

454
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:03,650
Whatever.

455
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,111
God!

456
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,410
Come on, let's go.

457
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,748
- Where are you parked?
- Out back.

458
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,778
- Yeah, that's the whole bunch.
- Right.

459
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,573
<i>It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself.</i>

460
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,867
<i>And Cameron knew just how to use it.</i>

461
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,994
You sure you don't wanna
stick around?

462
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,329
You know I'd love to...

463
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,998
...but I gotta be careful.

464
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,332
Yeah, I know.

465
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:47,003
- We'll see you back at the house, then.
- Right.

466
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,671
- All right.
- Good luck.

467
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,923
<i>He sent Derek to the kids...</i>

468
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,675
<i>...to the frustrated ones.</i>

469
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:57,013
<i>The ones who were sick of getting their
asses kicked by black and Mexican gangs.</i>

470
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,514
<i>Don't just be some punk...</i>

471
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,932
<i>...be part of something.</i>

472
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,602
All right, let's go. Pull it together.

473
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:07,398
<i>And everybody ate it up.
They did whatever Derek told them to.</i>

474
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,318
Let's go. Come on,
we're not here to fucking socialize.

475
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,614
- Shut the fuck up.
- Check this shit out, man.

476
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:18,701
You want a little toke? Huh? Go ahead.

477
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:21,329
- Curtis, what is that?
- Aw, come on, Derek.

478
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,706
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

479
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:26,876
- Aw, Jesus fucking Christ.
- Have a little self-respect.

480
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:32,423
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

481
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:39,055
There's over 2 million illegal immigrants
bedding down in this state tonight.

482
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,768
This state spent $3 billion last year...

483
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:47,313
...on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place.

484
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,898
Three billion dollars.

485
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:54,111
Four hundred million dollars just to lock up
a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals...

486
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:57,156
...who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

487
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:01,035
...it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

488
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,666
Who gives a shit?
Our government doesn't give a shit.

489
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,919
Our border policy is a joke.

490
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:14,173
So is anybody surprised that south
of the border they're laughing at us?

491
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,092
- Laughing at our laws.
- Yeah.

492
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:19,095
Every night these parasites
stream across the border...

493
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,847
...like some fucking piñata exploded.

494
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,181
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Don't laugh!

495
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:26,686
There's nothing funny going on here.
This is about your life and mine.

496
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:31,148
It's about decent, hardworking Americans
falling through the cracks...

497
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,860
...and getting the shaft.
The government cares about...

498
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:38,531
...the constitutional rights of a bunch of
people who aren't citizens of this country!

499
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:42,660
On the Statue of Liberty, it says, "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor."

500
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:45,413
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

501
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,125
And I say until you take care of that,
close the fucking book!

502
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,210
Because we're losing.

503
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:55,131
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

504
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,966
We're losing our freedom...

505
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,970
...so that a bunch of fucking foreigners
can come in and exploit our country.

506
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:03,973
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

507
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,018
This isn't happening in places
we can't do anything about it.

508
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:11,647
It's happening right here! Right in our
neighborhood. Right in that building.

509
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:15,151
Archie Miller ran that grocery store
since we were kids here.

510
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:18,112
Dave worked there, Mike worked there.

511
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,908
He went under, and now some fucking
Korean owns it, who fired these guys...

512
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:26,370
...and is making a killing because
he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.

513
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:29,916
I see this shit going on and I don't see
anybody doing anything about it.

514
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,918
And it fucking pisses me off!

515
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,005
So look around you.

516
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:39,258
This isn't our neighborhood.
It's a battlefield.

517
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,386
We're on a battlefield tonight.
Make a decision.

518
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:45,514
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines...

519
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,476
...quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

520
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,061
Fuck that.

521
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,021
Are we gonna ante up
and do something?

522
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,689
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

523
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,107
You're goddamn right we are.

524
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,080
Come here!

525
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:13,042
Don't you know it's against the law
to hire border-jumpers, you nip bastard?

526
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,004
Fuck that! Fuck that!

527
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,095
Sweetheart. No, you don't need this.
We're not gonna hurt you.

528
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,847
Please! Please, no!

529
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,142
You fucking spic!

530
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:35,856
You know what?
I think this bitch is hungry.

531
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:38,067
This bitch stinks.
Get me cleaning products.

532
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,152
Smells like fish and chips
and guacamole.

533
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,612
Here we go.

534
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,656
Yeah, that's it.

535
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:00,089
Get the fuck up!

536
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,970
Get down!

537
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,688
Have some fucking beans,
you goddamn beaner.

538
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,023
Yeah!

539
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,692
- Take my job.
- You donkey bitch!

540
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,476
Get some of that in there.

541
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:28,743
- Throw it on, throw it on.
- Hey, that's a great color on you.

542
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,703
You can get a white woman's job,
bitch.

543
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,581
- A little better than this one, huh?
- Yeah.

544
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,792
- White.
- You can move up in the world, huh?

545
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,879
Asshole!

546
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,760
Let's go. We're out of here.
Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!

547
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,306
All right, let's go! Let's go!

548
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:53,726
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

549
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,644
Let's go.

550
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:01,942
No green card, no fucking work,
<i>comprendes?</i>

551
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:05,988
- Come on. Come on!
- Go, go, go.

552
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:07,490
We're fucking done! Come on!

553
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,686
<i>Dad was gone.
But things were almost normal again.</i>

554
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:41,357
<i>Derek had a good job.
Mom was starting to live a little.</i>

555
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:45,694
<i>Everyone was feeling so good
that we just didn't see it coming.</i>

556
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,488
<i>Maybe we should have.</i>

557
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:51,200
The irony is that most of the stores
that were destroyed during the riots...

558
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,953
- ...were owned by black people.
- That's stupid, though.

559
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,579
Why trash your own neighborhood?

560
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,541
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

561
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:03,003
It's like an expression of rage
by people who feel neglected...

562
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,713
...and turned away by the system.

563
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,675
Exactly.
I mean, it's like we had in Watts...

564
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,261
...or the riots in Chicago in '68—

565
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,887
I don't buy that for a minute.

566
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:15,724
Calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage, that's such a cop-out.

567
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,352
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people...

568
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,647
...grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store.

569
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:23,816
The fact these people ripped off stores...

570
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,652
...in their own communities
reflects that these people...

571
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,612
...have no respect for the law.

572
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:33,159
And certainly no concept of community
or civic responsibility.

573
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,912
Wait a minute. White people commit
crimes against white people too.

574
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,416
But they're not offing each other
in record numbers all over America.

575
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,418
Look at the statistics, for chrissakes.

576
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:47,006
One in every three black males is in
some phase of the correctional system.

577
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:51,177
Is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime?

578
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:53,512
Not only that. They're proud of it.

579
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,724
Maybe it says something about prejudice
in the judicial system.

580
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:58,767
If you wanna talk about
criminal statistics...

581
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:02,605
...you might wanna take a look at
the social inequalities that produce them.

582
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,811
Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.

583
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,693
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

584
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,947
...and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions.

585
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:13,616
It's like saying:

586
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:17,077
"It's not a riot, it's rage.
It's not crime, it's poverty."

587
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:21,373
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit. It's
exactly what happened in this trial too.

588
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,960
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops...

589
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,670
...whether they'd get convicted...

590
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:29,965
...and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

591
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,259
Everybody lost sight
of Rodney King himself.

592
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:35,387
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

593
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:39,642
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.

594
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:43,562
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

595
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:46,315
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.

596
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:50,319
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through...

597
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:52,363
...so all we see is them hitting him.

598
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,575
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs...

599
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:59,286
...and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

600
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,789
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

601
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,165
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

602
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:06,252
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves...

603
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:09,797
...for using absolutely standard,
textbook self-defense procedures.

604
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:11,924
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

605
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:15,010
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

606
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:17,346
Murray, what do you think?

607
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:22,935
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

608
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:26,438
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

609
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:29,525
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

610
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:33,862
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls...

611
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:37,783
...because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

612
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,704
You know? Unfortunately, very few
people, like, respect that authority.

613
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,707
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

614
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,834
- What?
- Davina.

615
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,878
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.

616
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:53,048
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

617
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,552
I don't respect laws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

618
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:58,512
Second, I am not, as you well know...

619
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,392
...a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

620
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,894
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

621
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,605
You've gotten off the point.

622
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:13,402
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?

623
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,404
All right, think about this.

624
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:17,740
If Danny had been
walking across the street...

625
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:22,286
- ...and Rodney King had plowed into him—
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

626
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:23,912
Mm-hm.

627
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,713
Who would like some dessert?

628
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:35,591
We're having a discussion.

629
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:38,010
We're having a nice discussion, right?

630
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,846
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP...

631
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:43,098
...and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

632
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,809
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

633
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:47,728
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

634
00:44:47,895 --> 00:44:50,981
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.

635
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:57,780
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...

636
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,866
...everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

637
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:03,744
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

638
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:06,205
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

639
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:10,250
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

640
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,627
I mean, it blows my mind.

641
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:13,796
We're hung up on this notion
we have some...

642
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,548
...obligation to help
the struggling black man.

643
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:20,302
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

644
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:22,888
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

645
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:24,431
All this liberal nonsense.

646
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:27,976
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

647
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:31,814
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 130 years ago?

648
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,566
How long does it take
to get your act together?

649
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:37,653
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

650
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,573
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

651
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:45,994
Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.

652
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:49,998
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.

653
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:53,085
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

654
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:55,754
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

655
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:59,299
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

656
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,844
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

657
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,847
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

658
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,515
The hell do you think you are?

659
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:09,601
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?

660
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:10,894
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!

661
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,313
- Sit down! Shut up!
- Derek, calm down.

662
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,815
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.

663
00:46:14,982 --> 00:46:17,359
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

664
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:19,361
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!

665
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:21,780
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!

666
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,157
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

667
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,451
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

668
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,870
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

669
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:31,707
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

670
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:35,752
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
- Come here!

671
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:38,172
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

672
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:41,216
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!

673
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:42,885
Stop!

674
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:45,095
She can't breathe!

675
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,347
Let her go!

676
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,266
Are you gonna apologize?

677
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,602
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

678
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:53,020
You're a fucking asshole.

679
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:55,731
I hate you!

680
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,575
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

681
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:10,245
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...

682
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:13,832
...anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

683
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,251
- That has nothing to do with it!
- It doesn't?

684
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:18,003
You don't think I see
what you're doing?

685
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,757
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

686
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:23,800
It's never gonna happen!

687
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,970
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

688
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:30,265
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off
and stick it up your ass...

689
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:32,768
...before I let that happen.
Coming in here...

690
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:37,773
...and poisoning my family's dinner with
your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

691
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:43,070
Fuck you!

692
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:44,279
Fuck you!

693
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:46,240
Yeah, walk out.

694
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:48,534
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

695
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,244
Get the fuck out of my house!

696
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:57,417
You see this?
That means "not welcome."

697
00:48:10,264 --> 00:48:11,723
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!

698
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,059
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

699
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,978
Primping your hair and your dress!

700
00:48:16,979 --> 00:48:20,232
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?

701
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:23,860
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

702
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:25,153
Aren't you ashamed?

703
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,615
I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!

704
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,831
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

705
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:44,006
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

706
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:52,514
I'm so sorry, Doris.

707
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,850
I really am.

708
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:06,194
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy...

709
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:08,447
...without a father.

710
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:12,284
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

711
00:49:22,544 --> 00:49:24,004
Goodbye.

712
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:10,884
Hey. You all right?

713
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,515
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!

714
00:50:16,682 --> 00:50:17,849
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

715
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,226
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

716
00:50:19,393 --> 00:50:20,769
Let me go, goddamn it!

717
00:50:20,936 --> 00:50:22,938
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

718
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,817
I would never hurt you. You know that.

719
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,027
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.

720
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,612
It's not you.

721
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:32,114
I'm sorry.

722
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,449
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

723
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,576
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

724
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:37,953
I don't believe you.

725
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:40,205
I trust you, Derek.

726
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,258
Hi.

727
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,885
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

728
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,971
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,973
Going for takeoff.

730
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:02,352
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.

731
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:03,603
Oh, no.

732
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,605
No, no! Don't crash!

733
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:08,316
Gotta go to Mom.

734
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:10,318
She's a crazy flier.

735
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:14,156
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

736
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:16,491
Okay.

737
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:25,959
- You don't feel too hot.
- No, it's in my chest.

738
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:28,462
- What are you up to?
- I'm just thinking.

739
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:30,338
A lot of that going around.

740
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,300
- I don't even know how we got here.
- Mom.

741
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:36,094
Like I let you all down.
I don't know when it happened.

742
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,138
Mom, it's okay.

743
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:39,973
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

744
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,769
It's cold in here. No wonder you're sick.

745
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,229
Don't get sick from cold,
you get sick from germs.

746
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:49,691
No, you get sick from smoking.

747
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:53,653
You gotta quit. It's not good for you.

748
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,703
What are you looking at me like that for?

749
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,498
When are you gonna let that
beautiful hair grow back?

750
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,335
The day you quit smoking.

751
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,547
Deal.

752
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,634
I better get Ally to bed.

753
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:17,219
- Say good night to Mom?
- Mm-hm.

754
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,679
Then you have to go to bed. Come on.

755
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,516
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

756
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:24,726
Good night, Mom.

757
00:52:56,925 --> 00:53:00,387
<i>I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.</i>

758
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:02,430
<i>I try to stop it from happening.</i>

759
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,599
I want you out of this house.

760
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:07,686
That's fine. I'll be gone in the morning.

761
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:09,271
He can move in with me.

762
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,899
<i>In my mind,
I imagine what would've happened...</i>

763
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:16,236
<i>...if I hadn't gone into that room
and told him.</i>

764
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:18,864
Danny, get down!

765
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:23,118
No, Danny!

766
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:25,620
Mommy!

767
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,595
Nigger, you just fucked with
the wrong bull.

768
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:43,805
- Come here!
- Get off!

769
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:47,434
You should've learned your place
on the fucking basketball court!

770
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:50,604
But you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

771
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,148
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

772
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:54,733
You ever shoot at firemen?

773
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,776
You come here, you shoot at my family?

774
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:59,321
I'm gonna teach you a real lesson,
motherfucker.

775
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,489
Put your fucking mouth on the curb.

776
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:02,657
Come on, man!

777
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,285
Put it on the curb! Right now!

778
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:11,791
- That's it.
- Derek, no!

779
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:16,296
No!

780
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:17,839
Now say good night.

781
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,145
Fucker.

782
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,237
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

783
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:43,031
Put your hands up!

784
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:45,200
I said, get your hands up!

785
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,868
Now turn around!

786
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:58,964
Put your hands behind your head!

787
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:04,302
Get down on your knees right now!

788
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,070
It's all right.

789
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:05,947
It's all right.

790
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,284
Let's go.

791
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:12,203
Come on.

792
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:22,672
She ain't gonna open the door?

793
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:25,425
I don't know.
Someone's there looking at us. Hello?

794
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:27,052
Danny, it's for you.

795
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:30,138
I'll be right there.

796
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:46,071
Open the door, Danny!
It's fucking freezing!

797
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:48,156
Danny, this party's gonna be sick!

798
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:51,159
Come on, Danny!

799
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:24,025
I'm gonna go get some beers.

800
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:38,373
Hey, what a party, huh, fat Seth?

801
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,459
I'm not fat, asshole! I'm husky.

802
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:44,295
What the fuck's up, Seth?

803
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,548
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

804
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:47,924
Holy fuck. He's here?

805
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:49,801
- Yeah, he's here.
- He's fucking here.

806
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:52,178
- Go pay your respects.
- Fuck you, Seth.

807
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:56,891
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

808
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:00,603
- Father Vinyard?
- How's it going? I'm Jason, this is Chris.

809
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:03,773
- We're friends with your brother.
- You are a fucking god, man!

810
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,234
- Oh, shit, yeah.
- Derek!

811
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:12,323
Hey.

812
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,503
- I thought you turned that paper in.
- I did...

813
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,589
...and now fucking Murray
turned me in...

814
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:30,967
...and so Sweeney's
making me write another one.

815
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:35,722
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying, now, does he?

816
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:39,642
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger
people. I hate those guys.

817
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:41,519
Now, wait a minute, Danny.

818
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:43,396
He's not proud.

819
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:49,235
He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

820
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:53,573
He's trying to make you feel guilty
about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

821
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,410
Some nigger, some spic writes about
Martin Luther King...

822
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,579
...or fucking Cesar "Commie" Chavez...

823
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,539
- Heh-heh-heh.
- ...gets a pat on the head.

824
00:59:01,998 --> 00:59:03,458
Yeah.

825
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:07,045
I mean, you can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

826
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:09,881
Definitely.

827
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,928
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

828
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:16,137
No, listen to me.

829
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:22,810
I wanna see you, okay? I do.
But I gotta take care of something tonight.

830
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:27,315
- Okay.
- You understand?

831
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,985
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

832
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:37,158
- Look, would you do something with me?
- Anything.

833
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:40,161
Leave with me.

834
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:43,331
- Leave where?
- Leave here. Leave all this.

835
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:45,625
Just come with me.

836
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:49,337
Why would you wanna leave? They
worship you. You're like a god to them.

837
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:51,256
If you think we had it good before...

838
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:54,217
- ...wait till you see what it's like now.
- I don't want all that.

839
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:58,012
I don't want my family involved.
Everything I've done here has fucked it up.

840
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:01,182
- Do you understand?
- You think what you did was wrong?

841
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,102
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

842
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:06,646
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

843
01:00:06,813 --> 01:00:08,773
...and we all know that.

844
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,441
I understand you just got out...

845
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:13,194
...but no one's gonna hurt you.
No one can touch you.

846
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:14,821
There's a small army out there.

847
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:17,323
We won't let a bunch of spooks
kick us out of here.

848
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,618
Stacey, you're not listening to me, okay?
I'm not scared.

849
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:21,953
I don't want it anymore.

850
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,456
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.

851
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:27,375
It's...

852
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:29,794
It's bullshit, Stacey.

853
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:33,423
Listen, you don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

854
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:36,676
If you wanna be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

855
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:38,886
Come on.

856
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,096
You're nuts.

857
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:42,223
You are nuts. No way.

858
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:45,351
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

859
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:49,188
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

860
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:51,566
I mean, it is like nothing
you have ever seen!

861
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:53,067
This is a mistake. Forget it.

862
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:56,070
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

863
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:58,323
Stacey, just say goodbye.
Just say goodbye.

864
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,533
This isn't you.

865
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,244
- I know you.
- You don't know anything about me, Stacey.

866
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:13,046
- Hey. Are you Danny's brother?
- Yeah.

867
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,839
Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.

868
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:17,216
Lizzy. Thank you.

869
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:23,931
We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics
grab for their piece of the pie.

870
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:25,391
Can't blame them.

871
01:01:27,477 --> 01:01:29,896
Of course,
they're gonna have to fight to get it.

872
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:33,858
And if we scare the fuck out of people...

873
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:37,570
...and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

874
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:41,240
You gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

875
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:45,286
- Ha, ha. Hey, man.
- Well, look who's here.

876
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:47,372
The return of the soldier.

877
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:52,543
- What are you doing here, Danny?
- Come on, man. I had to check it out.

878
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,755
- You knew I was gonna come.
- Let the kid alone, Derek.

879
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:57,799
He knows when to go to bed.

880
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:03,012
- Go wait outside.
- Come on, I'm not doing anything.

881
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:05,139
There's a little blond sitting out there.

882
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:08,476
She keeps asking for you.
She's dying. Come on.

883
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:10,853
- Well, I gotta check out.
- Go easy on her.

884
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,980
All right.

885
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,945
Wait for me right outside.

886
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:25,159
Take it easy.

887
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:27,286
Chill out.

888
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,081
You're on safe ground.

889
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:33,501
You don't have to watch your ass
around here.

890
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:37,296
Come on, sit down. Relax.

891
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,175
I'm sorry. The party was a little quick.

892
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:44,887
But we're just so damned glad
you're back, Derek.

893
01:02:45,054 --> 01:02:48,433
- It's only natural you should feel funny.
- I don't feel funny, Cam.

894
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:53,187
You know, you made the fat kid nervous.
He thinks the joint messed with your mind.

895
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:54,689
It did.

896
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:05,491
<i>Glory, glory hallelujah</i>

897
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:10,663
<i>Glory, glory hallelujah</i>

898
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:14,041
<i>The white man marches on</i>

899
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:17,211
Things have changed
since you've been gone, Derek.

900
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:19,380
You talk about organization?

901
01:03:19,547 --> 01:03:22,216
Wait till you see
what we've done with the Internet.

902
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:26,053
We've got every gang from Seattle
to San Diego working together now.

903
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,473
They're not competing.
They're consolidated.

904
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:31,017
Only thing we lack
is a little overall leadership.

905
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:33,936
And that's where you come in.

906
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:37,315
Because people out there
got a lot of respect for you, Derek.

907
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:41,736
- When you're ready, talk to me about it.
- Well, you can forget about that.

908
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:44,071
I'm done with it, Cam.

909
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:47,074
Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that...

910
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:50,578
...shaved-head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

911
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:52,413
I like your hair the way it is now.

912
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,999
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

913
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,919
- No more of this grocery store—
- You're not listening.

914
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:01,464
I am done with it. All that bullshit
out there and all your bullshit too.

915
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,132
I'm out.

916
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:06,344
I understand how you feel.
You've just done some hard time—

917
01:04:06,511 --> 01:04:08,429
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

918
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,723
- You don't know a thing about it.
- I done mine.

919
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,142
You didn't do shit.
I found out about your story.

920
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:16,938
You did two months, then rolled over
on two kids and let them go down for you.

921
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:19,106
So don't feed me your fucking lies,
Cameron!

922
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:22,860
All right, then. This is stupid.

923
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:24,529
I'm done.

924
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,073
Look, you go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

925
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,951
Get your head on straight,
then I'll talk to you.

926
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,078
But it doesn't matter if I don't, does it?

927
01:04:32,245 --> 01:04:34,539
You got the next crop
all lined up and ready to go...

928
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:37,792
- ...you fucking chicken hawk!
- Excuse me?

929
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:40,419
You prey on people, Cam! You use them!

930
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:43,381
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

931
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:45,424
...but I am onto you,
you fucking snake.

932
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:48,135
Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful.

933
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,554
Remember where you are.

934
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,266
This is not a fucking country club
where you can waltz in and out of here—

935
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,101
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

936
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:58,354
I came in here to tell you one thing:
I am out. Out!

937
01:04:58,521 --> 01:04:59,647
And Danny is out too.

938
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:02,275
You come near my family again,
I'll fucking kill you.

939
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,777
Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

940
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:07,113
You can't come barking threats at me.

941
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,824
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

942
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:14,078
He's not some whining pussy like you.
He needs my help and I'll give it to him.

943
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:15,955
If you come near Danny again...

944
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:19,083
...I will feed you your fucking heart,
Cameron.

945
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,043
I won't have to.

946
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,005
He'll come to me.

947
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,592
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

948
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:32,972
Shit!

949
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:36,058
You're a fucking dead man, Vinyard.

950
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,200
Hey, hey, hey. Where's Cameron?

951
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,535
Where the fuck is he?

952
01:05:55,536 --> 01:05:57,705
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Derek.

953
01:05:57,872 --> 01:05:59,582
Stay away from me, Stacey. Danny!

954
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:02,001
Why don't you share
what you just said to me...

955
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:04,962
...you piece-of-shit, race-trading nigger!

956
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:07,214
- Fucking nigger?
- You monkey-fucking traitor!

957
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,050
Are you a fucking nigger?

958
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,052
Hey, Danny! Come on.

959
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,179
He's a fucking nigger. Nigger. Nigger.

960
01:06:13,346 --> 01:06:14,639
Cam's out cold!

961
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,557
Where the fuck are you going?

962
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:19,560
He's got a gun!

963
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:22,438
- Yo, yo, back up, back up.
- Seth.

964
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:25,024
You make me fucking sick!

965
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:27,318
Seth! Put down the fucking gun!

966
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:28,569
Go ahead. Shoot.

967
01:06:29,362 --> 01:06:32,406
- Shoot him! Do it, Seth! Shoot him!
- Seth. Holy shit.

968
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:33,733
- Traitor.
- Kick his ass.

969
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,077
- Seth!
- Do it, Seth, do it.

970
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,870
- Shoot him.
- Do it! Shoot him!

971
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:39,789
Oh, God.

972
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,040
Back up. Move.

973
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:45,419
Back up. Back up. Back the fuck up.

974
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,922
Move. Move.

975
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:49,215
Easy, Derek. Hey. Hey.

976
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:13,280
- Danny, easy.
- Fuck you. Who do you think you are?

977
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:15,282
Danny, Danny. Relax. Relax.

978
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:18,953
- Who do you think you are?
- Danny. Take it easy, Dan. Take it easy.

979
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,455
I fucking hate you, Der!

980
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,541
All right. Shh, shh. I mean it.

981
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:26,544
Hey, come on. Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

982
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:28,796
- Take it easy.
- What's happened to you, Der?

983
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:31,966
Take it easy. Take it easy.

984
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:34,301
What's happened to you, Der?

985
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:45,229
Come on. Come on.

986
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:50,317
This is so fucked.

987
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,986
Look. I'm sorry. All right?

988
01:07:52,153 --> 01:07:54,780
You weren't supposed to see that.
I told you not to come.

989
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:57,158
Fuck you, man.

990
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:59,118
That was so fucked up.

991
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:01,203
I know. I know.

992
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:04,206
- God.
- It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

993
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:05,916
That was fucked up.

994
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,502
- That's all there is to it.
- Not what I had planned.

995
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:11,255
It just all went to shit.

996
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:13,507
It went to shit.

997
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:15,134
Totally out of control.

998
01:08:16,886 --> 01:08:19,346
What's fucking happening to you, man?

999
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:26,479
Hey. Look at me.

1000
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:31,358
I can't go back to that, Dan.

1001
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:33,694
Can't go back to what?

1002
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:38,365
To any of it. Those guys, the gang,
that life. I'm done with it.

1003
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,038
What happened to you up there?

1004
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:55,966
C Block! Back at the chow!
Don't be late today, you piece of shit!

1005
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,843
Let's go! You wanna eat today?

1006
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:00,012
Get up! Five minutes!

1007
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:02,348
This is my fucking house! Get up!

1008
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,725
What the fuck's your problem,
you asshole?

1009
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:06,519
Move!

1010
01:09:06,685 --> 01:09:07,978
Joe, open the fucking gates.

1011
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:09,939
All right, back up.

1012
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:17,154
Five minutes. Step forward.

1013
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:19,532
Those beds better be made.

1014
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:25,579
<i>After two days in that place,
I didn't think I'd make it a week.</i>

1015
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:27,248
Come on there, motherfuckers.

1016
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:29,583
You wanna eat today, you piece of shit?

1017
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:33,087
You white-trash piece of shit.
You think you're fucking special?

1018
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:36,757
Button that top button. Let's go! Move!

1019
01:09:36,924 --> 01:09:40,052
Are you fucking eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole.

1020
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:42,388
I'll fucking kill you.

1021
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:45,599
Fucking keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit.

1022
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,437
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy,
or I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1023
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,356
Step forward.

1024
01:09:53,983 --> 01:09:55,776
Turn to the left.

1025
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:59,280
Step forward to chow. Let's go.

1026
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,448
Come on.

1027
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:04,034
Hey, fish, straight ahead.
Straight ahead, fucker.

1028
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:05,244
Let's go.

1029
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:08,372
<i>All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...</i>

1030
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:11,834
<i>...so I figured I'm just gonna put
up a flag and hope a friend sees it.</i>

1031
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:16,941
That's the catapult right there.

1032
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:38,045
- How you doing?
- Good.

1033
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:39,713
Have a seat.

1034
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:44,093
- Spike. Good to meet you.
- Hey.

1035
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:56,730
Don't fuck with me, all right? Because
I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.

1036
01:11:57,606 --> 01:11:58,816
You know why?

1037
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,610
Because I control the underwear.

1038
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:11,954
All right, we pick them up over here
and we sort them over there.

1039
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:14,915
I hope you work out, all right?
The last guy they sent me...

1040
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:19,044
...didn't wear no drawers,
couldn't read the sizes in the drawers...

1041
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:21,005
...and used to sniff the drawers.

1042
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,257
We got two sizes: medium and large.
All right?

1043
01:12:23,424 --> 01:12:25,884
All you do is put the mediums
with the mediums...

1044
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:27,594
...and the large with the large.

1045
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:31,348
It's a boring job, but it's better than
that last shit they had me doing.

1046
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:35,769
I spent two years in the kitchen, ha,
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1047
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:38,731
That, you don't wanna do. All right?

1048
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:40,941
You should be happy
that you landed this job.

1049
01:12:41,108 --> 01:12:44,445
Ain't no telling what the hell
they'll have you do in the joint.

1050
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:47,322
By the way, uh...

1051
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:50,367
...what are you in for?

1052
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:55,622
Probably robbed some old lady, huh?

1053
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,094
Okay, I know your kind, right?

1054
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:11,472
Badass peckerwood with an attitude.

1055
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:15,225
Well, let me tell you something, man.

1056
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,102
You better watch your ass.

1057
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:19,021
Because in the joint...

1058
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:21,148
...you the nigger, not me.

1059
01:13:25,069 --> 01:13:28,739
<i>I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.</i>

1060
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:31,658
<i>Then everything
started getting complicated.</i>

1061
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:58,352
I'll take care of that, all right?

1062
01:13:58,519 --> 01:14:00,145
What the fuck is that?

1063
01:14:01,897 --> 01:14:03,482
What's that all about?

1064
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:06,860
Oh, that's just politics, man.
Favors, you know.

1065
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:11,115
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

1066
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:17,204
Mitch has got a little something extra
on the side with them boys, you know.

1067
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:19,289
You're kidding, right?

1068
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:21,458
No.

1069
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,504
That's bullshit, man.
Somebody should say something to him.

1070
01:14:25,671 --> 01:14:27,256
What the fuck is he thinking?

1071
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:29,716
Mitch is the only reason
why you're not a corpse.

1072
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:33,095
- Remember that.
- You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.

1073
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:36,390
I can take care of myself.
He shouldn't be doing that.

1074
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:39,560
I'm getting sick of it.
A lot of hard talk around here...

1075
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:41,979
...and not a lot of follow-through.

1076
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:46,233
I think you'd better chill out...

1077
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,195
...on the preaching bullshit, okay?
We're getting a little tired of that shit.

1078
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:53,740
Ease up on it.

1079
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,480
What are you doing here, Doris?

1080
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,274
I was in the neighborhood.

1081
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:30,068
Well, look, I told you I don't want you
all coming here.

1082
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:33,113
I don't care what you told me, okay?

1083
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,573
I need to talk to you now.

1084
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:56,720
So how is everyone?

1085
01:15:56,887 --> 01:16:02,309
Davina's great.
She's, uh, getting straight A's almost.

1086
01:16:02,476 --> 01:16:04,728
And, uh, Ally's walking...

1087
01:16:04,895 --> 01:16:07,064
...and starting to talk a little.

1088
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:14,738
- How's Danny?
- Danny?

1089
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:17,574
Danny.

1090
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:21,411
He holds you up so high.

1091
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:23,997
He thinks you're the greatest.

1092
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:27,960
He's always bragging about you
to Cameron...

1093
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:29,920
...and all his new friends.

1094
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,717
He's starting to remind me of you.

1095
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:38,553
Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?

1096
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,222
I'm sure he's fine.

1097
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:44,184
I mean, he's 16 years old, Doris.
He's not gonna be a little angel forever.

1098
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:48,021
You think because I watched
my first-born fuck up his entire life...

1099
01:16:48,188 --> 01:16:52,192
...that I can sit here and see my baby
follow him down the same toilet?

1100
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:54,987
You know what? I can't fix all
this shit from up here, okay?

1101
01:16:55,153 --> 01:16:56,530
I'm not asking you to.

1102
01:16:56,697 --> 01:16:59,866
It makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get
through this, you make it harder.

1103
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:03,036
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1104
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:05,622
You think you're here all alone?

1105
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:07,624
You think I'm not in here with you?

1106
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:21,680
Fuck, man.

1107
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:28,729
Every day you go through these sheets
like you gonna get to the end of them.

1108
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:32,316
Look, nigga, will you chill the fuck out?

1109
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:35,694
Goddamn! No matter how fast
you get through them, man...

1110
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:38,363
...they'll keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1111
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:42,242
Throwing them around ain't gonna do
a thing but give you a heart attack.

1112
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:43,910
Know what? That's cool with me.

1113
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:46,496
But you're gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack too!

1114
01:17:55,339 --> 01:17:57,758
I know, I know.
I'm just a dumb stupid nigger, right?

1115
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:59,634
What do I know?

1116
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:04,306
I know I ain't the one getting mad
at them damn sheets, though.

1117
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,894
As a matter of fact, the only sheets
I get mad at? I'll tell you.

1118
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:13,607
"Boys, this is what we gonna do.

1119
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:15,442
We gonna hate some niggers.

1120
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:19,446
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers. That's
all we'll do, is hate niggers all day.

1121
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:22,032
I don't know what a nigger is,
but we'll hate them.

1122
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:24,117
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1123
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:28,372
...working next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy."

1124
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:48,892
See? That's the ticket.

1125
01:18:49,935 --> 01:18:51,853
Nice and easy.

1126
01:18:52,687 --> 01:18:54,481
Now we can ignore each other in peace.

1127
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:00,570
I go, "What you doing?"
Know what he tells me?

1128
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:03,824
He goes, "It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck."

1129
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,120
Never lets me finish.

1130
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:10,997
- Why don't you tell a joke?
- Did you fuck him too?

1131
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:16,962
I get back, she's laying on her back.
She likes the wine bottle thing, right?

1132
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,673
What's up?

1133
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:27,806
Will you get to the fucking point?
Jesus Christ.

1134
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:37,858
<i>He was taking it from the Mexicans
and dealing it out to his own people.</i>

1135
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:41,486
<i>He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.</i>

1136
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,738
Took too damn long.

1137
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:53,123
Hey. Hey, Vinyard!

1138
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:08,513
What?

1139
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,600
Come on, man. Don't look at me like that.

1140
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:14,144
You know what that smells like, right?

1141
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,397
Come on, don't tell me this smell
doesn't remind you of a woman.

1142
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:20,358
God, I miss that smell, man.

1143
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:24,821
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this one.

1144
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:28,575
But at least I gotta go home at night
and lie down next to this sweet smell.

1145
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:33,538
God, I miss that.

1146
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:36,208
You got a woman?

1147
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:37,876
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

1148
01:20:38,043 --> 01:20:40,712
Let me give you some advice. All right?

1149
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:42,923
She comes to visit you...

1150
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:47,594
...whatever you do, no matter what,
don't let her leave here in a fight.

1151
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:50,847
Don't let her walk out of here
with a bad attitude. If you do...

1152
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:55,769
...you spend next week wondering if she's
getting her fuck on with somebody else.

1153
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:59,231
She comes to see you it's nothing
but sweet talk through that glass.

1154
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:01,775
Send her away floating, all right?

1155
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:04,945
Because it's not like the real world.
Where you can fight...

1156
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:08,698
...but it's cool to fight because you
can make up and have make-up sex.

1157
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:11,952
You know what I'm saying? That angry sex.
That sex with an attitude.

1158
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:15,622
Where you lay on your back and let her
take out all that aggression on you.

1159
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:17,707
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1160
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,876
It's that pow, pow, pow.

1161
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:22,879
Let her get on top
and she's gonna punish you first, right?

1162
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:24,548
"You been a bad boy, huh?

1163
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,425
You been a bad boy
and I'm gonna punish you.

1164
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:32,722
I'm gonna put it on you.
Don't you ever let me catch you...

1165
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:34,474
...looking at another woman.

1166
01:21:34,975 --> 01:21:37,519
Yeah. I may forgive you if you bring it.

1167
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:40,021
I think I can. I forgive.

1168
01:21:40,188 --> 01:21:43,692
I forgive. Oh, right there. Right there.
You hitting it. My spot.

1169
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:47,988
That's it. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. I forgive you.

1170
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:51,658
I forgive you. I for— I for— I forgive you.

1171
01:21:51,825 --> 01:21:53,827
I love you!"

1172
01:21:57,664 --> 01:21:59,332
Let's keep it moving.

1173
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:15,098
How do you figure the Lakers to ever
be a bigger dynasty than the Celtics?

1174
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:18,476
- The Lakers are like a flare-up. A fluke.
- Are you crazy?

1175
01:22:18,643 --> 01:22:21,605
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are like a dynasty!

1176
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:26,192
Come on, man. The Celtics were, like,
the ugliest team in the history of sports.

1177
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:28,278
A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man.

1178
01:22:28,445 --> 01:22:30,488
Look at Kevin McHale.

1179
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:33,325
James Worthy?
The guy has a head like a melon.

1180
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,036
- No, he had ladies.
- I can't even talk to you.

1181
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,872
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- You are tweaking.

1182
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:41,124
Boston Celtics.

1183
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,691
- How many is that?
- That's enough.

1184
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:44,377
Enough? All right.

1185
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:55,555
I lost count, man.

1186
01:22:55,722 --> 01:22:57,557
- Doesn't matter, man.
- All right.

1187
01:22:57,724 --> 01:22:59,559
Who's counting anyway?

1188
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:08,526
All right, so I wanna know something.

1189
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,571
What the fuck landed you in here?

1190
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:13,823
You didn't kill.
Too skinny for a gangbanger.

1191
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:17,994
That a bitch. Don't judge a book by its
cover. I can throw these things, all right?

1192
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:21,414
- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever. Come on. What did you do?

1193
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:25,418
Yo, man, it's none of your business,
all right? It's embarrassing, all right?

1194
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:29,798
What? Embar—?
Everybody in here is embarrassed.

1195
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:32,926
You think? Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1196
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:34,928
What did you do?

1197
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:39,766
Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?

1198
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:41,768
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing?

1199
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:46,022
I stole a TV from a store that was right
next door to a doughnut shop, all right?

1200
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:49,109
I run out, the store owner's
running behind me, yelling, bam.

1201
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:51,695
I run into three cops, all right?

1202
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:53,947
I told you it was embarrassing
and you laugh.

1203
01:23:54,114 --> 01:23:56,282
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1204
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:58,910
That doesn't make sense.

1205
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:02,372
No, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV.

1206
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:05,792
- Come on.
- I go in the store, I come out...

1207
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:09,295
...the police officer grabs my arm,
TV falls on his foot and breaks it.

1208
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:11,631
They said I threw the TV at the officer.

1209
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:13,758
Assault. Six years.

1210
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:15,760
Come on. Tell the truth.

1211
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,804
You chucked it at him. Or something.

1212
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:20,932
Like I said, I came out of the store...

1213
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:24,644
...he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot.

1214
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:33,445
What you got for me, baby?
What you got for me? What you got for me?

1215
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,865
There you go, baby. Yeah, baby.

1216
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,992
That's what I'm talking about!

1217
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:44,873
Put some D on him, now.

1218
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:18,031
Fuck you.

1219
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:20,033
Get a towel! Hold him. Hold him.

1220
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:30,043
- You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?
- Fuck you!

1221
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,545
We're gonna treat you like one.

1222
01:25:33,797 --> 01:25:35,381
Come on.

1223
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:51,231
Fuck you.

1224
01:25:56,736 --> 01:25:58,321
- That was real sweet.
- Fuck you!

1225
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:33,940
How is he?

1226
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:36,067
Well, he took six stitches.

1227
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,660
Hey, man.

1228
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:20,486
Oh, man, what the hell
are you doing here, anyway?

1229
01:27:20,653 --> 01:27:24,324
Well, I came to talk about Danny,
but we don't have to do that right now.

1230
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,742
I brought you some books.

1231
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:31,331
Well, what about him? You know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1232
01:27:31,956 --> 01:27:34,000
He's headed right where you are.

1233
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:39,088
Oh, man, you know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me, man.

1234
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:41,382
Danny's not my responsibility.
You know?

1235
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:45,053
What do you expect me to do? It
doesn't help. Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1236
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:49,515
I don't want you to do anything. I need
to know the truth about how you feel.

1237
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:52,894
Well, what?
You think I want him in here? I mean...

1238
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:56,314
I don't know. I don't know what I feel.
I'm all...

1239
01:27:58,316 --> 01:27:59,859
I feel a little inside out.

1240
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:03,696
Um, you know, I don't know.
There's some things...

1241
01:28:04,364 --> 01:28:06,032
...that don't fit.

1242
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:07,992
Well, that happens.

1243
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:11,871
Look, you are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1244
01:28:12,038 --> 01:28:14,624
...pretending you don't see
the holes in this bullshit.

1245
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:17,794
Listen, I said I was confused.
I didn't say I didn't believe in it.

1246
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:20,338
All right.
That's why you have to stay open.

1247
01:28:21,089 --> 01:28:23,049
Right now, your anger is consuming you.

1248
01:28:23,216 --> 01:28:26,219
Your anger is shutting down the brain
God gave you.

1249
01:28:26,386 --> 01:28:29,889
You've been talking about what's going
on in me since I was in high school.

1250
01:28:30,056 --> 01:28:33,059
How the fuck do you know so much
about what's going on inside me?

1251
01:28:33,226 --> 01:28:35,353
No, I know about me.

1252
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,732
I know about this place.
I know about the place you are in.

1253
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:42,402
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1254
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:44,445
There was a moment...

1255
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:47,448
...when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

1256
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:51,703
...for all the pain and suffering
and vile things that happened to me...

1257
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:54,247
...that I saw happen to my people.

1258
01:28:55,206 --> 01:28:57,125
I used to blame everybody.
Blame white people.

1259
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,877
Blame society. Blame God.

1260
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:03,923
I didn't get no answers, because
I was asking the wrong questions.

1261
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:06,759
- You have to ask the right questions.
- Like what?

1262
01:29:09,554 --> 01:29:12,098
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1263
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:24,444
No.

1264
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,037
You gotta help me now.

1265
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:38,958
Just help me.

1266
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,462
Get me out of here, you know?

1267
01:29:45,465 --> 01:29:48,217
I'm up in four months for review.

1268
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:51,554
Put in a word for me.

1269
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:54,140
I already have.
So you're out there, then what?

1270
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:56,976
I don't wanna fuck up
my family anymore.

1271
01:29:57,143 --> 01:29:59,312
I'll go as far away as I can get.

1272
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:01,105
That's not good enough.

1273
01:30:02,565 --> 01:30:07,111
You want my help, you gotta do better
than that. My help is not unconditional.

1274
01:30:08,112 --> 01:30:11,074
But running just ain't good enough.

1275
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:45,316
Fuck him.

1276
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:48,152
Fuck him. Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1277
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:51,697
Yo, what's up, D?

1278
01:30:51,864 --> 01:30:54,909
Yo, what's all that bullshit you pulled
in the mess hall, man?

1279
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:58,287
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you fucking crazy?

1280
01:30:59,497 --> 01:31:01,624
D! Look at me, man!

1281
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,209
You can't make it on your own.

1282
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:07,338
I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
There was six of them, they jumped me.

1283
01:31:07,505 --> 01:31:09,966
That won't happen again.
I hope they fucking try.

1284
01:31:10,133 --> 01:31:12,677
Look, I'm not talking about
your peckerwood friends!

1285
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:15,054
They were protecting your stupid ass!

1286
01:31:15,221 --> 01:31:17,056
You dissed them in public.

1287
01:31:17,223 --> 01:31:19,267
Now you're on your fucking own!

1288
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:21,644
Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers.

1289
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:25,481
They're gonna fuck you, toss your salad,
then smoke your motherfucking ass!

1290
01:31:25,648 --> 01:31:29,569
Tell me something I don't already know.
You think I haven't thought about that?

1291
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:32,864
They're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

1292
01:31:35,241 --> 01:31:37,285
What can I do, man?

1293
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:43,749
<i>So I was right back where I started.</i>

1294
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,668
<i>Every day, I was sure it was my day.</i>

1295
01:31:47,545 --> 01:31:49,964
<i>Every time I stepped out of my cell.</i>

1296
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:52,592
<i>Every time I got in that shower.</i>

1297
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:59,557
<i>I figured it was only a matter of time
before they made a move.</i>

1298
01:32:01,267 --> 01:32:03,644
<i>I just hoped that it'd be quick.</i>

1299
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:37,345
<i>But it never came.</i>

1300
01:32:38,763 --> 01:32:41,891
<i>I couldn't figure it out.
I knew some of them were itching for it.</i>

1301
01:32:42,058 --> 01:32:44,477
<i>But after a while
I just put my head down...</i>

1302
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:47,980
<i>...read the stuff that Sweeney sent me,
and I kept to myself.</i>

1303
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,277
<i>The last six months in that place
I was like a ghost.</i>

1304
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:09,585
What's up, man? You getting out?

1305
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,675
What the fuck you waiting on?
Get the fuck on out of here.

1306
01:33:18,135 --> 01:33:21,472
- Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

1307
01:33:23,182 --> 01:33:27,770
I'm thinking maybe the only reason I'm
getting out of here in one piece is you.

1308
01:33:27,937 --> 01:33:29,981
Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1309
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:33,609
You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line
for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

1310
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:37,697
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

1311
01:33:43,577 --> 01:33:45,371
That's what I thought.

1312
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:51,544
I owe you, man.

1313
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:54,714
Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?

1314
01:33:57,049 --> 01:33:58,926
Yes, I do.

1315
01:34:08,853 --> 01:34:10,187
You'll be out in no time.

1316
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:12,481
Come on, man.
It's a piece of cake. All right?

1317
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:17,695
You just take it easy on the brothers,
all right? The brothers!

1318
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:30,249
God, man.

1319
01:34:32,126 --> 01:34:34,420
I'm sorry, Der.

1320
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:37,214
Sorry that happened to you.

1321
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:41,385
No, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1322
01:34:41,552 --> 01:34:43,137
I feel lucky because...

1323
01:34:43,304 --> 01:34:45,222
...it's wrong, Dan.

1324
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:50,936
It's wrong and it was eating me up.
It was gonna kill me.

1325
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:53,814
And I kept asking myself all the time...

1326
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:56,942
...how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1327
01:34:58,611 --> 01:35:00,863
And it's just because I was pissed off.

1328
01:35:01,364 --> 01:35:05,159
And nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1329
01:35:06,202 --> 01:35:08,954
I mean, I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1330
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,709
And that didn't make me
feel any different.

1331
01:35:14,627 --> 01:35:18,089
It just got me more lost.
And I'm tired of feeling pissed off, Danny.

1332
01:35:18,964 --> 01:35:20,633
I'm just tired of it.

1333
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:24,136
And I'm not telling you what to do.

1334
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:26,639
I'm really not.

1335
01:35:27,473 --> 01:35:29,642
But I need you to understand.

1336
01:35:31,227 --> 01:35:33,979
Because I love you
and you're my best friend.

1337
01:35:36,774 --> 01:35:38,567
Do you understand?

1338
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:40,694
Yeah, I understand.

1339
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:45,825
All right.

1340
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,328
Whoo!

1341
01:35:49,495 --> 01:35:51,205
Jesus.

1342
01:36:06,095 --> 01:36:08,472
- Hey.
- Hi.

1343
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,933
- Everything okay?
- No, everything's great.

1344
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:13,686
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1345
01:36:13,853 --> 01:36:17,148
- No, thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine.
- You sure?

1346
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:19,483
Thank you, though.

1347
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:21,944
All right. Come on, let's go.

1348
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,383
Good night.

1349
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:53,202
I'm gonna take a shower, all right?

1350
01:38:26,902 --> 01:38:31,323
<i>It's hard to look back
and see the truth about people you love.</i>

1351
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:35,661
<i>I think if you asked Derek why it all went
the way it did, and where it all started...</i>

1352
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:38,497
<i>...he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.</i>

1353
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:41,959
<i>But the truth is, it started earlier.</i>

1354
01:38:42,376 --> 01:38:45,254
All right. Are we all meeting together
for the game tonight?

1355
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:46,755
Yes, definitely.

1356
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,550
Ben's Burgers, 7:00,
then we go watch the big guy play.

1357
01:38:49,717 --> 01:38:51,927
Okay. Yeah.

1358
01:38:52,094 --> 01:38:55,514
- Psyching up for the game?
- Yeah, I'm always ready for that.

1359
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:59,685
I got an English exam third period.
I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

1360
01:38:59,852 --> 01:39:02,479
What's the matter,
afraid you're gonna get a B?

1361
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:04,481
Might do you good. B minus.

1362
01:39:05,608 --> 01:39:07,359
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

1363
01:39:07,526 --> 01:39:11,989
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable.
I've never had a teacher like this.

1364
01:39:12,156 --> 01:39:14,950
He's got two Ph.D.s.
I don't know what he's doing at our school.

1365
01:39:15,117 --> 01:39:18,203
- He's not like other teachers.
- What's he got you reading?

1366
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:21,874
We got this essay exam on this book,
<i>Native Son.</i>

1367
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:24,543
- All on this one book.
<i>- Native Son</i>. I don't know that.

1368
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:25,961
That's a big surprise.

1369
01:39:27,546 --> 01:39:29,798
What? I read.

1370
01:39:29,965 --> 01:39:33,052
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy at school.

1371
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,722
Well, they don't.

1372
01:39:36,889 --> 01:39:39,266
So, what is it? What is this <i>Native Son?</i>
What is it?

1373
01:39:39,433 --> 01:39:41,560
It's this book about this black guy.

1374
01:39:42,144 --> 01:39:44,563
We're doing this
whole black literature unit.

1375
01:39:45,356 --> 01:39:47,024
What is it, Black History Month?

1376
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:48,609
No, it's just like...

1377
01:39:48,776 --> 01:39:51,403
This guy Sweeney, you know,
it's part of the course now.

1378
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:56,367
Yeah.

1379
01:39:58,410 --> 01:39:59,662
What?

1380
01:40:00,621 --> 01:40:02,498
Nothing. It's just, you know.

1381
01:40:02,665 --> 01:40:04,541
It's everywhere I look now.

1382
01:40:05,626 --> 01:40:06,919
What?

1383
01:40:08,337 --> 01:40:10,881
This affirmative blaction.

1384
01:40:11,924 --> 01:40:15,844
Honey, a few new books doesn't
qualify as affirmative black action.

1385
01:40:17,096 --> 01:40:18,764
Read the book, ace the guy's test.

1386
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:21,266
Just don't swallow everything
he feeds you whole.

1387
01:40:21,433 --> 01:40:23,936
- Just because you see it on the news.
- But like what?

1388
01:40:24,103 --> 01:40:27,439
All this stuff about making everything
equal. It's not that simple.

1389
01:40:27,606 --> 01:40:29,316
Now you got this book, <i>Native Son.</i>

1390
01:40:29,483 --> 01:40:31,610
What happened to the other books
in the course?

1391
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:35,823
They're not any good anymore because
Mr. Two-Ph.D.s says they aren't?

1392
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:39,952
Are you gonna trade in great books
for black books? Does that make sense?

1393
01:40:41,328 --> 01:40:43,205
You gotta question these things, Derek.

1394
01:40:43,372 --> 01:40:45,374
You gotta look at the whole picture.

1395
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:48,627
We're talking about books here.
But I'm also talking about my job.

1396
01:40:49,044 --> 01:40:52,339
I got two black guys on my squad now
who got their job...

1397
01:40:52,506 --> 01:40:56,135
...over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher on the test.

1398
01:40:57,428 --> 01:41:01,140
That make sense? Huh?
Yeah, sure, everything's equal now...

1399
01:41:01,306 --> 01:41:05,561
...but I got two guys watching my back,
responsible for my life...

1400
01:41:05,728 --> 01:41:09,398
...who aren't as good as two others.
They got the job because they were black.

1401
01:41:09,565 --> 01:41:12,359
- Not because they were the best.
- That sucks.

1402
01:41:12,526 --> 01:41:14,445
Yeah. Is that what America is about?

1403
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:16,739
No. America's about
"best man for the job."

1404
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:18,991
You do your best, you get the job.

1405
01:41:19,158 --> 01:41:22,453
You know, this affirmative action crap...

1406
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:24,872
I don't know what that's about.
There's some...

1407
01:41:25,038 --> 01:41:27,666
...hidden agenda or something going on.

1408
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:29,918
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.

1409
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:32,504
I don't know,
I didn't think about it like that.

1410
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:35,048
- Well...
- This guy, though...

1411
01:41:35,215 --> 01:41:38,135
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on, like, so strong...

1412
01:41:38,302 --> 01:41:40,512
...it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

1413
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:42,639
Maybe some of what he says is kind of—

1414
01:41:42,806 --> 01:41:44,433
It's bullshit.

1415
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,852
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1416
01:41:47,019 --> 01:41:48,604
No, no.

1417
01:41:48,771 --> 01:41:51,273
It's nigger bullshit.

1418
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:55,694
- You see that, don't you?
- Yeah.

1419
01:41:56,528 --> 01:42:00,532
- You gotta watch out for that.
- Yeah, I get what you're saying. I will.

1420
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:03,869
Good boy.

1421
01:42:05,162 --> 01:42:08,332
- I'm proud of you.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.

1422
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,498
<i>It's 5:40 a.m...</i>

1423
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:18,086
<i>...and in about one minute,
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.</i>

1424
01:44:18,337 --> 01:44:20,631
<i>I don't know if I've ever done that.</i>

1425
01:44:21,632 --> 01:44:25,177
<i>Anyway, we're gonna try
to pick things up and start over.</i>

1426
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:28,305
<i>It won't be easy,
but we're all together again.</i>

1427
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:31,266
<i>And I feel good.</i>

1428
01:44:32,476 --> 01:44:34,811
<i>I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted.</i>

1429
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:38,774
<i>If I hit the social significance,
or whatever you're looking for.</i>

1430
01:44:39,191 --> 01:44:43,236
<i>But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot.</i>

1431
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:59,962
Wow. You look great.

1432
01:45:00,128 --> 01:45:01,964
Look at you.

1433
01:45:02,798 --> 01:45:05,717
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1434
01:45:06,218 --> 01:45:07,636
Is she cute?

1435
01:45:07,803 --> 01:45:10,389
She is a fat guy named Hector.

1436
01:45:10,555 --> 01:45:12,516
So I'm out of luck.

1437
01:45:15,519 --> 01:45:18,647
I just gotta check in, then I'll
see about getting my old job back.

1438
01:45:19,314 --> 01:45:20,565
Great.

1439
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:22,734
- Good morning.
- Yes, my love.

1440
01:45:22,901 --> 01:45:26,780
Davina, can you—?
Your sister's gonna help you, honey.

1441
01:45:26,947 --> 01:45:28,865
- You look great. Knock them dead.
- Okay.

1442
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:30,325
Thanks.

1443
01:45:30,575 --> 01:45:34,871
- What would you like to wear?
- I wanna wear my blue dress today.

1444
01:45:35,038 --> 01:45:38,166
- You do look good.
- Yeah? I feel silly.

1445
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:40,419
- You look good.
- Yeah?

1446
01:45:42,838 --> 01:45:44,339
You feel good?

1447
01:45:47,092 --> 01:45:50,178
Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know...

1448
01:45:50,345 --> 01:45:52,431
...a little...

1449
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:54,433
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1450
01:45:56,268 --> 01:45:59,396
Listen, I don't know...

1451
01:45:59,563 --> 01:46:02,399
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.

1452
01:46:06,153 --> 01:46:08,405
I wanna be here.

1453
01:46:26,298 --> 01:46:27,758
- I'm gonna get a paper.
- Cool.

1454
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:48,028
- What do you want?
- A maple bar and a large milk.

1455
01:46:48,195 --> 01:46:49,863
All right, I got it.

1456
01:46:54,868 --> 01:46:58,538
Let me get a coffee, a maple bar
and a large milk to go.

1457
01:46:58,705 --> 01:47:00,165
Right away.

1458
01:47:08,298 --> 01:47:10,133
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey.

1459
01:47:11,134 --> 01:47:12,344
Derek.

1460
01:47:12,511 --> 01:47:15,013
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

1461
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:19,059
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1462
01:47:19,226 --> 01:47:21,478
- They were jumped last night.
- How bad?

1463
01:47:21,645 --> 01:47:23,897
Well, it looks like they're gonna live.

1464
01:47:24,064 --> 01:47:27,150
- Then they got lucky.
- Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1465
01:47:30,362 --> 01:47:32,072
Aw, what?

1466
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:35,367
We were kind of hoping that maybe
you'd talk to your old crew.

1467
01:47:35,534 --> 01:47:37,702
- Come on. No way.
- This is not a good thing.

1468
01:47:37,869 --> 01:47:40,038
If there's anybody they'll listen to,
it's you.

1469
01:47:40,205 --> 01:47:42,457
No. No, I hate to tell you, but I'm out.

1470
01:47:42,624 --> 01:47:44,668
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1471
01:47:44,835 --> 01:47:46,711
We're asking for your help here, Derek.

1472
01:47:46,878 --> 01:47:49,339
- Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
- Derek.

1473
01:47:55,554 --> 01:47:57,222
This has got nothing to do with me.

1474
01:47:57,389 --> 01:48:00,183
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1475
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:03,061
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1476
01:48:03,228 --> 01:48:05,730
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

1477
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:08,358
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

1478
01:48:08,525 --> 01:48:12,445
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1479
01:48:12,612 --> 01:48:14,865
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1480
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:17,409
The way to find peace is to stick.

1481
01:48:18,243 --> 01:48:20,579
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1482
01:48:20,745 --> 01:48:22,289
It might.

1483
01:48:23,707 --> 01:48:26,084
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?

1484
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:29,337
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

1485
01:48:32,424 --> 01:48:33,758
Man.

1486
01:48:35,719 --> 01:48:37,220
Fuck.

1487
01:48:42,184 --> 01:48:43,768
All right.

1488
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:47,898
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1489
01:48:48,064 --> 01:48:50,775
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...

1490
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:54,321
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

1491
01:48:54,487 --> 01:48:57,741
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1492
01:48:57,908 --> 01:48:59,284
Come on.

1493
01:48:59,451 --> 01:49:02,746
Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

1494
01:49:02,913 --> 01:49:06,458
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

1495
01:49:10,795 --> 01:49:12,297
What's going on?

1496
01:49:17,802 --> 01:49:19,262
Come on.

1497
01:49:35,153 --> 01:49:38,156
This is so bad for Seth, man.

1498
01:49:38,323 --> 01:49:41,493
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

1499
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:44,663
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1500
01:49:45,497 --> 01:49:46,790
Should we visit them?

1501
01:49:46,957 --> 01:49:49,084
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1502
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:51,586
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1503
01:49:51,753 --> 01:49:53,546
Listen, too...

1504
01:49:53,713 --> 01:49:57,759
...I saw a car cruising by the house last
night when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1505
01:49:57,926 --> 01:50:00,720
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1506
01:50:00,887 --> 01:50:02,847
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1507
01:50:04,266 --> 01:50:06,142
Oh, man. This is bad.

1508
01:50:08,561 --> 01:50:11,439
- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

1509
01:50:11,606 --> 01:50:13,275
If I made it through Chino...

1510
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:17,028
...this should be a piece of cake, right?

1511
01:50:17,195 --> 01:50:20,365
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1512
01:50:21,783 --> 01:50:23,201
Okay.

1513
01:50:23,785 --> 01:50:25,245
What are you gonna do?

1514
01:50:25,412 --> 01:50:27,163
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1515
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:29,457
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

1516
01:50:29,624 --> 01:50:31,459
It's gonna be fine.

1517
01:50:31,626 --> 01:50:33,336
Go turn that paper in.

1518
01:50:35,547 --> 01:50:38,216
- Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.

1519
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:47,684
I'll see you at home.

1520
01:50:49,602 --> 01:50:51,187
All right?

1521
01:50:51,563 --> 01:50:52,814
Yeah, I'll see you.

1522
01:50:52,981 --> 01:50:55,150
- Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.

1523
01:50:55,525 --> 01:50:57,068
See you later.

1524
01:51:02,991 --> 01:51:04,951
- We're gonna be late.
- We'd better go.

1525
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:07,704
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

1526
01:51:30,769 --> 01:51:33,688
- Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?

1527
01:51:33,938 --> 01:51:35,482
See you later.

1528
01:52:56,062 --> 01:52:57,480
- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!

1529
01:52:57,647 --> 01:52:59,732
- All right. All right.
- Get out of my way!

1530
01:52:59,899 --> 01:53:01,317
Let him go!

1531
01:53:02,986 --> 01:53:07,031
Oh, no. No! No! No!

1532
01:53:07,365 --> 01:53:09,534
Oh, Jesus.

1533
01:53:12,162 --> 01:53:14,038
No.

1534
01:53:14,205 --> 01:53:18,376
Oh, no, no. No.

1535
01:53:32,932 --> 01:53:34,642
Oh, Jesus.

1536
01:53:34,809 --> 01:53:36,978
God, what did I do?

1537
01:53:50,366 --> 01:53:52,494
Oh, God.

1538
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:54,829
Oh, God.

1539
01:54:05,757 --> 01:54:08,384
<i>So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.</i>

1540
01:54:08,551 --> 01:54:10,929
<i>My conclusion, right?</i>

1541
01:54:11,763 --> 01:54:13,848
<i>Well, my conclusion is...</i>

1542
01:54:14,015 --> 01:54:16,017
<i>...hate is baggage.</i>

1543
01:54:16,267 --> 01:54:19,562
<i>Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.</i>

1544
01:54:20,104 --> 01:54:21,981
<i>It's just not worth it.</i>

1545
01:54:24,776 --> 01:54:27,904
<i>Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.</i>

1546
01:54:28,404 --> 01:54:30,448
<i>He says someone else
has already said it best...</i>

1547
01:54:30,615 --> 01:54:35,119
<i>...so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.</i>

1548
01:54:35,286 --> 01:54:37,956
<i>So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:</i>

1549
01:54:39,541 --> 01:54:42,919
<i>"We are not enemies, but friends.</i>

1550
01:54:43,086 --> 01:54:45,505
<i>We must not be enemies.</i>

1551
01:54:45,672 --> 01:54:47,882
<i>Though passion may have strained...</i>

1552
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:51,302
<i>...it must not break
our bonds of affection.</i>

1553
01:54:51,469 --> 01:54:56,307
<i>The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...</i>

1554
01:54:56,474 --> 01:55:01,104
<i>...as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature."</i>
