And you must wake.

889
01:45:23,776 --> 01:45:25,642
I don't want to wake.

890
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:29,812
I want to stay here with you.

891
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,698
And <i>I</i> with you,

892
01:45:33,536 --> 01:45:35,447
but you must wake now.

893
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:40,748
Wake up, William.

894
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:42,408
Wake up.

895
01:45:44,547 --> 01:45:46,663
<i>William, wake up, wake up.</i>

896
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,252
CAMPBELL; William!

897
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:52,051
A royal entourage comes,
flying banners of truce

898
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,884
and the standards
of Longshanks himself!

899
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:40,975
I am the Princess of Wales.

900
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:44,012
I come as the king's servant
and with his authority.

901
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:46,514
To do what?

902
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,858
To discuss the king's proposals.

903
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,984
Will you speak with a woman?

904
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:17,466
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

905
01:47:17,514 --> 01:47:19,755
I have been given nothing.

906
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:22,349
God makes men what they are.

907
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,686
Did God make you
the sacker of peaceful cities,

908
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:29,516
the executioner of the king's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

909
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:34,521
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country,

910
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,360
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent Scots,

911
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:40,409
even women and children,
from the city walls.

912
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:47,708
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

913
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:51,375
(SPEAKING LATIN)

914
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:55,545
(SPEAKING LATIN)

915
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,809
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

916
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:11,228
You ask your king to his face. Ask him.

917
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:16,942
You see if his eyes can
convince you of the truth.

918
01:48:24,707 --> 01:48:26,823
Hamilton, leave us.

919
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:31,415
- Milady...
- Leave us. Now.

920
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:45,224
Let us talk plainly.

921
01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:47,636
You invade England,

922
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:51,268
but you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

923
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:55,309
The king desires peace.

924
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,896
Longshanks desires peace?

925
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:00,531
He declares it to me. I swear it.

926
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:02,904
He proposes that you
withdraw your attack.

927
01:49:02,953 --> 01:49:06,036
In return, he grants you title, estates,

928
01:49:06,123 --> 01:49:10,162
and this chest of gold,
which I am to pay to you personally.

929
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:15,088
A lordship and titles. Gold.
That I should become Judas?

930
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:19,046
- Peace is made in such ways.
- Slaves are made in such ways!

931
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:25,514
The last time Longshanks
spoke of peace, I was a boy,

932
01:49:25,601 --> 01:49:27,968
and many Scottish nobles,
who would not be slaves,

933
01:49:28,062 --> 01:49:33,478
were lured by him, under a flag of truce,
to a barn where he had them hanged.

934
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:36,813
I was very young.

935
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:40,321
But I remember Longshanks'
notion of peace.

936
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,869
I understand you have suffered.

937
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:50,323
I know about your woman.

938
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,836
She was my wife.

939
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:10,810
We married in secret because I would
not share her with an English lord.

940
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,847
They killed her to get to me.

941
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:17,103
(SIGHS)

942
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:22,446
I have never spoken of it.

943
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:26,989
I don't know why I tell you now,

944
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,327
except I see her strength in you.

945
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:40,414
One day, you'll be a queen,

946
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:44,965
and you must open your eyes.

947
01:50:52,271 --> 01:50:57,266
You tell your king that
William Wallace will not be ruled,

948
01:50:58,026 --> 01:51:00,609
and nor will any Scot while I live.

949
01:51:34,062 --> 01:51:38,647
My son's loyal wife
returns unkilled by the heathen.

950
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:41,772
- So he accepted our bribe?
- No, he did not.

951
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:45,525
Then why does he stay?

952
01:51:45,616 --> 01:51:48,779
My scouts tell me
that he has not advanced.

953
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:50,951
He waits for you at York.

954
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:53,780
He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

955
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:56,616
if you are man enough
to come and face him.

956
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:57,954
Did he?

957
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:02,838
The Welsh bowmen
will not be detected

958
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:07,544
arriving so far around his flank.

959
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:11,757
The main force of our armies
from France will land here

960
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:13,925
to the north of Edinburgh.

961
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:19,643
Conscripts from Ireland will
approach from the southwest to here.

962
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:23,476
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?

963
01:52:23,528 --> 01:52:26,816
Even if you dispatch them today,
they'd take weeks to assemble.

964
01:52:26,907 --> 01:52:30,525
I dispatched them before I sent your wife.

965
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:39,834
So our little ruse succeeded. Thank you.

966
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:43,754
And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York,

967
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:47,750
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

968
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:55,513
You spoke with this Wallace in private.

969
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:57,843
Tell me,

970
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:01,480
what kind of man is he?

971
01:53:02,859 --> 01:53:04,725
A mindless barbarian.

972
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:08,191
Not a king like you, milord.

973
01:53:10,409 --> 01:53:12,867
You may return to your embroidery.

974
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:15,448
Humbly, milord.

975
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:18,201
You brought back
the money, of course.

976
01:53:21,378 --> 01:53:22,539
No.

977
01:53:23,422 --> 01:53:26,380
I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

978
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:28,582
(LAUGHING)

979
01:53:28,677 --> 01:53:31,544
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

980
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:35,097
Forgive me, sire.

981
01:53:35,183 --> 01:53:39,222
I thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness

982
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:40,895
to those you mean to rule.

983
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:44,022
(COUGHS)

984
01:53:44,067 --> 01:53:47,901
My greatness will be
better demonstrated

985
01:53:47,946 --> 01:53:53,441
when Wallace returns to Scotland
and finds his country in ashes.

986
01:53:53,535 --> 01:53:55,151
<i>(consume)</i>

987
01:53:57,914 --> 01:54:01,498
William! There's riders approaching!

988
01:54:08,759 --> 01:54:11,626
Personal escort of the princess.

989
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,210
Aye.

990
01:54:14,139 --> 01:54:16,426
Must have made an impression.

991
01:54:17,225 --> 01:54:18,340
Aye.

992
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:21,427
I didn't think
you were in the tent that long.

993
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:26,564
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

994
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:31,653
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

995
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:59,639
It's true! English ships are
moving up from the south!

996
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:02,809
I don't know about the Welsh
yet, but the Irish have landed!

997
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:05,979
I had to see it with me own
eyes before I could believe it.

998
01:55:06,024 --> 01:55:08,265
What the hell are the Irish
doing fighting with the English?

999
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:12,027
I wouldn't worry about them.
Didn't I tell you before?

1000
01:55:12,364 --> 01:55:14,321
It's my island.

1001
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:17,901
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council.

1002
01:55:17,994 --> 01:55:19,655
- Order it.
- Aye.

1003
01:55:19,704 --> 01:55:22,196
(SHOUTS)

1004
01:55:24,376 --> 01:55:27,164
- Your island?
- My island! Yup!

1005
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,083
CRAIG: You want to negotiate?

1006
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:31,459
No, please, gentlemen!

1007
01:55:31,508 --> 01:55:34,000
Lords, Craig is right!

1008
01:55:34,052 --> 01:55:37,215
This time, our only
option is to negotiate.

1009
01:55:37,305 --> 01:55:40,798
Now, unless you want to see
Edinburgh razed to the ground...

1010
01:55:47,232 --> 01:55:50,600
My army has marched for
more days than I can remember

1011
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:54,733
and we still have preparations
to make, so I'll make this plain.

1012
01:55:55,866 --> 01:55:58,233
We require every soldier
you can summon.

1013
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:01,323
Your personal escorts,
even yourselves,

1014
01:56:01,913 --> 01:56:03,699
and we need them now.

1015
01:56:05,125 --> 01:56:08,538
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

1016
01:56:08,587 --> 01:56:10,203
Other options?

1017
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:15,587
Don't you wish at least to
lead your men onto the field

1018
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:19,921
and barter a better deal with Longshanks
before you tuck tail and run?

1019
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:21,881
- Sir William...
- We can't defeat this army!

1020
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:24,012
- We can! And we will!
- Sir William!

1021
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:30,063
We won at Stirling,
and still you quibble!

1022
01:56:31,943 --> 01:56:34,776
We won at York,
and you would not support us.

1023
01:56:35,322 --> 01:56:39,236
If you'll not stand up with us now,
then I say you're cowards.

1024
01:56:44,873 --> 01:56:48,707
And if you are Scotsmen,
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

1025
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:52,249
Please, Sir William,
speak with me alone.

1026
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:55,922
I beg you.

1027
01:56:59,387 --> 01:57:02,049
Now, you've achieved
more than anyone ever dreamed,

1028
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:05,932
but fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.

1029
01:57:05,977 --> 01:57:07,934
It's well beyond rage.

1030
01:57:09,898 --> 01:57:11,434
Help me.

1031
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:16,272
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

1032
01:57:16,363 --> 01:57:18,274
Now is our chance. Now.

1033
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:20,488
If we join, we can win.

1034
01:57:20,575 --> 01:57:24,614
If we win, well, then we'll have
what none of us have ever had before.

1035
01:57:25,664 --> 01:57:27,154
A country of our own.

1036
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:33,911
You're the rightful leader, and
there is strength in you. I see it.

1037
01:57:39,177 --> 01:57:40,508
Unite us.

1038
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:47,133
Unite us! Unite the clans.

1039
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:56,475
- All right.
- Right.

1040
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:03,490
This cannot be the way.

1041
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:08,617
You said yourself,
the nobles will not support Wallace.

1042
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:14,622
So how does it help us to join
the side that is slaughtered?

1043
01:58:15,463 --> 01:58:17,454
I gave him my word.

1044
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:27,590
I know it is hard.

1045
01:58:28,435 --> 01:58:30,142
Being a leader is.

1046
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:32,727
Now, Son...

1047
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:36,560
Son, look at me.

1048
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:45,949
I cannot be king.

1049
01:58:46,703 --> 01:58:49,786
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

1050
01:58:50,498 --> 01:58:55,868
What I tell you, you must do.
Not for me, not for yourself,

1051
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,911
for your country.

1052
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:15,387
HAMISH: Lads, make way.

1053
01:59:15,482 --> 01:59:16,563
Coming through you.

1054
01:59:23,448 --> 01:59:26,782
Make way, lads. Make...

1055
01:59:26,868 --> 01:59:29,326
(MEN CHATTERING)

1056
01:59:30,705 --> 01:59:32,912
The Bruce is not coming, William.

1057
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:34,914
He'll come.

1058
01:59:36,544 --> 01:59:39,002
Mornay and Lochlan have come,

1059
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:42,464
so will the Bruce.

1060
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:49,050
Quite a lovely gathering.

1061
01:59:50,308 --> 01:59:52,140
Wouldn't you agree?

1062
01:59:55,689 --> 01:59:58,807
- The archers are ready, sire.
- Not the archers.

1063
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:02,438
My scouts tell me their archers
are miles away and no threat to us.

1064
02:00:02,487 --> 02:00:06,902
Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.
The dead cost nothing.

1065

I gave Mornay double
his lands in Scotland

1081
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:17,572
with matching estates in England.
Lochlan turned for much less.

Won't we hit our own troops?

Yes, but we'll hit theirs as well.

1122
02:13:09,732 --> 02:13:13,350
we must have alliance
with England to prevail here.

1123
02:13:14,236 --> 02:13:16,273
You achieved that.

1124
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:20,106
You saved your family,
increased your land.

1125
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:24,869
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1126

Men fight for me

1129
02:13:38,093 --> 02:13:40,505
because if they do not,
I throw them off my land

1130
02:13:40,596 --> 02:13:43,805
and I starve their wives
and their children.

1131
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:49,057

1132

they fought for William Wallace,

and he fights for something
that I've never had.

1134
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:00,776
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

1135
02:14:00,824 --> 02:14:06,445
and I saw it in his face on the battlefield,
and it's tearing me apart!

1136

- All men betray, all lose heart.
- I don't want to lose heart!

And there's no telling who'll be next.

If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct,

1174
02:18:44,650 --> 02:18:48,234
he warmed to our future
queen and would trust her.

1175
02:18:49,905 --> 02:18:53,569
So we'll dispatch her with the
notion that she comes in peace.

Milord, the princess
might be taken hostage

02:19:07,172 --> 02:19:11,917
we would soon find the king of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

Well, what's the point?

1204
02:24:40,130 --> 02:24:42,462
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1205
02:24:42,549 --> 02:24:44,916
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1206
02:24:44,968 --> 02:24:47,585
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1207
02:24:47,679 --> 02:24:50,137
So let the council swear publicly.

1208
02:24:50,223 --> 02:24:53,591
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1209
02:24:53,685 --> 02:24:56,768
Others think you'll pay
them Mornay's wages.

1210
02:24:56,813 --> 02:24:59,680
So we bid you to Edinburgh.
Meet us two days from now.

1211
02:24:59,774 --> 02:25:02,357
Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1212
02:25:02,444 --> 02:25:06,187
- Scotland will be one.
- One? You mean us and you.

1213
02:25:06,281 --> 02:25:08,113
No.

1214
02:25:09,201 --> 02:25:11,033
I mean this.

1215
02:25:13,038 --> 02:25:15,621
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1216
02:25:25,008 --> 02:25:27,625
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1217
02:25:27,719 --> 02:25:31,337
I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it already at Falkirk.

1218
02:25:31,431 --> 02:25:34,139
- Aye.
- I know. I saw.

1219
02:25:34,184 --> 02:25:36,972

what about the others?

- It's a trap. Are you blind?
- Look at us.

We've got to try.
We can't do this alone.

- Aye, I do.

1237
02:26:25,151 --> 02:26:28,860
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.

You're my son, and you
have always known my mind.

1271

- You deceived me.
- You let yourself be deceived.

1276
02:30:19,677 --> 02:30:24,217
William Wallace,
you stand in taint of high treason.

1277
02:30:25,225 --> 02:30:28,263
- Against whom?
- Against your king.

1278
02:30:29,687 --> 02:30:31,678
Have you anything to say?

1279
02:30:32,607 --> 02:30:34,598
Never in my whole life

1280
02:30:36,277 --> 02:30:38,609
did I swear allegiance to him.

1281
02:30:39,822 --> 02:30:42,985
It matters not. He is your king.

1282
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:48,487
Confess, and you may
receive a quick death.

1283
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:52,245
Deny, and you must
be purified by pain.

1284
02:30:52,293 --> 02:30:53,909
Do you confess?

1285
02:30:56,214 --> 02:30:59,332

- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

1289
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,105
We've got orders
from the king that nobody...

1290
02:31:24,158 --> 02:31:26,525
The king will be dead in a month
and his son is a weakling.

1291
02:31:26,619 --> 02:31:29,111
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

1292
02:31:29,163 --> 02:31:30,949
Now open this door.

1299
02:32:04,782 --> 02:32:09,117
Sir, I come to beg you

1300
02:32:11,164 --> 02:32:15,909
to confess all and swear allegiance to
the king that he might show you mercy.

1301
02:32:16,794 --> 02:32:19,206
Will he show mercy to my country?

1302
02:32:20,048 --> 02:32:24,383
Mercy is to die quickly,
perhaps even live in a tower.

1303
02:32:24,427 --> 02:32:26,919
In time, who knows what can happen

1304
02:32:28,556 --> 02:32:30,718
if you can only live.

1305
02:32:35,229 --> 02:32:37,061
If I swear to him,

1306
02:32:37,857 --> 02:32:41,020
then all that I am is dead already.

It will dull your pain.

1313
02:33:11,432 --> 02:33:15,300
No. It will numb my wits,
and I must have them all.

1314
02:33:16,604 --> 02:33:18,845
For if I'm senseless, or if I wail,

1315
02:33:19,357 --> 02:33:22,099
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1316
02:33:22,151 --> 02:33:25,018
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1317
02:33:25,613 --> 02:33:26,899
