1
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,298
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:53,112
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:58,580
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:03,381
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:07,921
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:10,290
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:13,862
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,262
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:17,961
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:24,537
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:28,841
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:32,316
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:36,752
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:39,051
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:41,126
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,349
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,011
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,457
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,722
You should be proud.

20
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,102
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:51,230
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:56,398
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:56,703 --> 00:03:00,935
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:03,668
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:08,406
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,275
You do good in school?

27
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:17,423
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,185
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:25,294
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:35,066
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:37,938
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:39,738
Good.

33
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:42,438
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,382
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:50,546
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:53,852
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,325
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:59,056
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:02,725
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:05,064
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,831
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,872
You have to take it.

43
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,311
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:15,945
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:18,812
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:22,752
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:26,924
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:37,428
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,840
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,309
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:49,745
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:54,444
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:57,385
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:01,118
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,260
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,233
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:13,535
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,403
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,670
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:23,475
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,517
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:29,850
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,149
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:34,761
<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:38,489
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,564
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:52,542
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:56,410
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:59,374
Pencils.

70
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:06,420
Begin.

71
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,158
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,372
Forget it.

73
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,169
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:30,448
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,412
They are.

76
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:36,147
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:41,761
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,761
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:45,955
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,499
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:51,228
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:54,670
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:58,341
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:01,606
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:05,548
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:11,089
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,192
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,454
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,669
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:34,610
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,549
School's out.

92
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,262
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,053
You earned it.

94
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,291
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:57,992
All right.

96
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,695
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:01,773
<i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

98
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:04,068
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:06,940
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:08,478
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:11,048
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:14,278
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,617
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:31,536
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:35,197
- ... to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:38,242
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:42,245
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,914
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,078
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:53,285
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,826
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:05,229
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,032
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:17,943
You can sit.

115
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:24,622
So...

116
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,559
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,526
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,394
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,060
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:42,164
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:43,866
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,069
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,646
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:51,750
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:56,379
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:59,081
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,898
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:10,365
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:14,268
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:18,374
That's right.

131
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,937
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:23,343
Closed casket?

133
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:26,781
That's right.

134
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,322
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:32,617
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:35,192
...you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,133
I got a question.

138
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:43,360
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,774
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:03,183
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:08,160
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:12,291
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:15,593
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:18,431
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:23,341
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:25,606
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,612
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,614
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:37,154
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:40,349
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:43,860
- ... from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,793
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,136
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:56,867
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:57,043 --> 00:12:00,137
This is an elite unit.

156
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:04,579
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,810
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,716
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,653
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,987
And we will do it.

161
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:18,619
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:21,093
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,326
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,433
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,065
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:32,769
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:35,642
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,908
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:42,043
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:44,952
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,286
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,588
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,527
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:54,996
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:58,137
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:00,772
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,408
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:07,444
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:10,515
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,981
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:17,021
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,420
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,526
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:25,960
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:29,101
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:31,760
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:35,702
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:38,767
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:42,176
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:42,348 --> 00:13:45,317
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:48,977
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:54,218
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:58,720
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:01,526
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:05,993
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:11,338
We have a question.

197
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:17,176
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,647
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:22,481
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,283
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,256
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:30,692
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:31,955
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:34,099
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:35,632
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:39,238
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,373
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:46,070
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:49,079
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:52,082
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:55,847
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,683
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:58,858 --> 00:14:59,950
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:06,858
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:10,963
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,632
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,647
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,750
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,320
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:33,323
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:38,487
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,899
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:46,095
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:48,968
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:53,841
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:58,780
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,924
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,956
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:17,561
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:20,365
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,771
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:27,902
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:31,483
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:32,485 --> 00:16:36,216
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,220
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:41,726
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,394
No.

238
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,992
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,191
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:54,063
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,538
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:57,477 --> 00:16:59,172
Sure.

243
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:04,480
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,175
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:10,550
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:13,920
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:16,891
Amen.

248
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:40,317
So what do I do?

249
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:44,453
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:46,717
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:47,326 --> 00:17:49,226
Tax-free.

252
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:55,132
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:59,032
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:00,263
Given your nature.

255
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:03,442
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:06,134
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:08,007
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:12,508
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,043
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:18,088
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:22,216
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,727
Do it again.

263
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,560
For me.

264
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:05,804
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,873
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,374
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:15,207
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:34,062
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:37,168
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:40,328
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:44,673
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:47,108
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,510
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,045
So you know.

275
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:56,052
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:59,024
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:02,320
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,124
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:09,692
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,429
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,606
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:20,037
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:22,374
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,873
I got, like...

285
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:29,510
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:32,453
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,287
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:39,158
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,697
You know what you...

290
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,200
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:49,467
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:53,544
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,340
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:02,053
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:06,388
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:10,353
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:15,091
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:18,795
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:22,441
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:25,702
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:28,847
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:32,449
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:36,076
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,688
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:41,587
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,752
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,761
...concerned.

308
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:51,803
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:54,337
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:57,271
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,911
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:02,806
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:05,473
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:07,619
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:10,287
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:13,548
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,888
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:17,063 --> 00:22:20,260
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:23,365
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,007
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,810
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:39,876
Do you know me?

323
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,915
No. No.

324
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,289
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,450
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,618
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:53,060
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:55,894
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:56,068 --> 00:22:59,094
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:04,467
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:05,978 --> 00:23:09,573
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:11,708
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:14,717
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,183
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:21,451
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,360
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,791
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:38,769
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:42,239
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:48,515
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,085
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,927
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,068
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:07,906
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,008
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:12,769
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,175
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:17,577
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,310
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,920
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,921
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,026
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:31,459
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,894
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,900
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:37,968
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:42,470
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:45,201
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:45,377 --> 00:24:47,641
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:50,646
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:52,647
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:55,651
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:58,381
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:01,492
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,719
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:06,262
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:06,432 --> 00:25:08,593
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,325
Southie projects.

369
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:13,165
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,365
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,271
- ... which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:21,504
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,877
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:29,779
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:31,388
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:33,024
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:35,717
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:38,363
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,931
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,536
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:48,434
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:51,206
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:53,072
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:55,577
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:57,648
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:57,816 --> 00:25:59,443
You girls have a good day.

387
00:26:00,252 --> 00:26:03,915
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:05,989
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:12,224
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:14,127
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,133
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:17,303 --> 00:26:19,464
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:22,630
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:25,641
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:27,643
Allegedly.

396
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:29,809
Allegedly.

397
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:32,450
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:34,586
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:36,812
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:42,117
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:46,158
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,268
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:53,872
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:56,841
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,853
You making a house call?

406
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:15,483
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:19,153
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:22,994
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:26,763
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:30,773
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,604
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:36,236
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:38,508
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:40,777
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:44,081
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,553
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:48,591
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:52,253
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:55,195
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:58,029
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:01,001
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:06,270
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:08,675
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:11,873
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:13,541
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:27,159
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:30,165
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,463
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,767
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:38,239
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,240
Cut him here.

432
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,481
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,744
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,583
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:55,284
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:58,430
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:01,088
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:04,292
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,698
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:09,307
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:12,933
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:16,570
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:19,582
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:22,186
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:25,221
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,620
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:30,023
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:33,289
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:34,989
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,226
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,927
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:52,945
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:54,879
Fuck!

454
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:58,216
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:05,496
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:15,834
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:20,069
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:28,719
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,445
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,180
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:32,357 --> 00:30:35,758
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,263
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:46,370
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:47,903
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:58,012
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:58,183 --> 00:31:00,048
...in your office all day long?

467
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:02,847
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:06,555
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:08,124
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:10,625
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,192
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,765
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:19,099
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,905
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:28,541
Don't you?

476
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:32,182
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:33,784
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:36,511
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:40,954
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:44,259
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:47,592
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,757
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:52,096
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:55,432
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:58,443 --> 00:31:59,774
Fair enough.

486
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:03,642
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:05,844
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,282
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:12,182
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:16,186
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,454
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:19,665 --> 00:32:21,565
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:25,661
...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:28,872
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:33,068
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:38,147
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:42,183
Schuyler.

498
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,165
Do you know who I am?

499
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:02,930
No.

500
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:11,279
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:23,951
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:28,526
No.

503
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,105
Come with me.

504
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:42,909
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:49,579
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:53,623
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:02,531
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:04,862
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:07,770
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:11,534
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,736
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:17,313
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:19,550
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,917
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:30,591
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:30,762 --> 00:34:33,060
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,961
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,002
Shoes.

519
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:46,133
I knew your father.

520
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,444
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:56,287
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:00,115
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:03,022
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,027
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:09,857
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:13,501
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:16,072
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,677
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:21,710
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,142
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:24,839
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:28,349
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,687
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:41,763
He's clean.

535
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:45,198
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:49,170
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:54,301
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:58,779
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:01,884
I just can't know.

540
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:06,552
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,953
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:11,496 --> 00:36:14,465
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,466
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:18,403 --> 00:36:23,306
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:26,603
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,806
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,779
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:36,185
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:41,817
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:46,723
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:50,364
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:55,873
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,477
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,883
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:09,111
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:11,651
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:13,984
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,253
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:20,757
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:22,627
Well, these days...

561
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,926
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,438
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,599
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,246
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:43,487
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,317
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,956
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:55,023
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,298
She wasn't.

570
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:02,470
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:07,602
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,805
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:12,711
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:14,977
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:39,368
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:43,241
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:46,179
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:47,818
Thanks.

579
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:54,316
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,289
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:57,723
All right, see you then.

582
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,930
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:06,935
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,176
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:21,080
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:25,552
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:27,919
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:31,252
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:39,196
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:40,668
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,903
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:59,055
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:03,218
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:07,891
Lennon said:

595
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,328
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:14,905
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:20,508
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:23,943
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:33,721
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:36,559
Too bad.

601
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:40,060
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:42,955
Now what?

603
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:46,436
Choir practice.

604
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:48,803
Choir practice...

605
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:56,079
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:57,215 --> 00:41:00,981
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:02,813
...and make something out of it.

608
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:04,454
For instance...

609
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:07,022
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,359
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:14,358
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:16,022
French.

613
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:18,669
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:20,532
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:24,671
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:26,811
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:29,208
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:31,315
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:35,151
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:46,025
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:48,890
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:41:49,067 --> 00:41:51,331
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:53,903
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:56,370
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:59,408
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:02,512
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,080
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,514
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:08,674
...you let us know.

630
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,852
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,523
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:17,695 --> 00:42:19,686
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:23,160
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,665
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:29,034
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:31,038
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,244
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,407
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:40,847
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:44,045
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:46,457 --> 00:42:49,290
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:52,622
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:55,732
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,028
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:02,604
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:43:02,774 --> 00:43:05,299
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:07,410
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:15,344
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,544
Hey.

650
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:19,820
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:23,995 --> 00:43:26,725
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:27,865 --> 00:43:29,526
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:31,498
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:33,569
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:33,738 --> 00:43:37,037
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,836
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:42,104
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,805
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:45,016 --> 00:43:48,110
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:51,153
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:51,322 --> 00:43:55,554
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,453
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:58,823
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:58,997 --> 00:44:01,124
- ... knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:03,392
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:44:03,568 --> 00:44:06,401
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:07,833
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:10,236
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:12,842
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,070
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:17,510
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:17,682 --> 00:44:19,013
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:21,811
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,220
Bottom line...

675
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:26,482
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:29,525
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:31,195 --> 00:44:33,595
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:33,765 --> 00:44:36,063
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:38,828
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:39,003 --> 00:44:40,436
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:42,732
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:47,037
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:47,211 --> 00:44:50,703
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:53,780
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:55,612
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:55,787 --> 00:44:58,722
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,517
Good.

688
00:45:02,026 --> 00:45:03,891
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:06,859
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:24,415 --> 00:45:26,383
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:27,485 --> 00:45:29,282
You know...

692
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:32,921
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:35,150
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:35,326 --> 00:45:37,590
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:40,560
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:42,962
And he could do it...

697
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:47,436
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:56,806
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:56,981 --> 00:46:00,473
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:02,949
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:05,648
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,590
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:15,191
And I think about this.

704
00:46:21,105 --> 00:46:23,801
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:27,510
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:29,703
School?

707
00:46:31,716 --> 00:46:34,446
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,712
...school is out.

709
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:40,219
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:43,288
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:44,495 --> 00:46:47,464
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:50,294
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:52,694
Little boys...

714
00:46:53,137 --> 00:46:57,301
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:00,309
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,716
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:11,912
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:14,425 --> 00:47:17,394
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:17,562 --> 00:47:20,963
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:21,766 --> 00:47:23,927
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:25,796
Pay them.

722
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:30,165
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:36,981 --> 00:47:40,109
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:42,650
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,754
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:44,922 --> 00:47:47,482
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:50,320
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:53,122
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:53,865 --> 00:47:55,264
Beeper number.

730
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:58,265
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:01,635
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:05,877 --> 00:48:08,345
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:10,639
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:14,242
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:14,418 --> 00:48:16,477
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:16,654 --> 00:48:17,916
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:20,751
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:23,253
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:26,885
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:30,056
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:30,234 --> 00:48:31,895
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:36,599
I beeped you.

743
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:39,901
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:40,077 --> 00:48:43,478
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:48,117
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:48,286 --> 00:48:50,584
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:55,293 --> 00:48:58,820
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:05,432
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:09,197
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,732
So make the call.

751
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:20,839
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:24,915
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:41,706 --> 00:49:46,200
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:48,311
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:49:49,847 --> 00:49:52,782
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:57,049
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:58,984
Bye.

758
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,387
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,738
Thank you.

760
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:23,479
So who are you?

761
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:27,083
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:28,912
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:29,086 --> 00:50:32,419
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,286
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:37,552
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:37,728 --> 00:50:41,095
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:54,074
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,678
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:11,852
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:17,435 --> 00:51:19,369
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:21,129
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:32,178
Do you lie?

773
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:36,075
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:37,948
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:41,423
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:41,592 --> 00:51:43,685
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:45,021
You lie.

778
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:47,854
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:48,032 --> 00:51:50,091
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:55,694
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:59,143 --> 00:52:01,134
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:06,744
Did you?

783
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:08,544
No.

784
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:12,618
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,384
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:17,194 --> 00:52:19,492
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:21,563
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:44,148
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:52,361
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,327
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:59,166
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:52:59,336 --> 00:53:01,566
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:03,534
A mass murderer.

794
00:53:03,707 --> 00:53:06,904
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:09,707
And your hand...

796
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:12,781
...steady.

797
00:53:15,186 --> 00:53:19,486
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:19,657 --> 00:53:21,852
...does not shake.

799
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,150
Ever.

800
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:35,130
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:37,608 --> 00:53:39,599
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,978
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:46,947
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:49,278
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:49,453 --> 00:53:52,650
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:56,054
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:58,588
Should I?

808
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:02,229
So do they all come in here...

809
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:04,629
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:08,104
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:08,272 --> 00:54:11,469
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:13,769
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:15,778
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:15,946 --> 00:54:18,244
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:20,883
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:23,952
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:27,147
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:29,121
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:38,467
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:42,163
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:43,863
Yeah.

822
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:46,166
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:54:46,577 --> 00:54:50,809
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:50,981 --> 00:54:52,812
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,616
No.

826
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,280
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:04,859
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:07,930
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:08,098 --> 00:55:10,464
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:12,226
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:12,403 --> 00:55:15,531
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:18,834
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:21,375
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:25,106
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:25,282 --> 00:55:27,307
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:29,247
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,854
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:32,022 --> 00:55:35,253
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:39,021
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:39,196 --> 00:55:41,323
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:41,498 --> 00:55:43,728
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:49,271
- ... you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,342
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,204
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,679
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,408
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:56:01,585 --> 00:56:03,951
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:06,223 --> 00:56:07,918
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:08,092 --> 00:56:10,219
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:13,693
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:15,559
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:18,668
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:22,533
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:22,706 --> 00:56:24,401
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,338
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,876
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:30,274
You know that.

858
00:56:31,582 --> 00:56:33,447
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:34,218 --> 00:56:36,049
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:38,055 --> 00:56:39,647
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:40,224 --> 00:56:42,954
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:43,394 --> 00:56:45,123
No bullshit.

863
00:56:45,662 --> 00:56:48,825
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:51,735 --> 00:56:53,259
You serious?

865
00:56:53,437 --> 00:56:55,234
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:59,243 --> 00:57:01,803
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:57:01,979 --> 00:57:03,640
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:07,680
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:09,648
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,118
We are this close:

871
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:15,920
All right?

872
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:18,956
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:21,927
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:22,499 --> 00:57:25,024
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:25,302 --> 00:57:27,099
...what do you want?

876
00:57:27,504 --> 00:57:28,937
You want the truth?

877
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,799
Valium.

878
00:57:33,143 --> 00:57:36,271
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:36,447 --> 00:57:39,848
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:40,017 --> 00:57:43,714
- ... before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:43,887 --> 00:57:48,221
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:48,392 --> 00:57:49,984
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,684
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:54,558
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:56,562
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:56,733 --> 00:58:00,362
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:58:00,537 --> 00:58:03,131
- ... the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:58:03,307 --> 00:58:07,437
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:08,600
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:12,840
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:13,383 --> 00:58:15,749
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:25,324
Two pills?

893
00:58:26,196 --> 00:58:28,357
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:28,532 --> 00:58:30,693
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:30,868 --> 00:58:33,860
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:34,037 --> 00:58:36,437
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:41,044
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:42,412 --> 00:58:44,039
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:58:52,756 --> 00:58:55,418
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:55,592 --> 00:58:57,389
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:57,561 --> 00:58:59,461
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:04,727
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:59:04,902 --> 00:59:07,769
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:11,364
What's this?

905
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:14,675
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:14,845 --> 00:59:16,403
Yeah?

907
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,207
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:18,782 --> 00:59:21,273
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:21,451 --> 00:59:23,612
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:27,518
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:27,691 --> 00:59:31,320
You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:31,495 --> 00:59:32,757
Thank you.

913
00:59:33,997 --> 00:59:36,557
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:36,733 --> 00:59:38,724
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,463
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:49,313 --> 00:59:52,180
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:53,714
Come on in.

918
00:59:54,818 --> 00:59:58,811
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:58,989 --> 01:00:00,581
Yes, those.

920
01:00:00,757 --> 01:00:04,488
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:07,186
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:09,628
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:13,394
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,435
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:15,606 --> 01:00:18,666
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:18,842 --> 01:00:20,207
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:20,844 --> 01:00:24,712
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:27,076
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:31,209
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:32,055 --> 01:00:34,990
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:37,683
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:37,861 --> 01:00:40,625
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:40,797 --> 01:00:43,129
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,325
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:50,064
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:55,178 --> 01:00:57,305
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:57,481 --> 01:00:59,642
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
01:00:59,816 --> 01:01:02,307
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

939
01:01:03,153 --> 01:01:05,053
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:05,355 --> 01:01:08,722
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:08,892 --> 01:01:11,053
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:17,364
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:18,268 --> 01:01:20,031
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:20,203 --> 01:01:22,068
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:22,372 --> 01:01:24,863
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:25,642 --> 01:01:29,510
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:32,441
Thank you.

948
01:01:33,684 --> 01:01:35,618
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:35,786 --> 01:01:38,949
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:39,122 --> 01:01:41,852
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:42,025 --> 01:01:44,960
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:46,755
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:54,465
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:54,905 --> 01:01:57,135
All cellphone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:57,307 --> 01:02:00,071
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:06,379
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:09,586 --> 01:02:10,746
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:48,186
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:50,861 --> 01:02:53,159
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,159
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:55,532 --> 01:02:57,363
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,408
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:08,478 --> 01:03:10,537
All right, turn off your cellphones.

964
01:03:10,714 --> 01:03:13,706
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:39,499
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:39,676 --> 01:03:41,576
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:41,745 --> 01:03:44,475
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:47,708
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:57,085
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:57,494 --> 01:04:01,123
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:14,845 --> 01:04:17,370
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:17,814 --> 01:04:20,681
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:21,084 --> 01:04:24,781
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:28,356
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:30,421
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:40,236
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:43,031
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:43,206 --> 01:04:46,505
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:46,943 --> 01:04:49,468
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:49,646 --> 01:04:51,841
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:07,898 --> 01:05:12,767
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:12,936 --> 01:05:15,097
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.

983
01:05:15,605 --> 01:05:17,800
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:20,374
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:22,010
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:22,178 --> 01:05:24,738
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:24,915 --> 01:05:26,815
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:26,983 --> 01:05:29,952
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:43,997
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:51,038
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:51,207 --> 01:05:52,697
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:55,973
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:56,346 --> 01:05:57,608
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:58,148 --> 01:06:01,276
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:07,754
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:07,924 --> 01:06:12,190
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:17,334 --> 01:06:20,770
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:21,338 --> 01:06:23,067
...is one guy...

999
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:25,432
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:27,906
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:29,508
...pays him.

1002
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:35,308
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:35,919 --> 01:06:38,149
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:46,596 --> 01:06:48,689
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:04,814 --> 01:07:07,806
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:11,578
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:11,755 --> 01:07:16,818
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:21,398 --> 01:07:24,333
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:30,173 --> 01:07:32,403
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:36,340
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:40,911
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:43,275
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:43,453 --> 01:07:46,718
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:50,155
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:50,493 --> 01:07:52,688
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:55,092
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1017
01:07:55,265 --> 01:07:58,257
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:58,435 --> 01:08:00,460
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:08:00,637 --> 01:08:03,265
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,273
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:06,443 --> 01:08:07,910
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1022
01:08:08,078 --> 01:08:11,138
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:11,314 --> 01:08:14,477
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:18,678
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:18,855 --> 01:08:22,382
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:27,019
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:27,197 --> 01:08:29,665
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,698
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:31,868 --> 01:08:34,928
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1030
01:08:35,105 --> 01:08:38,199
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:44,214 --> 01:08:47,377
...changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,950
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,145
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:55,058 --> 01:08:57,424
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:00,889
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,797
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,494
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:10,673 --> 01:09:13,141
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:14,674
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:14,844 --> 01:09:18,541
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:21,174
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:21,818 --> 01:09:23,809
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:24,454 --> 01:09:26,684
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:26,856 --> 01:09:29,188
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:33,322
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:36,065 --> 01:09:39,831
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:48,208
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:51,905
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:52,081 --> 01:09:54,174
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:59,722 --> 01:10:01,690
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:10:02,258 --> 01:10:04,283
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:04,794 --> 01:10:06,261
Yeah.

1053
01:10:07,697 --> 01:10:09,289
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:10,927
Sure.

1055
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:16,198
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:16,372 --> 01:10:18,533
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:19,008 --> 01:10:20,475
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:20,643 --> 01:10:22,804
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:24,571
We might have company.

1060
01:10:24,747 --> 01:10:26,738
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:27,483 --> 01:10:30,884
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:31,054 --> 01:10:34,751
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:36,113
Yeah?

1064
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:39,227
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:42,922
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:48,068
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:48,838 --> 01:10:51,306
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:54,601
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,472
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:56,646 --> 01:10:58,113
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:58,381 --> 01:11:00,508
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:11:00,683 --> 01:11:02,878
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:04,854 --> 01:11:06,583
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1074
01:11:06,756 --> 01:11:09,554
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1075
01:11:10,026 --> 01:11:11,323
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:11,494 --> 01:11:13,018
What?

1077
01:11:13,496 --> 01:11:15,623
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:15,798 --> 01:11:19,791
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:19,969 --> 01:11:23,132
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:24,974 --> 01:11:26,339
Something for work.

1081
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:30,377
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,844
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:33,016 --> 01:11:35,644
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:35,818 --> 01:11:37,513
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1085
01:11:37,687 --> 01:11:41,418
- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:41,591 --> 01:11:43,422
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:43,593 --> 01:11:46,994
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:47,163 --> 01:11:50,894
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:53,603 --> 01:11:54,968
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:55,138 --> 01:11:56,765
So earn it.

1091
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,699
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:59,876 --> 01:12:01,776
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:12:02,078 --> 01:12:04,478
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:07,445
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:07,617 --> 01:12:08,709
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1096
01:12:08,885 --> 01:12:12,480
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:12,655 --> 01:12:13,849
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1098
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:16,890
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,618
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:18,795 --> 01:12:22,663
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:22,832 --> 01:12:26,290
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1102
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:28,403
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:28,571 --> 01:12:32,735
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:36,174
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:36,346 --> 01:12:39,543
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:39,716 --> 01:12:44,244
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:46,217
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1108
01:12:46,389 --> 01:12:48,823
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:51,186
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:51,361 --> 01:12:53,090
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1111
01:12:53,262 --> 01:12:56,425
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1112
01:12:56,599 --> 01:12:59,898
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:13:00,069 --> 01:13:02,560
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:11,745
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:20,411
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:23,388
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:26,221
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:26,396 --> 01:13:30,389
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:13:30,566 --> 01:13:32,693
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:32,869 --> 01:13:36,771
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:38,930
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:42,075
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:42,245 --> 01:13:45,703
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:48,845
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:49,352 --> 01:13:50,580
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:50,753 --> 01:13:53,916
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:57,423
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1128
01:13:59,128 --> 01:14:01,961
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:14:02,632 --> 01:14:05,294
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:05,468 --> 01:14:09,427
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:09,806 --> 01:14:14,573
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:16,769
...or your life.

1133
01:14:17,747 --> 01:14:20,739
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:21,384 --> 01:14:23,113
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:26,566
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:27,203 --> 01:14:29,364
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:31,302
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:34,436
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:34,611 --> 01:14:38,240
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,650
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:44,684
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:44,955 --> 01:14:48,516
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:53,061
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:02,093
<i>Frankie.</i>

1145
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,506
<i>Frankie!</i>

1146
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,468
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1147
01:15:12,248 --> 01:15:14,113
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:14,284 --> 01:15:16,309
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:16,486 --> 01:15:19,319
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:23,892
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,551
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,524
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:33,862
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:35,971
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:39,130
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:39,309 --> 01:15:43,075
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:43,346 --> 01:15:45,507
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:45,682 --> 01:15:49,584
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,409
Fuck!

1160
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:54,887
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:55,058 --> 01:15:59,017
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:59,195 --> 01:16:01,686
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:04,761
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:08,028
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:08,204 --> 01:16:11,196
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:20,945
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:23,449
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:28,419
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:32,891
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:33,063 --> 01:16:35,429
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:35,598 --> 01:16:39,830
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:41,004 --> 01:16:43,632
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:47,343 --> 01:16:50,710
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:57,480
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:00,915
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:17:01,091 --> 01:17:04,458
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:04,627 --> 01:17:06,117
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:09,891
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:10,066 --> 01:17:11,693
Come on.

1180
01:17:47,237 --> 01:17:48,465
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,910
There it is.

1182
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:59,037
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:14,063 --> 01:18:15,997
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:18,334 --> 01:18:20,165
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,862
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,133
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:29,506
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,615
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:33,783 --> 01:18:35,614
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:36,452 --> 01:18:39,182
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:52,694
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:56,206 --> 01:18:58,572
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:58,741 --> 01:19:01,403
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:04,379
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:09,352 --> 01:19:11,343
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:13,682
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:13,856 --> 01:19:15,118
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:16,588
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,351
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:19,696 --> 01:19:21,027
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:21,397 --> 01:19:23,922
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,465
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:29,799
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:51,150
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:53,196 --> 01:19:55,255
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:20:02,171 --> 01:20:04,036
Look...

1207
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:05,970
- ... if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1208
01:20:06,142 --> 01:20:08,770
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:11,614 --> 01:20:13,582
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,511
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,356
That's me.

1212
01:20:30,433 --> 01:20:31,923
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:41,704
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:43,477
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:43,646 --> 01:20:46,308
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:46,482 --> 01:20:49,883
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,317
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:52,488 --> 01:20:55,082
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:56,025 --> 01:20:58,926
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:14,972
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:20,183 --> 01:21:21,844
Is it real?

1222
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:27,484
I think so.

1223
01:21:33,396 --> 01:21:35,261
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:36,989
No.

1225
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:39,730
I like that.

1226
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:53,235
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:58,773
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:58,948 --> 01:23:02,111
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:23:02,285 --> 01:23:06,517
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:10,853
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:11,027 --> 01:23:14,292
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:14,464 --> 01:23:17,797
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:17,967 --> 01:23:19,434
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:20,703 --> 01:23:22,568
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:25,172
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:28,108
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:28,277 --> 01:23:30,404
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:33,481
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:36,311
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:36,486 --> 01:23:40,547
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:41,357 --> 01:23:43,791
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:46,957
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:38,707
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:40,883 --> 01:24:43,078
Yeah...

1245
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:51,021
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:51,894 --> 01:24:54,920
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:55,097 --> 01:24:57,998
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:02,228
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:04,300
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:05,241 --> 01:25:07,801
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:09,877
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:10,046 --> 01:25:13,209
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:13,816 --> 01:25:15,477
I own the place.

1254
01:25:17,787 --> 01:25:20,381
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:21,724 --> 01:25:25,455
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:27,629
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:27,797 --> 01:25:30,095
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:30,266 --> 01:25:33,827
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:35,595
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:36,205 --> 01:25:38,605
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:42,971
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:43,145 --> 01:25:45,204
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:45,381 --> 01:25:49,818
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:49,986 --> 01:25:51,817
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:51,988 --> 01:25:54,388
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:54,557 --> 01:25:57,219
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:57,393 --> 01:25:59,623
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:59,795 --> 01:26:01,387
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:06,535 --> 01:26:09,333
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:09,505 --> 01:26:11,166
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,935
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:18,481 --> 01:26:19,641
Okay.

1273
01:26:23,486 --> 01:26:26,353
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:26,522 --> 01:26:30,549
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:30,726 --> 01:26:34,958
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:35,898 --> 01:26:38,389
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:38,567 --> 01:26:43,732
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:46,340
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:49,242
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:55,041
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:55,217 --> 01:26:56,878
Right?

1282
01:26:57,053 --> 01:26:59,681
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:59,855 --> 01:27:04,485
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,558
Christ.

1285
01:27:14,704 --> 01:27:17,229
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:18,007 --> 01:27:22,671
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:07,423 --> 01:28:08,890
Shit!

1288
01:28:47,797 --> 01:28:49,230
Fuck.

1289
01:30:07,376 --> 01:30:08,866
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:09,044 --> 01:30:11,205
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:15,384 --> 01:30:17,249
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:17,419 --> 01:30:19,114
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:42,244 --> 01:30:44,405
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:51,053 --> 01:30:52,281
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:53,355 --> 01:30:54,947
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:56,892 --> 01:30:58,553
No.

1297
01:30:58,727 --> 01:31:00,786
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:31:02,531 --> 01:31:03,896
It depends.

1299
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:09,730
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:13,467
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:14,443 --> 01:31:15,671
Cop.

1302
01:31:15,844 --> 01:31:21,111
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:21,283 --> 01:31:23,444
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:25,054 --> 01:31:27,682
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:32,025
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:33,062 --> 01:31:34,996
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:36,298 --> 01:31:38,357
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:39,735 --> 01:31:41,669
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:42,838 --> 01:31:46,205
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,070
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:48,744 --> 01:31:50,644
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:54,883 --> 01:32:00,253
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:03,424
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:32:03,892 --> 01:32:06,190
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:06,362 --> 01:32:08,455
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:09,264 --> 01:32:12,199
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:12,868 --> 01:32:16,031
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:18,107 --> 01:32:21,270
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:22,778 --> 01:32:24,803
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:25,547 --> 01:32:27,879
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:31,113
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:31,887 --> 01:32:36,381
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:36,558 --> 01:32:37,889
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:39,528 --> 01:32:41,428
...I quit.

1325
01:32:42,031 --> 01:32:46,434
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:49,537
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:33:00,682 --> 01:33:04,345
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:06,488 --> 01:33:10,515
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:11,393 --> 01:33:13,691
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:13,862 --> 01:33:16,194
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:16,365 --> 01:33:18,663
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:22,429
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:22,604 --> 01:33:24,731
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:24,907 --> 01:33:29,037
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:29,211 --> 01:33:32,476
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:35,780
But I like it.

1337
01:33:36,952 --> 01:33:39,716
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:39,888 --> 01:33:42,721
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:47,191
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:47,362 --> 01:33:49,762
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:49,932 --> 01:33:53,925
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,001
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:03,710
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,142
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:07,316 --> 01:34:10,251
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:10,419 --> 01:34:13,217
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:13,388 --> 01:34:15,788
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,892
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:21,359
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:22,929
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:24,032 --> 01:34:26,364
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:27,269 --> 01:34:28,793
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:28,971 --> 01:34:32,498
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:32,674 --> 01:34:34,767
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:34,943 --> 01:34:39,437
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:44,453 --> 01:34:45,977
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:46,155 --> 01:34:48,555
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:51,693
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:54,829
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:54,997 --> 01:34:58,524
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:59,368 --> 01:35:03,862
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:04,806 --> 01:35:07,969
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:09,244 --> 01:35:12,680
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:15,184 --> 01:35:17,209
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:23,585
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:25,249
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:26,562 --> 01:35:29,622
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:29,798 --> 01:35:32,062
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:33,068 --> 01:35:38,005
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:38,507 --> 01:35:39,940
Yeah.

1371
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:43,244
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:43,412 --> 01:35:47,508
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:50,018 --> 01:35:52,885
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:53,055 --> 01:35:54,920
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:55,424 --> 01:35:59,326
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:36:01,563 --> 01:36:03,895
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:36:04,866 --> 01:36:07,699
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:07,869 --> 01:36:11,032
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:20,443
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:21,283 --> 01:36:23,547
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:25,921 --> 01:36:27,479
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:30,318
- ... French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:30,492 --> 01:36:31,481
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:34,463 --> 01:36:36,795
Eat something.

1385
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,429
Problem?

1386
01:36:46,608 --> 01:36:50,135
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:50,312 --> 01:36:52,644
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:52,814 --> 01:36:54,941
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:55,117 --> 01:36:58,644
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:02,381
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:37:02,557 --> 01:37:03,546
Fucking prick.

1392
01:37:03,959 --> 01:37:06,951
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:07,129 --> 01:37:09,461
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:09,798 --> 01:37:13,131
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:13,902 --> 01:37:16,496
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:16,972 --> 01:37:21,033
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:22,778 --> 01:37:25,679
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:28,016 --> 01:37:31,281
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:31,453 --> 01:37:34,217
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:34,389 --> 01:37:35,617
No.

1401
01:37:38,093 --> 01:37:40,994
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:41,763 --> 01:37:45,460
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:45,634 --> 01:37:47,499
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:49,271 --> 01:37:51,637
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:01,909
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1406
01:38:02,117 --> 01:38:06,349
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1407
01:38:06,521 --> 01:38:11,322
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1408
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:14,752
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1409
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:20,930
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1410
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:24,505
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:27,268
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:28,577 --> 01:38:30,477
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:38:34,783 --> 01:38:37,616
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:38,854 --> 01:38:40,583
Another city.

1415
01:38:40,822 --> 01:38:43,154
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:44,659 --> 01:38:47,787
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:51,595
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1418
01:38:53,935 --> 01:38:55,732
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:55,904 --> 01:39:00,364
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:39:01,676 --> 01:39:06,010
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:18,624
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1422
01:39:36,878 --> 01:39:39,642
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:39,815 --> 01:39:42,841
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:43,018 --> 01:39:46,283
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:46,455 --> 01:39:47,444
Yeah.

1426
01:39:47,622 --> 01:39:51,319
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,793
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:40:00,735 --> 01:40:02,703
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:40:05,273 --> 01:40:08,003
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:09,778 --> 01:40:12,110
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,578
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:26,094 --> 01:40:30,121
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:31,867 --> 01:40:36,497
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:36,671 --> 01:40:40,869
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:41,643 --> 01:40:44,203
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:45,213 --> 01:40:47,306
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:47,482 --> 01:40:49,780
- ... and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:52,187 --> 01:40:53,814
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:54,289 --> 01:40:55,620
What?

1440
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:57,917
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,691
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1442
01:41:04,132 --> 01:41:07,260
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:07,435 --> 01:41:09,369
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:16,211 --> 01:41:19,271
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:19,447 --> 01:41:22,644
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:22,817 --> 01:41:26,116
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:27,721
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1448
01:41:27,889 --> 01:41:30,255
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1449
01:41:30,425 --> 01:41:33,883
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:34,062 --> 01:41:37,828
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:39,701 --> 01:41:41,328
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:41,503 --> 01:41:43,266
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:55,784 --> 01:41:58,150
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,844
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:42:00,021 --> 01:42:04,424
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,155
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:09,998 --> 01:42:13,934
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:14,102 --> 01:42:16,002
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:19,334
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:19,507 --> 01:42:23,273
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:23,445 --> 01:42:25,436
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:25,614 --> 01:42:29,141
<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1463
01:42:29,317 --> 01:42:32,047
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:34,518
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:40,726
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:18,426
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,568
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1468
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:24,438
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1469
01:43:24,606 --> 01:43:26,471
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:26,975 --> 01:43:28,374
No.

1471
01:43:30,011 --> 01:43:32,844
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:34,182 --> 01:43:37,811
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:37,986 --> 01:43:40,250
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:16,191 --> 01:44:19,388
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:19,561 --> 01:44:22,086
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:26,267 --> 01:44:27,894
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:35,136
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:36,644 --> 01:44:39,943
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:40,782 --> 01:44:42,272
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:43,576
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:43,752 --> 01:44:46,277
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:52,861 --> 01:44:55,295
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:58,899
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:59,067 --> 01:45:02,594
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:45:02,771 --> 01:45:05,103
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:11,946 --> 01:45:14,915
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:16,778
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:16,951 --> 01:45:19,749
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:19,921 --> 01:45:23,186
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:24,259 --> 01:45:25,317
Yeah?

1491
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:28,189
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:28,363 --> 01:45:30,695
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:30,865 --> 01:45:32,298
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:36,337 --> 01:45:37,497
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1495
01:45:37,672 --> 01:45:39,970
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:42,432
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1497
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:45,204
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,813
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:47,348 --> 01:45:48,576
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:50,342
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:50,518 --> 01:45:51,951
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,850
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:55,824 --> 01:45:57,348
Come on!

1504
01:46:03,998 --> 01:46:06,466
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:10,402
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:11,306 --> 01:46:13,740
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:13,908 --> 01:46:17,207
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1508
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:24,983
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:29,057 --> 01:46:30,854
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:31,025 --> 01:46:32,856
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:33,027 --> 01:46:36,053
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:53,681 --> 01:46:56,241
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:56,417 --> 01:46:59,443
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:59,621 --> 01:47:01,714
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:03,915
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:20,241 --> 01:47:23,233
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:27,582 --> 01:47:29,607
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:30,418 --> 01:47:32,477
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:35,556 --> 01:47:36,545
Fuck.

1520
01:47:36,724 --> 01:47:38,624
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:38,793 --> 01:47:41,489
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:50,204 --> 01:47:52,104
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:52,273 --> 01:47:55,037
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:55,643 --> 01:47:57,133
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:59,109
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,645
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:48:00,815 --> 01:48:02,476
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:04,174
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:07,287
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:07,455 --> 01:48:09,514
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:11,818
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:11,993 --> 01:48:13,358
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:13,528 --> 01:48:15,018
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:15,196 --> 01:48:16,959
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:26,666
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:28,176 --> 01:48:31,111
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:32,906
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:39,354 --> 01:48:41,549
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:45,124
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1540
01:48:45,293 --> 01:48:47,318
<i>Send some back...</i>

1541
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:07,842
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:08,016 --> 01:49:09,847
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:10,018 --> 01:49:12,179
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:12,353 --> 01:49:15,083
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:15,256 --> 01:49:17,656
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:18,559 --> 01:49:20,220
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:20,395 --> 01:49:21,885
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:22,063 --> 01:49:23,428
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:23,598 --> 01:49:26,761
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:26,934 --> 01:49:29,095
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:31,500
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:31,672 --> 01:49:35,073
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:35,243 --> 01:49:36,335
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:36,511 --> 01:49:40,072
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:40,248 --> 01:49:41,840
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:45,042
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:45,219 --> 01:49:47,346
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:47,522 --> 01:49:50,320
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:50,491 --> 01:49:53,358
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:53,528 --> 01:49:56,463
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:56,631 --> 01:49:58,997
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:59,167 --> 01:50:02,568
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:50:02,737 --> 01:50:04,204
Good.

1564
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,632
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:09,577 --> 01:50:11,408
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:11,579 --> 01:50:13,706
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:18,547
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:20,221 --> 01:50:22,781
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:22,957 --> 01:50:27,155
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,795
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:29,397 --> 01:50:32,298
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:32,467 --> 01:50:34,458
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:34,635 --> 01:50:37,661
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:37,839 --> 01:50:39,898
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,804
Yeah?

1576
01:50:50,017 --> 01:50:52,008
Yeah?

1577
01:50:52,487 --> 01:50:54,648
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:56,457 --> 01:50:58,152
What's that?

1579
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:02,618
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:07,465
Yeah?

1581
01:51:08,503 --> 01:51:12,303
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:16,438
When I called you...

1583
01:51:16,611 --> 01:51:18,841
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:19,013 --> 01:51:22,813
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:22,984 --> 01:51:26,818
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:27,288 --> 01:51:29,188
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:30,458 --> 01:51:33,018
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:34,295 --> 01:51:35,626
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:58,519 --> 01:52:01,920
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:52:02,089 --> 01:52:03,886
He's dead.

1591
01:52:04,058 --> 01:52:05,685
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,658
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1593
01:52:08,829 --> 01:52:10,854
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:11,032 --> 01:52:12,499
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:12,667 --> 01:52:15,864
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:16,037 --> 01:52:18,699
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1597
01:52:18,873 --> 01:52:20,340
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1598
01:52:20,508 --> 01:52:24,569
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:24,745 --> 01:52:26,178
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1600
01:52:26,347 --> 01:52:30,010
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:30,184 --> 01:52:32,243
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1602
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:36,083
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:39,419
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:39,594 --> 01:52:41,789
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:42,396 --> 01:52:43,795
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:44,298 --> 01:52:47,563
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:48,035 --> 01:52:50,026
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:50,204 --> 01:52:52,638
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:53,341 --> 01:52:55,639
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:53:03,551 --> 01:53:06,418
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:09,624 --> 01:53:11,387
I know.

1612
01:53:37,785 --> 01:53:41,687
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:46,827 --> 01:53:48,727
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:55,202 --> 01:53:56,931
Yeah...

1615
01:54:01,509 --> 01:54:03,136
...I know.

1616
01:56:11,772 --> 01:56:13,262
Yeah.

1617
01:56:14,074 --> 01:56:17,305
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:17,745 --> 01:56:19,303
Who are you?

1619
01:56:19,547 --> 01:56:21,811
So it is you.

1620
01:56:23,017 --> 01:56:26,009
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:27,421 --> 01:56:29,048
Who are you?

1622
01:56:29,957 --> 01:56:31,982
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:33,922
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:56:34,628 --> 01:56:36,653
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:36,831 --> 01:56:38,162
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1626
01:56:38,332 --> 01:56:41,529
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:41,702 --> 01:56:43,897
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:44,538 --> 01:56:47,302
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1629
01:56:48,275 --> 01:56:51,176
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:52,646 --> 01:56:53,635
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1631
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:35,118
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1632
01:57:35,289 --> 01:57:37,257
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1633
01:57:37,424 --> 01:57:40,416
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1634
01:57:40,594 --> 01:57:43,085
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1635
01:57:43,264 --> 01:57:46,233
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1636
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,958
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1637
01:57:48,135 --> 01:57:50,535
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1638
01:57:50,704 --> 01:57:54,162
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:54,408 --> 01:57:57,866
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:58,045 --> 01:57:59,979
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:58:00,147 --> 01:58:02,775
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:05,111
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:05,286 --> 01:58:07,413
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:07,588 --> 01:58:09,818
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:10,190 --> 01:58:11,487
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:14,821
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:14,995 --> 01:58:19,523
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:22,095
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:24,997
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:25,172 --> 01:58:30,132
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:30,311 --> 01:58:33,246
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:34,281 --> 01:58:37,580
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:37,751 --> 01:58:39,844
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:40,621 --> 01:58:42,782
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:43,624 --> 01:58:46,525
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:50,464 --> 01:58:52,227
Proceed.

1657
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,155
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:16,323 --> 01:59:19,087
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:19,259 --> 01:59:22,820
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:22,997 --> 01:59:24,123
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:24,298 --> 01:59:27,392
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:27,568 --> 01:59:29,798
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:34,742 --> 01:59:36,300
All right.

1664
01:59:42,616 --> 01:59:45,813
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:45,986 --> 01:59:48,784
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:05,105 --> 02:00:08,438
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:08,609 --> 02:00:10,975
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:11,145 --> 02:00:13,807
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:14,014 --> 02:00:15,379
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1670
02:00:15,549 --> 02:00:18,211
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:18,385 --> 02:00:21,320
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:21,522 --> 02:00:23,990
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:26,319
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:26,493 --> 02:00:28,927
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:29,096 --> 02:00:32,088
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:52,453 --> 02:00:54,512
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:54,688 --> 02:00:57,282
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:21,582 --> 02:01:23,106
Load it.

1679
02:01:31,125 --> 02:01:33,423
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:34,695 --> 02:01:36,663
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:39,890
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:43,103 --> 02:01:44,900
Load.

1683
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:54,310
Go, go!

1684
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:58,308
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:02:00,387 --> 02:02:02,514
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:02:02,689 --> 02:02:06,147
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:15,169 --> 02:02:17,603
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:23,610 --> 02:02:26,170
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:29,616 --> 02:02:31,277
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:34,688 --> 02:02:36,952
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:37,124 --> 02:02:39,217
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:44,056
Get down!

1693
02:02:47,067 --> 02:02:48,625
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:07,354 --> 02:03:08,821
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:48,262 --> 02:03:52,028
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:53,433 --> 02:03:56,027
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:56,203 --> 02:03:58,398
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:59,873 --> 02:04:01,568
Grow up.

1699
02:04:02,276 --> 02:04:05,211
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:05,379 --> 02:04:06,869
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:08,815 --> 02:04:13,184
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
02:04:14,221 --> 02:04:16,655
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:18,258 --> 02:04:19,748
Frank.

1704
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:22,961
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,121
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:26,833 --> 02:04:29,358
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:29,536 --> 02:04:32,369
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:33,106 --> 02:04:35,870
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:36,777 --> 02:04:40,144
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:41,114 --> 02:04:45,448
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:07,474 --> 02:05:09,908
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:31,498 --> 02:05:33,090
<i>Frank?</i>

1713
02:05:33,266 --> 02:05:34,756
Yeah?

1714
02:05:36,503 --> 02:05:37,731
Who's this?

1715
02:05:39,639 --> 02:05:41,266
Gwen?

1716
02:05:42,409 --> 02:05:44,502
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:45,579 --> 02:05:47,376
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:50,217 --> 02:05:52,617
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:06:00,994 --> 02:06:02,621
I got him!

1720
02:06:02,796 --> 02:06:05,230
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:09,369 --> 02:06:11,860
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:14,197
No, it's...

1723
02:06:15,609 --> 02:06:17,201
For you.

1724
02:06:18,278 --> 02:06:21,338
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:24,851 --> 02:06:28,082
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:28,288 --> 02:06:30,722
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:30,891 --> 02:06:33,689
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:06:34,661 --> 02:06:36,026
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:36,196 --> 02:06:39,063
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:46,506 --> 02:06:48,167
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:48,341 --> 02:06:51,003
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:51,178 --> 02:06:52,736
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:54,281 --> 02:06:56,044
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:56,216 --> 02:06:58,116
Long time.

1735
02:06:58,285 --> 02:07:00,116
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:05,457
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:08,295 --> 02:07:11,628
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:11,798 --> 02:07:13,493
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:14,434 --> 02:07:16,800
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:18,839 --> 02:07:20,636
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:20,807 --> 02:07:23,605
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:23,777 --> 02:07:25,768
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:25,946 --> 02:07:28,847
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:29,015 --> 02:07:32,610
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:32,886 --> 02:07:35,855
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:36,022 --> 02:07:39,981
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:42,629 --> 02:07:44,927
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:45,098 --> 02:07:46,827
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:47,567 --> 02:07:50,331
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:52,939 --> 02:07:56,170
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:56,610 --> 02:07:59,306
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:59,479 --> 02:08:02,642
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:06,650
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:09,414
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:09,589 --> 02:08:12,149
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:12,325 --> 02:08:14,486
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:14,661 --> 02:08:17,061
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:18,629
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:19,232 --> 02:08:23,692
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:25,872 --> 02:08:26,896
It's my name.

1761
02:08:27,707 --> 02:08:30,073
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:30,243 --> 02:08:33,508
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,014
It's your name.

1764
02:08:38,118 --> 02:08:39,517
All right.

1765
02:08:39,686 --> 02:08:42,382
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:42,556 --> 02:08:44,786
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:44,958 --> 02:08:47,222
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:47,394 --> 02:08:51,160
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:28,325
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:59,292 --> 02:11:01,055
I know.

1771
02:11:02,595 --> 02:11:05,086
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:05,365 --> 02:11:06,957
I'm not.

1773
02:11:09,169 --> 02:11:12,434
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:12,605 --> 02:11:15,039
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:15,208 --> 02:11:16,800
For me.

1776
02:11:19,079 --> 02:11:20,671
Okay?

1777
02:11:24,284 --> 02:11:28,584
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:28,755 --> 02:11:32,714
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:32,892 --> 02:11:35,452
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:37,063 --> 02:11:38,655
Please.

1781
02:11:42,202 --> 02:11:44,602
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:44,771 --> 02:11:47,467
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:50,905
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:52,345 --> 02:11:54,506
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:55,281 --> 02:11:58,011
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:58,618 --> 02:12:00,586
You know, I have...

1787
02:12:00,754 --> 02:12:03,188
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:12:03,356 --> 02:12:05,551
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:12:05,725 --> 02:12:09,252
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:39,025 --> 02:12:40,959
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:42,328 --> 02:12:46,526
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:47,467 --> 02:12:50,698
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:59,546 --> 02:13:02,208
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:13:03,249 --> 02:13:04,716
Really?

1795
02:13:05,385 --> 02:13:06,909
Yeah.

1796
02:13:07,086 --> 02:13:10,647
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:10,824 --> 02:13:13,019
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:16,296 --> 02:13:18,161
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:18,331 --> 02:13:21,129
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:22,635 --> 02:13:24,626
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:15,188 --> 02:14:17,179
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1802
02:14:17,357 --> 02:14:21,555
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1803
02:14:21,728 --> 02:14:25,391
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1804
02:14:25,565 --> 02:14:28,398
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1805
02:14:28,568 --> 02:14:33,870
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1806
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:37,237
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1807
02:14:37,410 --> 02:14:39,776
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1808
02:14:39,946 --> 02:14:43,347
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1809
02:14:43,516 --> 02:14:47,384
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1810
02:14:51,057 --> 02:14:52,615
What?

1811
02:14:56,229 --> 02:14:57,719
What?

1812
02:15:00,033 --> 02:15:02,331
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1813
02:15:02,502 --> 02:15:06,461
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1814
02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:07,970
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1815
02:15:08,141 --> 02:15:11,736
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1816
02:15:11,911 --> 02:15:16,473
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1817
02:15:16,649 --> 02:15:19,584
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:24,757 --> 02:15:26,782
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:31,522
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:31,698 --> 02:15:33,188
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:33,366 --> 02:15:35,129
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:35,301 --> 02:15:37,292
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1823
02:15:37,971 --> 02:15:41,168
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:41,674 --> 02:15:44,268
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:44,444 --> 02:15:46,469
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:46,779 --> 02:15:50,613
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:50,783 --> 02:15:52,717
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:16:04,831 --> 02:16:06,594
Open the door.

1829
02:16:10,603 --> 02:16:14,596
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:15,775 --> 02:16:17,936
This is my job.

1831
02:16:43,202 --> 02:16:45,193
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:46,895
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:47,073 --> 02:16:50,304
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:50,476 --> 02:16:52,034
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:52,211 --> 02:16:54,236
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:54,414 --> 02:16:58,009
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:58,184 --> 02:17:01,153
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:04,812
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:04,991 --> 02:17:06,982
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:09,025
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:09,195 --> 02:17:11,595
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:11,764 --> 02:17:14,597
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:14,767 --> 02:17:16,667
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:16,836 --> 02:17:20,101
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:20,273 --> 02:17:23,401
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:23,576 --> 02:17:26,238
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:26,412 --> 02:17:28,880
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:29,048 --> 02:17:31,744
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:31,918 --> 02:17:36,378
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:36,556 --> 02:17:39,320
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:42,061 --> 02:17:44,291
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:44,464 --> 02:17:46,159
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:46,599 --> 02:17:48,499
Get up.

1854
02:17:49,669 --> 02:17:52,695
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:52,872 --> 02:17:55,397
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:55,575 --> 02:17:58,942
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:59,112 --> 02:18:02,081
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:18:02,248 --> 02:18:04,375
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:04,550 --> 02:18:06,780
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:06,953 --> 02:18:10,650
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:10,823 --> 02:18:15,487
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:17,897 --> 02:18:19,831
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:19,999 --> 02:18:22,126
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:22,301 --> 02:18:25,270
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:25,438 --> 02:18:28,407
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:28,574 --> 02:18:30,667
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:30,843 --> 02:18:33,038
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:36,349 --> 02:18:38,180
You know who I am.

1869
02:19:03,309 --> 02:19:05,174
Shut up.

1870
02:19:06,212 --> 02:19:09,238
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:09,415 --> 02:19:10,609
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:10,783 --> 02:19:13,308
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:24,463 --> 02:19:26,761
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:28,367 --> 02:19:30,528
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:32,805 --> 02:19:34,864
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:11,077 --> 02:20:13,807
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:14,046 --> 02:20:16,344
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:16,515 --> 02:20:18,210
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:18,384 --> 02:20:21,251
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:34,867 --> 02:20:36,459
Give me that.

1881
02:20:51,884 --> 02:20:55,251
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1882
02:21:03,462 --> 02:21:05,657
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1883
02:21:05,831 --> 02:21:10,359
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1884
02:21:10,536 --> 02:21:12,697
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1885
02:21:12,872 --> 02:21:15,306
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1886
02:21:15,474 --> 02:21:17,669
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1887
02:21:17,843 --> 02:21:21,006
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:24,183 --> 02:21:26,447
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:27,186 --> 02:21:31,145
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:42,134 --> 02:21:44,466
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:44,637 --> 02:21:47,538
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:47,707 --> 02:21:50,505
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:50,676 --> 02:21:53,008
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:53,179 --> 02:21:58,014
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:58,184 --> 02:21:59,776
Amen.

1896
02:22:29,215 --> 02:22:31,445
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:32,818 --> 02:22:34,809
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:35,054 --> 02:22:36,681
Fire.

1899
02:22:36,856 --> 02:22:39,347
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:40,259 --> 02:22:43,285
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:43,729 --> 02:22:47,028
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:23:00,446 --> 02:23:02,812
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:10,089 --> 02:23:11,920
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:29,642 --> 02:23:31,269
Hi, pup.

1905
02:24:02,808 --> 02:24:04,435
Okay.
