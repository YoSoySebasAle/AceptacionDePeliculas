1
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,262
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

2
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,307
You did it. You did it!

3
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:34,983
To continue, you've listened to a long and complex case, murder in the first degree.

4
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:40,113
Premeditated murder is the most serious charge tried in our criminal courts.

5
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:44,909
You've listened to the testimony, had the law interpreted as it applies in this case.

6
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:49,706
lt's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy.

7
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,044
One man is dead. Another man's life is at stake.

8
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:58,173
lf there's a reasonable doubt in your minds as to the guilt of the accused -

9
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:03,053
a reasonable doubt - then you must bring me a verdict of not guilty.

10
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:07,223
lf there's no reasonable doubt, then you must, in good conscience,

11
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:10,226
find the accused guilty.

12
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,147
However you decide, your verdict must be unanimous.

13
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:17,692
ln the event that you find the accused guilty,

14
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:21,071
the bench will not entertain a recommendation for mercy.

15
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:24,449
The death sentence is mandatory in this case.

16
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:29,079
You are faced with a grave responsibility. Thank you, gentlemen.

17
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:33,625
The alternate jurors are excused.

18
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,632
The jury will now retire.

19
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,900
- Wanna piece of gum? - No, thanks.

20
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,778
This thing isn't movin'.

21
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:13,243
- l'll give you a hand. - That's it.

22
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:21,334
You know somethin'? l called the Weather Bureau this morning.

23
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:24,462
This is gonna be the hottest day of the year.

24
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:27,215
You'd think they'd air-condition this place.

25
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:30,552
- What is your name, sir? - Oh, it's... that one. Yeah.

26
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:34,806
Thank you very much. OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

27
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,019
Now, if there's anything you want, l'll be right outside the door. Just knock.

28
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:55,410
Good morning. l never knew they locked the door.

29
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:58,496
Sure they lock the door. What'd you think?

30
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:01,708
l don't know. lt just never occurred to me.

31
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:06,504
- What's that for? - l thought we might wanna vote by ballot.

32
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:10,800
Great idea. Maybe we can get him elected senator.

33
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,477
- How'd you like it? - l don't know. lt was pretty interesting.

34
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,273
- Yeah? l almost fell asleep. - l mean, l've never been on a jury before.

35
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,942
No? l've sat on many juries.

36
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,491
Those lawyers talk and talk, even when it's an open-and-shut case like this one.

37
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:38,161
- Ever hear so much talk about nothin'? - l guess they're entitled.

38
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:41,498
They're entitled. lt's the system, but...

39
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:46,211
if you ask me, l'd slap those tough kids down before they start any trouble.

40
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:49,798
lt saves a lot of time and money. Let's get started.

41
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,592
Yeah. We've probably all got things to do here.

42
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:56,596
We can start with a five-minute break. One gentleman is in the bathroom.

43
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,765
Are... we gonna sit in order?

44
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,601
Gee, l don't know. l guess so.

45
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:08,858
- Buddy, you're in my seat. - Oh, excuse me.

46
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,027
That's all right.

47
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,031
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

48
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:22,372
What did you think of the case? l mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

49
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:26,334
No real... dead spots. You know what l mean?

50
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:31,047
We were lucky to get a murder case. l figured us for an assault or burglary.

51
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:33,842
Boy, they can be the dullest!

52
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:40,140
- Hey, is that the Woolworth Building? - That's right.

53
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:44,185
lsn't that funny? l've lived here all my life. l've never been inside it.

54
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,356
lf you had to sort out all that junk, like that thing with the movies.

55
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,443
Yeah. What about that business with the knife?

56
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:54,529
Asking grown-up people to believe that kind ofjazz.

57
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:57,407
You expect that. You know what we're dealing with.

58
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,117
Yeah, l guess so.

59
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,746
Well, your horn works. Now try your lights.

60
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:06,833
- You got a cold? - And how. Hot-weather colds can kill you.

61
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,377
l can hardly touch my nose. Know what l mean?

62
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:12,172
Sure do. l just got over one.

63
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:17,552
- Oh, come on! Mr Foreman, let's go. - The guy's still in the bathroom.

64
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:21,514
What's new? l didn't get a chance to see a paper this morning.

65
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,975
l was only wondering how the market closed.

66
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,563
- You got a seat on the exchange? - l'm a broker.

67
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:30,732
l run a messenger service.

68
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:33,151
The Beck and Call Company.

69
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,487
The name is my wife's idea.

70
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:39,115
Got 377 men workin'. Started with nothin'.

71
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,951
OK, men. Let's take our seats, huh?

72
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,794
We can all get out of here pretty quick. l have tickets to that ball game tonight.

73
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,672
Yanks and Cleveland. We've got this kid Modjelewski in there.

74
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,092
He's a real bull, this kid. You know...

75
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,512
Real jug-handled. You know?

76
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:07,143
You're a real baseball fan, aren't ya? Where do we sit here?

77
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:10,271
l thought we'd sit in order, by jury numbers.

78
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:14,067
One, two, three and so on around the table, if that's OK with you gentlemen.

79
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:17,278
- What's the difference? - lt's reasonable to sit in order.

80
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:24,035
- Let it be. - That's twelve. We go around one, two...

81
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:28,206
What was your impression of the prosecuting attorney?

82
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:31,084
- l beg pardon? - l thought he was really sharp,

83
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:35,004
the way he handled all those points one by one, in logical sequence.

84
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,009
- l was very impressed. - l think he... he did an expert job.

85
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:43,263
A lot of drive, too. You know? Real drive.

86
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:46,808
OK, fellas. Can we hold it down a minute? Fellas?

87
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,060
Say, we'd like to get started.

88
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:52,063
Gentleman at the window.

89
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:55,316
- We'd like to get started. - Oh, l'm sorry.

90
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,447
- The kid kills his father, just like that. - Listen, it happens all the time.

91
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,824
They let those kids run wild up there.

92
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:05,869
Well, maybe it serves him right. You know what l mean?

93
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,913
- ls everyone here? - The old man is inside.

94
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:11,750
- Would you knock on the door for him? - Yeah.

95
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:16,004
- Are you a Yankee fan? - No, Baltimore.

96
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,465
Baltimore?

97
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:23,261
That's like being hit in the head with a crowbar once a day.

98
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:27,098
Who have they got? Who have they got besides good groundkeepers?

99
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:30,393
- Say, we'd like to get started. - Forgive me, gentlemen.

100
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:34,189
- l didn't mean to keep you waiting. - Baltimore?

101
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:40,320
OK, if l can have your attention. You fellas can handle this thing any way you want.

102
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:43,198
l'm... you know, l'm not gonna make any rules.

103
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:49,204
We can, well, discuss it first, then vote on it. That's, of course... that's one way.

104
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,082
And, well, we can vote on it right now.

105
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,918
l think it's customary to take a preliminary vote.

106
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:58,838
Yeah, let's vote. Who knows? Maybe we can all get outta here.

107
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:06,554
OK. Then l think that you know that we have a first-degree murder charge here,

108
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:11,768
and if we vote the accused guilty, we've got to send him to the chair.

109
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,479
Um... That's mandatory.

110
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:17,565
- l think we know that. - Yeah, let's see who's where.

111
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:21,361
- OK. Anyone doesn't wanna vote? - lt's fine with me.

112
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:27,992
OK, then, just remember that this has to be twelve to nothing, either way.

113
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:31,079
That's the law. OK, are we ready?

114
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:34,708
All those voting guilty, please raise your hands.

115
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:42,006
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

116
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:45,301
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

117
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:47,887
OK, that's eleven guilty.

118
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:50,515
Those voting not guilty?

119
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:53,226
One. Right.

120
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:58,106
Eleven guilty, one not guilty. Well, now we know where we are.

121
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:01,359
Boy, oh boy! There's always one.

122
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:05,405
So, what do we do now?

123
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:08,575
- l guess we talk. - Boy, oh boy!

124
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:11,578
You really think he's innocent?

125
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:17,459
- l don't know. - You sat in court with the rest of us.

126
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:20,712
You heard what we did. The kid's a dangerous killer.

127
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:24,215
- He's 18 years old. - Well, that's old enough.

128
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,218
He stabbed his own father four inches into the chest.

129
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:29,971
They proved it a dozen different ways in court.

130
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:33,558
- Would you like me to list 'em for you? - No.

131
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:36,895
- Then what do you want? - l just want to talk.

132
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:40,148
What's there to talk about? Eleven of us think he's guilty.

133
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,525
No one had to think about it twice except you.

134
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,820
l want to ask you something. Do you believe his story?

135
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:50,200
- l don't know. Maybe l don't. - So how come you voted not guilty?

136
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,160
There were eleven votes for guilty.

137
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:57,290
lt's not easy to raise my hand and send a boy off to die without talking about it first.

138
00:12:57,415 --> 00:13:00,919
- Well, now, who says it's easy? - No one.

139
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:05,840
What? Just because l voted fast? l honestly think the guy is guilty.

140
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:08,593
Couldn't change my mind if you talked for 100 years.

141
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:11,388
l'm not trying to change your mind. lt's just that...

142
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:14,557
This is somebody's life. We can't decide in five minutes.

143
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:19,062
- Supposing we're wrong? - Supposing this building fell on my head?

144
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:22,065
- You can suppose anything. - That's right.

145
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:27,195
What's the difference how long it takes? Supposin' we take five minutes? So what?

146
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,158
Let's take an hour. The ball game doesn't start till eight o'clock.

147
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:40,375
- Who's got something to say? - l'm willing to sit for an hour.

148
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:45,797
- Great. l heard a good story last night... - That's not why we're sitting here.

149
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,051
All right, then you tell me. What are we sitting here for?

150
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,513
l don't know. Maybe no reason.

151
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:57,016
Look, this kid's been kicked around all of his life.

152
00:13:57,142 --> 00:14:00,895
You know, born in a slum, mother dead since he was nine.

153
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,398
He lived for a year and a half in an orphanage

154
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:06,443
when his father was serving a jail term for forgery.

155
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,820
That's not a very happy beginning.

156
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:12,615
He's a wild, angry kid. That's all he's ever been. And you know why?

157
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:16,536
Cos he's been hit on the head by somebody once a day, every day.

158
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:21,958
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. l think we owe him a few words, that's all.

159
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:26,755
l don't mind telling you this, mister. We don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial.

160
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,426
What do you think that trial cost? He's lucky he got it. Know what l mean?

161
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:35,805
Look, we're all grown-ups in here. We heard the facts, didn't we?

162
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:40,185
You're not gonna tell me we're supposed to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

163
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,520
l've lived among them all my life.

164
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:47,942
You can't believe a word they say. You know that. l mean, they're born liars.

165
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:51,279
- Only an ignorant man can believe that. - Now, listen...

166
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:54,240
Do you think you were born with a monopoly on the truth?

167
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:57,118
Certain things should be pointed out to this man.

168
00:14:57,202 --> 00:15:02,248
- lt's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon. - We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

169
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:06,127
Rice Pops. lt's a product l work on at the agency.

170
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:08,797
''The breakfast with the built-in bounce.''

171
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,257
- l wrote that line. - Very catchy.

172
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:15,970
- Say, do you mind? - l'm sorry. l have this habit of doodling.

173
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:19,057
- lt keeps me thinking clearly. - We have work to do.

174
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,227
There's no point staying here for ever. OK.

175
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:28,942
Perhaps if the gentleman down there who is disagreeing with us could tell us why.

176
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:33,071
Tell us what you're thinking. We might be able to show you where you're mixed up.

177
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:39,869
Maybe this is an idea. lt seems to me that it's up to us to convince this gentleman

178
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:45,583
that he's wrong and we're right. Maybe if we each took a couple of minutes just to...

179
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:49,504
- Well, it was just a quick idea. - No, no, no. That's a good one.

180
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,673
Supposing we go once around the table?

181
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,842
l guess you're first.

182
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:00,265
lt's hard to put into words.

183
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:03,435
l just think he's guilty.

184
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:07,272
l thought it was obvious from the word go. Nobody proved otherwise.

185
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:11,401
Nobody has to prove otherwise. The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

186
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:15,739
The defendant doesn't even have to open his mouth. That's in the Constitution.

187
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:20,076
Sure, l know that. What l meant was...

188
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:24,497
Well... l just think he's guilty. l mean, somebody saw him do it.

189
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:29,836
OK. Here's what l think. And l have no personal feelings about this.

190
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,964
l just wanna talk about facts.

191
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,467
Number one.

192
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:39,804
The old man lived downstairs under the room where the killing took place.

193
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:43,558
At 10 minutes after 12 on the night of the killing, he heard loud noises.

194
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:45,727
Said it sounded like a fight.

195
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:48,646
And he heard the kid yell out ''l'm gonna kill ya.''

196
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,024
A second later, he heard a body hit the floor.

197
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:55,528
Ran to the door, opened it up, saw the kid run down the stairs and out of the house.

198
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:59,574
Called the police. They found the old man with the knife in his chest.

199
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:02,911
The coroner fixed the time of death around midnight.

200
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:08,333
Now, these are facts. You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.

201
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,669
l'm just as sentimental as the next fella. l know he's only 18.

202
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:15,965
- But he's still gotta pay for what he did. - l'm with you.

203
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,886
- OK. Are you finished? - Yeah.

204
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:23,515
lt is obvious to me that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

205
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,475
He claimed he was at the movies,

206
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,521
yet he couldn't remember the names of the films he saw or who played in them.

207
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,440
- That's right. - And no one saw him at the theatre.

208
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:36,903
And the woman across the street - if her testimony don't prove it, nothing does.

209
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:41,449
- That's right. She actually saw the killing. - Fellas, please. Let's go in order.

210
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,576
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

211
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:49,499
Here's a woman who's lying in bed. She can't sleep. She's dyin' with the heat.

212
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:52,711
She looks out the window, and right across the street

213
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:56,381
she sees the kid stick the knife into his father.

214
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:59,592
The time is 12.10 on the nose. Everything fits.

215
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:02,011
She's known the kid all his life.

216
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:05,932
His window is opposite hers across the el tracks. She swore she saw him do it.

217
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,601
Through the windows of a passing el train.

218
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:12,981
This el train had no passengers on it. lt was just being moved downtown.

219
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:16,401
The lights were out, and they proved in court that at night

220
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:20,321
you can look through the windows and see what's happening on the other side.

221
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:23,575
- They proved it. - l'd like to ask you something.

222
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:26,578
You don't believe the boy. How come you believe the woman?

223
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:29,914
She's one of ''them'' too, isn't she?

224
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,961
- You're a pretty smart fella, aren't ya? - OK, gentlemen. Now, gentlemen.

225
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:39,340
- Come on, sit down. Sit down. - What's he so wise about? l'm telling ya...

226
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:42,677
Come on. Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.

227
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:47,057
- Whose turn is it next? - Oh, his. Number five.

228
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,854
May l... Can l pass?

229
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,857
Well... That's your privilege.

230
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,151
How about the next gentleman?

231
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,820
Oh. Well... l don't know.

232
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:05,575
l started to be convinced, you know, very early in the case.

233
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,870
You see, l was looking for a motive.

234
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:14,542
That's very important because if you don't have a motive, where's your case, right?

235
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:20,382
Anyway, that testimony from those people across the hall from the kid's apartment,

236
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:25,887
that was very powerful. Didn't they say something about a fight, an argument,

237
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,266
between the old man and his son around about seven o'clock that night?

238
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,686
- l could be wrong but... - lt was eight o'clock, not seven.

239
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,526
They heard an argument. Then they heard the father hit the boy twice.

240
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:43,905
Finally they saw the boy run, angry, out of the house. What does that prove?

241
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,991
lt don't prove anything. lt's just part of the picture.

242
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:50,245
You said it provided a motive. So did the prosecution.

243
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,455
That wasn't a very strong motive.

244
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:56,459
This boy has been hit so many times that violence is practically...

245
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,837
lt's a normal state of affairs with him.

246
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:03,216
l just can't see two slaps in the face provoking him into committing murder.

247
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:07,846
lt may have been two too many. Everyone has a breaking point.

248
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,433
Anything else?

249
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:14,853
- No. - OK. How about you?

250
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,900
l don't know. lt's all been said.

251
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:24,404
You can talk here for ever. lt's still the same thing.

252
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:29,701
This kid is five for 0. Well, look at his record.

253
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:34,080
When he was 10, he was in children's court: he threw a rock at a teacher.

254
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:38,251
When he was 15, he was in reform school: he stole a car.

255
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:43,131
He's been arrested for muggin'. He was picked up twice for knife fightin'.

256
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:47,969
They say he's real handy with a knife. Oh, this is a very fine boy.

257
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:52,599
Ever since he was five, his father beat him up regularly. He used his fists.

258
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:55,143
So would l. A kid like that?

259
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:58,605
lt's these kids - the way they are nowadays.

260
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:04,527
When l was a kid, l used to call my father ''sir''.

261
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:07,822
That's right. Ever hear a kid call his father that any more?

262
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:11,242
Fathers don't seem to think it's important any more.

263
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,745
- You got any kids? - Three.

264
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,873
l got one.

265
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:19,876
He's 22 years old.

266
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,053
When he was nine years old, he ran away from a fight.

267
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:34,933
l saw it. l was so embarrassed, l almost threw up.

268
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:40,480
l said ''l'm gonna make a man out of you if l have to break you in two tryin'.''

269
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:44,776
Well, l made a man out of him.

270
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,570
When he was 16, we had a fight.

271
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:51,908
Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.

272
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:57,455
l haven't seen him for two years.

273
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:01,918
Kids.

274
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:04,421
You work your heart out...

275
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:10,468
- Well, let's get goin'. - l think we're missing the point.

276
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:14,264
This boy's the product of a broken home and a filthy neighbourhood.

277
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:17,851
We can't help that. We're here to decide his innocence or guilt,

278
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,895
not to go into the reasons why he grew up the way he did.

279
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:25,525
He was born in a slum. Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

280
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:31,072
lt's no secret that children from slums are potential menaces to society. l think...

281
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:35,368
You can say that again. The kids who crawl out of these places are real trash.

282
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:40,874
- l don't want any part of them. - Listen, l... l've lived in a slum all my life.

283
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:42,751
- Wait a minute. - Please. l...

284
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:45,837
l've played in back yards that were filled with garbage.

285
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,715
- Maybe you can still smell it on me. - Listen, sonny...

286
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:51,176
Come on, now. There's nothing personal.

287
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,846
Come on, fella. He didn't mean you. Let's not be so sensitive.

288
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:57,640
This sensitivity l can understand.

289
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:02,520
OK, look. Let's stop the arguing. We're only wasting time.

290
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,106
Your turn down there. Let's go.

291
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:10,153
l didn't expect a turn. l thought you were all gonna to try to convince me.

292
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:12,447
- That was the idea. - l forgot. He's right.

293
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,867
He's the one keeping us in here. Let's hear what he's got to say.

294
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,788
Wait. We decided to do this a certain way. l think we ought to stick to it.

295
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:22,207
Oh, stop being a kid, will ya?

296
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,920
- What do you mean, a kid? - What do you think l mean? K-l-D: kid.

297
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:32,175
Just because l'm trying to keep this organised?

298
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:36,471
Here, you take on the responsibility. l'll just keep my mouth shut.

299
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:39,891
- Why are you gettin' so hot? Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down.

300
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:42,394
You want to take the chair? Take the chair.

301
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:44,854
Did you ever see such a thing?

302
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:48,274
- You think it's funny? - Forget it, fella. lt's unimportant.

303
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:50,235
Unimportant? Here, you try it.

304
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,446
Nobody wants to change. You're doing a beautiful job.

305
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:59,202
Yeah, you're doin' great. Just great, fella. You stay in there and pitch.

306
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:02,872
All right, let's hear from somebody.

307
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:07,168
Well, if you want me to tell you how l feel about it, it's all right with me.

308
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:12,215
- Boy, l don't care what you do. - All right. l don't have anything brilliant.

309
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:14,426
l only know as much as you do.

310
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:18,221
According to the testimony, the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

311
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:23,017
l sat there in court for six days listening while the evidence built up.

312
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:25,145
Everybody sounded so positive.

313
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,150
l began to get a peculiar feeling about this trial. l mean, nothing is that positive.

314
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:34,654
There are questions l'd have liked to ask. Maybe they wouldn't mean anything but...

315
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:39,576
l felt that the defence wasn't conducting a thorough enough cross-examination.

316
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,579
He let too many things go by - little things.

317
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:45,498
What little things? When they don't ask questions,

318
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:48,501
it's because they know the answers already.

319
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:53,465
lt's also possible for a lawyer to be just plain stupid, isn't it? l mean, it's possible.

320
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,676
You sound like you met my brother-in-law once.

321
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:05,018
l kept putting myself in the kid's place. l'd have asked for another lawyer, l think.

322
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:07,520
l mean, if l was on trial for my life,

323
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:12,609
l'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

324
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:16,988
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness to this killing.

325
00:25:17,072 --> 00:25:20,575
Someone else claims he heard the killing, saw the boy run out after,

326
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,911
and there was circumstantial evidence.

327
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:26,915
But those two witnesses were the entire case for the prosecution.

328
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,500
Supposing they're wrong?

329
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,920
What do you mean? What's the point of having witnesses at all?

330
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:36,383
- Could they be wrong? - Those people were under oath.

331
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:40,470
They're only people. People make mistakes. Could they be wrong?

332
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:43,640
- Well, no. l don't think so. - Do you know so?

333
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:47,143
Nobody can know a thing like that. This isn't an exact science.

334
00:25:47,268 --> 00:25:49,729
That's right, it isn't.

335
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:56,236
OK, let's get to the point.

336
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:59,447
What about the switch knife they found in the old man's chest?

337
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:02,742
Some people haven't talked yet. Shouldn't we go in order?

338
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:06,454
They'll get a chance to talk. Be quiet a second, will ya?

339
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:11,167
What about the knife this fine, upright boy admitted buying the night of the killing?

340
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:14,879
- Let's talk about it. - All right. Let's get it in here and look at it.

341
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:20,051
- l'd like to see it again. Mr Foreman? - Why do we have to see it again?

342
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:23,722
The gentleman has a right to see exhibits in evidence.

343
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:27,809
- Say, could you bring us the knife? - The knife? Sure.

344
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:32,731
The knife and the way it was bought is strong evidence, don't you think?

345
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:36,693
- l do. - Good. Let's take the facts one at a time.

346
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:40,196
One: the boy admitted leaving the house at eight o'clock at night

347
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,490
after being slapped by his father.

348
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:47,454
No, he didn't say ''slapped''. He said ''punched''. There's a difference.

349
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:50,081
After being hit several times by his father.

350
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:54,169
Two: he went directly to a local junk shop where he bought one of those...

351
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:56,629
- Switch knives. - Switchblade knives.

352
00:26:56,755 --> 00:27:01,468
This wasn't an ordinary knife. lt had a very unusual carved handle and blade.

353
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:06,097
The storekeeper said it was the only one of its kind he had ever had in stock.

354
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:11,394
Three: he met some friends of his in front of a tavern about 8.45. Am l right so far?

355
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,563
- Yes, you are. - You bet he is.

356
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:17,067
He talked with his friends for an hour, leaving them at 9.45.

357
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:19,986
During this time, they saw the switch knife.

358
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:26,951
Four: they identified the death weapon in court as that very same knife.

359
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:29,871
Five: he arrived home at about ten o'clock.

360
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:34,250
This is where the stories offered by the State and the boy diverge slightly.

361
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:36,795
He claims that he went to a movie at about 11.30,

362
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,216
returning home at 37.10 to find his father dead and himself arrested.

363
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,387
He also claims that the two detectives threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

364
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,307
What happened to the knife? He claims it fell through a hole in his pocket

365
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:53,186
on the way to the movies, sometime between 11.30 and 3.10,

366
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:56,940
and that he never saw it again. Now, there is a tale, gentlemen.

367
00:27:57,023 --> 00:28:00,276
l think it's clear the boy never went to the movies that night.

368
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:04,155
No one in the house saw him go out. No one at the theatre identified him.

369
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,534
He couldn't even remember the names of the pictures he saw.

370
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:11,246
What actually happened is this.

371
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:14,624
The boy stayed home, had another fight with his father,

372
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:18,253
stabbed him to death and left the house at 10 minutes after 12.

373
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:21,131
He even wiped the knife clean of fingerprints.

374
00:28:21,214 --> 00:28:25,593
Are you trying to tell me that this knife fell through a hole in the boy's pocket,

375
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:28,096
someone picked it up, went to the boy's house

376
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:31,141
and stabbed his father with it just to test its sharpness?

377
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,435
No, but it's possible the boy lost his knife

378
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,646
and somebody else stabbed his father with a similar knife.

379
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,190
Take a look at this knife.

380
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:42,444
lt's a very unusual knife.

381
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:46,781
l've never seen one like it. Neither had the storekeeper who sold it to the boy.

382
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:50,118
Aren't you asking us to accept an incredible coincidence?

383
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:54,998
- l'm just saying a coincidence is possible. - And l say it's not possible.

384
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:02,756
Where did that come from?

385
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,633
- lt's the same knife! - What do you think you're doin'?

386
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:09,387
- Where did you get it? - l went out walking last night.

387
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,556
Through the boy's neighbourhood.

388
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:16,978
l bought that at a pawn shop two blocks from the boy's house. lt cost six dollars.

389
00:29:17,062 --> 00:29:19,814
lt's against the law to buy or sell switchblade knives.

390
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:23,068
- That's right. l broke the law. - You pulled a real bright trick.

391
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:25,653
Now supposing you tell me what it proves.

392
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:29,032
- Maybe there are ten knives like that. - Maybe there are!

393
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:34,079
What does it mean? You found a knife like it. What's that? The discovery of the age?

394
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:38,416
You think somebody else did the stabbing with exactly the same kind of knife?

395
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,503
- The odds are a million to one. - lt's possible!

396
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:45,757
- But not very probable. - OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.

397
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,344
There's no point standing around all over the place.

398
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:53,139
lt's interesting that he'd find a knife exactly like the boy's.

399
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:57,811
- What's interesting about it? lnteresting! - l just thought it was interesting.

400
00:29:57,936 --> 00:30:00,230
Eleven of us still think he's guilty.

401
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:04,192
Right. You're not gonna change anybody's mind.

402
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:06,569
lf you wanna hang this jury, go ahead.

403
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:10,824
The kid'll be tried again and found guilty, as sure as he's born.

404
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:13,284
You're probably right.

405
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:16,204
So, what are you gonna do? We can be here all night.

406
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:19,541
lt's only one night. A boy may die.

407
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:22,419
Well, why don't we just set up house here?

408
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,796
Someone send for a pinochle deck

409
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:28,591
and we'll just sweat the whole thing out right here.

410
00:30:28,675 --> 00:30:32,512
- l don't think he oughta joke about it. - What do you want me to do about it?

411
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,682
l don't see what the knife has got to do with anything.

412
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:38,727
Somebody saw the kid stab his father. What more do we need?

413
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,646
You guys can talk the ears right off my head.

414
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,276
l got three garages going to pot. So let's get done and get outta here.

415
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,946
The knife was important to the district attorney. He spent a day...

416
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,866
He's a 15th assistant or something. What does he know?

417
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:57,245
Let's hold it down. These side arguments are only slowin' us up.

418
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,417
- Well, what about it? - You're the only one.

419
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:16,014
l have a proposition to make to all of you. l'm going to call for another vote.

420
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:18,892
l want you eleven men to...

421
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:21,352
vote by secret written ballot.

422
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:26,483
l'll abstain. lf there are eleven votes for guilty, l won't stand alone.

423
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:31,446
We'll take in a guilty verdict to the judge right now.

424
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:36,785
But if anyone votes not guilty, we'll stay here and talk it out.

425
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:43,458
- That's it. lf you want to try it, l'm ready. - All right. Let's do it the hard way.

426
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:47,420
That sounds fair. Everyone agreed? Anyone doesn't agree?

427
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:49,547
OK, pass these along.

428
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:24,457
Guilty.

429
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,919
Guilty.

430
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:31,339
Guilty.

431
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:34,634
Guilty.

432
00:32:35,885 --> 00:32:37,512
Guilty.

433
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,557
Guilty.

434
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:43,852
Guilty.

435
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,020
Guilty.

436
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:48,690
Guilty.

437
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:54,779
Not guilty.

438
00:32:54,904 --> 00:32:56,448
Guilty.

439
00:32:56,531 --> 00:33:00,702
- Boy, how do you like that? - And another chap flips his wings!

440
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:03,621
All right. Who was it? Come on, l wanna know.

441
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:07,375
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot. We all agreed on that, no?

442
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:09,919
lf the gentleman wants it to remain secret...

443
00:33:10,003 --> 00:33:15,592
Secret? What do you mean? There are no secrets in a jury room. l know who it was.

444
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:19,929
Brother, you really are somethin'. You vote guilty like the rest of us,

445
00:33:20,013 --> 00:33:23,183
then some golden-voiced preacher tears your heart out -

446
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:26,561
some underprivileged kid couldn't help becoming a murderer -

447
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:30,440
and you change your vote. lf that isn't the most sickening...

448
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:33,943
Why don't you drop a quarter in his collection box?

449
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:38,698
Oh, now just wait a... Listen, you can't talk to me like that. Who do you think you are?

450
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:41,618
Calm down, calm down. lt doesn't matter.

451
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:45,288
- He's very excitable. Sit down. - Excitable? You bet l'm excitable!

452
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:48,750
We're tryin' to put a guilty man in the chair, where he belongs.

453
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:52,504
Someone starts tellin' us fairy tales and we're listenin'!

454
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:58,093
- What made you change your vote? - He didn't change his vote. l did.

455
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:00,178
- Oh, fine. - l knew it.

456
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:04,140
- Would you like me to tell you why? - No, l wouldn't like you to tell me why.

457
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:08,353
- l'd like to anyway, if you don't mind. - Do we have to listen to this?

458
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:11,940
- The man wants to talk. - Thank you.

459
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:15,360
This gentleman has been standing alone against us.

460
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:17,696
He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.

461
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:22,701
He just isn't sure. lt's not easy to stand alone against the ridicule of others.

462
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:27,539
So he gambled for support and l gave it to him. l respect his motives.

463
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:32,293
The boy on trial is probably guilty, but... l want to hear more.

464
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:36,089
The vote is ten to two. l'm talking! You have no right to leave this room!

465
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:39,426
He can't hear you. He never will. Let's sit down.

466
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,685
- Shall we continue? - Well, l think we ought to take a break.

467
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:53,398
You know, one man's inside and l think we ought to wait for him.

468
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:58,987
Looks like we're really hung up here, huh?

469
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,533
l mean, that thing with the old man, that was pretty unexpected.

470
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:07,245
Wish l could figure out some way we could break it up.

471
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:13,668
You know, in advertising... l told you l worked in an agency?

472
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:17,630
Some pretty strange people work there. Well, not strange, really.

473
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:22,010
l guess it's just they have peculiar ways of expressing themselves.

474
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:25,096
l suppose it's the same in your business too, huh?

475
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,724
- What do you do? - l'm a watchmaker.

476
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:31,936
Really? l imagine the finest watchmakers in the world come from Europe.

477
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,023
Anyway, in an agency, when we reach a point like this...

478
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:38,943
l'm telling him, in an ad agency when a point like this is reached in a meeting,

479
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:42,113
there's always some character ready with an idea, see.

480
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:44,616
lt kills me. lt's the weirdest thing,

481
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:47,744
the way they sometimes precede their idea with a phrase.

482
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:51,539
Like, some account exec will get up and he'll say:

483
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:58,004
''OK, here's an idea. Let's... run it up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it.''

484
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,632
l mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny.

485
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:04,302
l... got a little excited back there.

486
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:07,389
l... didn't mean to get nasty.

487
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:14,062
Glad you're not one of those who lets these emotional appeals influence him.

488
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,871
l don't know what's the matter with that fan.

489
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:44,884
- Are you a salesman? - l'm an architect.

490
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:50,432
You know what the soft sell is?

491
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:55,812
Well, you've got it, believe me.

492
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:58,898
l've got a different technique.

493
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:02,902
Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks. You know?

494
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:05,989
Yeah.

495
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:10,076
Hit 'em where they live - that's my motto.

496
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,830
l made 27 grand last year sellin' marmalade.

497
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:17,542
That's not bad. l mean, you know, considerin' marmalade.

498
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:22,380
What are you gettin' out of this? Kicks?

499
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:26,801
Or did somebody bump you on the head once and you haven't gotten over it?

500
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:31,222
- Maybe. - You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

501
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:35,977
You're always blowin' your stacks over some guy that fanned.

502
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:39,898
But what are you wastin' our time for?

503
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:45,487
Why don't you donate five dollars to the cause? Maybe it'll make you feel better.

504
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:49,282
This kid is guilty, pal.

505
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:54,204
lt's as plain as the nose on your face. So why don't we stop wastin' our time here?

506
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:57,165
We're gonna all get sore throats if we keep it up.

507
00:37:57,248 --> 00:38:01,086
What difference does it make if you get it here or at the ball game?

508
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:03,546
No difference, pal.

509
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:05,715
No difference at all.

510
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:22,399
- Nice bunch of guys, huh? - They're about the same as anyone else.

511
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:24,943
Boy, what a murderous day.

512
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:29,155
- Do you think we'll be much longer? - l don't know.

513
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,909
He's guilty for sure. Not a doubt in the whole world.

514
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:36,788
We should've... We should've been done already.

515
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:40,083
Oh, l don't mind, you know.

516
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,252
Beats workin'.

517
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:53,096
- You think he's not guilty, huh? - l don't know. lt's possible.

518
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:57,267
Well, l don't know you, but l'm bettin' you've never been wronger in your life.

519
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,728
You're wastin' your time. You ought to wrap it up.

520
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:02,731
Supposing you were the one who was on trial?

521
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:06,067
Well, l'm not used to supposin'. l'm just a workin' man.

522
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:09,112
My boss does the supposin'. But...

523
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:11,239
l'll try one.

524
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:15,493
Supposin' you talk us all out of this and...

525
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:19,456
the kid really did knife his father, huh?

526
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:28,757
Are you ready?

527
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:32,260
Sorry, blue eyes.

528
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:36,097
- Well, where else? - OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.

529
00:39:36,222 --> 00:39:40,852
- Looks like we'll be here for dinner. - OK, now let's get down to business.

530
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:42,771
- Who wants to start? - l will.

531
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:45,774
- OK, go. - You, down there.

532
00:39:45,857 --> 00:39:49,903
The old man who lived downstairs says he heard the kid yell ''l'm gonna kill ya.''

533
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:52,447
A second later, he heard the body hit the floor.

534
00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:57,702
He ran to the door and saw the kid run out of the house. What's that mean to you?

535
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:01,373
l wonder how clearly he heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.

536
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:05,543
He didn't. The window was open. So was the one upstairs. lt was a hot night.

537
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:09,214
lt was another apartment. lt's not easy to identify a shouting voice.

538
00:40:09,297 --> 00:40:11,091
He identified it in court.

539
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:15,678
The lady across the street looked right in the open window and saw the stabbing.

540
00:40:15,762 --> 00:40:18,223
- lsn't that enough for you? - No, it isn't.

541
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:22,102
Boy, how do you like this guy? lt's like talkin' into a dead phone.

542
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:25,271
She said she saw it through the windows of a moving el train.

543
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:28,858
There were six cars on the train. She saw it through the last two.

544
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:32,987
She remembered insignificant details. How can you argue with that?

545
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:38,410
Has anybody here any idea how long it would take an el...

546
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:50,380
This isn't a game.

547
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:55,885
Did you see him?

548
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,264
The nerve! The absolute nerve!

549
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:03,226
- Forget it. lt's not important. - This isn't a game?

550
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:06,730
- Who does he think he is? - Forget it now.

551
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:12,110
Any idea how long it takes an el train at medium speed to pass a given point?

552
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:14,070
- What has that to do with it? - Guess.

553
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:16,531
- l wouldn't have any idea. - What do you think?

554
00:41:16,614 --> 00:41:21,327
- l don't know. Ten, twelve seconds? - A pretty good guess. Anyone else?

555
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,080
- Sounds right to me. - What's the guessing game for?

556
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:26,041
- What do you say? - Ten seconds.

557
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:29,377
- All right. What are you getting at? - This.

558
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:33,173
lt takes a six-car el train ten seconds to pass a given point.

559
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:37,719
Say the given point is the open window of the room where the killing took place.

560
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:40,805
You can reach out and almost touch the el tracks, right?

561
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:44,726
Now let me ask you this. Has anyone here ever lived near the el tracks?

562
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:49,647
l just finished painting an apartment that overlooked an el line. lt took three days.

563
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:54,110
- What was it like? Noisy? - Oh, brother! No matter. We were punchy.

564
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:56,905
l lived in an apartment near the el line once.

565
00:41:56,988 --> 00:42:00,075
When the window's open, the train noise is almost unbearable.

566
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,870
- You can hardly hear yourself think. - Will you get to the point?

567
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:09,042
l will. Now, let's take two pieces of testimony and try to put them together.

568
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:13,380
First: the old man in the apartment downstairs.

569
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:16,007
He says he heard the boy say ''l'm gonna kill you'',

570
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:18,760
and a split second later heard a body hit the floor.

571
00:42:18,843 --> 00:42:20,553
- One second later. - Right.

572
00:42:20,678 --> 00:42:23,390
Second: the woman across the street

573
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:27,519
swore positively she looked out of the window and saw the killing

574
00:42:27,602 --> 00:42:31,022
through the last two cars of a passing el train - the last two cars.

575
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:33,858
- What are you givin' us here? - Now, just a minute.

576
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:39,072
We've agreed that it takes ten seconds for a train to pass a given point.

577
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:42,367
Since the woman saw the killing through the last two cars,

578
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:47,914
we can assume that the body hit the floor just as the train went by.

579
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:52,293
Therefore, the train had been roaring by the old man's window

580
00:42:52,377 --> 00:42:55,797
a full ten seconds before the body hit the floor.

581
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,094
The old man - ''l'm gonna kill you'', body hitting the floor a second later -

582
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:05,348
would have had to hear the boy's words with the el roaring past his nose!

583
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:08,351
- lt's not possible he heard it. - Of course he heard it.

584
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:11,771
- Do you think so? - He said he yelled at the top of his voice.

585
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:15,108
He couldn't have identified the voice with the el roaring by.

586
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:18,028
lt was a matter of seconds! Nobody can be that accurate.

587
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:23,324
Testimony that could put a boy into the electric chair should be that accurate.

588
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:29,247
- l don't think he could have heard it. - Maybe he didn't, with all that el noise.

589
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:33,293
- What are you people talkin' about? - lt stands to reason he couldn't have.

590
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:37,464
- Why lie? What's he got to gain? - Attention, maybe.

591
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:42,761
You keep comin' in with bright sayings. Send 'em to a paper! They pay $3 apiece!

592
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:45,638
What are you talkin' to him like that for?

593
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:49,225
A guy who talks like that to an old man really oughta get stepped on.

594
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,353
You oughta have more respect, mister.

595
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:57,525
You say stuff like that to him again... l'm gonna lay you out.

596
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:09,871
You go ahead. You say anything you like.

597
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:14,042
Why do you think the old man might lie?

598
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:18,213
lt was just that l looked at him for a very long time.

599
00:44:18,296 --> 00:44:21,549
The seam of his jacket was split, under the shoulder.

600
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:26,012
Did you notice that? l mean, to come into court like that.

601
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:31,851
He was a very old man in a torn jacket.

602
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:35,897
And he walked very slowly to the stand.

603
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,276
He was dragging his left leg and trying to hide it,

604
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,904
because he was ashamed.

605
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:47,200
l think l know this man better than anyone here.

606
00:44:47,283 --> 00:44:50,120
This is a quiet, frightened,

607
00:44:50,203 --> 00:44:52,664
insignificant old man who...

608
00:44:52,747 --> 00:44:55,500
who has been nothing all his life.

609
00:44:55,583 --> 00:45:00,463
Who has never had recognition or his name in the newspapers.

610
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:04,801
Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.

611
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:08,638
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

612
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:14,227
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing - to mean nothing.

613
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:19,107
A man like this needs to be quoted, to be listened to.

614
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:23,361
To be quoted just once - very important to him.

615
00:45:23,445 --> 00:45:26,448
lt would be so hard for him to recede into the background.

616
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:30,660
Wait a minute. Are you tellin' us he'd lie just so he could be important once?

617
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:33,580
No. He wouldn't really lie.

618
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:37,000
But perhaps he made himself believe he heard those words

619
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,419
and recognised the boy's face.

620
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:41,921
That's the most fantastic story ever.

621
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:45,967
How can you make up a thing like that? What do you know about it?

622
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:58,271
- Does anybody want a cough drop? - l'll take one.

623
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,941
l still don't see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

624
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:06,196
There's something else l'd like to talk about for a minute. Thanks.

625
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:10,325
We've proved the old man couldn't have heard the boy say ''l'm gonna kill you.''

626
00:46:10,408 --> 00:46:14,329
- You didn't prove it at all! - Wait. Supposing he really did hear it?

627
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:18,249
This phrase, how many times have all of us used it? Probably thousands.

628
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:23,338
''l could kill you for that.'' ''Junior, do that again and l'll kill you.'' ''Rocky, kill him.''

629
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:28,676
- lt doesn't mean we'd really kill anybody. - The phrase was: ''l'm gonna kill you.''

630
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,054
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

631
00:46:31,137 --> 00:46:34,724
Don't tell me he didn't mean it. Anybody says it like that, they mean it!

632
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:36,726
Gee, l don't know.

633
00:46:36,851 --> 00:46:40,605
l was arguing with the guy l work next to at the bank a few weeks ago.

634
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:43,149
He called me an idiot, so l yelled at him.

635
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,027
This guy is trying to make you believe what isn't so!

636
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:48,154
The kid said he'd kill him and he did!

637
00:46:48,279 --> 00:46:52,909
Do you really think the boy'd shout it out so the whole neighbourhood could hear?

638
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:57,914
- He's much too bright for that. - Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob.

639
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:00,083
He don't even speak good English.

640
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:03,628
He doesn't even speak good English.

641
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:09,008
Mr Foreman, l'd like to change my vote to not guilty.

642
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:11,803
- You what? - You heard me.

643
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:15,306
- Are you sure? - Yeah, l'm sure.

644
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,101
The vote is nine to three in favour of guilty.

645
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:20,645
Well, if this isn't the livin' end!

646
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:28,403
What are you basin' it on? Stories this guy made up?

647
00:47:28,486 --> 00:47:32,574
You oughta write for one of those kooky detective magazines, make a fortune.

648
00:47:32,657 --> 00:47:36,327
For cryin' out loud, the kid's own lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.

649
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:39,914
Right from the beginning, his own lawyer knew, and you could see it.

650
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,252
Boy, oh boy, l'm telling ya. This guy here is really somethin'.

651
00:47:44,335 --> 00:47:47,672
The kid had a lawyer, didn't he? He presented his case, not you.

652
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:50,675
- How come you say so much? - Lawyers aren't infallible.

653
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:53,762
- Baltimore, please. - He was court-appointed.

654
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,097
- What's that supposed to mean? - A lot.

655
00:47:56,181 --> 00:47:59,434
He didn't want the case or he resented being appointed.

656
00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:03,980
lt's the kind of case that brings no money, no glory, not much chance of winning.

657
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:07,150
That's not a very promising situation for a young lawyer.

658
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:12,155
He'd really have to believe in his client to put up a good case. Obviously he didn't.

659
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,324
Of course he didn't.

660
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:17,535
Who the heck could?

661
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,622
Except maybe some guy's mother or somebody.

662
00:48:20,705 --> 00:48:23,625
Oh, look. Will you look at the time? Come on.

663
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:27,212
Pardon me. l have made some notes here,

664
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:30,757
and l would like, please, to say something.

665
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,635
l have been listening very carefully and...

666
00:48:33,718 --> 00:48:37,555
it seems to me that this man has some very good points to make.

667
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,310
From what was presented at the trial, the boy looks guilty, on the surface.

668
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:46,272
- But maybe if we go deeper... - Come on, will ya?

669
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,566
There is a question l would like to ask.

670
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,112
Let us assume that the boy really did commit the murder.

671
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:55,573
Now, this happened at 10 minutes after 12.

672
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,243
Now, how was he caught by the police?

673
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:02,455
He came back home... at three o'clock or so,

674
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,292
and he was captured by two detectives in the hallway of his house.

675
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:11,047
Now, my question is: if he really had killed his father,

676
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:14,551
why would he come back home three hours later?

677
00:49:14,676 --> 00:49:17,554
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

678
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:21,725
He came home for his knife. lt's not nice to leave knives in people's chests.

679
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:24,644
Yeah, especially relatives'.

680
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,355
l don't see anything funny about it.

681
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:30,608
The boy knew the knife could be identified.

682
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:35,196
- He had to get it before the police did. - lf he knew the knife could be identified,

683
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:37,949
why did he leave it there in the first place?

684
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:43,496
l think we can assume the boy ran out in a state of panic, having just killed his father.

685
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,583
He calmed down and realised he'd left his knife there.

686
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:49,586
This, then, depends on your definition of panic.

687
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:54,632
He would have had to be calm enough to wipe off any fingerprints left on the knife.

688
00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:58,553
Now, where did this panic start and where did it end?

689
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:01,473
You voted guilty. What side are you on?

690
00:50:01,556 --> 00:50:04,726
l don't believe l have to be loyal to one side or the other.

691
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:10,023
- l'm simply asking questions. - This is just off the top of my head but...

692
00:50:10,148 --> 00:50:14,361
lf l'd done the stabbing, l'd take a chance and go back for the knife.

693
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,988
l'll bet he figured nobody'd seen him running out

694
00:50:17,113 --> 00:50:19,908
and the body wouldn't be discovered till the next day.

695
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:24,204
After all, it was the middle of the night. He figured it'd be found the next day.

696
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,331
Pardon. This is my whole point.

697
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:30,418
The woman across the street testified that the moment after she saw the killing,

698
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:32,712
that is, a moment after the train went by,

699
00:50:32,837 --> 00:50:36,007
she screamed, and then went to telephone the police.

700
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:39,594
Now, the boy certainly must have heard the scream.

701
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:42,972
So he knew that somebody saw something.

702
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:45,934
l just don't think that he would have gone back.

703
00:50:46,017 --> 00:50:50,647
Two things. One: he may not have heard the scream. Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

704
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:54,067
Two: if he did, he may not have connected it with his own acts.

705
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,153
He lived in a neighbourhood where screams were commonplace.

706
00:50:57,278 --> 00:51:01,658
- There's your answer. - Maybe. Maybe the boy did kill his father.

707
00:51:01,741 --> 00:51:04,119
Didn't hear the scream, did run out in a panic,

708
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:09,124
calmed down later and came back for the knife, risking being caught by the police.

709
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:12,168
Maybe those things happened, but maybe they didn't.

710
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:16,506
There's enough doubt to wonder if he was there at all at the time of the killing.

711
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:20,009
What do you mean? Didn't the old man see him running out of the house?

712
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:21,928
He's twisting the facts.

713
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:25,640
Did or didn't the old man see the kid running out of the house at 12.10?

714
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:28,393
- Well, did or didn't he? - He says he did.

715
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:30,937
Says he did? Boy, how do you like that?

716
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,107
- Witnesses can make mistakes. - Sure, when you want them to!

717
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:36,943
- Or when he wants them to! - Keep the yelling down.

718
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:41,823
Maybe we need a little yelling. These guys keep going off every which way.

719
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:45,201
Did hear the scream, didn't hear it - what difference does it make?

720
00:51:45,326 --> 00:51:49,164
You're talking about little details and forgetting the important stuff.

721
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:51,958
- l call for another vote. - l'm talking here!

722
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,085
Another vote called for.

723
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,671
Now let's take our seats.

724
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:02,260
l never saw so much time spent on nothin'.

725
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:04,637
lt only takes a second.

726
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:08,725
OK, l guess the fastest way is to find out who's voting not guilty.

727
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:12,562
All those voting not guilty, please raise your hands.

728
00:52:12,687 --> 00:52:16,274
Still the same. One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

729
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:21,363
So now where are we? We can yakety-yak till next Tuesday. Where's it getting us?

730
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:24,449
Pardon. l vote not guilty.

731
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:30,914
What are you talkin' about? l mean, we're all goin' crazy in here or somethin'.

732
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:34,417
The kid is guilty. Why don't you listen to the facts?

733
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:37,045
Tell them, will ya? This is gettin' to be a joke.

734
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:40,507
The vote is eight to four in favour of guilty.

735
00:52:40,632 --> 00:52:44,386
What is this? Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week?

736
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:48,139
l want you to tell me why you changed your vote. Give me reasons.

737
00:52:48,223 --> 00:52:52,769
l don't have to defend my decision to you. There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

738
00:52:52,894 --> 00:52:55,855
Reasonable doubt? Nothing but words. Look at this.

739
00:52:55,939 --> 00:53:00,902
The kid you just decided isn't guilty was seen ramming this into his father!

740
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:05,907
- What about this, Mr Reasonable Doubt? - That's not the knife, remember?

741
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,537
- Oh, brilliant! - l'm tellin' you, this is the craziest.

742
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:15,625
l mean, what are we supposed to believe? You're pullin' stories out of thin air.

743
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:19,546
A guy like this, if he's sittin' ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,

744
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,423
he'd be trying to tell you that...

745
00:53:22,006 --> 00:53:24,300
Look. Now what about the old man?

746
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:28,054
Are we supposed to believe he didn't see the kid tearin' down the steps

747
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:30,140
15 seconds after the killing?

748
00:53:30,265 --> 00:53:32,892
He's just sayin' so to be important, right?

749
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,103
- What's the point of it all? - Hold it.

750
00:53:35,186 --> 00:53:37,480
The Baltimore rooter is heard from again.

751
00:53:37,564 --> 00:53:41,067
- And pop-ups are fallin' for base hits. - Hold on a second. Look.

752
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:44,696
- Did the old man say he ran to the door? - What's the difference?

753
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,908
- He got there, didn't he? - He said he ran. At least l think he did.

754
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:52,162
l don't remember, but l don't see how he could have run.

755
00:53:52,287 --> 00:53:55,874
He said he wentfrom his bedroom to the front door. lsn't that enough?

756
00:53:55,957 --> 00:53:58,418
- Where was the bedroom? - Down the hall.

757
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,254
- Don't you remember that? - No.

758
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:06,384
- l want to see a diagram of the apartment. - Why don't we have him on trial again?

759
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,803
You're the only one wants to see exhibits.

760
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:12,223
- l want to see this one, too. - l'd like to stop wastin' time.

761
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:15,560
lf we're gonna wade through that nonsense about the body...

762
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:21,107
No, but l'd like to know if an old man who drags one foot cos he had a stroke

763
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,985
can get from his bedroom to his front door in 15 seconds.

764
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:25,779
- He said 20. - He said 15.

765
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:29,574
- 20. What are you tryin' to distort? - He said 15.

766
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:32,827
How does he know how long 15 seconds is? You can't judge that.

767
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:35,455
He said 15. He was positive about it.

768
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,749
He was an old man! He was confused!

769
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:41,461
How could he be positive about anything?

770
00:54:48,093 --> 00:54:52,222
l don't see what you're going to prove. The man said he saw the boy running out.

771
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:55,558
Let's see if the details bear him out. As the body hit the floor,

772
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:59,104
he said he heard footsteps upstairs, running to the front door.

773
00:54:59,187 --> 00:55:02,357
Heard the upstairs door open, the footsteps start down.

774
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:08,238
He said he got to his own door in, at most, 15 seconds. lf the killer ran immediately...

775
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:10,865
- Maybe he didn't. - The old man said he did.

776
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,327
You oughta be at that hair-splitters' convention.

777
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,705
Why don't you stop making smart remarks?

778
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:21,376
My friend, for your three dollars a day, you have to listen to everything.

779
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:27,424
Here's the apartment. The old man's was directly beneath and exactly the same.

780
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:32,721
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom, hall, stairs.

781
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:35,056
The old man was in this bedroom here.

782
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:38,518
He says he crossed to the door, walked down the hall, opened the door

783
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:41,896
just in time to see the boy running down the stairs. Am l right?

784
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:44,315
That's the story, for the 19th time.

785
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,944
- 15 seconds after the body hit the floor. - Correct.

786
00:55:48,028 --> 00:55:50,071
Now, let's see. lt was...

787
00:55:50,196 --> 00:55:53,950
lt's 12 feet from the bed to the door. The hall is 43 feet.

788
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:57,495
He would have had to walk 12 feet, open the bedroom door,

789
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,207
walk 43 feet down and open the front door, all in 15 seconds.

790
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,334
- Could he have done it? - Sure.

791
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,463
He walks slowly. He needed help into the witness chair.

792
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:11,885
- You make it sound like a long walk. - For an old man who had a stroke, it is.

793
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,512
- What are you doin'? - l'm gonna try it.

794
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,640
What do you mean? Why didn't his lawyer bring it up?

795
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:21,853
- Maybe he just didn't think of it. - Do you think he's an idiot? lt's obvious.

796
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:24,939
- Did you think of it? - lt don't matter. He didn't bring it up

797
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:27,025
because he knew it'd hurt his case.

798
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,196
Or because it would have meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.

799
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:34,616
That doesn't sit well with a jury. Most lawyers avoid it.

800
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:37,369
- What kind of a bum is he? - That's what l'm asking.

801
00:56:37,452 --> 00:56:40,455
Pass me that chair. Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

802
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,375
l just paced off 12 feet. This is the bedroom door.

803
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,336
That's crazy. You can't re-create a thing like that.

804
00:56:46,419 --> 00:56:51,883
The hall was 43 feet. l'll pace from that wall and back again.

805
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:55,470
This is insane. What are you wasting everybody's time for?

806
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:58,848
According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds. We can spare that.

807
00:57:02,268 --> 00:57:04,312
Come on. Knock it off.

808
00:57:04,437 --> 00:57:07,357
OK. OK, OK, killer.

809
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:10,193
Yeah.

810
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:16,324
Will you stand there and mark the front door? lt was chain-locked, remember.

811
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,827
- Who's got a watch with a second hand? - l have.

812
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:23,289
Stamp your foot. That'll be the body falling. You can time me from there.

813
00:57:23,415 --> 00:57:27,460
- What are we gonna do, play charades? - What are we waiting for?

814
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,921
l wanna wait till the second hand reaches 60.

815
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,090
Aw, come on!

816
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:42,684
Come on, speed it up. He can walk twice as fast as that.

817
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:46,563
lf you want me to walk faster than that, l will.

818
00:58:02,203 --> 00:58:05,373
- Lock. Door. Stop. - Right.

819
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:07,459
What's the time?

820
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,754
Exactly... 41 seconds.

821
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:15,341
This is what l think happened. The old man heard the fight a few hours earlier.

822
00:58:15,467 --> 00:58:18,136
When he's in bed, he heard the body hit the floor,

823
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:21,723
heard the woman scream, got to his front door as fast as he could,

824
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:24,392
heard somebody running and assumed it was the boy.

825
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:27,604
- l think that's possible. - Assumed?

826
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:32,067
Brother, l've seen all kinds of dishonesty in my day,

827
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:35,111
but this little display takes the cake.

828
00:58:35,195 --> 00:58:40,075
You all come in here with your hearts bleedin' about slum kids and injustice.

829
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,496
You listen to some fairy tales. You start getting through to these old ladies.

830
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:47,457
You're not getting through to me. l've had enough.

831
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,753
What's the matter with you guys? You all know he's guilty! He's got to burn!

832
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:55,256
- He'll slip through our fingers. - Slip through our fingers?

833
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:59,260
- Are you his executioner? - l'm one of 'em.

834
00:58:59,344 --> 00:59:03,264
- Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch. - For this kid, you bet l would.

835
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:07,227
l feel sorry for you. What it must feel like to wanna pull the switch!

836
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:11,356
Ever since you walked in, you've acted like a self-appointed public avenger.

837
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:15,485
You want to see this boy die because you want it, not because of the facts.

838
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:18,113
- You're a sadist. - You...

839
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:21,950
Let me go! l'll kill him! l'll kill him!

840
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:25,286
You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?

841
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:35,505
- Anything wrong? l heard some noise. - No, everything's all right.

842
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,383
We're just... Friendly little argument.

843
00:59:38,466 --> 00:59:43,680
We're through with that diagram. You can take it if you want. Here you are.

844
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,731
What are you lookin' at?

845
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:15,920
- Somebody has to start off again. - l beg pardon...

846
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:18,923
''l beg pardon.'' What are you so polite about?

847
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:24,137
For the same reason you're not. lt's the way l was brought up.

848
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,100
This fighting... That's not why we are here, to fight.

849
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,686
We have a responsibility.

850
01:00:32,854 --> 01:00:37,233
This, l have always thought, is a remarkable thing about democracy.

851
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,652
That we are...

852
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,114
What is the word?

853
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:47,535
Notified. That we are notified by mail to come down to this place

854
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:54,959
to decide on the guilt or innocence of a man we... we have never heard of before.

855
01:00:55,043 --> 01:01:00,256
We have nothing to gain or lose by... by our verdict.

856
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,552
This is one of the reasons why we are strong.

857
01:01:04,636 --> 01:01:08,556
We should not make it a... personal thing.

858
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:15,730
lf nobody else has an idea, l might have a cutie here.

859
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:18,400
Let's throw it out and see if the cat licks it up.

860
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:20,944
- The cat licks it up? - Yeah. The boy...

861
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:30,995
Look how dark it's gettin' out there. l bet we're gonna have a storm now.

862
01:01:32,038 --> 01:01:35,291
Boy, oh boy. lt's really hot, huh?

863
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:41,256
- Pardon me, but... don't you ever sweat? - No, l don't.

864
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,885
Listen. l... l was wonderin' if...

865
01:01:47,345 --> 01:01:50,223
Maybe... maybe we should take another vote.

866
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:55,603
Great. Maybe we can follow this one up with a little dancing and refreshments!

867
01:01:55,687 --> 01:01:58,773
- Mr Foreman? - Well, that's OK with me.

868
01:01:58,898 --> 01:02:02,652
Anyone doesn't wanna vote? Hey, come on.

869
01:02:03,528 --> 01:02:06,489
- Sorry. - l think we ought to have an open ballot.

870
01:02:06,573 --> 01:02:09,826
Call out our votes, you know? Let's see who stands where.

871
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:13,455
Well, that sounds fair to me. Anyone object?

872
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,793
OK. l'll call off your jury numbers. One?

873
01:02:18,918 --> 01:02:22,172
Oh, that's me. l vote guilty. Two?

874
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,550
Not guilty.

875
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,385
Number three?

876
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,387
Guilty.

877
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,556
Number four?

878
01:02:32,807 --> 01:02:34,434
Guilty.

879
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,102
Number five?

880
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:38,229
Not guilty.

881
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,482
Number six?

882
01:02:40,565 --> 01:02:42,525
Not guilty.

883
01:02:42,609 --> 01:02:44,319
Number seven?

884
01:02:44,402 --> 01:02:46,196
Guilty.

885
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:48,156
Number eight?

886
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,283
Not guilty.

887
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:54,412
- Number nine? - Not guilty.

888
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:57,457
- Number ten? - Guilty.

889
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,293
Number eleven?

890
01:03:00,418 --> 01:03:02,212
Not guilty.

891
01:03:02,337 --> 01:03:04,381
Number twelve?

892
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:07,008
Number twelve!

893
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:09,427
Guilty.

894
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,394
The vote is now six to six.

895
01:03:17,477 --> 01:03:20,397
And we go into extra innings here, eh?

896
01:03:21,815 --> 01:03:27,028
Six to six! l'm telling you, some of you people in here must be out of your minds.

897
01:03:27,153 --> 01:03:28,738
A kid like that!

898
01:03:28,822 --> 01:03:32,242
l don't think the kind of boy he is has anything to do with it.

899
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:35,120
- Facts determine the case. - Don't give me that!

900
01:03:35,203 --> 01:03:38,373
l'm sick and tired of facts. You can twist 'em any way you like.

901
01:03:38,498 --> 01:03:41,751
That's exactly the point this gentleman has been making.

902
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:44,671
You keep shouting at the top of your lungs...

903
01:03:45,964 --> 01:03:50,093
l'd like to be a few years younger. That man gets on my...

904
01:03:53,471 --> 01:03:55,932
- My, it's hot in here. - Want a drink of water?

905
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:58,101
No, no. Thanks. Thanks.

906
01:04:07,736 --> 01:04:12,198
- lt's gonna rain. - Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

907
01:04:13,241 --> 01:04:17,787
- How come you changed your vote? - lt just seemed there was room for doubt.

908
01:04:17,871 --> 01:04:20,874
- You haven't got a leg to stand on. - l don't feel that way.

909
01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:24,169
- A lot of details never came out. - Yeah, well, good luck.

910
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:30,050
Come on. You're like everybody else. You think too much, you get mixed up.

911
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:34,137
- You know what l mean? - l don't think you have any right to...

912
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,264
Loudmouth.

913
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:32,570
Look at that come down, will ya?

914
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:37,826
You know, this reminds me of a storm we had last...

915
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:42,789
Was it November? l don't know. Something.

916
01:05:42,914 --> 01:05:46,751
lt was quite a storm we had. lt was right in the middle of a game.

917
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:51,923
We were behind - seven to six. We'd just started to move the ball, made a tackle.

918
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:56,803
lt was gonna cut right in, slash through, slashed right in, cut right through...

919
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,930
And...

920
01:05:59,472 --> 01:06:01,933
We had this kid - Slattery.

921
01:06:03,017 --> 01:06:05,478
He was an ox. A real ox.

922
01:06:06,354 --> 01:06:08,732
l wish l had another one just like him.

923
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:13,319
l forgot to tell you. l'm the assistant head coach at Andrew J McCorkle High School.

924
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,613
That's out in Queens.

925
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:20,368
And anyway... we're starting to move along real nice.

926
01:06:20,493 --> 01:06:25,206
You know, their whole line is just... just comin' apart.

927
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:28,877
And it starts to come down, cats and dogs, just like this.

928
01:06:29,002 --> 01:06:32,756
Just... whoosh! You know, right down.

929
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:36,301
Well, it was murder, you know?

930
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:41,639
l swear, l... l nearly bawled. Just... We couldn't go nowhere.

931
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:03,286
Hey, what is it with this fan here? How come...

932
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:16,049
Must have been on the same switch with the lights.

933
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:19,135
Well, things are lookin' up here, huh?

934
01:07:19,844 --> 01:07:21,888
Yeah.

935
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,186
Boy, that's better.

936
01:07:34,901 --> 01:07:37,362
Hey! Two points.

937
01:07:42,242 --> 01:07:45,078
You guys ever go to the Garden?

938
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:49,374
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

939
01:07:49,457 --> 01:07:51,501
Oh, l'm sorry. l...

940
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,713
You know?

941
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,216
Pardon me.

942
01:07:58,299 --> 01:08:03,096
Well, how do you like it? Even-steven. Pretty surprising, isn't it?

943
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:05,265
Yes.

944
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:11,563
That... business before, when that tall guy, whatshisname, was tryin' to bait me?

945
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:15,483
That doesn't prove anything. l'm a... pretty excitable person.

946
01:08:15,567 --> 01:08:19,320
Where does he come off calling me a public avenger, a sadist?

947
01:08:19,446 --> 01:08:23,116
Anyone in his right mind would blow his stack.

948
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,410
He was just tryin' to bait me.

949
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,996
He did an excellent job.

950
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:32,208
l think we're going nowhere here.

951
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:34,836
l'm ready to walk into court and declare a hung jury.

952
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:38,214
- There's no point in this thing going on. - l go for that, too.

953
01:08:38,298 --> 01:08:41,009
Let the kid take his chance with 12 other guys.

954
01:08:41,092 --> 01:08:44,345
The judge won't accept a hung jury. We haven't been here long.

955
01:08:44,429 --> 01:08:47,432
- Well, let's find out. - l am not in favour of that.

956
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:51,061
This kid wouldn't stand a chance with another jury, and you know it.

957
01:08:51,186 --> 01:08:54,105
Come on, we're hung. Nobody's gonna change his vote.

958
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:57,525
- Still no room for reasonable doubt? - No.

959
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:02,864
Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand the term ''reasonable doubt''.

960
01:09:02,947 --> 01:09:06,034
What do you mean, l don't understand?

961
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,496
How do you like this guy? l'm tellin' you, they're all alike.

962
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:12,332
They come over here and before they can take a breath,

963
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:15,126
they're telling us how to run the show.

964
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:18,296
- Boy, the arrogance of this guy! - All right.

965
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,549
Let's stop the arguing for about two minutes in here.

966
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:24,219
Now, who's got something constructive to say?

967
01:09:24,302 --> 01:09:27,722
l'd like to go over something, if you gentlemen don't mind.

968
01:09:27,806 --> 01:09:30,266
An important point for the prosecution was

969
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:35,397
the fact that after the boy claimed he was at the movies when the killing took place,

970
01:09:35,522 --> 01:09:39,609
he couldn't remember the names of the movies or who starred in them.

971
01:09:39,693 --> 01:09:43,613
- This gentleman has made that point. - That's correct.

972
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:48,201
lt's the only alibi the boy offered, and he couldn't back it up with any details.

973
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,371
ln the boy's place, do you think you could remember details

974
01:09:51,496 --> 01:09:54,999
after an upsetting experience such as being slapped by your father?

975
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:58,336
l think so, if there were any special details to remember.

976
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:01,798
The boy couldn't remember the movies because he wasn't there.

977
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:06,845
According to the police testimony, the boy was questioned in the kitchen,

978
01:10:06,928 --> 01:10:09,848
while the body of his father was lying in the bedroom.

979
01:10:09,931 --> 01:10:12,392
Do you think you could remember details?

980
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:14,602
- l do. - Under great emotional stress?

981
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:18,857
- Under great emotional stress. - He remembered them correctly in court.

982
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:22,610
Yes. His lawyer took great pains to bring that out.

983
01:10:22,694 --> 01:10:26,740
He had three months to the day of the trial in which to memorise them.

984
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:31,369
lt's not difficult for a lawyer to find out what played on a particular night.

985
01:10:31,453 --> 01:10:35,040
l'll take the testimony from right after the murder,

986
01:10:35,165 --> 01:10:39,461
when he couldn't remember a thing about the movies, great emotional stress or not.

987
01:10:39,836 --> 01:10:43,089
- l'd like to ask you a personal question. - Go ahead.

988
01:10:43,214 --> 01:10:46,384
- Where were you last night? - l was home all night.

989
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,970
- How about the night before that? - What is this?

990
01:10:49,095 --> 01:10:52,932
lt's all right. l left the office at 8.30 and went straight home and to bed.

991
01:10:53,058 --> 01:10:57,353
- And the night before that? - That was... Tuesday night.

992
01:10:57,437 --> 01:11:00,398
- The bridge tournament. l played bridge. - Monday night?

993
01:11:00,482 --> 01:11:03,902
When you get to New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.

994
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:12,118
Monday night? Monday night... my wife and l went to the movies.

995
01:11:12,243 --> 01:11:15,205
- What did you see? - The Scarlet Circle. A whodunit.

996
01:11:15,288 --> 01:11:18,166
- What was the second feature? - The...

997
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:22,712
l'll tell you in a minute. The...

998
01:11:22,796 --> 01:11:24,839
Remarkable Mrs...

999
01:11:26,257 --> 01:11:28,301
Something.

1000
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:32,097
Mrs Bainbridge. The Remarkable Mrs Bainbridge.

1001
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:35,975
l saw that. lt's called The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.

1002
01:11:36,059 --> 01:11:38,603
Yes. The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.

1003
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,272
Who was in The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge?

1004
01:11:41,356 --> 01:11:45,193
Barbara... Long, l think it was.

1005
01:11:45,276 --> 01:11:47,654
A dark, very pretty girl.

1006
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:51,908
- Ling or... Long. Something like that. - Who else?

1007
01:11:52,033 --> 01:11:54,160
l'd never heard of them before.

1008
01:11:54,285 --> 01:11:58,915
lt was a very inexpensive second feature, with unknown...

1009
01:11:58,998 --> 01:12:03,169
And you weren't under an emotional stress, were you?

1010
01:12:04,879 --> 01:12:06,923
No.

1011
01:12:07,048 --> 01:12:09,092
l wasn't.

1012
01:12:10,677 --> 01:12:13,680
- l think the point is made. - Big point.

1013
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:19,269
You can talk till your tongue is draggin' on the floor. The boy is guilty.

1014
01:12:19,352 --> 01:12:21,563
Know what l mean, my friend?

1015
01:12:21,688 --> 01:12:25,859
- You got those cough drops? - They're all gone, my friend.

1016
01:12:27,152 --> 01:12:31,197
Oh, boy. Look at that rain. There goes your ball game.

1017
01:12:31,823 --> 01:12:34,117
lt's only a shower.

1018
01:12:34,242 --> 01:12:36,953
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1019
01:12:37,037 --> 01:12:40,540
Say, could l see that knife a second, please?

1020
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:46,963
Well, we're still tied up six to six. Who's got a suggestion?

1021
01:12:47,047 --> 01:12:51,217
- lt's 5 after 6. Let's get some dinner. - Why don't we wait till 7 o'clock?

1022
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:52,135
OK with me.

1023
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,307
There's something l'd like to say. lt's been bothering me a little,

1024
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,684
and as long as we're stuck...

1025
01:12:59,768 --> 01:13:03,605
There was this whole business about the stab wound and how it was made.

1026
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:07,233
- The downward angle of it, you know? - Don't start with that again.

1027
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:11,279
- They've been over it and over it. - l know, but l don't go along with it.

1028
01:13:11,363 --> 01:13:15,450
The boy was five feet seven inches tall. His father was six two.

1029
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:17,827
That's a difference of seven inches.

1030
01:13:17,952 --> 01:13:22,248
lt's very awkward to stab down into the chest of someone over half a foot taller.

1031
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:24,793
Give me that.

1032
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:28,630
l'll give you a demonstration. Somebody get up.

1033
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,098
Watch this - l don't wanna have to do it again.

1034
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:41,059
l'll make myself about six or seven inches shorter.

1035
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:44,813
- That's about right. Maybe a little more. - OK, a little more.

1036
01:13:56,324 --> 01:13:58,785
Now... nobody's hurt.

1037
01:13:59,703 --> 01:14:02,163
- Right? - Right. Nobody hurt.

1038
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:11,131
Now, this is the way l'd stab a man who was... taller than l was.

1039
01:14:11,256 --> 01:14:13,717
Look at the angle. Down and in.

1040
01:14:13,842 --> 01:14:17,595
And this is the way it was done. Now tell me l'm wrong.

1041
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,643
- Down and in. There's no argument. - Hold on a minute.

1042
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,770
Will you give me that?

1043
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:28,565
Boy, l hate these things.

1044
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:31,860
- Did you ever see a knife fight? - No.

1045
01:14:31,943 --> 01:14:34,946
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1046
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:40,201
Well, l have. You know, on my back stoop, the lot across the street, back yard.

1047
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:42,662
Switchblades came with the neighbourhood.

1048
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:45,832
Funny l never thought of it before. l guess you try to forget.

1049
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:51,046
- How do you use a switchblade? - Well, you'd never use it like this.

1050
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:54,591
See, you'd lose too much time switching hands.

1051
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,761
Here's how. Underhand.

1052
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,600
Anyone who's ever used one wouldn't handle it any other way.

1053
01:15:03,683 --> 01:15:06,061
- Are you sure? - l'm sure.

1054
01:15:06,186 --> 01:15:10,815
- lt's why they're made to open like that. - The boy was pretty handy with a knife?

1055
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:14,027
You think he could have made the wound that killed his father?

1056
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:18,156
No. Not with the experience he got all his life handling these things.

1057
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:21,409
- l feel he'd have gone for him underhand. - How do you know?

1058
01:15:21,493 --> 01:15:25,413
- Were you there when he was killed? - No. Neither was anybody else.

1059
01:15:25,538 --> 01:15:28,792
What are you giving us this mumbo jumbo for? l don't believe it.

1060
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:32,128
l don't think you can tell what wound he might have made

1061
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:34,672
simply because he knew how to handle a knife.

1062
01:15:34,756 --> 01:15:37,842
- What do you think? - l don't know.

1063
01:15:37,967 --> 01:15:41,388
- What do you mean, you don't know? - l don't know.

1064
01:15:45,558 --> 01:15:48,436
- How about you? - l don't know about the rest of 'em,

1065
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,607
but l'm gettin' tired of this yakety-yakkin'. lt's gettin' us nowhere.

1066
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:57,570
So l guess l'll have to break it up. l'm changin' my vote to not guilty.

1067
01:15:57,654 --> 01:16:00,657
- You're what? - You heard me. l've had enough.

1068
01:16:00,782 --> 01:16:06,162
- You've had enough? That's no answer. - Listen, you just take care of yourself.

1069
01:16:06,246 --> 01:16:08,707
- You know? - He's right.

1070
01:16:09,082 --> 01:16:11,543
That's not an answer.

1071
01:16:11,626 --> 01:16:14,546
What kind of a man are you?

1072
01:16:14,629 --> 01:16:17,799
You have sat here and voted guilty with everyone else

1073
01:16:17,882 --> 01:16:22,178
because there are some baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket.

1074
01:16:22,262 --> 01:16:27,142
Now you have changed your vote because you say you're sick of all the talking?

1075
01:16:27,267 --> 01:16:31,020
- Now, listen, buddy... - Who tells you that you have the right

1076
01:16:31,146 --> 01:16:34,149
to play like this with a man's life? Don't you care...

1077
01:16:34,232 --> 01:16:37,485
Now, wait a minute. You can't talk like that to me.

1078
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:42,073
l can talk like that to you. lf you want to vote not guilty,

1079
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:46,661
do it because you are convinced he is not guilty, not because you've had enough.

1080
01:16:46,745 --> 01:16:49,539
And if you think he is guilty, then vote that way.

1081
01:16:49,622 --> 01:16:52,542
Or don't you have the guts to do what you think is right?

1082
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:55,587
- Now, listen... - Guilty or not guilty?

1083
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,257
- l told you. Not guilty. - Why?

1084
01:17:01,176 --> 01:17:05,889
- Look, l don't have to... - You do have to. Say it. Why?

1085
01:17:06,014 --> 01:17:08,308
l... l don't think he's guilty.

1086
01:17:17,817 --> 01:17:22,030
- l want another vote. - OK, that's another vote called for.

1087
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:25,116
l guess the quickest way is a show of hands. Anyone object?

1088
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:28,078
OK, all those voting not guilty, raise your hands.

1089
01:17:28,453 --> 01:17:30,580
One, two, three,

1090
01:17:30,997 --> 01:17:34,084
four, five, six, seven...

1091
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:38,797
eight.

1092
01:17:43,718 --> 01:17:45,762
Nine.

1093
01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:50,725
All those voting guilty, raise your hands.

1094
01:17:50,809 --> 01:17:53,103
One, two, three.

1095
01:17:53,186 --> 01:17:56,606
Well, the vote's nine to three in favour of acquittal.

1096
01:17:56,815 --> 01:17:58,608
l don't understand you people!

1097
01:17:58,692 --> 01:18:02,696
All these picky little points you keep bringing up, they don't mean nothing!

1098
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:04,489
You saw this kid just like l did.

1099
01:18:04,572 --> 01:18:08,076
Don't tell me you believe that phoney story about losing the knife

1100
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,203
and about being at the movies.

1101
01:18:10,328 --> 01:18:13,331
Look, you know how these people lie. lt's born in them.

1102
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:17,502
What the heck? l don't have to tell you. They don't know what the truth is!

1103
01:18:17,585 --> 01:18:21,172
And they don't need any real big reason to kill someone, either.

1104
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:26,177
No, sir. They get drunk. They're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1105
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:29,389
You know that. And bang! Someone's lying in the gutter.

1106
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:32,559
Nobody's blaming 'em. That's the way they are by nature.

1107
01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:36,146
You know what l mean? Violent. Where are you going?

1108
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:40,400
Human life don't mean as much to them as it does to us.

1109
01:18:40,483 --> 01:18:43,111
They're lushing it up and fighting all the time,

1110
01:18:43,194 --> 01:18:46,865
and if somebody gets killed, somebody gets killed! They don't care!

1111
01:18:46,948 --> 01:18:50,994
Sure, there's some good things about 'em, too. l'm the first one to say that.

1112
01:18:51,077 --> 01:18:54,664
l've known a couple who were OK, but that's the exception.

1113
01:18:54,748 --> 01:18:58,418
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings! They can do anything!

1114
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:00,545
What's going on here?

1115
01:19:01,296 --> 01:19:05,341
l'm trying to tell you. You're making a big mistake, you people.

1116
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:09,179
This kid is a liar. l know it. l know all about them.

1117
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:12,182
Listen to me. They're no good.

1118
01:19:12,307 --> 01:19:15,018
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1119
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:19,230
l mean, what's happening in here?

1120
01:19:19,356 --> 01:19:21,900
l speak my piece, and you...

1121
01:19:22,734 --> 01:19:24,778
Listen to me.

1122
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:28,031
l... We're... we're...

1123
01:19:28,156 --> 01:19:32,702
This kid on trial here. His type. Well, don't you know about them?

1124
01:19:33,578 --> 01:19:36,039
There's a... There's a danger here.

1125
01:19:37,123 --> 01:19:39,250
These people are dangerous.

1126
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:41,669
They're... wild.

1127
01:19:42,587 --> 01:19:45,048
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1128
01:19:45,673 --> 01:19:49,677
l have. Now, sit down and don't open your mouth again.

1129
01:19:53,598 --> 01:19:56,434
Some of the time... l tell you.

1130
01:20:32,846 --> 01:20:38,351
lt's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this.

1131
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:43,940
Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.

1132
01:20:44,024 --> 01:20:46,401
l don't really know what the truth is.

1133
01:20:46,484 --> 01:20:50,697
l don't suppose anybody will ever really know.

1134
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:54,534
Nine of us now seem to feel that the defendant is innocent.

1135
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:59,789
But we're just gambling on probabilities. We may be wrong.

1136
01:20:59,873 --> 01:21:05,795
We may be trying to let a guilty man go free. l don't know. Nobody really can.

1137
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,214
But we have a reasonable doubt.

1138
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:12,052
And that's something that's very valuable in our system.

1139
01:21:12,135 --> 01:21:16,765
No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure.

1140
01:21:17,891 --> 01:21:23,271
We nine can't understand how you three are still so sure.

1141
01:21:24,272 --> 01:21:26,733
- Maybe you can tell us. - l'll try.

1142
01:21:27,609 --> 01:21:31,279
You've made some excellent points, but l still believe the boy is guilty.

1143
01:21:31,363 --> 01:21:35,825
l have two reasons. One: the evidence given by the woman across the street,

1144
01:21:35,909 --> 01:21:38,745
who actually saw the murder committed.

1145
01:21:38,828 --> 01:21:41,539
That's the most important testimony.

1146
01:21:41,623 --> 01:21:44,250
And two: the fact that she described the stabbing

1147
01:21:44,334 --> 01:21:47,420
by saying she saw the boy raise his arm over his head

1148
01:21:47,545 --> 01:21:50,465
and stab down into the father's chest.

1149
01:21:50,548 --> 01:21:54,552
- She saw him do it, the wrong way. - That's absolutely right.

1150
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:57,389
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1151
01:21:57,514 --> 01:22:00,683
She said she went to bed about eleven o'clock that night.

1152
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:04,104
Her bed was next to the window, and she could look out

1153
01:22:04,187 --> 01:22:08,316
and see directly into the boy's room across the street.

1154
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,944
She tossed and turned for over an hour.

1155
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:15,198
Finally, she turned toward the window at about 10 minutes after 12,

1156
01:22:15,281 --> 01:22:20,620
and as she looked out, she saw the killing through the windows of a passing el train.

1157
01:22:20,704 --> 01:22:23,081
She said the lights went out after the killing,

1158
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:28,962
but that she got a good look at the boy in the act of stabbing his father.

1159
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:33,633
As far as l can see it, this is unshakeable testimony.

1160
01:22:33,717 --> 01:22:37,220
- Well, that's the whole case. - What do you think?

1161
01:22:41,933 --> 01:22:43,977
How about you?

1162
01:22:45,311 --> 01:22:51,568
l don't know. So much evidence to sift. This is a pretty complicated business.

1163
01:22:51,693 --> 01:22:55,613
Frankly, l don't see how you can vote for acquittal.

1164
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:59,909
- lt's not so easy to arrange the evidence. - Throw out all the other evidence!

1165
01:22:59,993 --> 01:23:03,580
The woman saw him do it! What else do you want?

1166
01:23:03,705 --> 01:23:05,832
- Well, maybe... - Let's vote on it.

1167
01:23:05,957 --> 01:23:09,794
OK, there's another vote called for. Anyone object?

1168
01:23:09,919 --> 01:23:12,130
All right. l'm changing my vote.

1169
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:15,425
- He's guilty. - Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.

1170
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:19,054
Why is this such a personal triumph for you, this one vote?

1171
01:23:19,179 --> 01:23:22,599
OK. l say we're a hung jury. l say we take it in to the judge.

1172
01:23:22,724 --> 01:23:25,643
How about it? l wanna hear arguments.

1173
01:23:25,727 --> 01:23:29,481
You, you're the leader of the cause. What about it?

1174
01:23:30,357 --> 01:23:34,110
- Let's go over it again. - We've been over it again.

1175
01:23:34,235 --> 01:23:39,032
The boy in the grey flannel suit is bouncin' back and forth like a tennis ball.

1176
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:44,579
There's no point in getting nasty. You keep trying to turn this into a contest.

1177
01:23:45,205 --> 01:23:46,289
OK.

1178
01:23:46,373 --> 01:23:49,459
Maybe we can talk about setting some kind of time limit.

1179
01:23:49,542 --> 01:23:52,462
Yeah. Once around for the deal, huh?

1180
01:23:52,545 --> 01:23:58,385
lt's... a quarter after six. Someone before mentioned seven o'clock.

1181
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:04,140
That's a point at which we might begin to discuss whether we're a hung jury or not.

1182
01:24:04,265 --> 01:24:09,145
- Don't you feel well? - l feel perfectly well, thank you.

1183
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:12,190
l was saying seven o'clock would be a reasonable time...

1184
01:24:12,273 --> 01:24:16,528
The reason l asked that was because you were rubbing your nose like...

1185
01:24:16,611 --> 01:24:19,280
Oh, l'm sorry for interrupting.

1186
01:24:19,364 --> 01:24:22,784
But you made a gesture that reminded me of something.

1187
01:24:22,867 --> 01:24:27,747
- l'm trying to settle something here. - Well, l think this is important.

1188
01:24:27,997 --> 01:24:32,377
Thank you. Now, then. l'm sure you'll pardon me for this,

1189
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:35,463
but l was wondering why you rub your nose like that.

1190
01:24:35,588 --> 01:24:36,840
Come on, will you?

1191
01:24:36,965 --> 01:24:41,428
At this point l happen to be talking to the gentleman sitting next to you.

1192
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:44,931
Now, why were you rubbing your nose like that?

1193
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:48,935
lf it's any of your business, l was rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1194
01:24:49,018 --> 01:24:53,023
Oh, l'm sorry. ls it... ls it because of your eyeglasses?

1195
01:24:53,106 --> 01:24:56,609
lt is. Now could we get on to something else?

1196
01:24:56,735 --> 01:25:01,281
Your eyeglasses made those two deep impressions on the sides of your nose.

1197
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:04,951
l hadn't noticed that before. That must be annoying.

1198
01:25:05,035 --> 01:25:07,078
lt is very annoying.

1199
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:12,625
l wouldn't know about that. l've never worn eyeglasses. 20l20.

1200
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:16,921
Listen, will you come on already with the optometrist bit?

1201
01:25:17,005 --> 01:25:20,675
The woman who testified that she saw the killing

1202
01:25:20,759 --> 01:25:24,971
had those same marks on the sides of her nose.

1203
01:25:25,055 --> 01:25:27,098
Holy smoke! He's right.

1204
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:32,896
Please. Just give me a minute... and l'll be finished.

1205
01:25:33,021 --> 01:25:35,982
l don't know if anyone else noticed that about her.

1206
01:25:36,066 --> 01:25:42,989
l didn't think of it then, but l've been going over her face... in my mind.

1207
01:25:43,073 --> 01:25:47,327
She had those same marks. She kept rubbing them in court.

1208
01:25:47,744 --> 01:25:51,164
He's right. She did do that a lot.

1209
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:55,001
This woman was about 45 years old.

1210
01:25:56,044 --> 01:26:00,048
She was making a tremendous effort to look 375.

1211
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:05,678
For her first public appearance. Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.

1212
01:26:05,762 --> 01:26:09,599
Brand-new clothes that should have been worn by a younger woman.

1213
01:26:09,682 --> 01:26:15,605
No glasses. Well, women do that. See if you can get a mental picture of her.

1214
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:19,234
What do you mean, no glasses? How do you know whether she wore glasses?

1215
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:22,696
- Just cos she was rubbin' her nose? - She had those marks. l saw 'em.

1216
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:26,157
- So? What do you think that means? - l'm sick of your yellin'...

1217
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:27,784
Come on. Forget it.

1218
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:32,414
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. l saw them too. l was the closest one to her.

1219
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:35,625
She had these things on the side of her nose.

1220
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:37,627
What point are you makin'?

1221
01:26:37,711 --> 01:26:41,297
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose. What does that mean?

1222
01:26:41,423 --> 01:26:45,969
Could those marks be made by anything other than eyeglasses?

1223
01:26:49,431 --> 01:26:51,558
No. They couldn't.

1224
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:54,102
l didn't see any marks!

1225
01:26:55,603 --> 01:26:59,733
l did. Strange, but l didn't think about it before.

1226
01:26:59,816 --> 01:27:02,027
Why didn't the lawyer say something?

1227
01:27:02,152 --> 01:27:05,113
There are twelve people in here concentrating on this case.

1228
01:27:05,196 --> 01:27:08,867
- Eleven of us didn't think of it either. - What about the district attorney?

1229
01:27:08,992 --> 01:27:12,495
You think he'd pull that? Have her testify without her glasses?

1230
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:16,875
Ever see a woman who didn't want to wear them because they spoil her looks?

1231
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:21,755
OK. She had marks on her nose. l'm givin' you that.

1232
01:27:21,838 --> 01:27:25,175
From glasses, right? She didn't wanna wear 'em out of the house

1233
01:27:25,258 --> 01:27:28,261
so people'd think she's gorgeous.

1234
01:27:28,386 --> 01:27:32,682
But when she saw this kid killin' his father, she was in the house alone.

1235
01:27:32,807 --> 01:27:34,851
That's all.

1236
01:27:35,018 --> 01:27:37,479
Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?

1237
01:27:37,562 --> 01:27:39,606
No. l don't.

1238
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,734
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1239
01:27:42,817 --> 01:27:47,364
lt's logical to assume that she wasn't wearing them in bed.

1240
01:27:47,489 --> 01:27:49,949
- How do you know? - l don't know. l'm guessing.

1241
01:27:50,033 --> 01:27:54,662
l'm also guessing that she didn't put them on when she looked out of the window.

1242
01:27:54,788 --> 01:27:57,874
She testified the killing took place just as she looked out.

1243
01:27:57,999 --> 01:28:01,002
The lights went off. She didn't have time to put them on.

1244
01:28:01,086 --> 01:28:04,923
Here's another guess. She honestly thought she saw the boy kill his father.

1245
01:28:05,048 --> 01:28:08,551
- l say she only saw a blur. - How do you know what she saw?

1246
01:28:08,635 --> 01:28:12,138
How does he know all that? How do you know what glasses she wore?

1247
01:28:12,222 --> 01:28:16,142
Maybe they were sunglasses! Maybe she was far-sighted! What do you know?

1248
01:28:16,226 --> 01:28:19,229
l only know the woman's eyesight is in question now.

1249
01:28:19,312 --> 01:28:25,318
She had to be able to identify a person 60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1250
01:28:25,443 --> 01:28:28,446
You can't send someone off to die on evidence like that.

1251
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:30,031
Aw, don't give me that.

1252
01:28:30,115 --> 01:28:33,118
- Might she not have made a mistake? - No.

1253
01:28:33,326 --> 01:28:36,329
- lt's not possible? - No, it's not possible.

1254
01:28:39,624 --> 01:28:41,668
ls it possible?

1255
01:28:42,585 --> 01:28:44,629
Not guilty.

1256
01:28:48,383 --> 01:28:51,010
Do you think he's guilty?

1257
01:28:51,094 --> 01:28:53,388
l think he's guilty.

1258
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:57,934
Do you?

1259
01:29:00,228 --> 01:29:01,730
No.

1260
01:29:01,813 --> 01:29:04,816
l'm convinced. Not guilty.

1261
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:08,862
- What's the matter with you? - l have a reasonable doubt now.

1262
01:29:08,987 --> 01:29:12,073
- lt's eleven to one. - What about all the other evidence?

1263
01:29:12,157 --> 01:29:15,744
What about all that stuff? The... The knife? The whole business?

1264
01:29:15,827 --> 01:29:19,914
Well, you said we could throw out all the other evidence.

1265
01:29:24,502 --> 01:29:26,963
Well, what do we do now?

1266
01:29:29,841 --> 01:29:31,718
You're alone.

1267
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:36,097
l don't care whether l'm alone or not. lt's my right.

1268
01:29:38,433 --> 01:29:40,393
lt's your right.

1269
01:29:49,903 --> 01:29:52,864
Well, what do you want? l say he's guilty.

1270
01:29:53,698 --> 01:29:57,911
- We want to hear your arguments. - l gave you my arguments.

1271
01:29:58,328 --> 01:30:02,082
We're not convinced. We want to hear them again.

1272
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:06,002
We have as much time as it takes.

1273
01:30:10,965 --> 01:30:17,305
Everything - every single thing that took place in that courtroom says he's guilty.

1274
01:30:17,389 --> 01:30:20,475
What do you think? l'm an idiot or somethin'?

1275
01:30:21,559 --> 01:30:27,232
Take that stuff about the old man, who lived there and heard everything!

1276
01:30:28,525 --> 01:30:32,195
Or this business about the knife. They found another one exactly like it?

1277
01:30:32,278 --> 01:30:35,782
The old man saw him! Right there, on the stairs.

1278
01:30:35,865 --> 01:30:39,452
What's the difference how many seconds it was?

1279
01:30:39,994 --> 01:30:46,251
Every single thing. The knife fallin' through a hole in his pocket.

1280
01:30:46,334 --> 01:30:50,004
You can't prove he didn't get to the door!

1281
01:30:50,088 --> 01:30:54,801
Sure, you can take all the time, hobble around the room, but you can't prove it!

1282
01:30:57,387 --> 01:31:00,390
And what about this business of the el? And the movies?

1283
01:31:00,515 --> 01:31:03,768
There's a phoney deal if l ever heard one.

1284
01:31:03,893 --> 01:31:07,897
l'll bet you $5,000 l'd remember the movies l saw.

1285
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:14,154
l'm tellin' you, everything that's gone on has been twisted and turned!

1286
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:17,949
This business with the glasses? How do you know she didn't have 'em on?

1287
01:31:18,074 --> 01:31:21,411
This woman testified in open court!

1288
01:31:22,203 --> 01:31:26,041
And what about hearin' the kid yell? Huh?

1289
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:30,336
l'm tellin' ya, l've got all the facts here.

1290
01:31:30,754 --> 01:31:32,797

Well, that's it. That's the whole case.

1292
01:31:44,684 --> 01:31:46,728
Well?

1293
01:31:48,521 --> 01:31:50,565
Say something!

1294
01:31:55,612 --> 01:31:58,948
You lousy bunch of bleedin' hearts.

1295
01:31:59,783 --> 01:32:04,996
You're not gonna intimidate me. l'm entitled to my opinion.

1296
01:32:07,582 --> 01:32:11,336
Rotten kids... You work your life out!

1297
01:32:23,223 --> 01:32:25,266
No...

01:32:28,853 --> 01:32:30,897
Not guilty.

1299
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:36,194
Not guilty.

1300
01:32:51,668 --> 01:32:53,712
We're ready now.

1301
01:34:46,658 --> 01:34:48,702
