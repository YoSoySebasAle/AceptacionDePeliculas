1
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,108
Our bosun's mate.

2
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,070
Been on quite a bender tonight.

3
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,578
The road's closed.

4
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,413
Whose pigs were they?

5
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,626
- The road's clear.
- Coming through!

6
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,472
They called that fireboat drill.

7
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:43,390
They're all from my boat.

8
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,166
Captain.

9
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,592
Merkel's crews. They moved out at dawn.

10
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,315
Okay, sailors! Let's go start a fire and
find ourselves a little French quill!

11
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,734
Just don't miss your mark!

12
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,196
Shall I tell you how to flush it out.

13
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,240
They're scared you know.

14
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,992
They comfort themselves in
women and schnapps.

15
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,829
What's going on here?

16
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,831
Ready and fire!

17
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,800
Sir!

18
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,302
My 2nd officer.

19
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,684
This is Lieutenant Werner,
war correspondent.

20
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,353
He'll ship out with us.

21
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,025
He'll report the true facts.
Life on a submarine.

22
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,696
Welcome aboard, lieutenant.

23
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,531
Good evening.

24
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,038
Hey lieutenant, come this way.

25
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,541
U-boat crews need relaxation.

26
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,668
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening.

27
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,836
Two beers please.

28
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,047
Of course captain, right away.

29
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,022
Where's our friend, Thomsen?

30
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,816
He should be toasting his Knight Cross.

31
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,115
You talk to your wife?

32
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,456
No calls to Germany before 10 o'clock.

33
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,045
Two beers.

34
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,973
My unit report back from U-96, sir.

35
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,477
All provisions onboard and fully
armed, sir. The boat is cleared for sea.

36
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,062
Thanks you lieutenant.

37
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,980
One more thing, Captain.

38
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,443
On the way here...

39
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,654
I had a very embarassing experience.

40
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,784
It was...

41
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,454
Quite outrageous!

42
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,790
They stopped me and...

43
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,875
You were initiated you mean.

44
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,254
Exactly!

45
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,589
Me too.

46
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,096
May I have your attention!

47
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,141
Now please a little silence to
be appreciated.

48
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,936
I'm very happy to call on our latest hero..

49
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,848
Captain Lietenant Thomsen!

50
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:19,022
Three big cheers!

51
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,036
That's Thomsen.

52
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,372
He's from the old guard.

53
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,392
Always drunk now.

54
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,557
My respects, Thomsen!

55
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,858
Quiet in this whorehouse, quiet!

56
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,036
To our wonderful

57
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,371
abstaining

58
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,291
and womanless führer...

59
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,004
who rose gloriously

60
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,340
from apprentice painter

61
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,510
to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

62
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,555
What? Isn't it true?

63
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,018
He's the great naval expert

64
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,730
who took it upon himself

65
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,566
in his infinte wisdom--

66
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,744
How's it go again?

67
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,417
The English bedwetter

68
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:06,421
that cigar-chomping asshole Churchill

69
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,243
where exactly to go

70
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:13,637
and stick his stinking cigars!

71
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,138
Excuse me.

72
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,309
I see you in the morning.
I must phone home.

73
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,576
Philip the old bunch is gone.

74
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,999
Got these new heroes,

75
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,544
all wind and smoke.

76
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,005
Big mouths.

77
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:36,303
Cheeks together... balls in hands

78
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,557
and the belief in our führer in their eyes.

79
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,646
They'll know in time.

80
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,049
You're a pig's ass!

81
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:41,076
Combat! Conquer or die!

82
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,886
Come on, Phillip... come on!

83
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,388
Give me hand. Help me get him up!

84
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,814
You kow I wanted to

85
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,524
really

86
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,611
screw my brains out tonight but...

87
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,197
- Come on, Philip.
- I am not in the condition to fuck.

88
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,781
That will do!

89
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,507
- That's Thomsen's boat.
- Huh?

90
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,759
Are everything righted up?

91
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,095
Yes, starboard propeller blade was bend.

92
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,850
That's explained the running
noise in at low gears.

93
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,687
They've changed it. We have got a
brand-new propeller captain.

94
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,681
That's our boat.

95
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,975
Crew at attention!

96
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:34,147
At my point vector, attention!

97
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,701
All hands present and accounted
for captain. Watches at manuever station.

98
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,036
The boat is cleared for sea.

99
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,539
Thank you, number 1.

100
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,672
At ease!

101
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,233
Well, men...

102
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,487
All set?

103
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,240
All set, sir!

104
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,745
We have a guest on board.

105
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,832
Lieutenant Werner.

106
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,918
War correspondent.

107
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,215
He has even brought his camera.

108
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,767
He's writing a story on our war heroes.

109
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,645
See you remember your manners.

110
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,774
At your stations, man.

111
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,994
Heil und Sieg! Sink them all!

112
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:22,900
Moved all these crates out of here.
This isn't a vegetable garden.

113
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,860
Fish store.

114
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,779
Where we maintain and stored the torpedoes.

115
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,741
Head's up you slobs.
You're gonna to be in the papers.

116
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,036
- Thank you, men.
- Come on, follow me.

117
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,704
Here we have the can.

118
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,706
Just one for fifty men.

119
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,042
The other's full of provisions.

120
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,004
That's where we have to think
and eat and empty it, it's logical.

121
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,256
Chief petty officer's quarter.

122
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,175
- My home away from home.
- Here comes the newspaper.

123
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,856
- Here's the board room.
- Make sure you spell my name right.

124
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:53,430
What where you put that stuff!!

125
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,392
It's really cosy here.

126
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,685
Where are you, lieutenant?

127
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,854
Coming, excuse me please.

128
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,149
- Careful!
- He's got a picture of his mother.

129
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,403
The eyes and ears of the boat

130
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:09,613
Just what we need.

131
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,323
The control room.

132
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,076
The boat's command post.

133
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,175
Come on, through here lieutenant.

134
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,462
Let me through. We've got company.

135
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,715
- Morning, herr lieutenant.
- Morning, gentlemen.

136
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,553
Sir, this is where the petty officers bunk.

137
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,263
Sleep twelve men.

138
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,891
It means two guys have to share a bunk.
One sleep while the other's on duty.

139
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,813
And so one man comes off watch, he climbs
through the other's man stink. Right?

140
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,441
This bunk just for you.

141
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,027
One to yourself,
since you're a guest onboard.

142
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,154
Take here lieutenant. This is for you.

143
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,907
And here's your escape gear,
very important.

144
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,327
It's only for show.
Come in useful in the shower.

145
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,289
The mask comes out when the diesel stink.

146
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,125
Or when Frenssen pees.

147
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,627
Okay, come along.

148
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,754
Come along!

149
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,507
This is the galley.

150
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,968
And here is Johann, our phantom.

151
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,268
Hey Johann, everything in order?

152
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,439
- Could you come up?
- Yes lieutenant!

153
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,465
Better to take photos on our
return from the mission.

154
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,467
Not when we are going out.

155
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,302
What do you mean?

156
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,474
They'll have grown beards by then.

157
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:15,364
The British will be ashamed if they
see the shaven faces of their enemy.

158
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,534
Tight face kids.

159
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,704
Innocent stride from mama skirt.

160
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,504
Sailing with them makes you feel so old.

161
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,593
It's like a "Children's Crusade."

162
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,022
- Permission to pass, sir?
- Carry on.

163
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,305
You're from Mexico, ain't you?

164
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,057
Yes, south of Mexico City.

165
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,393
Good there?

166
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,604
Yes, very nice.

167
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,732
Good climate... high altitude.

168
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,454
Quite a way.

169
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,916
It was my duty as a German to come.

170
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,254
Did you work there or what?

171
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,133
Yes, on a plantation in fact.
Belongs to my step-parents.

172
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,513
You're boss' son?

173
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,765
You could say so.

174
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,143
<i>Stand by, first watch and starboard watch.</i>

175
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,437
Excuse me.

176
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:14,983
Can I get by?

177
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,496
- Permission to go on watch, Captain!
- Hmm!

178
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,464
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.

179
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,845
He's a machine.

180
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,306
Follows order without question.

181
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:50,477
He's so uptight,
he could crack nuts with his back cheek.

182
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,193
Careful... Eggs.

183
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,907
- Permission to come up?
- Yes lieutenant.

184
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,035
Alarm!

185
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,509
All hands forward!

186
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,428
Diving position!

187
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,013
Forward, come on!

188
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,850
Come on! Move it. Come on... move it.
Hop, hop....

189
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:31,874
Come on... Move! Move...

190
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:33,898
Faster... faster. Move...

191
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,483
Keep moving. I want to see steams
coming out of you guys!

192
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,820
In case you didn't know, it's an alarm!

193
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,655
It isn't the blasted cruise, damn it!

194
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,219
Blow negative tank.

195
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,933
Plow turn east to 10 degrees.

196
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,905
Not bad... not bad.

197
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,823
Practise makes perfect.

198
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,034
Keeps you from getting rusty.

199
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,161
A practice drill.

200
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,040
Level off chief.

201
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,001
Bow up 15. Stem up 10.

202
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,004
Planes on zero.

203
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:48,095
- Level off sir.
- Shut all main vents.

204
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,100
All main vents shut.

205
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,185
Take her down.

206
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,855
Let's see how the valves
and seals hold up...

207
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,984
Bow placed on 15, stern up 10.

208
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,579
The shipyard rates about to 90 metres.

209
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,542
We could go deeper.

210
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,723
There's a limit somewhere.

211
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,736
We can only take so much pressure

212
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:41,231
before the boat's be crushed.

213
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,120
Check all valves.

214
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:06,840
- It's pressure.
- Yeah... so?

215
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,226
Deeper!

216
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,855
140 metres.

217
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,489
She must takes this depth.

218
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:31,990
150.

219
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:41,416
160 metres.

220
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,590
That will do for now.

221
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,301
- Surface.
- Surface.

222
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,470
Bow up 10. Stem up 5.

223
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:38,807
Your girl?

224
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,522
French girl?

225
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:58,493
You know the shop that sells flowers
beside the Cafe Al'Ami Pierrot?

226
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:00,996
Beside where?

227
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,998
Al'Ami Pierrot.

228
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,167
Sure...

229
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,793
The two pretty salesgirls.

230
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,505
Jeannette and... The other one's call...

231
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,965
Francoise.

232
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:18,007
There's nobody who knows but we're engaged.

233
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,517
Unofficially.

234
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,025
Can I see?

235
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,200
Very pretty. Really...

236
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:44,790
What's wrong?

237
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,171
She's pregnant.

238
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,385
Go on...

239
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,347
Did you know what that means?

240
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,517
If the Resistance ever find out

241
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,852
German baby...

242
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,188
Told her about it.

243
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,233
She wants to have it.

244
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,242
You've got problems.

245
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:13,128
Our Master's in Berlin spend all their
time finding Churchill clever new nickname.

246
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,840
What's the latest creations?

247
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,180
"Drunken Pig"

248
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,266
"Fat Boar"

249
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,937
"Paralytic."

250
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:35,692
I must say for a drunken paralytic
he's putting up a damn good fight.

251
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,237
Just see...

252
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,531
We'll cut this man shreds.

253
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,407
That is my firm belief.

254
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,829
Listen to me, smart guy...

255
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,960
He's a long way from French, Mr Churchill.

256
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,298
I'd like to know how many of
their ships are getting through us.

257
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:03,303
Right now, while we sit on our
behind's waiting for orders.

258
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,474
Our patrol planes... where are they?
Answer that one Herr Göring!

259
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,018
The British have plenty of them.

260
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:16,024
Talking big is all he's good for,
that fat slob.

261
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:24,199
Big heroes, nothing but hot air.

262
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:25,701
All of them.

263
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,877
Go on.

264
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,588
Put that one down.

265
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,230
It will make exciting reading

266
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:41,008
in your "Epic".

267
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:46,180
The propaganda ministry will love it.

268
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,901
Music we need.

269
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:55,772
Think our Hitler Youth leader
might put a record on for us.

270
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,279
That "Tipperary" song,
if you've no objection!

271
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,880
Hey, now we're the Royal Navy.

272
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,726
A simple record won't make you do that.

273
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,645
Do you remember...

274
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:54,373
Shut the door, you lazy pig!
You stupid jerk.

275
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,155
They should use him as a door stopper.

276
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,796
His rear end big enough.

277
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:05,092
Yeah, it's so big, one of these days...

278
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,929
he'll stick it in the can and
he won't be able to pull it out again.

279
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:13,433
Morning... morning.

280
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,106
This stinks.

281
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,652
Yeah... sweaty feet and hair grease.

282
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,404
Pilgrim's specialty, huh.

283
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,416
Smell just like old socks.

284
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,626
These rotten eggs...

285
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,214
Poo babies...

286
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:49,136
Maybe Pilgrim could used the
control room to hatch chicken in...

287
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:53,223
That's right. Ducks in the bilge, why not.
Sweet little ducklings.

288
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:57,352
We could fat them up with
jam from your filthy feet.

289
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,813
- You dirty pig.
- Why, what's wrong?

290
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:02,149
They'd find it good fun.

291
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,526
In the morning they'd...

292
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,778
feed on fresh toe jams.

293
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,523
"We took cleanliness," four letters?

294
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:45,400
Bath.

295
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,073
Thank you.

296
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,500
A desert animal with two humps?

297
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:05,712
Camel.

298
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:08,090
Perfect!

299
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:21,311
Intellectual starvation... I would say.

300
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,781
It's completed sir.

301
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,085
One moment.

302
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:15,365
This could work.

303
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,712
A new course, sir?

304
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,302
One minute.

305
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,059
What's the signal position sir?

306
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,028
"Convoy squared at AK 2246,

307
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:55,906
main course 60 degrees, speed

308
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,700
8 knots." U-Boat 37.

309
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:02,579
U-Boat 37, that's Marten's boat.
Moving in to attack...

310
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,840
Too far away. Never make it.

311
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,678
Goddamn it!

312
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:20,180
When do we get some orders?

313
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,023
Hey, you lazy rat!

314
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,150
Put your back into it!

315
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:35,404
Pull them out. Slap some grease on it.

316
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,573
- For your journal, huh?
- Yeah, wonderful stuff.

317
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,325
Come on guys. Let's see you moving.
The press is here.

318
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:43,245
- You there. This way a moment.
- Sure, lieutenant!

319
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,622
So nicely grease with Vaseline now so...

320
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,916
Come on, we're ready to ram it in.

321
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,877
Don't let me disturb you. Carry on working.

322
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,212
- Can I just bring you round this way?
- Yes...

323
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,550
This is good.

324
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,436
You stayed here in the foreground.
I just want the picture like that.

325
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:10,314
Good, let;s have some more...
the camera's running.

326
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,369
Who did that?

327
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,458
Who did that?

328
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,466
Tell me now.

329
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:23,387
You got any hairs up your nose?

330
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,764
Why?

331
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:28,684
I've got some up mine.

332
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:32,229
Maybe we could knit them together

333
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,407
Francoise, my love

334
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:47,536
this is my 14th letter,
but you've yet to see one.

335
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,758
20th day at sea.

336
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:06,346
Feeling foggy and overfed.
It's all so crazy.

337
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,849
Alarm!

338
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,101
All ahead full!

339
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:15,230
Flood now!

340
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,985
Just a shadow off beyond the starboard.
Straight out of the rain.

341
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,237
Take her down 30 metres.

342
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,407
Stern planes up easy, bow planes 10.

343
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,288
Anything on the starboard beam?

344
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:32,748
Propeller sounds.

345
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,636
110 degrees.

346
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:53,477
Way aft of us.

347
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,781
Contact getting fainter.

348
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,791
Fading fast, sir.

349
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,096
We'd better stay down now.

350
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,932
Steer 120.

351
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:40,190
One ship travelling fast.

352
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:43,151
No chance of getting it in this light.

353
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:08,348
"It's more than merely
superficial to take the utmost

354
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:10,745
care in dress and personal apperances.

355
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:14,016
It denotes that the...

356
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:17,019
has a corresponding effect on other people.

357
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,147
An officer should be thoroughly
unpretentious

358
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,275
in character and wardrobe

359
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:26,862
always be the case. In the old days
young officers used to....

360
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,032
when superiors were more lenient

361
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,203
for the German lieutenant
always knew..."

362
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,289
Comfortably, huh?

363
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:41,001
No mail, no telephone.

364
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,088
A well-ventilated boat.

365
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:48,008
Solid wood paneling.

366
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,181
Free food too.

367
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,892
We're in clover here.

368
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:00,521
Like horse droppings.

369
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,484
They're rolling in clover smell.

370
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,654
No need to work to make a living.

371
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,989
We are even allow to smoke.

372
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,431
U-boat special cocktail.

373
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,892
Want some?

374
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,281
Stop that!

375
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,596
Our recent truimphs.

376
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,934
"Dived to evade enemy aircraft,
lost contact.“

377
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,313
"Dived to avoid destroyer
depth charges."

378
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:36,700
The British's have stopped making mistakes.

379
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,628
Next to supply fuel to the engines!

380
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:49,338
Okay.

381
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:57,221
Let's get to the diesel room!

382
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,199
Look out!

383
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,368
- Here we go again.
- What's happening?

384
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:21,286
U-32, he has spotted the British

385
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,873
convoy somewhere in our vicinity.
We should be there in 10 hours.

386
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:33,924
<i>- Now hear this.</i>
- Shut up... listen!

387
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:38,011
<i>U-32 is operating against the convoy.
We're joining in the hunt.</i>

388
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,348
<i>Contact expected anytime after 1800 hours.
That's all!</i>

389
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,018
Soon we'll flew this beauties out.

390
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:46,728
All ready for blast-off!

391
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,567
Over 30 freighters!

392
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:55,112
Berthold has to wait till we arrived.

393
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,073
Follow the convoy and
keep in contact with us.

394
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:04,454
For me it's the best getting draft
into the U-Boat

395
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,415
and sailing ships.

396
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:09,710
Skimmimg across the sea like
a bird on the wing.

397
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:12,212
I've sailed on a 3-masted schooner.

398
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,131
Wonderful ship.

399
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,426
Lots of room. Hull big as churches.

400
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,102
That's a fine way to waste fuel.

401
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:29,938
Lunatic.

402
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,364
Damn this weather, damn it!

403
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:50,000
We could passed the British completely
without seeing them.

404
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:54,087
We should be well within range.

405
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:56,757
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

406
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,929
Why haven't we heard from HQ?

407
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:10,354
Visibility nil, sir. It's useless!

408
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,072
- Prepare to dive!
- Prepare to dive!

409
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,369
Cleared the bridge now!

410
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:08,078
Take her down 30 metres.

411
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,038
Bow planes up 10.

412
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:12,207
Stern down 5.

413
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,169
Bow planes zero.

414
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:17,171
Stern zero.

415
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:22,676
What's happening? Why are we diving?

416
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,680
- Hydrophone check.
- What?

417
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:31,852
In bad weather you're able to hear
more than see on the surface.

418
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,393
Can't you make a contact?

419
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,533
Nothing?

420
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:26,967
Contact, bearing 060. Quite faint.

421
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,026
Depth charges.

422
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:50,073
They're blasting someone.

423
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:59,875
What's the bearing from us now?

424
00:50:05,464 --> 00:50:08,509
Moving right 045 degrees.

425
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:11,845
Moving away from us.

426
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:20,354
- Surface!
- Surface!

427
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,356
Steer 330.

428
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:27,402
Note this our log book.

429
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:30,405
In spite of bad weather decided
to commence operation. Moving in now.

430
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:05,899
Damn this stinking weather!

431
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,277
How's it look?

432
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:09,903
One minute captain.

433
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,784
We're here. The enemy should be here...
running zig-zagged!

434
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:20,539
Freight on starboard bow bearing 040.

435
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:29,423
They're over there. 040... and closing!

436
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,467
Damn it!

437
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:39,766
That's no freighter.

438
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:44,855
Oh no... a destroyer.

439
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:47,316
Coming straight at us.

440
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:49,902
- Clear the bridge.
- Aye, aye captain.

441
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:57,618
Take her down!

442
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,881
 Come to periscope depth.

443
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,654
Stand by battle stations.

444
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:24,788
Make way!

445
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:29,960
Go! Go! Faster! Faster...

446
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:40,804
Keep her level, chief.

447
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,900
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

448
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:03,035
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.

449
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:07,331
Watch your depth, chief!

450
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:09,833
Bow planes up 2.

451
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,960
Stern planes down 2.

452
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:16,757
Come on...

453
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:20,427
Bow planes keep to zero.

454
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:22,346
13.5 metres.

455
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,436
Open bow caps now.

456
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,203
Enemy speed: 10.

457
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:49,039
Our left. Bow angle: 030.

458
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,667
Range: 6,000.

459
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,794
Depth: 2 metres.

460
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:59,800
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread shots from tubes 1 and 3.

461
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:01,802
Angleof spread: 3 degrees.

462
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,642
Tubes 1 to 4 ready to fire.

463
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:34,877
Damn it.

464
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:56,398
Close bow caps! Takes her deeper, chief.
Takes her deeper!

465
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:06,116
Depth charges dropped!

466
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:23,217
Get some fuses, quick!

467
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:26,637
Check all high valves enclosures.

468
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,281
Control room secured.

469
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,117
All clear forward.

470
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,290
No serious damages.

471
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:03,924
They must have spotted our periscope.

472
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,264
Seems incredible in this sea.

473
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,294
Is it getting louder?

474
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:44,798
The same constant. Ahead of us.

475
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:16,914
It's pulling further ahead.
295 degrees.

476
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:19,124
- Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder.

477
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,214
That's left full sir!

478
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:27,382
Steer due north.

479
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:29,551
Deeper chief!

480
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,429
Bow down planes 15. Stem up 10.

481
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:34,598
Pump 200 liters forward.

482
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,904
All ahead one-third.

483
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:57,788
Now it all turns psychological,
gentlemen.

484
00:59:39,037 --> 00:59:41,373
Check torpedo tubes!

485
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:00,684
Stay calm, men.

486
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:02,853
That ain't nothing yet.

487
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:16,867
Kill the lights.

488
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,335
Silent run.

489
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,421
Both engines 50 r.p.m.

490
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:49,733
Contact closing.

491
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:52,694
Ahead, 52 degrees.

492
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,113
Approaching fast.

493
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:56,532
Midships.

494
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,535
All full ahead. Right full rudder.

495
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:26,061
Heading straight for us!

496
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:40,033
Those aren't amateurs
up there. Deeper!

497
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:41,201
Bow down 20.

498
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,328
Stern up 5.

499
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:20,240
Destroyer approaching.
Getting louder.

500
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,534
Deeper, quickly.

501
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:43,430
Don't be afraid.

502
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:45,807
It's only the pressure.

503
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,776
Deeper!

504
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,528
Stern up 15.

505
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:33,856
Tighten that flange!

506
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:38,443
Bring her up! Up 150 metres!

507
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:40,362
Chief... forward 20!

508
01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:45,492
Come on Frentzen, quickly!

509
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:49,496
Come on... tighter Frentzen, hurry!

510
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:14,104
Depth gauge hull valves secured.

511
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:15,856
Both planes eased to zero.

512
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:23,071
Level at 150 metres.

513
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,669
Becoming louder.

514
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:38,837
She's turned around.

515
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,227
Go on, get it over.

516
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:13,121
They're above us.

517
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:18,210
Just above us.

518
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,322
Contact fading to starboard.

519
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,377
Twenty-two.

520
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:10,387
Twenty-three.

521
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:12,806
They're far away.

522
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,066
Contact receding aft.

523
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:33,452
Can barely hear it.

524
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,727
It has passed us by.

525
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,200
I think that will be all this time.

526
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,165
Hunt speed!

527
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:23,585
Both main engines silent speed, 50 r.p.m.

528
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:59,288
From my private collection.

529
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:15,846
How does it look in the engine room?

530
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:17,848
Smashed up quite badly.

531
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:21,185
- Be able to patch it up at sea?
- Already started.

532
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:24,897
Be sure to make it good, chief.

533
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:28,066
I've got a feeling we're going
to see some action.

534
01:09:00,224 --> 01:09:02,351
Waited over an hour now.

535
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:05,979
I guess we've shaken them off, sir.

536
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:08,148
Don't be so sure.

537
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:12,694
It could have stopped,
they're still there waiting.

538
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:16,532
To surprise us when we try to surface.

539
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:21,787
Not dumb the British.

540
01:09:21,954 --> 01:09:25,020
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark we will surface.

541
01:09:25,024 --> 01:09:28,168
- Okay. Show us...
- See better in the dark.

542
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:15,007
Coming up fast.

543
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:18,719
- Sound check at 30.
- Planes on zero.

544
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,265
Level at 30 metres.

545
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,993
Periscope depth.

546
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,459
Tower free.

547
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:53,086
Stern down 5.

548
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,255
Come up!

549
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:57,424
Stern up 3.

550
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:00,135
Zero.

551
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:17,194
Surface.

552
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:18,654
All set to blow.

553
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,178
What a cutie pie.

554
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:45,806
If only your Mama could see you now.

555
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,170
Cut it out! All this damn noise!

556
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:25,846
I've got bad news, men.

557
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:28,557
What's up now?

558
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:33,020
Our team is losing.

559
01:12:36,732 --> 01:12:38,567
5-0.

560
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:45,282
Not a chance of making the final's now.

561
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,244
It can't be! I just don't believe it!

562
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,547
Drop them.

563
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,826
You dirty little boy.

564
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:27,616
Crabs.

565
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:30,577
A whole army of them.

566
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:34,414
A winky like yours,
they'll eat it down to the bones.

567
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:41,964
Yeah, give them a blow with the gun powder!

568
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:49,680
Excuse me, lieutenant.

569
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,790
Need a shave is what this meat does.

570
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:25,257
What's of those thing crawling
about in your eyebrows?

571
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:28,927
Pardon?

572
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:32,139
A case for the medical, I say.

573
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:34,266
Crabs by the look of them.

574
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,318
Are you joking?

575
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:48,030
When the creatures begin to surface,
it's the fifth stage.

576
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,510
Bosun!

577
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:11,220
Yes lieutenant?

578
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:12,763
Do you know where the medic is?

579
01:15:12,971 --> 01:15:15,474
Yeah, in the bow compartment lieutenant.

580
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,524
This crabsgot you too!

581
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:46,755
Calm down...

582
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:50,217
What?

583
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:52,302
Take it easy... calm down!

584
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:56,390
You have gone crazy or something?

585
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:04,690
Hey... guess what? You heard the latest?

586
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:06,233
Our Dufte tying the knot.

587
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:09,611
Who the hell is this stupid bitch!

588
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,071
You're so mean...

589
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:13,323
I think half the fleet have tried her.

590
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:17,661
They should stick you in a zoo,
mate you and a chimpanzee like you.

591
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:21,540
Pictures of the beautiful fräulein!

592
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:22,875
Don't dirty them...

593
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:30,007
Don't tell me this 2nd hand matches that...

594
01:16:30,215 --> 01:16:31,800
Did you sleep with her?

595
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,842
This boat are built to take it.

596
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:19,306
A real storm on a sailing ship,
you should try that sometime.

597
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:22,809
You don't feel a thing down here.

598
01:17:34,947 --> 01:17:36,281
Compass.

599
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:50,462
The boat's heaving to starboard.

600
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,673
I can't keep her on course.

601
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:55,759
No cause for concern.

602
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:02,599
It's pointless sir.

603
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:05,686
We're burning up fuel for nothing.

604
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:15,821
Prepare to dive.

605
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,448
Diving stations!

606
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:20,701
Standby all main vents.

607
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,703
All main vents clear.

608
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:24,890
Nothing exciting out there, huh?

609
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:31,855
Just reports... very faint.

610
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:35,567
SOS calls from enemy frieghters.

611
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:43,116
If one of the rudder breaks
in one of those...

612
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:49,831
there's nothing to do but pray.

613
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,673
The sea can't sink us, you know.

614
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:02,386
No ship as safe as our U-Boat's.

615
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:18,902
Put the record on.

616
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:22,781
You know the one.

617
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:38,065
Watch out!

618
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:59,336
Man overboard!

619
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:25,445
Hold on!

620
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:46,884
Let's move! Hold onto him!
Hurry will you.

621
01:22:49,434 --> 01:22:50,636
Lay him out flat!

622
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:00,147
First aid kits! Bring now...

623
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:01,899
First aid kit! Damn it!

624
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:06,069
Prepare to dive!

625
01:23:14,745 --> 01:23:18,999
"A military leader leads
through self-discipline.

626
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:22,878
Without his example,
education is impossible."

627
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:26,507
Three ribs cracked and a gash on the head.

628
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:29,301
He was lucky.

629
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:34,723
What a rotten month.

630
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:39,603
Absolutely rotten.

631
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:42,523
Mildew is good for you.

632
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,904
It's the next best thing

633
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:52,115
to fresh grown lettuce.

634
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:59,456
Anything that grows on this boat,
we've got to be grateful for.

635
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,843
Must be snowing already back home.

636
01:24:18,684 --> 01:24:20,185
Very funny.

637
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:26,275
It's been years since I have seen snow.

638
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:30,904
Can I look?

639
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:32,406
Sure!

640
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,088
Your wife?

641
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:58,617
There, in front... there!

642
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:07,042
Captain, U-boat, port ahead!

643
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:11,672
It's one of our, it's a German U-boat!

644
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:18,595
Sir, a German U-Boat over there.

645
01:26:26,436 --> 01:26:28,146
You're right!

646
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:34,275
- Both engines stop.
- Bring out the lights.!

647
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:08,353
Look, it's Thomsen!

648
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:12,065
All back...

649
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:33,712
Good hunting, you rascal!

650
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:45,015
My god, Phillip.

651
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:48,519
So they pushed you out to sea again.

652
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:58,779
Goddamn it! How can this happen?

653
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:05,285
Dozen boats we've got in the Atlantic.

654
01:28:05,494 --> 01:28:08,997
From Greenland to the Azores,
a mere dozen!

655
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,877
But still we... we almost collide
with one of our own.

656
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:18,090
Sixty metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.

657
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:25,305
Something's wrong here.

658
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,686
Check on our position's?

659
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:33,063
More or less, captain.

660
01:28:33,272 --> 01:28:35,941
More or less... more or less,
that's not good enough!

661
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,528
We haven't had a sun shot in fourteen days.

662
01:28:39,736 --> 01:28:42,197
And we've been drifting in this storm.

663
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,325
Hard to compute.

664
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,794
For certain!

665
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,715
We make a few errors in our own position,

666
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:01,633
the others do the same...

667
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:06,138
And we end playing collision games,
leaving the route wide open.

668
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:10,309
So we allowed the British to shove
the whole armada through.

669
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:22,613
It's another story in the middle
of the ocean, lieutenant.

670
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:26,491
I hope you're making notes of all these.

671
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,411
Maybe headquarters will listen to you.

672
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:31,914
You've more influence than I have sir.

673
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:37,794
You believe that?

674
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:07,449
What's up?

675
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:09,117
A convoy.

676
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:26,552
- Permission to come up?
- Affirmative.

677
01:31:16,185 --> 01:31:21,023
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.

678
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:23,233
Very juicy.

679
01:31:26,904 --> 01:31:29,531
Any escort in sight?

680
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,782
Destroyers?

681
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:34,328
Nope, nothing.

682
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:36,622
No protection. Nothing.

683
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:43,629
That's funny.

684
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:49,259
They could be off chasing one of our's.

685
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:00,354
That damn moon.

686
01:32:04,816 --> 01:32:07,819
- How many of ours boat on contact?
- Five.

687
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:13,909
Do we risk it?

688
01:32:17,454 --> 01:32:19,373
It's worth a try, captain.

689
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:25,170
Come left to 180.

690
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:26,588
Left to 5 degrees rudder.

691
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:29,550
New course 180.

692
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:38,141
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?

693
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:44,523
It will work, captain. We've got them.

694
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:59,663
Prepared tubes 1 to 4, for surface firing.

695
01:32:59,872 --> 01:33:01,540
Flood tubes 1 to 4.

696
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:03,166
I'm going in.

697
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:05,335
Mast to sight to bridge.

698
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:29,818
All ahead full,
left full rudder come to 107.

699
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:31,153
Standby to attack!

700
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:37,829
Watch the pressure of the lubricating oil!

701
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:43,749
Bow angle, bearing 050.

702
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:45,375
Lock on!

703
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:47,878
Range: 2200 metres.

704
01:33:49,421 --> 01:33:51,590
Those two that are overlapping.

705
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:55,552
Double shot on the big one,
the other two a single each.

706
01:33:56,512 --> 01:33:57,513
Target identified.

707
01:33:57,721 --> 01:34:01,016
Right standard rudder. All ahead one-third.

708
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:03,018
Open bow hatches.

709
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:08,148
Lock on tubes 1 and 2. New bow angle 063.

710
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:09,983
Check... locked on!

711
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:11,985
Follow fore-bearing.

712
01:34:13,278 --> 01:34:14,279
All set!

713
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:16,406
Tubes 1 and 2...

714
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:18,575
- fire when match.
- Tubes 1 and 2.

715
01:34:21,328 --> 01:34:23,705
Tube 1, fire!

716
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:27,334
- Tube 2.
- Fire!

717
01:34:31,213 --> 01:34:32,714
Tube 3, fire when match.

718
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:38,554
- Fire!
- Tube 3... fire.

719
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:43,559
Tube 4 ready.

720
01:34:45,644 --> 01:34:47,396
Fire!

721
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:49,690
Destroyer ahead!

722
01:34:51,692 --> 01:34:52,901
They're firing!

723
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:55,904
Alarm!

724
01:35:29,771 --> 01:35:31,773
Bow head up 10, stern up 5.

725
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:39,156
Keep quiet you men!

726
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,701
Down 80 metres.

727
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:44,828
Easy...

728
01:35:45,287 --> 01:35:48,999
Bow down 15, stern up 10.

729
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:54,880
What about the torpedoes?

730
01:35:55,589 --> 01:35:57,382
Any minute now.

731
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:05,349
Not long to go now.

732
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:08,977
Hundred ten.

733
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:18,737
Hundred twenty.

734
01:36:19,446 --> 01:36:22,908
Those lousy torpedoes. They don't run true.

735
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,911
What a crazy thing to do.

736
01:36:26,203 --> 01:36:27,829
Charging in like that.

737
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:30,165
The destroyer won't let us off the hook.

738
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:34,837
Try to hunt us down, you'll see.

739
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:44,638
It hit the first.

740
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:49,810
We hit her! We hit her!

741
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:52,229
Psst... Quiet!

742
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:17,588
Time's up for third torpedo.

743
01:37:24,887 --> 01:37:25,888
Number three.

744
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:43,906
Now they're going to the bottom.

745
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:01,840
It's the bulkheads. They've collasped!

746
01:38:19,525 --> 01:38:21,568
This is it!

747
01:38:26,865 --> 01:38:28,909
Now we have to pay off.

748
01:38:39,211 --> 01:38:41,338
Destroyer bearing 044.

749
01:38:41,547 --> 01:38:42,756
Our direction?

750
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:44,675
Moving left.

751
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:46,844
Fading, sir.

752
01:39:00,774 --> 01:39:04,278
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

753
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:13,829
Astern of us.

754
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:19,209
Way astern of us.

755
01:39:24,047 --> 01:39:26,425
They're spitting in the wrong direction.

756
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:37,644
We haven't thrown them off yet.

757
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:42,107
I reckon they won't be too happy.

758
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:45,569
Propeller noises.

759
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:49,031
Contact bearing 270... closing.

760
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,701
Both engines ahead one-third.

761
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,174
Now you'll see.

762
01:40:34,952 --> 01:40:36,245
All ahead full!

763
01:40:36,453 --> 01:40:37,871
Dump 150 liters!

764
01:41:43,312 --> 01:41:44,938
Asdic.

765
01:41:46,231 --> 01:41:49,526
Detector system - Ultrasonic.

766
01:41:54,573 --> 01:41:59,328
Swine. Filthy rotten swine.

767
01:42:11,798 --> 01:42:12,799
What's the damage?

768
01:42:13,008 --> 01:42:14,843
Air shaft fractured.

769
01:42:21,517 --> 01:42:25,687
Quiet boys. Keep it quiet.

770
01:43:17,656 --> 01:43:18,615
Hold dead slow.

771
01:43:18,824 --> 01:43:21,910
Fifty r.p.m. Kill the fans.

772
01:43:23,787 --> 01:43:24,913
Left 15 degrees.

773
01:43:45,809 --> 01:43:46,768
All ahead full!

774
01:43:56,778 --> 01:43:58,614
Shut it off!

775
01:44:14,129 --> 01:44:18,091
Shut the number two auxiliary!

776
01:44:54,044 --> 01:44:56,296
Connect ventilation cartridges.

777
01:44:56,547 --> 01:44:59,883
Switch on fans,
connect the emergency cartridges.

778
01:45:28,745 --> 01:45:30,581
Yeah...

779
01:45:32,165 --> 01:45:34,835
She doesn't want to let go of us.

780
01:45:42,217 --> 01:45:44,011
What's going on?

781
01:45:45,721 --> 01:45:47,431
Running away?

782
01:46:01,653 --> 01:46:03,906
We've really smashed them.

783
01:46:06,825 --> 01:46:10,078
These bulkheads, did you hear them burst?

784
01:46:22,591 --> 01:46:24,468
What's the bearing?

785
01:46:25,344 --> 01:46:28,388
065 sir. Bearing constant.

786
01:46:32,684 --> 01:46:34,561
Deeper, chief. Silent speed.

787
01:47:01,213 --> 01:47:02,965
Bearing?

788
01:47:05,634 --> 01:47:07,302
Five 0.

789
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:10,097
Growing louder.

790
01:47:31,827 --> 01:47:32,828
Yeah, sure!

791
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:48,302
Deeper still. Right thirty degrees.

792
01:47:49,052 --> 01:47:50,637
They'll try doubling back.

793
01:47:53,891 --> 01:47:56,018
Keep them guessing.

794
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:05,652
Bow steady. Stern up 10.

795
01:48:55,452 --> 01:48:57,913
Contact bearing 270.

796
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:03,085
It's fading.

797
01:49:19,142 --> 01:49:20,894
Right full rudder.

798
01:49:22,271 --> 01:49:24,231
Rudder is full right.

799
01:49:27,276 --> 01:49:28,902
Steer 090 degrees.

800
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:50,924
Ugh!

801
01:49:52,634 --> 01:49:55,929
Second contact closing fast... bearing 076.

802
01:49:59,975 --> 01:50:01,768
Damn them!

803
01:50:04,646 --> 01:50:06,523
Another one!

804
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:39,348
Deeper...

805
01:50:45,103 --> 01:50:46,563
Yes... deeper.

806
01:50:51,735 --> 01:50:53,362
Bow planes down 10.

807
01:50:53,695 --> 01:50:55,197
Stern planes up 7.

808
01:51:13,715 --> 01:51:15,676
190 metres.

809
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:28,772
200 metres.

810
01:51:41,285 --> 01:51:43,328
210 metres.

811
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:53,881
220 metres.

812
01:52:01,471 --> 01:52:03,473
230 metres.

813
01:52:15,277 --> 01:52:17,446
The bolts! They're bursting!

814
01:52:17,654 --> 01:52:19,656
That's deep enough, chief. 10 metres rise.

815
01:52:20,949 --> 01:52:22,201
All ahead standard!

816
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:32,169
Quiet, men, quiet.

817
01:53:13,168 --> 01:53:15,504
Up to 150 metres! Both full ahead!

818
01:53:24,346 --> 01:53:25,806
Left 20 degrees!

819
01:53:26,014 --> 01:53:27,474
Steer 050!

820
01:53:29,685 --> 01:53:31,728
He's near his mark.

821
01:54:12,728 --> 01:54:14,188
Quiet, damn it!

822
01:54:14,396 --> 01:54:16,899
Reports! I want actual damage report.

823
01:54:27,034 --> 01:54:29,244
Captain... permission to
inspect engine room?

824
01:54:30,704 --> 01:54:32,581
Number one... Take over!

825
01:54:42,257 --> 01:54:45,052
- Bring the tank gaskets.
- Bring the tank gaskets.

826
01:54:47,221 --> 01:54:48,847
Bring me the gaskets.

827
01:54:49,056 --> 01:54:51,016
Come on, move it!

828
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:53,769
Here... Torpedo hatch taking water!

829
01:55:00,859 --> 01:55:02,945
Crow bar ! Hurry up!

830
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:12,538
They'll soon be out of fireworks.

831
01:55:28,136 --> 01:55:31,723
Exhaust flaps secured.

832
01:55:31,932 --> 01:55:35,185
150 metres, all ahead full.

833
01:55:53,787 --> 01:55:55,163
What's wrong, Johann?

834
01:56:03,255 --> 01:56:04,798
Back to your battle station.

835
01:56:05,132 --> 01:56:06,091
Right now!

836
01:56:19,104 --> 01:56:21,190
Don't disobey my orders. Do as you're told.

837
01:56:22,274 --> 01:56:23,525
Back to your station!

838
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:30,282
I'm ordering you, Johann.

839
01:56:51,386 --> 01:56:53,263
Take him aft, hurry!

840
01:56:56,266 --> 01:56:57,518
He's under control.

841
01:57:38,892 --> 01:57:41,562
Who would have thought it was Johann?

842
01:57:45,566 --> 01:57:47,150
Degrading...

843
01:57:49,736 --> 01:57:51,321
Shame.

844
01:58:10,132 --> 01:58:13,594
Forget it... We can hear them.

845
01:58:38,952 --> 01:58:40,412
That's it... come on.

846
01:59:06,355 --> 01:59:09,233
Boat dropping!

847
01:59:11,944 --> 01:59:13,529
190 metres!

848
01:59:41,431 --> 01:59:43,433
220 metres!

849
01:59:44,768 --> 01:59:46,728
We're sinking!

850
02:00:57,799 --> 02:01:00,761
Make a note for the war diary.

851
02:01:04,473 --> 02:01:07,100
Today submerged for 6 hours

852
02:01:08,393 --> 02:01:10,103
at silent speed.

853
02:01:11,146 --> 02:01:14,762
Satisfied, the destroyer has lost us.

854
02:01:16,735 --> 02:01:20,489
Intense glowing sky, observed it...

855
02:01:20,697 --> 02:01:23,283
210 degrees.

856
02:01:23,659 --> 02:01:26,620
Probably flames from tanker we hit.

857
02:01:36,588 --> 02:01:38,549
We'll surface in 10 minutes.

858
02:02:18,797 --> 02:02:20,674
You see, lieutenant...

859
02:02:23,886 --> 02:02:25,971
they didn't kill us.

860
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:35,541
Her back's already broken.

861
02:03:39,211 --> 02:03:43,257
She's a tough one. She won't go down.

862
02:03:45,467 --> 02:03:47,094
Alright number one. Let's finish her off.

863
02:03:47,302 --> 02:03:49,012
Master sight to bridge.

864
02:03:49,221 --> 02:03:51,557
Final shot. Prepare to fire.

865
02:03:59,815 --> 02:04:01,400
Target speed zero.

866
02:04:03,277 --> 02:04:06,446
Range: 650 metres.

867
02:04:06,655 --> 02:04:10,075
4 metres... torpedo speed 30.

868
02:04:10,826 --> 02:04:14,997
Aiming point. Forward of aft to mast.

869
02:04:15,205 --> 02:04:18,083
Tube 1 ready.

870
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:22,379
- Fire!
- Fire!

871
02:04:22,403 --> 02:04:24,403
Torpedo running!

872
02:05:05,827 --> 02:05:08,175
There are still men on board!

873
02:05:20,729 --> 02:05:22,523
Why didn't their own ship rescued them?

874
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:25,192
For the love of god!

875
02:05:25,567 --> 02:05:27,027
They have had 6 hours!

876
02:05:54,763 --> 02:05:56,557
They're swimming towards us.

877
02:05:59,059 --> 02:06:00,477
Both engines back two-third.

878
02:07:17,763 --> 02:07:19,306
May I clear the table sir?

879
02:07:53,632 --> 02:07:54,758
Some more signals sir.

880
02:07:56,218 --> 02:07:57,678
Go ahead.

881
02:07:58,470 --> 02:08:02,641
"Three freighters sunk. Convoy's dispersed
into groups and stranglers.

882
02:08:03,016 --> 02:08:04,643
Contact problem.

883
02:08:04,852 --> 02:08:07,479
Cruising course 030."

884
02:08:07,688 --> 02:08:08,689
U-112.

885
02:08:10,357 --> 02:08:11,817
Wenzel.

886
02:08:12,025 --> 02:08:13,360
Not bad.

887
02:08:14,236 --> 02:08:16,697
Kupsch is in contact with the same convoy.

888
02:08:18,615 --> 02:08:21,034
Stackmann has torpedo a 6000 tonner.

889
02:08:23,787 --> 02:08:25,747
They're having a field day.

890
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:29,042
Any hope of joining them?

891
02:08:32,212 --> 02:08:33,505
Difficult.

892
02:08:33,714 --> 02:08:35,382
Minimum 5 hours away.

893
02:08:36,592 --> 02:08:37,551
Our fuel--

894
02:08:37,759 --> 02:08:40,304
- We can't make it.
- Yes, yes... it's no good!

895
02:09:05,913 --> 02:09:07,247
So, when do we go back?

896
02:09:14,922 --> 02:09:17,716
When it's time for us to go back.

897
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:20,385
And not before Klepton.

898
02:09:52,835 --> 02:09:55,879
Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast.

899
02:09:56,129 --> 02:09:59,258
Crew, assumed rescued,
was still on board.

900
02:09:59,466 --> 02:10:02,177
Survivors swam toward U-96.

901
02:10:43,343 --> 02:10:45,596
I wish to apologise.

902
02:10:46,722 --> 02:10:48,807
Nothing to be said, Johann.

903
02:10:50,726 --> 02:10:54,688
You deserted your post at the
critical moment in action.

904
02:10:55,731 --> 02:10:57,858
You also disobeyed my order
to return to it.

905
02:11:10,412 --> 02:11:14,378
You mean to say that there
has to be a court-martial?

906
02:11:21,215 --> 02:11:22,883
How many patrols have you done?

907
02:11:24,092 --> 02:11:25,511
Nine, sir.

908
02:11:31,892 --> 02:11:34,478
You... why you... Johann.

909
02:11:37,606 --> 02:11:39,983
Please it was a mistake.

910
02:11:49,785 --> 02:11:54,915
I just somehow... all of a sudden...
as if...

911
02:11:59,419 --> 02:12:03,507
It won't ever happen again.
You can depend on me.

912
02:12:06,552 --> 02:12:08,428
I swear.

913
02:12:11,598 --> 02:12:13,267
All right, Johann.

914
02:12:15,894 --> 02:12:20,246
There isn't... no court martial, sir?

915
02:12:24,236 --> 02:12:26,613
Get some sleep.

916
02:12:40,419 --> 02:12:42,880
U-96 withdrew from survivors.
Decision...

917
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:46,133
Return to La Rochelle.

918
02:13:03,817 --> 02:13:05,903
Cipher officer!

919
02:13:12,534 --> 02:13:14,119
You found the problem?

920
02:13:14,953 --> 02:13:16,872
- It's the bulkhead conduit, captain.
- Good.

921
02:13:17,372 --> 02:13:18,874
Get it fix!

922
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:23,295
Morning there.

923
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:27,466
Get moving, there's a signal to be decoded.

924
02:13:36,975 --> 02:13:38,685
Supposed it's top secrets.

925
02:13:40,062 --> 02:13:42,356
Another wild goose chase.

926
02:13:43,023 --> 02:13:44,816
Amateur task.

927
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,194
This rig is ready for a refit.

928
02:13:47,402 --> 02:13:50,989
Not to mention our fuel shortage.
We won't even make La Rochelle.

929
02:13:51,615 --> 02:13:54,409
- The last 100 miles--
- We'll hoist the sail.

930
02:13:55,077 --> 02:13:56,912
Don't worry, chief.

931
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:01,166
Decoded it yet?

932
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,505
Well, what's it?

933
02:14:08,215 --> 02:14:10,467
"For captain's only."

934
02:14:35,409 --> 02:14:37,286
Very strange.

935
02:14:37,953 --> 02:14:39,913
Triple cipher.

936
02:14:47,796 --> 02:14:50,507
Well, what do you know...
Christmas in La Rochelle.

937
02:14:50,716 --> 02:14:52,217
Real girls and Christmas stockings.

938
02:14:52,426 --> 02:14:54,178
Delicious telephone operators,

939
02:14:54,386 --> 02:14:58,265
cute sexy little nurses,
to comfort and kiss.

940
02:14:58,473 --> 02:14:59,933
Hot damsels. We'll have a ball.

941
02:15:00,142 --> 02:15:04,605
A valkyrie... in shinning armour,
really big and fat.

942
02:15:05,147 --> 02:15:07,441
<i>- Now hear this.</i>
- Chief master's voice.

943
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:09,193
<i>La Rochelle's out.</i>

944
02:15:11,278 --> 02:15:13,864
<i>We've orders to a new port of destination.</i>

945
02:15:14,114 --> 02:15:15,199
<i>La Spezia.</i>

946
02:15:17,034 --> 02:15:19,328
<i>The Mediterranean. First...</i>

947
02:15:20,037 --> 02:15:23,165
<i>we'll refuel and supplies at Vigo in Spain.</i>

948
02:15:23,707 --> 02:15:25,459
<i>That's all.</i>

949
02:15:31,673 --> 02:15:33,759
They must be crazy.

950
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:36,053
Those dirty roaches.

951
02:15:37,179 --> 02:15:39,223
There goes our Christmas stocking.

952
02:15:39,681 --> 02:15:42,976
No sexy little nurses.
Not even decent a pig.

953
02:15:43,185 --> 02:15:46,011
I'd like to kill those morons.

954
02:15:47,189 --> 02:15:49,981
Well... Christmas and Macaronis.
That can't be such a bad thing.

955
02:15:49,985 --> 02:15:52,319
We've got to get there first,
you stupid little jerk.

956
02:15:52,528 --> 02:15:54,545
- And so?
- And so?

957
02:15:55,072 --> 02:15:56,907
Gibraltar!

958
02:15:57,241 --> 02:16:00,452
Use your brain, you pathetic idiot.

959
02:16:05,082 --> 02:16:07,251
It's like eye of a needle.

960
02:16:08,293 --> 02:16:11,839
This camel will need more than a can of
Vaseline to get through there.

961
02:16:28,313 --> 02:16:29,690
The Mediterranean.

962
02:16:30,482 --> 02:16:32,359
It's madness.

963
02:16:33,068 --> 02:16:35,821
It's swarming with English combat ships.

964
02:16:36,071 --> 02:16:37,906
Venus... standby!

965
02:16:38,866 --> 02:16:40,158
Zero...

966
02:16:40,784 --> 02:16:43,912
25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

967
02:16:45,789 --> 02:16:47,040
Gibraltar.

968
02:16:47,958 --> 02:16:50,669
It's the best chance to get ourselves kill.

969
02:17:05,726 --> 02:17:09,563
When you reached Vigo you go ashore
Lieutenany Werner, you and the chief.

970
02:17:10,772 --> 02:17:11,899
But sir...

971
02:17:12,441 --> 02:17:14,818
I've already make the decision.

972
02:17:19,156 --> 02:17:22,117
I'll have got to find new replacement
for the chief.

973
02:17:25,913 --> 02:17:29,041
Our agents will smuggle you
out of Spain somehow.

974
02:17:30,626 --> 02:17:33,212
Dress up as gypsies for instance.

975
02:17:34,421 --> 02:17:37,090
- But captain I thought I would be going...
- No arguments.

976
02:17:40,594 --> 02:17:42,513
It's all been settled.

977
02:17:43,472 --> 02:17:45,933
It's easier to get two of you out.

978
02:17:50,145 --> 02:17:53,065
I really believed the chief needs a break.

979
02:18:06,286 --> 02:18:08,580
His wife is very ill.

980
02:18:11,959 --> 02:18:13,961
He must get home.

981
02:18:19,508 --> 02:18:21,134
I understand, sir.

982
02:18:36,942 --> 02:18:38,318
Tough break?

983
02:18:51,248 --> 02:18:53,542
When we reach Vigo it's goodbye.

984
02:18:55,294 --> 02:18:57,421
Captain order me ashore.

985
02:18:59,298 --> 02:19:01,300
The chief leaves too.

986
02:19:08,724 --> 02:19:11,518
To deliver your mail for you?

987
02:19:28,744 --> 02:19:30,913
That's quite a bunch of them.

988
02:19:34,917 --> 02:19:37,544
Well... it's quite a romance, isn't it?

989
02:20:19,378 --> 02:20:21,088
Equalize.

990
02:20:28,428 --> 02:20:29,680
Pipe down.

991
02:20:30,764 --> 02:20:31,890
White light.

992
02:20:32,099 --> 02:20:33,851
Hurry up with that gear.

993
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,270
Quiet, man!

994
02:20:44,278 --> 02:20:47,281
Now we just have to find this little bunch.

995
02:20:49,950 --> 02:20:51,827
The "Weser"

996
02:20:53,787 --> 02:20:56,748
a German merchant ship,
she's got herself interned here.

997
02:20:57,833 --> 02:21:02,087
With a bellyful of torpedoes,
fuel and supplies.

998
02:21:02,504 --> 02:21:04,798
And that's all for us.

999
02:21:05,507 --> 02:21:08,468
Yeah... yeah, 1st class service.

1000
02:21:21,315 --> 02:21:23,483
Starboard engine stop.

1001
02:21:25,652 --> 02:21:27,321
We've arrived.

1002
02:21:27,529 --> 02:21:29,323
Port engine stop.

1003
02:21:38,415 --> 02:21:39,875
Officers to bridge.

1004
02:21:41,877 --> 02:21:43,253
Watch out on deck.

1005
02:21:55,849 --> 02:21:56,934
Gentlemen.

1006
02:22:03,815 --> 02:22:06,610
Three cheers for our gallant U-Boat men.

1007
02:22:19,623 --> 02:22:21,416
You're most welcome.

1008
02:22:21,792 --> 02:22:23,335
Captain lieutenant.

1009
02:22:23,585 --> 02:22:27,381
No, no please, not me.

1010
02:22:28,674 --> 02:22:30,467
This is the commandant.

1011
02:22:30,843 --> 02:22:32,845
My apologies, sir. I...

1012
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:39,059
A pleasure to have you aboard the "Weser,“
captain lieutenant.

1013
02:22:39,935 --> 02:22:44,565
A hero, I am delighted to be so honored.

1014
02:22:45,774 --> 02:22:47,234
Gentlemen...

1015
02:22:47,442 --> 02:22:49,695
here they stand.

1016
02:22:49,903 --> 02:22:52,322
Our heroes of the deep.

1017
02:22:52,573 --> 02:22:54,741
The grey wolves...

1018
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:58,287
our humble ship is honor on this occasion..

1019
02:22:58,662 --> 02:23:00,747
such as this is.

1020
02:23:00,956 --> 02:23:03,542
Captain, lead the way...

1021
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:05,169
- Welcome onboard.
- Congratulations... well done!

1022
02:23:05,377 --> 02:23:07,421
Nice clean tugboat you've got here.

1023
02:23:11,925 --> 02:23:13,719
Here we are captain.
As you could see we've done

1024
02:23:13,927 --> 02:23:17,222
we can in our modesty way,
I hope it's to your taste.

1025
02:23:17,431 --> 02:23:20,767
Quite a table, just like home.

1026
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:24,897
Fresh bread, cakes from the ship bakery.

1027
02:23:25,105 --> 02:23:29,443
With fruits,
fresh sausage our chef specialty.

1028
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:33,697
We are waiting to hear your news.

1029
02:23:33,906 --> 02:23:36,825
You can't imagine what it means to us.

1030
02:23:38,202 --> 02:23:41,622
It isn't easy here despite what people say,
it's very frustrating.

1031
02:23:41,830 --> 02:23:45,667
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel supplies no problem.

1032
02:23:45,876 --> 02:23:48,795
Torpedoes are tricky though. Very tricky.

1033
02:23:50,255 --> 02:23:52,424
You're all set-up.

1034
02:23:53,425 --> 02:23:58,055
The Spaniards tolerate us,
but we couldn't called them enthusiastic.

1035
02:23:58,263 --> 02:24:00,432
Christmas cake.

1036
02:24:02,768 --> 02:24:04,269
Now tell us...

1037
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:06,480
how many ships have you sunk?

1038
02:24:06,688 --> 02:24:09,066
Now let's see, I guess about...

1039
02:24:09,274 --> 02:24:10,776
Oh... champagne.

1040
02:24:10,984 --> 02:24:12,945
How forgetful of me.

1041
02:24:13,153 --> 02:24:14,446
Take a glass.

1042
02:24:15,197 --> 02:24:16,782
Gentlemen.

1043
02:24:19,368 --> 02:24:21,537
We drink to our heroes.

1044
02:24:21,745 --> 02:24:23,705
We are proud of you.

1045
02:24:25,082 --> 02:24:27,167
To the German U-boat's service...

1046
02:24:27,376 --> 02:24:29,586
and to our beloved Füh--

1047
02:24:31,046 --> 02:24:33,590
Aah yes, we're not exactly at home.

1048
02:24:33,799 --> 02:24:35,634
If you understand what I mean.

1049
02:24:37,094 --> 02:24:38,095
All the best!

1050
02:24:38,971 --> 02:24:40,848
Cheers!

1051
02:24:43,016 --> 02:24:45,811
And now... plenty for everyone, come on.

1052
02:24:46,812 --> 02:24:48,814
- And with me, let's get down to business.
- Yes, come...

1053
02:24:54,194 --> 02:24:56,530
Yes now, telll us all about it captain,
continue...

1054
02:24:56,738 --> 02:24:59,157
I'm bursting with curiosity.

1055
02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:02,536
Those are fresh figs.

1056
02:25:10,836 --> 02:25:12,546
Never had one.

1057
02:25:20,429 --> 02:25:22,389
Quiet, gentlemen.

1058
02:25:26,268 --> 02:25:28,896
This time we very nearly had it.

1059
02:25:34,109 --> 02:25:35,527
Phenomenal.

1060
02:25:37,279 --> 02:25:40,449
You see gentlemen,
that's the stuff heroes are made of.

1061
02:25:40,657 --> 02:25:43,452
There's no other word for it
but phenomenal.

1062
02:25:44,119 --> 02:25:46,622
Come on captain,
I want to hear more... here.

1063
02:25:46,830 --> 02:25:49,917
Give me your plate, herring sir.

1064
02:25:50,417 --> 02:25:52,252
Another specialty of our chef this.

1065
02:25:52,461 --> 02:25:54,588
His mother recipe.

1066
02:25:55,631 --> 02:25:58,091
Just taste it. There's lots more.

1067
02:26:03,222 --> 02:26:05,766
What's like to be underwater?

1068
02:26:05,974 --> 02:26:07,851
To be submerged...

1069
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,938
while overhead the enemy lies in wait?

1070
02:26:11,605 --> 02:26:13,023
It's dark!

1071
02:26:16,068 --> 02:26:17,694
Yes and very quiet.

1072
02:26:17,986 --> 02:26:20,280
As long as no one belches.

1073
02:26:22,866 --> 02:26:23,909
Why is that?

1074
02:26:24,368 --> 02:26:27,913
- As long as no one...
- I'd explains what our number two means.

1075
02:26:28,163 --> 02:26:31,458
In the silent speed the men
must always execise discipline.

1076
02:26:31,667 --> 02:26:34,461
And that's why you're forbidden
to belches, yes...

1077
02:26:37,631 --> 02:26:40,801
Herr Seewald, we've been expecting you.
Captain...

1078
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:46,890
Representatives of our naval attache here.

1079
02:26:49,184 --> 02:26:51,728
I brought some communications from Berlin.

1080
02:26:54,189 --> 02:26:56,900
Fisrt, the documents for the break-through.

1081
02:27:01,488 --> 02:27:03,323
This cable came.

1082
02:27:14,376 --> 02:27:16,962
Chief, Lieutenant Werner.

1083
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:23,177
We're going for a little fresh air.

1084
02:27:32,519 --> 02:27:34,104
Well Seewald, what's happening?

1085
02:27:34,521 --> 02:27:36,023
Bad news.

1086
02:27:42,696 --> 02:27:46,262
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, chief.

1087
02:27:51,413 --> 02:27:54,917
There's no replacement.
You'll stay too Werner.

1088
02:28:02,591 --> 02:28:04,218
I'm sorry.

1089
02:28:08,096 --> 02:28:10,349
I guess it's just as well.

1090
02:28:13,435 --> 02:28:16,230
Who knows what kind of idiot
they would have send you?

1091
02:28:20,234 --> 02:28:24,404
One of those new found warrior's.
Just all winds and smoke.

1092
02:28:29,826 --> 02:28:31,745
You could be right.

1093
02:28:33,413 --> 02:28:37,251
They should have stacked
the sub with a few horny little senorita.

1094
02:28:37,459 --> 02:28:39,264
Forget it lover boy. A case of

1095
02:28:39,289 --> 02:28:41,529
- Spanish crabs, that's all we need.
- Idiot!

1096
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:43,945
Today he was a virgin.
Now he can't live without...

1097
02:28:44,132 --> 02:28:47,261
Hurry up and get this mess out of here.
Get that chart table clear.

1098
02:28:47,469 --> 02:28:49,555
I can't navigate on bananas.

1099
02:28:50,556 --> 02:28:52,933
What're you doing? Get that fruit out
of here, move it. I want....

1100
02:28:53,141 --> 02:28:55,435
Those depth control completely free.

1101
02:28:57,145 --> 02:28:59,039
Is that's a Christmas tree?

1102
02:28:59,043 --> 02:29:01,108
- What do you think it is?
- Camouflage...

1103
02:29:06,071 --> 02:29:07,823
We're staying on board.

1104
02:29:08,031 --> 02:29:09,908
They won't replace us.

1105
02:29:21,336 --> 02:29:23,213
I'm sorry, Ullman.

1106
02:29:40,606 --> 02:29:43,609
Seven miles from coast to coast.

1107
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:46,278
A bit narrow.

1108
02:29:48,655 --> 02:29:50,866
Here are the British dockyards.

1109
02:29:51,742 --> 02:29:55,871
The only one the British have
in the western Mediterranean.

1110
02:29:57,706 --> 02:30:00,334
So they are very heavily defended.

1111
02:30:04,046 --> 02:30:06,173
The place will be crawling
with patrol boats.

1112
02:30:09,343 --> 02:30:12,513
Anything that floats will be on the water.

1113
02:30:16,099 --> 02:30:18,352
And this is where we have to go.

1114
02:30:19,645 --> 02:30:21,772
That's the situation.

1115
02:30:34,535 --> 02:30:36,745
We'll move in under darkness.

1116
02:30:38,205 --> 02:30:40,040
The surface.

1117
02:30:44,503 --> 02:30:47,214
We'll see if we can slip through
their cordon.

1118
02:30:52,219 --> 02:30:55,681
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.

1119
02:31:05,482 --> 02:31:07,442
Then dive down

1120
02:31:09,194 --> 02:31:11,154
and let ourselves drift through.

1121
02:31:21,832 --> 02:31:23,292
Dive...

1122
02:31:25,544 --> 02:31:28,797
And allow the surface current
to pull us through the strait.

1123
02:31:35,179 --> 02:31:37,306
As quiet as a shadow.

1124
02:31:39,641 --> 02:31:40,976
And we burnt less fuel.

1125
02:31:49,985 --> 02:31:51,445
Well, Kriechbaum?

1126
02:31:58,327 --> 02:32:00,662
Clever trick, captain.

1127
02:32:27,856 --> 02:32:29,316
Let's get going.

1128
02:32:33,987 --> 02:32:36,615
All ahead two-thirds.

1129
02:32:40,619 --> 02:32:43,997
Navigator and I stay up here,
now clear the bridge.

1130
02:33:16,947 --> 02:33:19,575
Half the British fleet are there.

1131
02:33:21,493 --> 02:33:24,872
- Left 20 degrees and change to main motor.
- Steering 05...

1132
02:34:00,741 --> 02:34:02,534
- Destroyer port...
- Range...

1133
02:34:02,743 --> 02:34:05,120
800...

1134
02:34:05,871 --> 02:34:07,247
Which way?

1135
02:34:07,956 --> 02:34:08,999
Is she closing?

1136
02:34:15,839 --> 02:34:17,424
No, she's heading away.

1137
02:34:18,634 --> 02:34:20,093
That's good.

1138
02:34:25,974 --> 02:34:27,768
- Full...
- Rudder left full.

1139
02:34:29,144 --> 02:34:31,897
Full.

1140
02:34:34,608 --> 02:34:36,151
All right, then.

1141
02:35:28,412 --> 02:35:30,831
Right full rudder! All ahead full.
Be quick.

1142
02:35:33,667 --> 02:35:34,751
Damn!

1143
02:36:01,570 --> 02:36:03,238
Gibraltar.

1144
02:36:16,043 --> 02:36:18,670
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

1145
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:36,730
Alarm!

1146
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:38,148
Flood valves!

1147
02:36:43,737 --> 02:36:45,239
Watch out, don't dive!

1148
02:36:45,447 --> 02:36:48,700
The captain's still on top! Don't dive!

1149
02:36:50,619 --> 02:36:53,163
We've got a wounded! Stopped flooding.

1150
02:36:53,413 --> 02:36:55,832
Safe off everything... everything!

1151
02:36:56,083 --> 02:36:58,988
Standby escape gear.
Ready to abandon ship!

1152
02:37:00,212 --> 02:37:03,423
- Power supply to escape gears...
- Medic to officers' mess immediately!

1153
02:37:07,678 --> 02:37:10,347
Bring the medic, hurry!

1154
02:37:10,597 --> 02:37:14,053
Both engines maximum power!
Hard starboard!

1155
02:37:16,270 --> 02:37:17,813
Easy...

1156
02:37:18,021 --> 02:37:19,565
To control room!

1157
02:37:19,773 --> 02:37:21,316
Prepare to abandon ship!

1158
02:37:28,365 --> 02:37:32,286
Faster, faster!

1159
02:37:42,254 --> 02:37:44,423
- Compresses!
- Compresses!

1160
02:37:56,310 --> 02:37:59,563
Chief to captain. We've to stop
port engines. That's is loose.

1161
02:37:59,771 --> 02:38:01,356
Maintain full power chief.

1162
02:38:01,607 --> 02:38:05,110
All the power you've got!
All the power you've got!

1163
02:38:05,903 --> 02:38:07,446
Where's the hell is he going?

1164
02:38:07,654 --> 02:38:08,655
Due south!

1165
02:38:08,864 --> 02:38:11,241
Heading directly for the African coastline.

1166
02:38:19,958 --> 02:38:22,419
Damn it. Damn it.

1167
02:38:26,423 --> 02:38:28,342
Ready to dive!

1168
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:30,677
All hands forward!

1169
02:38:41,396 --> 02:38:42,481
90 metres quick.

1170
02:38:47,361 --> 02:38:50,364
- Bow planes are inaction!
- Switch to manual!

1171
02:38:52,741 --> 02:38:55,827
The bow planes is jammed, we cannot dive!

1172
02:39:04,503 --> 02:39:05,838
All engines stop.

1173
02:39:06,255 --> 02:39:08,298
All men go aft!

1174
02:39:15,055 --> 02:39:16,598
Move, move... move!

1175
02:39:16,849 --> 02:39:18,100
Pump everything aft.

1176
02:39:19,601 --> 02:39:21,061
Auxiliary pump out of action!

1177
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:22,229
Blow forward trim tanks.

1178
02:39:25,941 --> 02:39:27,067
Won't pull up!

1179
02:39:27,276 --> 02:39:28,986
She's still going down.

1180
02:39:29,194 --> 02:39:31,363
Got to shed some weight!

1181
02:39:31,572 --> 02:39:33,740
Pump 1000 liters!

1182
02:39:36,618 --> 02:39:38,412
... don't you know how to keep him quiet.

1183
02:39:40,372 --> 02:39:41,832
Ballast pump out of action.

1184
02:39:43,166 --> 02:39:44,710
Permission to blow?

1185
02:39:45,085 --> 02:39:46,461
Both engines hard astern full!

1186
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:54,761
No effect!

1187
02:39:55,012 --> 02:39:57,931
- Alright blow.
- Blow I said.

1188
02:39:58,140 --> 02:39:59,141
Blow 4 ballasts.

1189
02:40:03,687 --> 02:40:05,647
Ooh... pull out. Pull out!

1190
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:10,652
Damn you... pull out!

1191
02:40:12,446 --> 02:40:14,865
All that you've got, chief.
All you've got.

1192
02:40:15,115 --> 02:40:16,074
All that she's got... blow!

1193
02:40:18,118 --> 02:40:19,453
Come on up.

1194
02:40:45,979 --> 02:40:48,941
We can't hold her.

1195
02:40:54,196 --> 02:40:55,155
200.

1196
02:40:59,493 --> 02:41:00,536
210.

1197
02:41:05,332 --> 02:41:07,167
220 metres.

1198
02:41:09,753 --> 02:41:11,630
230.

1199
02:41:12,798 --> 02:41:14,424
240.

1200
02:41:17,219 --> 02:41:19,304
250 metres.

1201
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:26,144
My God.

1202
02:41:27,688 --> 02:41:30,107
Do not turn away from me.

1203
02:41:30,607 --> 02:41:32,818
Oh dear lord. Take away...

1204
02:42:23,952 --> 02:42:25,579
A shovelful of sand.

1205
02:42:28,957 --> 02:42:32,836
The merciful God left a shovelful
of sand to keep us up.

1206
02:42:44,932 --> 02:42:46,391
280 metres.

1207
02:42:48,018 --> 02:42:50,145
She's still in one piece.

1208
02:43:40,654 --> 02:43:42,573
The torpedo hatch is taking water!

1209
02:43:45,909 --> 02:43:48,120
Control room... engine one and rising.

1210
02:43:50,205 --> 02:43:53,250
Taking water in motor bilge!

1211
02:43:54,251 --> 02:43:56,378
Tube 5 taking water!

1212
02:44:00,507 --> 02:44:01,717
What do you need?

1213
02:44:01,925 --> 02:44:04,845
- Timber for shoring.
- In the bow have it.

1214
02:44:07,097 --> 02:44:08,182
Exhaust valve okay?

1215
02:44:08,891 --> 02:44:11,059
Leakage plugs! Move!

1216
02:44:14,813 --> 02:44:16,690
Give me that flashlight!

1217
02:44:17,441 --> 02:44:19,067
I need a wrench, damn it!

1218
02:44:19,276 --> 02:44:20,944
Give me damage reports.

1219
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:23,989
Water coming in around the aft area.

1220
02:44:24,198 --> 02:44:26,200
Where are the tools?

1221
02:44:31,830 --> 02:44:34,499
- Where is it?
- Bilge pump!

1222
02:44:35,375 --> 02:44:37,044
Both main motors switch put out of action!

1223
02:44:37,252 --> 02:44:38,629
Sir, engines room completely wrecked.

1224
02:44:38,837 --> 02:44:40,547
I want some proper damage reports.

1225
02:44:47,137 --> 02:44:48,430
Where's the most damage...?

1226
02:44:48,639 --> 02:44:51,683
Shafting valves sir. Below the...

1227
02:44:52,351 --> 02:44:54,895
Check damage to number two batteries.

1228
02:44:55,103 --> 02:44:57,064
Give us a hand.

1229
02:44:59,608 --> 02:45:02,027
That bolt, there.
Right underneath should do it.

1230
02:45:02,236 --> 02:45:03,403
Can't see! I can't see.

1231
02:45:03,654 --> 02:45:06,490
Push! Hard as you can.

1232
02:45:06,698 --> 02:45:07,908
It's stuck tight!

1233
02:45:08,784 --> 02:45:11,245
Can't get the wedge in!

1234
02:45:11,453 --> 02:45:13,121
Here... Give me that hammer!

1235
02:45:19,628 --> 02:45:22,089
Need any more men in the aft torpedo room?

1236
02:45:22,297 --> 02:45:24,466
I'll ask them again!

1237
02:45:26,552 --> 02:45:27,970
Argh.. this damn thing.

1238
02:45:28,178 --> 02:45:29,805
Here, hold my light!

1239
02:45:30,639 --> 02:45:33,851
- Father... forgive my sins.
- Hey...

1240
02:45:35,143 --> 02:45:36,895
Stupid son of a pig!

1241
02:45:38,063 --> 02:45:39,064
There's work to do.

1242
02:45:40,566 --> 02:45:42,609
- Floods going in the engine room
- Go back!

1243
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:44,570
Hurry up!

1244
02:45:45,237 --> 02:45:46,864
Where's that damn wrench?

1245
02:45:50,367 --> 02:45:51,535
Bigger wrench!

1246
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:54,079
Here hold the light.

1247
02:46:03,088 --> 02:46:06,383
- It's rising.
- Tighten the seals. Don't you...

1248
02:46:08,302 --> 02:46:09,469
There's a leak in the cooling system.

1249
02:46:12,723 --> 02:46:16,018
Tighten the .... up there. Hurry up!

1250
02:46:18,729 --> 02:46:21,106
Hoffman... give me that planks for shoring.

1251
02:46:26,278 --> 02:46:29,114
- Plugs down here... quick!
- Hurry up.

1252
02:46:41,752 --> 02:46:43,629
- Easy with him.
- Easy men easy.

1253
02:46:55,349 --> 02:46:57,226
We're taking water very fast.

1254
02:46:57,434 --> 02:47:01,730
The hull valves has burst. Cooling water
system blocked, in the tower vent.

1255
02:47:01,939 --> 02:47:06,527
Compressors are dislodged.
Shaft valves beginning to leak, sir.

1256
02:47:08,570 --> 02:47:10,781
What about fuel leaks?

1257
02:47:10,989 --> 02:47:12,032
Can't tell us yet.

1258
02:47:12,241 --> 02:47:15,327
- What else, chief?
The battery cells many of them are cracked.

1259
02:47:15,536 --> 02:47:17,496
How many I don't know.

1260
02:47:23,585 --> 02:47:24,962
It's red. Acid in the bilge.

1261
02:47:25,170 --> 02:47:28,882
- Sublimed of lime quickly.
- See how many cells have cracked.

1262
02:47:29,132 --> 02:47:32,261
- Battery straps over here. Move it you.
- Battery straps.

1263
02:47:50,612 --> 02:47:51,572
Over here!

1264
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:54,283
I need plugs and a hammer!

1265
02:47:59,121 --> 02:48:01,915
- Here.
- Thanks, lieutenant.

1266
02:48:14,887 --> 02:48:16,763
Calm down.

1267
02:48:24,771 --> 02:48:25,981
Tell the chief.

1268
02:48:26,190 --> 02:48:30,569
Water is up to bilge torpedo hatch.
Rising faster.

1269
02:48:39,953 --> 02:48:41,371
Careful.

1270
02:48:48,086 --> 02:48:49,713
Twelve battery cells drained.

1271
02:48:49,922 --> 02:48:52,799
God almighty. What a hell of a mess.

1272
02:49:02,351 --> 02:49:04,520
Let's hope these are enough.

1273
02:49:08,690 --> 02:49:12,361
Packed the bridge with all of the life
cells. It's our only chance.

1274
02:49:12,694 --> 02:49:14,112
Without batteries we've had it.

1275
02:49:16,949 --> 02:49:19,284
It's no good. I can't see.

1276
02:49:19,493 --> 02:49:21,370
Lieutenant, more lights!

1277
02:49:22,704 --> 02:49:25,290
We got to close the leaks or
it's all over for us.

1278
02:49:34,633 --> 02:49:37,219
To the right, more to the right.

1279
02:49:44,852 --> 02:49:46,103
Wire.

1280
02:49:46,645 --> 02:49:48,522
- Get some wire to bridge them.
- Wire...

1281
02:49:49,690 --> 02:49:52,693
- Three cells.
- Move it, we need wire. Hurry up.

1282
02:49:59,950 --> 02:50:03,161
Wire. The chief needs wire. Get moving.

1283
02:50:03,453 --> 02:50:05,289
Look for wire. Did you hear me?

1284
02:50:05,539 --> 02:50:08,000
We've got plenty of
fancy torpedos, alright.

1285
02:50:08,959 --> 02:50:11,420
Each one is twenty-five thousand marks.

1286
02:50:11,628 --> 02:50:13,297
But no damn wire.

1287
02:50:13,505 --> 02:50:15,048
All they forget...

1288
02:50:15,257 --> 02:50:18,093
is 50 pennies worth of old wire.

1289
02:50:20,929 --> 02:50:22,598
The drainage pump jammed, sir.

1290
02:50:22,806 --> 02:50:24,933
- Won't even extend manually.
- That's great. Captain...

1291
02:50:28,270 --> 02:50:29,438
- Here!
- He's got some wire.

1292
02:50:30,439 --> 02:50:32,274
- Terrific... better than nothing.
- Got some wire.

1293
02:50:32,482 --> 02:50:33,817
Pliers!

1294
02:50:47,414 --> 02:50:48,665
All the leaks have been stopped.

1295
02:50:54,588 --> 02:50:55,589
Good, Johann.

1296
02:51:00,302 --> 02:51:01,845
That's good.

1297
02:51:07,309 --> 02:51:09,853
Now changed your wet things, men.

1298
02:51:20,781 --> 02:51:22,866
We must get rid of the water.

1299
02:51:23,075 --> 02:51:25,160
Just has to be a way.

1300
02:51:26,453 --> 02:51:28,664
Into the control room bilge

1301
02:51:29,581 --> 02:51:30,749
and then outside.

1302
02:51:37,339 --> 02:51:39,758
Come on. Move it.

1303
02:51:48,559 --> 02:51:51,311
Keep the rhythm going.

1304
02:51:58,777 --> 02:52:02,072
Step on it! .....
You lazy fat ass, quick.

1305
02:52:08,787 --> 02:52:10,873
Three more starboard side.

1306
02:52:23,385 --> 02:52:24,928
How does it look now?

1307
02:52:25,554 --> 02:52:28,432
Almost finish. Three cells to go, sir.

1308
02:52:40,986 --> 02:52:43,822
Make some room out there.
Chief coming through.

1309
02:53:10,724 --> 02:53:13,310
All of our compass are out of action.

1310
02:53:15,103 --> 02:53:18,023
And we may have lost sonar gear too.

1311
02:53:18,232 --> 02:53:19,775
And radio's contact seems bad.

1312
02:53:22,611 --> 02:53:24,321
First rate condition.

1313
02:53:27,074 --> 02:53:28,617
Can we get out again?

1314
02:53:34,623 --> 02:53:35,999
Do you think we have a chance, sir?

1315
02:53:42,985 --> 02:53:45,154
Good question.

1316
02:53:50,827 --> 02:53:53,746
Some air must be still in the ballast tanks

1317
02:53:54,622 --> 02:53:56,374
from the blowing.

1318
02:53:58,835 --> 02:54:01,004
Should help us.

1319
02:54:01,295 --> 02:54:04,007
If we used every ounce of high pressure,

1320
02:54:09,345 --> 02:54:10,805
we'll try.

1321
02:54:15,143 --> 02:54:17,687
The boat has to be light.

1322
02:54:19,230 --> 02:54:21,524
We've got to get the water out.

1323
02:54:28,573 --> 02:54:30,616
Must work. Must work.

1324
02:54:33,119 --> 02:54:35,204
Aft is almost bailed.

1325
02:54:42,754 --> 02:54:44,047
It could just work.

1326
02:54:44,255 --> 02:54:46,090
By hand into the trimming tanks,

1327
02:54:46,299 --> 02:54:47,508
then with ballast pump

1328
02:54:47,717 --> 02:54:50,511
and high pressure air,
we could forced the water's out.

1329
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:52,513
Ballast pump?

1330
02:54:53,264 --> 02:54:54,849
We're fixing it.

1331
02:54:58,853 --> 02:55:00,980
Then we gamble on one pump.

1332
02:55:02,523 --> 02:55:04,067
One blast and--

1333
02:55:05,735 --> 02:55:07,570
Won't be a second chance.

1334
02:55:09,822 --> 02:55:10,907
When?

1335
02:55:11,115 --> 02:55:13,242
When all repaired are completed.

1336
02:55:13,451 --> 02:55:15,203
About 8 hours, sir.

1337
02:55:17,372 --> 02:55:20,291
- CO2 content?
- 1.8 percent.

1338
02:55:21,417 --> 02:55:23,127
Will the oxygen last?

1339
02:55:23,836 --> 02:55:25,129
No.

1340
02:55:28,091 --> 02:55:30,760
Emergency issue.
For all men who're working.

1341
02:55:30,968 --> 02:55:32,887
Crew off-watch. Turn in.

1342
02:56:45,418 --> 02:56:46,753
Will he pull through?

1343
02:56:46,961 --> 02:56:48,713
Difficult to say as it is, sir.

1344
02:57:07,607 --> 02:57:09,442
Doesn't look good, sir.

1345
02:57:49,148 --> 02:57:50,692
Ready to vent, Pilgrim.

1346
02:57:52,235 --> 02:57:53,486
Everything okay?

1347
02:57:53,695 --> 02:57:55,822
Everything under control sir.

1348
02:57:56,030 --> 02:57:58,074
Think we're ready.

1349
02:58:01,411 --> 02:58:03,621
How is it looking aft?

1350
02:58:04,247 --> 02:58:06,499
We've done what we can, sir.

1351
02:58:08,793 --> 02:58:11,295
I guess it's time I look things over.

1352
02:58:44,746 --> 02:58:46,330
You should be careful.

1353
02:59:09,228 --> 02:59:10,938
Can you make it?

1354
02:59:11,147 --> 02:59:13,483
- I'll make it.
- That's great.

1355
02:59:18,863 --> 02:59:22,575
Don't worry, captain.
We'll soon be arriving.

1356
02:59:30,375 --> 02:59:32,126
How's it going?

1357
02:59:34,003 --> 02:59:37,173
Two bearings. Stand to be changed and fix.

1358
03:00:43,114 --> 03:00:44,657
Do you want some glucose?

1359
03:01:25,907 --> 03:01:27,408
It's a little crazy.

1360
03:01:28,576 --> 03:01:30,912
Hauling us through the strait.

1361
03:01:32,413 --> 03:01:34,540
It was bound to go wrong.

1362
03:01:39,837 --> 03:01:41,798
He knew it.

1363
03:01:43,508 --> 03:01:46,302
The old man knew it.

1364
03:01:51,474 --> 03:01:55,269
From the moment that
radio signal comes through.

1365
03:01:55,895 --> 03:01:58,564
Realised the risk.

1366
03:02:01,150 --> 03:02:05,071
The reason he wanted us ashore...

1367
03:02:05,279 --> 03:02:06,948
at Vigo.

1368
03:02:11,953 --> 03:02:14,956
He knew there wasn't any hope.

1369
03:02:30,763 --> 03:02:34,809
He wanted us believe,
quite simple as that.

1370
03:02:35,518 --> 03:02:37,186
Easy trick.

1371
03:02:41,733 --> 03:02:45,528
"Dive drift with the current and" --

1372
03:02:50,366 --> 03:02:53,036
That's a clever trick.

1373
03:02:55,371 --> 03:02:57,832
But it has to work.

1374
03:03:04,881 --> 03:03:08,634
Will we ever get out of this?

1375
03:03:17,393 --> 03:03:18,853
I really don't know.

1376
03:04:08,820 --> 03:04:10,446
I'm sorry.

1377
03:04:12,657 --> 03:04:14,701
You think it's hopeless now?

1378
03:04:18,496 --> 03:04:21,249
It's been 15 hours.

1379
03:04:29,424 --> 03:04:31,217
He'll never do it.

1380
03:04:53,865 --> 03:04:55,450
I'm sorry.

1381
03:05:04,292 --> 03:05:06,669
That we wanted to stay.

1382
03:05:12,633 --> 03:05:16,387
"To be heading into the inexorable

1383
03:05:18,181 --> 03:05:22,560
where no mother will care for us

1384
03:05:23,895 --> 03:05:27,440
no woman crosses our path

1385
03:05:28,983 --> 03:05:33,363
where only reality reigns,
with cruelty and grandeur."

1386
03:05:44,749 --> 03:05:47,210
Just want someone to be with.

1387
03:05:54,175 --> 03:05:56,969
The only thing I feel is afraid.

1388
03:06:48,104 --> 03:06:50,231
Reporting sir.

1389
03:06:55,111 --> 03:06:56,863
Motors are all done.

1390
03:06:58,239 --> 03:07:00,533
The ballast tanks is cleared.

1391
03:07:00,992 --> 03:07:03,119
Accumulated water can all be pump

1392
03:07:05,329 --> 03:07:08,374
then blown out
with compressed air.

1393
03:07:09,500 --> 03:07:11,461
Compass is in order.

1394
03:07:12,587 --> 03:07:14,422
Echo sonar clear.

1395
03:07:30,813 --> 03:07:32,732
Good, Chief.

1396
03:07:48,373 --> 03:07:50,333
Go and take a rest.

1397
03:07:58,966 --> 03:08:01,302
Few small problems, sir.

1398
03:08:47,223 --> 03:08:49,767
Got to have good men.

1399
03:08:53,938 --> 03:08:55,648
An other thing.

1400
03:09:00,069 --> 03:09:01,571
Now listen men.

1401
03:09:05,116 --> 03:09:07,731
See if we can get our rear end

1402
03:09:07,869 --> 03:09:10,496
out of the sand.

1403
03:09:13,958 --> 03:09:15,168
At the surface

1404
03:09:16,127 --> 03:09:18,338
say your prayers men.

1405
03:09:20,548 --> 03:09:22,508
Traffics heavy up there.

1406
03:09:27,930 --> 03:09:29,640
And we pray the engines start.

1407
03:09:30,641 --> 03:09:33,061
So we can get out of this place.

1408
03:09:34,437 --> 03:09:37,023
If the condition about the same

1409
03:09:37,648 --> 03:09:39,609
we've got to head straight

1410
03:09:40,568 --> 03:09:42,362
to La Rochelle.

1411
03:09:44,155 --> 03:09:45,615
If we make it

1412
03:09:47,075 --> 03:09:49,619
it's half a bottle of beer for each.

1413
03:09:53,623 --> 03:09:56,376
There's one thing on our side...

1414
03:09:58,961 --> 03:10:01,089
They won't be expecting us.

1415
03:10:08,721 --> 03:10:10,264
Well, men...

1416
03:10:12,642 --> 03:10:14,268
- All set?
- Aye, aye!

1417
03:10:19,649 --> 03:10:21,401
Surface contact?

1418
03:10:21,609 --> 03:10:22,860
Nothing near, captain.

1419
03:10:23,903 --> 03:10:26,406
Get ready to surface, standby escape gear.

1420
03:10:26,614 --> 03:10:28,241
Switch on to red lights.

1421
03:10:30,410 --> 03:10:32,078
Man your stations.

1422
03:10:57,437 --> 03:10:58,938
Let it blow.

1423
03:12:14,305 --> 03:12:15,807
She's rising!

1424
03:12:17,934 --> 03:12:20,061
Easy men! Easy!

1425
03:12:30,988 --> 03:12:32,699
270 metres.

1426
03:12:34,909 --> 03:12:36,703
First watch, standby.

1427
03:12:37,495 --> 03:12:39,414
260 metres.

1428
03:12:46,254 --> 03:12:48,047
250 metres.

1429
03:12:56,931 --> 03:12:58,766
240 metres.

1430
03:13:04,772 --> 03:13:06,607
230 metres.

1431
03:13:12,113 --> 03:13:13,865
220.

1432
03:13:54,238 --> 03:13:55,823
Hatch is open.

1433
03:14:09,837 --> 03:14:11,506
Start up engines?

1434
03:14:17,011 --> 03:14:18,346
Both main engines.

1435
03:14:20,098 --> 03:14:22,266
Well, this is it boys.

1436
03:14:48,376 --> 03:14:49,335
Get going...

1437
03:14:49,627 --> 03:14:51,587
Yes chief.... it's going!

1438
03:14:51,796 --> 03:14:54,841
Never heard such sweet music
in all my life.

1439
03:15:16,904 --> 03:15:18,698
They won't catch us this time.

1440
03:15:18,906 --> 03:15:20,366
Not this time!

1441
03:15:24,078 --> 03:15:26,581
Just you keep on going and get us back.

1442
03:15:27,123 --> 03:15:28,875
It's an order!

1443
03:15:29,584 --> 03:15:32,879
Right full rudder. Turn to 320.

1444
03:15:34,130 --> 03:15:35,882
That's good!

1445
03:15:40,511 --> 03:15:42,722
They haven't spotted us.

1446
03:15:42,930 --> 03:15:45,892
They're all snoring in their bunks.

1447
03:15:50,355 --> 03:15:52,065
Oh, you know what?

1448
03:15:52,523 --> 03:15:55,651
They're drinking at the bar,
celebrating our sinking!

1449
03:16:41,656 --> 03:16:45,451
Drink up, boys! Here's to getting home!

1450
03:17:22,280 --> 03:17:24,699
Let's pray the engines hold out.

1451
03:17:28,202 --> 03:17:30,413
With a bit of luck it might.

1452
03:17:35,626 --> 03:17:37,837
We'll make it back home.

1453
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:48,222
The 3rd Submarine Flotilla welcomes
our returning sailors with 3 cheers.

1454
03:18:21,005 --> 03:18:22,548
Both engines stop.

1455
03:18:22,757 --> 03:18:24,050
Stern line up.

1456
03:18:32,892 --> 03:18:38,147
We Build For Victory!

1457
03:18:50,118 --> 03:18:52,662
- Thanks you, Hinrich.
- It's okay.

1458
03:18:52,870 --> 03:18:54,622
Sun's shining out there.

1459
03:18:54,831 --> 03:18:56,416
Up with him.

1460
03:19:10,304 --> 03:19:12,343
All right? Already there.

1461
03:19:12,367 --> 03:19:14,849
Make a way. Wounded man coming ashore.
