Chapter One

00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,325
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:02,872
in Nazi-occupied France

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

6
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,582
Go back inside and shut the door.

7
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,046
Julie, get me some water
for my wash up...

8
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,715
then get inside with your sisters.

9
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,367
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

10
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,577
Ready, Papa.

11
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,503
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

12
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,671
Thank you, my darling...

13
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,631
now you go inside
with your sisters.

14
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,137
Don't run.

15
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,818
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)

16
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,869
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

17
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,362
Is this the property
of Perrier LaPadite?

18
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,538
I am Perrier LaPadite.

19
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,001
It is a pleasure to meet
you, Monsieur LaPadite...

20
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,545
I am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

21
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,172
What can I do for you?

22
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,508
I was hoping you could invite
me inside your home...

23
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,053
and we may have a discussion.

24
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,014
Certainly. After you.

25
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,859
Colonel Landa, this is my family.

26
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,204
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS...

27
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,705
Mademoiselle...

28
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,040
at your service.

29
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,322
The rumours I have
heard in the village

30
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:56,212
about your family are all true.

31
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,093
Each one of your daughters is
more lovely than the last.

32
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,387
Thank you.

33
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,639
Please...

34
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,432
have a seat.

35
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,265
Suzanne, would you be so good as
to get the Colonel some wine?

36
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,567
But no.

37
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,070
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur
LaPadite, but no wine.

38
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,909
This being a dairy farm, one would
be safe in assuming you have milk?

39
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,077
Yes.

40
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,578
Then milk is what I prefer.

41
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,997
Very well.

42
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,791
Julie, would you mind
closing the window?

43
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,271
Thank you.

44
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,291
Monsieur, to both your
family and your cows...

45
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,002
I say, "Bravo."

46
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,129
Thank you.

47
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,175
Please join me at your table.

48
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,093
Very well.

49
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,641
Monsieur LaPadite...

50
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,646
what we have to discuss would
be better discussed in private.

51
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,400
You'll notice I left
my men outdoors.

52
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,904
If it wouldn't offend
them, could you

53
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,406
ask your lovely ladies
to step outside?

54
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,242
You are right.

55
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,412
Charlotte, would you
take the girls outside?

56
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,873
The Colonel and I need
to have a few words.

57
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,095
Monsieur LaPadite...

58
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,518
I regret to inform you I've
exhausted the extent of my French.

59
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,840
To continue to speak
it so inadequately

60
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,564
would only serve to embarrass me.

61
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,652
However, I've been led to believe
you speak English quite well.

62
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,029
Yes.

63
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,283
Well, it just so happens, I do as
well. This being your house...

64
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,994
I ask your permission
to switch to English...

65
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,830
for the remainder of
the conversation.

66
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,165
By all means.

67
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,669
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

68
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,422
I have no way of knowing if you
are familiar with who I am.

69
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,551
Are you aware of my existence?

70
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,762
- Yes.
- This is good.

71
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,257
Now, are you aware of the job I've

72
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,392
been ordered to carry
out in France?

73
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,812
Yes.

74
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,481
Please tell me what you've heard.

75
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,733
I've heard

76
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,438
that the Führer has
put you in charge

77
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,613
of rounding up the
Jews left in France

78
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,616
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

79
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,954
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

80
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,543
But the meaning of your visit,

81
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:27,214
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

82
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,586
The Germans looked
through my house

83
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,136
nine months ago for hiding Jews

84
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,846
and found nothing.

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,308
I'm aware of that.

86
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,269
I've read the reports
of this area.

87
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,524
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

88
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,694
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

89
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,120
most of it being a
complete waste of

90
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:54,575
time, but needs to be
done nevertheless.

91
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,662
I just have a few questions,
Monsieur LaPadite.

92
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,416
If you can assist me with answers,

93
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,586
my department can close
the file on your family.

94
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,221
Now,

95
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,185
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,

96
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,063
all dairy farmers like yourself.

97
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,527
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts

98
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,989
and the Dreyfuses.

99
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,741
Is that correct?

100
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,909
To my knowledge,

101
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,454
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

102
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,375
Herr Colonel, would it disturb
you if I smoked my pipe?

103
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,918
Please, Monsieur LaPadite,

104
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,963
this is your house, make
yourself comfortable.

105
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,258
Now, according to these papers,

106
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,637
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for

107
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,556
except the Dreyfuses.

108
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,436
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.

109
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,168
Which leads me to
the conclusion that

110
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,815
they've either made
good their escape

111
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,776
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

112
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,614
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, Monsieur LaPadite?

113
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,033
- Only rumours.
- I love rumours.

114
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,995
Facts could be so misleading,

115
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,248
where rumours, true or
false, are often revealing.

116
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
So, Monsieur LaPadite,

117
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,461
what rumours have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?

118
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,426
Again, this is just a rumour,

119
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:41,807
but we heard the Dreyfuses had
made their way into Spain.

120
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,526
So, the rumours you've
heard have been of escape?

121
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,028
(AGREES IN FRENCH)

122
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,195
Yes.

123
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,536
Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me

124
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,873
the exact members of the
household and their names?

125
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,297
There were five of them.

126
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,177
The father, Jacob.

127
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,514
Wife, Miram.

128
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,187
And her brother, Bob.

129
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,945
How old is Bob?

130
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,907
Thirty, 31.

131
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,412
Continue.

132
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,414
And the children,

133
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,250
Amos

134
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,837
and Shosanna.

135
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,800
Ages of the children?

136
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,477
Amos was nine or 10.

137
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,817
- And Shosanna?
- And Shosanna was

138
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,322
18 or 19. I'm not really sure.

139
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,502
Well, I guess that should do it.

140
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,007
However, before I go, could I have

141
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,346
another glass of
your delicious milk?

142
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,851
But of course.

143
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,651
Monsieur LaPadite,

144
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,738
are you aware of the nickname the
people of France have given me?

145
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,870
I have no interest in such things.

146
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,540
But you are aware of
what they call me.

147
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,502
I'm aware.

148
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,047
What are you aware of?

149
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,098
(THANKING IN FRENCH)

150
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,394
That they call you
"The Jew Hunter."

151
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,395
Precisely.

152
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,107
I understand your trepidation
in repeating it.

153
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,485
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

154
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,196
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

155
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,999
Actually, why he
would hate the name

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,532
"the Hangman" is baffling to me.

157
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,042
It would appear he has done

158
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,994
everything in his
power to earn it.

159
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,331
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

160
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,791
precisely because I've earned it.

161
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,297
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,

162
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,050
as opposed to most
German soldiers,

163
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,135
I can think like a Jew

164
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,555
where they can only
think like a German.

165
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,642
More precisely, a German soldier.

166
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,711
Now, if one were to
determine what attribute

167
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:22,945
the German people
share with a beast,

168
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,074
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.

169
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,221
But if one were to determine what

170
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:31,370
attributes the Jews
share with a beast,

171
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,580
it would be that of the rat.

172
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,221
The Führer and
Goebbels' propaganda

173
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,212
have said pretty
much the same thing.

174
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,298
But where our conclusions differ,

175
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,426
is I don't consider the
comparison an insult.

176
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,766
Consider for a moment the
world a rat lives in.

177
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,811
It's a hostile world, indeed.

178
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,065
If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,

179
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,609
would you greet it with hostility?

180
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,404
I suppose I would.

181
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,800
Has a rat ever done
anything to you to

182
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:10,409
create this animosity
you feel toward them?

183
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,912
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.

184
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,250
Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.

185
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,961
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,

186
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,505
a squirrel could equally carry.

187
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,215
Would you agree?

188
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,967
(AGREES IN FRENCH)

189
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,636
Yet, I assume you don't share the
same animosity with squirrels

190
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,514
- that you do with rats, do you?
- No.

191
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,434
Yet, they're both
rodents, are they not?

192
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:39,521
And except for the tail, they even
rather look alike, don't they?

193
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,733
It's an interesting
thought, Herr Colonel.

194
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,485
However interesting as
the thought may be,

195
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,864
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.

196
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,245
If a rat were to walk in here,
right now, as I'm talking

197
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,250
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?

198
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,793
Probably not.

199
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,129
I didn't think so.

200
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,298
You don't like them.

201
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,300
You don't really know why
you don't like them.

202
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,094
All you know is you
find them repulsive.

203
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,391
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search

204
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,977
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.

205
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,480
Where does the hawk look?

206
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,775
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,

207
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,277
he looks everywhere he would hide.

208
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,534
But there are so
many places it would

209
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,407
never occur to a hawk to hide.

210
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,330
However, the reason the Führer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria

211
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,564
and placed me in
French cow country

212
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:42,834
today is because it
does occur to me.

213
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,464
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of

214
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,591
once they abandon dignity.

215
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,470
May I smoke my pipe as well?

216
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,684
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.

217
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:16,535
Now, my job dictates

218
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,543
that I must have my
men enter your home

219
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,382
and conduct a thorough search

220
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,219
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

221
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,982
And if there are any
irregularities to

222
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,890
be found, rest assured
they will be.

223
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,184
That is unless you have
something to tell me

224
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,271
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

225
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,606
I might add, also,
that any information

226
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,966
that makes the
performance of my duty

227
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,361
easier will not be
met with punishment.

228
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,741
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

229
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,576
And that reward will be,

230
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,412
your family will cease to
be harassed in any way

of the state, are you not?

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,353
Yes.

your floorboards, aren't you?

Yes.

where they're hiding.

any disturbance,

they don't speak English.

We're going to be dropped into
France dressed as civilians.

Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac

282

And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

291

evidence of our cruelty

292
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,131
in the disembowelled, dismembered

and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us.

294
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,512
And the German won't be
able to help themselves

295
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:13,308

brothers endured at our hands,

the edge of our knives.

297
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,149
And the German will
be sickened by us.

298
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,443
And the German will talk about us.

299
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,695
And the German will fear us.

their eyes at night

301

356
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,989
Hey, Hirschberg.

357
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,449
Send that Kraut sarge over.

358
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,034
You. Go.

359
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,820
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.

360
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,324
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.

361
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,909
You know what "sit
down" means, Werner?

362
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,786
- Yes.
- Then sit down.

363
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,583
How is your English, Werner?

364
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,259
Because if need be,
we got a couple

365
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,586
of fellows who can translate.

366
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,795
Wicki here,

367
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,551
an Austrian-Jew, got
the fuck out of

368
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:56,132
Munich while the getting was good.

369
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,094
Became American, got drafted, come
back to give you all what for.

370
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,306
Another one up there you
might be familiar with.

371
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,266
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

372
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,853
Heard of him?

373
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,899
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

374
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,495
The reason for Hugo
Stiglitz's celebrity

375
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,747
among German soldiers is simple.

376
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:33,461
As a German-enlisted man, he
killed 13 Gestapo officers.

377
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,770
Instead of putting him
up against a wall,

378
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,689
the High Command decided
to send him back to Berlin

379
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,233
to be made an example of.

380
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,530
Needless to say, once the
Basterds heard about him,

381
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,532
he never got there.

382
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,404
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

383
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,784
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.

384
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,536
Ever heard of us?

385
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,082
We just want to say we're
a big fan of your work.

386
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,417
When it comes to killing Nazis,

387
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,839
I think you show great talent.

388
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,718
And I pride myself for having
an eye for that kind of talent.

389
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,391
But your status as a Nazi
killer is still amateur.

390
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,437
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.

391
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,613
Can I assume you know who we are?

392
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,989
You're Aldo the Apache.

393
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,868
Werner, if you heard of us,

394
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,621
you probably heard we ain't in
the prisoner-taking business.

395
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,523
We in the killing Nazi business,

396
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:35,625
and, cousin, business
is a-booming.

397
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:36,959
Oh, yeah.

398
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,129
Now, that leaves two ways
we can play this out.

399
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,423
Either kill you or let you go.

400
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,051
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive

401
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,094
depends entirely on you.

402
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,143
Up the road a piece,
there's an orchard.

403
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,927
Besides you, we know
there's another Kraut

404
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:58,981
patrol fucking around
here somewhere.

405
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,984
If that patrol were to
have any crack shots,

406
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,029
that orchard would be a
goddamn sniper's delight.

407
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,575
So if you ever want to eat a
sauerkraut sandwich again,

408
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,497
you got to show me on this
here map where they are.

409
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,751
You got to tell me how many they
are, and you got to tell me

410
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,254
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.

411
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,985
You can't expect me to
divulge information

412
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:26,968
that would put German
lives in danger.

413
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,870
Well, now, Werner,
that's where you're

414
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:32,014
wrong, because that's
exactly what I expect.

415
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,976
I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.

416
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,229
And you need to tell me. And
you need to tell me right now.

417
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,982
Now, just take that
finger of yours

418
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,360
and point out on this here map
where this party is being held,

419
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,822
how many is coming and what
they brought to play with.

420
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,206
I respectfully refuse, sir.

421
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,876
Hear that?

422
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,254
Yes.

423
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,676
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.

424
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,679
You might know him
better by his nickname.

425
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,514
The Bear Jew.

426
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,723
Now, if you heard of
Aldo the Apache, you

427
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:18,644
got to have heard
about The Bear Jew.

428
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:21,689
- I heard of The Bear Jew.
- What did you hear?

429
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,192
Beats German soldiers with a club.

430
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,363
He bashes their brains in with
a baseball bat, what he does.

431
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,782
And, Werner, I'm going to ask
you one last goddamn time,

432
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,072
and if you still
respectfully refuse,

433
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:35,870
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.

434
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,872
He's going to take
that big bat of his,

435
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,083
and he's going to beat
your ass to death with it.

436
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,213
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,

437
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,300
and point out on this map
what I want to know.

438
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,726
Fuck you.

439
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,770
And your Jew dogs.

440
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,734
Actually, Werner, we're all
tickled to hear you say that.

441
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,694
Quite frankly, watching
Donny beat Nazis to death

442
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,656
is the closest we ever get to
going to the movies. Donny.

443
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,865
Yeah?

444
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,451
Got us a German here who
wants to die for country.

445
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,911
Oblige him.

446
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,980
Did you get that for killing Jews?

447
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,398
Bravery.

448
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,082
Yeah.

449
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,794
Oh, no.

450
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,087
Oh, no.

451
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,338
Donny.

452
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,048
Yeah, Donny.

my pants if I was you.

one over here. Alive.

up. You're on deck.

They let me go.

what happened here,

you can't tell them
you told us what

479
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,164
you told us. They'll shoot you.

They're going to want to know why
you so special, we let you live.

481

So tell them, we let
you live so you

482

could spread the word
through the ranks

anything. Not one word of detail.

and you got away.

Not one word more.

00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,584
Yes.

How is it a girl as young
as you owns a cinema?

533
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,591
My aunt left it to me.

534
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,677
Merci for hosting a German night.

535
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,138
I don't have a choice...

536
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,806
but you're welcome.

537
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,768
I love the Riefenstahl
mountain films...

538
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,144
especially Piz Palü.

539
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,814
It's nice to see a French girl
who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.

540
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,317
"Admire" would not really
be the word I would use...

541
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,278
to describe my feelings
towards Fräulein Riefenstahl.

542
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,491
But you do admire the
director Pabst, don't you?

543
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,119
That's why you include his
name on the marquee...

544
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,205
when you didn't have to.

545
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:28,383
I'm French. We respect
directors in our country.

546
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,385
Even Germans.

547
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,845
Even Germans, yes.

548
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,848

549
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,060

550
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,853

551

it's been a pleasure chatting
with a fellow cinema lover.

561

to stop pestering me.

I apologise, mademoiselle...

00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,015
I wasn't trying to be a pest.

575
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,643
I was simply trying
to be friendly.

576
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,853
I don't wish to be your friend.

I'm more than just a uniform.

Not to me.

581
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,451
If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend...

582
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,620

You're not just a German soldier.

Are you somebody's son?

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

603
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,613
I was alone in a bell tower
in a walled off city.

604
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,963
It was myself and
a thousand rounds

605

of ammo, in a bird's nest...

606
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,286
against three hundred
enemy soldiers.

607
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:08,955
What's a bird's nest?

608
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,795
A bird's nest is what a sniper
would call a bell tower.

609
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,672
It's a high structure, offering a

610
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,256
three hundred and
sixty degree view.

611
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,218

00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,432
Sixty-eight.

614
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,769
The first day.

615
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,314

617
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,655
Thirty-two the third day.

618
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,076
On the fourth day
they exited the city.

619
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,748
Naturally, my war story received
a lot of attention in Germany...

620
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,667
that's why they all recognise me.

621
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,337
They call me the
German Sergeant York.

622
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,257
Maybe they'll make a film
about your exploits.

623
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,345
Well, that's just what
Joseph Goebbels thought.

624
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,682
So he did and called
it "Nation's Pride."

625
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:14,438
And they wanted me
to play myself...

626
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,815
so I did.

627
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,818
Joseph thinks this movie will be
proven to be his masterpiece.

German Van Johnson.

01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,950
what the fuck are
we supposed to do?

892
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,455
It looks like we're supposed
to have a Nazi premiere.

893
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:53,125
Like I said, what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

894
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,631
Well, I need to talk
with you about that.

895
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,802
I'm confused, what are
we talking about?

896
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,139
Filling the cinema with Nazis and
burning it down to the ground.

897
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:08,474
I'm not talking about that.

898
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:09,975
You are talking about that.

899
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,144
No, we're talking about
that, right now.

900
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:16,649
If we can keep this place from
burning down by ourselves...

901
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,984
we can burn it down by ourselves?

902
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,239
Yes, Shosanna, we could do that.

903
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,242
And with Madame Mimieux's 350
nitrate film print collection...

904
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,512
we wouldn't even
need explosives...

905
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,497
would we?

906
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,667
You mean we wouldn't need
any more explosives?

907
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:39,338
At that time, 35 millimetre
nitrate film was so flammable

908
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,508
that you couldn't even bring
a reel onto a streetcar.

909
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,427
Hey, you can't bring those
here on a public vehicle.

910
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,928
- They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.

911
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,680
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.

912
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:51,684
Because nitrate film burns
three times faster than paper.

913
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,356
Shosanna has a collection

914
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:02,486
of over 350 nitrate film prints.

915
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,447
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

916
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,532
I am going to burn down
the cinema on Nazi night.

917
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,973
And if I'm going to
burn down the cinema...

918
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,124
which I am...

919
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,378
we both know, you're not going
to let me do it by myself.

920
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,551
Because you love me.
And I love you.

921
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,053
And you're the only person
on this earth I can trust.

922
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,725
But that's not all
we're going to do.

923
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,229
Does the film-making equipment
in the attic still work?

924
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,191
I know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?

925
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,567
Quite well, actually.

926
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,429
I recorded a new
guitarist I met in

927
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,238
a cafe last week. It works superb.

928
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,409
Why do we need
film-making equipment?

929
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,292
Because Marcel, my sweet...

930
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,252
we're going to make a film.

931
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,048
Just for the Nazis.

932
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,593
Chapter Four

933
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,929
OPERATION KINO

934
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,143
Right this way, Lieutenant.

935
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:39,041
Lieutenant Archie
Hicox reporting, sir.

936
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,961
General Ed Fenech. At ease, Hicox.

937
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,963
Drink?

938
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,852
If you offer me a
scotch and plain water,

939
01:04:47,853 --> 01:04:49,927
I could drink a scotch
and plain water.

940
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,622
That-a-boy, Lieutenant. Make it

941
01:04:51,623 --> 01:04:53,597
yourself like a good
chap, will you?

942
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,641
The bar is in the globe.

943
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,106
Something for yourself, sir?

944
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,359
Whiskey. Straight. No junk in it.

945
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,572
It says here that you
speak German fluently.

946
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,615
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

947
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,224
And your occupation
before the war?

948
01:05:14,225 --> 01:05:15,619
I'm a film critic.

949
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:20,124
- List your accomplishments.
- Well, sir, such as they are,

950
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,215
I write reviews and articles for a

951
01:05:22,216 --> 01:05:24,753
publication called
Films and Film-makers,

952
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,298
and I've had two books published.

953
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:31,176
Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?

954
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:32,303
The first book was called

955
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,681
Art of the Eyes, the
Heart and the Mind:

956
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:36,807
A Study of German
Cinema in the '20s.

957
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,769
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci.

958
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,619
It's a sub textual film
criticism study of

959
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,191
the work of German
director G.W. Pabst.

960
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:49,653
- What should we drink to, sir?
- Well...

961
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:54,241
- Down with Hitler.
- All the way down, sir.

962
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:55,826
Yes.

963
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:03,709
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

964
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,617
Yes. Obviously, I
haven't seen any of

965
01:06:07,618 --> 01:06:09,798
the films made in the
last three years,

966
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:13,218
- but I'm familiar with it.
- Explain it to me.

967
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,970
Pardon, sir?

968
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,283
Well, this little
escapade of ours requires

969
01:06:17,284 --> 01:06:19,308
a knowledge of the
German film industry

970
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:24,563
under the Third Reich. Explain
to me UFA under Goebbels.

971
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,109
Goebbels considers the
films he's making

972
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:32,404
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.

973
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,531
An alternative to
what he considers

974
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,576
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,

975
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,996
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

976
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,623
How's he doing?

977
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,751
Frightfully sorry,
sir. Once again?

978
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,798
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

979
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,802
Well, compared to,
say, Louis B. Mayer,

980
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,264
- how's he doing?
- Quite well, actually.

981
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,517
Since Goebbels has taken over,

982
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,902
film attendance has
steadily risen in

983
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:06,021
Germany over the last eight years.

984
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:09,566
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

985
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:13,445
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

986
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:19,284
Brief him.

987
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:22,121
Lieutenant Hicox, at
this point and time

988
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:24,623
I'd like to brief you
on Operation Kino.

989
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,333
Three days from now

990
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,851
Joseph Goebbels is
throwing a gala premiere

991
01:07:28,852 --> 01:07:30,754
of one of his new movies in Paris.

992
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:31,864
What film, sir?

993
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:34,758
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

994
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:39,054
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

995
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,256
will be Goebbels, Göring, Bormann,

996
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:43,559
and most of the
German High Command

997
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,630
including all high
ranking officers

998
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:47,396
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

999
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,899
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

1000
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,068
The master race at play?

1001
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:57,322
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.

1002
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,992
The objective of Operation Kino,

1003
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,661
blow up the basket.

1004
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:07,499
And like the snows of yesteryear,
gone from this earth.

1005
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,043
Jolly good, sir.

1006
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:14,339
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

1007
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:15,966
will be your assist.

1008
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,970
The Germans call
them the Basterds.

1009
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,682
The Basterds. Never heard of them.

1010
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,685
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.

1011
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,937
But the Jerries have
heard of them, because

1012
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,773
these Yanks have
been them the devil.

1013
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,384
You'll be dropped
into France, about

1014
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:35,569
24 kilometres outside of Paris.

1015
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:37,738
The Basterds will
be waiting for you.

1016
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:41,116
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.

1017
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:44,495
In Nadine, there's a tavern
called La Louisiane.

1018
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,292
There you'll rendezvous
with our double

1019
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:47,748
agent. She'll take it from there.

1020
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,958
She's the one who is going to
get you into the premiere.

1021
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,568
It'll be you, her, and two

1022
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:53,796
German-born members
of the Basterds.

1023
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,257
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.

1024
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,301
How will I know her?

1025
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,638
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

1026
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,490
Your contact is Bridget
von Hammersmark.

1027
01:09:06,491 --> 01:09:08,227
Bridget von Hammersmark?

1028
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,481
The German movie star
is working for England?

1029
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,150
Yes, for the last two years now.

1030
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,737
One could even say that Operation
Kino was her brainchild.

1031
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,156
- Indeed.
- Got the gist?

1032
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,909
I think so, sir. Paris
when it sizzles.

1033
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,996
The village of Nadine

1034
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,504
You didn't say the goddamn

1035
01:09:29,505 --> 01:09:31,583
rendezvous is in a
fucking basement.

1036
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,503
- I didn't know.
- You said it was in a tavern.

1037
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,256
- It is a tavern.
- Yeah, in a basement.

1038
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:40,759
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

1039
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:44,179
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.

1040
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,098
What if we go in there and
she's not even there?

1041
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,432
We wait.

1042
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:52,354
Don't worry. She's a British
spy. She'll make the rendezvous.

1043
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:17,296
- Stiglitz, right?
- That's right, sir.

1044
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,133
I hear you're pretty
good with that.

1045
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,973
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

1046
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:31,810
Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.

1047
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:38,483
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,

1048
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,654
I need to know we can
all remain calm.

1049
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,827
I don't look calm to you?

1050
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:56,668
Well, now that you put it
like that, I guess you do.

1051
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,545
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not

1052
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:17,522
exactly the loquacious
type, is he?

1053
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,111
Is that the kind of man you
need? Loquacious type?

1054
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,366
Fair point, Lieutenant.

1055
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,454
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?

1056
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,706
Make bets on how it all comes out?

1057
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:39,127
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

1058
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:43,548
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

1059
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:47,803
no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.

1060
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,975
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.

1061
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:56,084
Speaking of Frau von
Hammersmark, whose

1062
01:11:56,085 --> 01:11:59,022
idea was it for the
death-trap rendezvous?

1063
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:03,151
- She chose the spot.
- Isn't that just dandy?

1064
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:07,155
Look, she's not a military
strategist. She's just an actress.

1065
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,424
You don't got to be
Stonewall Jackson to

1066
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,410
know you don't want to
fight in a basement.

1067
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,495
She wasn't picking
a place to fight.

1068
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,415
She was picking a place
isolated and without Germans.

1069

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1070
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,251
So, I'm male...

1071
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,586
I'm a fictional, literary
character from the past...

1072
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,589
I'm American, and
that's controversial.

1073
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,926
No, it's not controversial at all.

1074
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,677
The nationality of the
author has nothing to

1075
01:12:30,678 --> 01:12:32,931
do with the nationality
of the character.

1076
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,600
The character is the character.

1077
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:38,270
Hamlet is not British.
He is Danish.

1078
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:42,107
So yes, this character
was born in America.

1079
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,191
Well then.

1080
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,445
Mathilda.

If I had a wife...

1088
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,823
would she be called a squaw?

1089
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,041
Yes.

1090
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,125
He's got it.

1091
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,461
Three more questions.

1092
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:03,745
Is my blood brother
Old Shatterhand?

1093
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:04,746
Yes.

1094
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,881
Did Karl May write me?

1095
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,049
Yes.

1096
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,216
So who are you?

1097
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,053
I am "Winnetou," chief
of the Apaches.

1098
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:12,596
Yes.

1099
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,723
That was good. That was
good. That was good.

1100
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,308
Now down with the glasses.

goodbye to my five
new friends here.

No hurry, Frau von

just over here waiting.

1117
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,993
it would appear the drinks
are on the Fräulein.

1118
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,779
- What would you like?
- Whiskey.

1119
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,947
Two whiskeys.

1120
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:14,324
- Three whiskeys.
- Three whiskeys, very well.

- Same to you.
- I thank you.

Your card.

1125
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:23,708
Yes, you're right.

1126
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,044
Let's see.

1127
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,048
Genghis Khan. I would
never have gotten that.

1128
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,466
But of course you would have.

1129
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,717
Hello, darling.

1130
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,179

01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,392

I thought this place was supposed
to have more French than Germans?

Yes, normally that's true.

1135
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,578
The Sergeant over there's
wife just had a baby.

1136
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,898
And his commanding
officer gave him and

1137
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,417
his mates the night
off to celebrate.

1138
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,420
We should leave.

1139
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,172
No.

1140
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:11,840
We should stay.

1141
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,425
For one drink at least.

1142
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,510
I've been waiting
for you in a bar.

1143
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,014

left before we had a drink.

and enjoy your whiskey.

There's some new development.

The cinema venue has changed.

1169
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:29,000
Why?

1170
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,086
No one knows but that should
not be a real problem.

1171
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,152
The cinema it's been changed to is

1172
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:34,673
considerably smaller
than The Ritz.

1173
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,328
So whatever explosives
you brought for The

effective here.

This is an officer's table.

1212
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:49,057
I suggest you stop
pestering the Fräulein...

1213
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,643
and rejoin your table.

1214
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,278
Excuse me, Captain, but your
accent is very unusual.

Where are you from?

1216
01:19:09,537 --> 01:19:12,747
You must be either completely
drunk or mad to dare...

I was born in a village that rests
in the shadow of the Piz Palü.

1235
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,252
- The mountain?
- Yes.

1236
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,755
In that village, we
all speak like this.

1237
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,634
Have you seen the
Riefenstahl film?

1238
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,595
- Yes.
- Then you saw me.

1239
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:55,266
You remember the
skiing torch scene?

1240
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,144
Yes.

1241
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:02,209
In that scene was
myself, my father,

1242
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:04,776
my sister and my two brothers.

1243
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,112
My brother is so handsome...

1244
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:12,116
the director Pabst,
gave him a Close-Up.

1245
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:16,412
Herr Major, if my word
means anything...

1246
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:20,959
I can vouch for everything the
young Captain has just said.

1247
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,963
He does hail from the
bottom of the Piz Palü.

1248
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:30,176
He was in the film and his brother
is far more handsome than he.

1249
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,188
You should rejoin your friends.

1250
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,443
May I join you?

1251
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:48,611
By all means.

1252
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,780
Wunderbar.

1253
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,666
So that's the source of
your bizarre accent.

1254
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,210
That's extraordinary.

1255
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,962
What are you doing here?

1256
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:09,340
Aside from having a drink
with the lovely Fräulein?

1257
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,969
Well, that pleasure
requires no explanation.

1258
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,388
I mean in country.

1259
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:19,809
You're obviously not stationed in
France or I'd know who you are.

1260
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,353
You know every German in France?

1261
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,272
Worth knowing.

1262
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,280
Well, there lies the problem.

1263
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,574
We never claimed to
be worth knowing.

1264
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,493
All levity aside, what
are you doing in France?

1265
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:42,165
Attending Minister Goebbels' film
premiere as the Fräulein's escort.

1266
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,961
You are the Fräulein
Hammersmark's escort.

1267
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,965
Someone has to carry her lighter.

1268
01:22:56,889 --> 01:23:00,266
The Captain is my date, but
all three are my guests.

1269
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:02,518
We are old friends...

1270
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,604
who go back a long time.

1271
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:10,360
Actually, longer than an
actress would care to admit.

1272
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:14,864
Well, in that case...

1273
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:18,368
let me raise my glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.

1274
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,453
I'll drink to that.

1275
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,332
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1276
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:25,667
Queen Christina.

1277
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,839
Mata Hari.

1278
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:37,720
I must say...

1279
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:40,390
that game they're playing
looks like a good bit of fun.

1280
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,434
I didn't join them because
you're quite right, Captain.

1281
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:46,270
An officer should not
fraternise with enlisted men.

1282
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:48,940
But...

1283
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,150
seeing as we are all officers...

1284
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,404
and sophisticated lady
friends of officers.

1285
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:55,988
What say we play the game?

1286
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,616
Yes, great, one game.

1287
01:23:58,867 --> 01:23:59,909
Wunderbar.

1288
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:03,454
Soldiers...

1289
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,123
the cards.

1290
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,501
Thank you.

1291
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:11,546
So gentlemen...

1292
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,799
the object of the game is to...

1293
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,677
write the name of a famous
person on your card.

1294
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:19,929
Real or fictitious,
doesn't matter.

1295
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,849
For instance, you could write,
Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.

1296
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,308
Eric. More pens.

1297
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,477
And they must be famous,
not aunt Frida.

1298
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,480
When you finish writing, put the
card face down on the table.

1299
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,941
And move it to the
person on your right...

1300
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:33,234
Thanks.

1301
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,361
The person to your left
moves his card to you.

1302
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,780
You pick up the card
without looking at it...

1303
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,240
lick the back...

1304
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,077
and stick it on your forehead.

1305
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:58,468
Write.

1306
01:24:58,552 --> 01:24:59,594
Write.

1307
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,575
I'll start, give you the idea.

1308
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:26,621
Am I German?

1309
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:27,997
- No.
- No.

1310
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:29,457
Am I American?

1311
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:30,666
- No.
- No.

1312
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,001
Wait a minute, he goes to...

1313
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:35,797
Obviously, he wasn't
born in America.

1314
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,925
So... I visited America, aye?

1315
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,218
Yes.

1316
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:43,596
Was this visit fortuitous?

1317
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:45,473
Not for you.

1318
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:50,895
My native land, is it what
one would call, exotic?

1319
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,380
(VON HAMMERSMARK AND
HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN)

1320
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:53,423
- Yes.
- Yes.

1321
01:25:55,943 --> 01:26:00,822
That could be either a reference
to the jungle or the Orient.

1322
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,020
I'm going to let my
first instinct take

1323
01:26:04,021 --> 01:26:05,284
over and ask. Am I
from the jungle?

1324
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:06,494
- Yes.
- Yes.

1325
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,473
Now gentlemen, around
this time you could

1326
01:26:08,474 --> 01:26:10,039
ask whether you're
real or fictitious.

1327
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:13,125
I, however, think that's too
easy, so I won't ask that yet.

1328
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:14,836
Okay...

1329
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,171
my native land is the jungle...

1330
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,465
I visited America...

1331
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,176
but my visit was not
fortuitous to me...

1332
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:26,639
but the implication is that
it was to somebody else.

1333
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:32,854
When I went...

1334
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:36,482
from the jungle to America...

1335
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:40,653
did I go by boat?

1336
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:41,779
- Yes.
- Yes.

1337
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,116
Did I go against my will?

1338
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,242
- Yes.
- Yes.

1339
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:52,081
On this boat ride,
was I in chains?

1340
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,416
Yes.

1341
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,085
When I arrived in America,
was I displayed in chains?

1342
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:57,211
- Yes.
- Yes.

1343
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:58,596
Am I the story of the
Negro in America?

(HICOX SPEAKING GERMAN)

1345
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:00,756
No.

1346
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:01,924
Well then I must be King Kong.

1347

Bravo.

1348
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,221
Impressive.

1349
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:10,064
Now, since I answered
correctly, you

1350
01:27:10,065 --> 01:27:11,475
all need to finish your drinks.

Cheers.

1352
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:19,859
Now, who is next?

1353
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:21,819
Well, Major...

1354
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:29,076
I don't mean to be rude. But the
four of us are very good friends.

1355
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,913
And we haven't seen each
other in quite a while.

1356
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,583
So, Major...

1357
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:37,293
I am afraid...

1358
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,629
you are intruding.

1359
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,758
I beg to differ, Captain.

1360
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:48,284
It's only if the
Fräulein considers

1361
01:27:48,285 --> 01:27:50,473
my presence an intrusion...

1362
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:52,975
that I become an intruder.

1363
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,198

It's simply the Captain
is immune to my charms.

1367
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,340
I am just joking.

1368
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:29,011
Just joking. Of
course I'm intruding.

glasses, gentlemen,

You don't want to contaminate
the thirty-three

1377
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:49,657
with the swill you were drinking.

1378
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:50,866

01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,243
- Five.
- Not for me.

doesn't like me.

yourself away, Captain.

walk out that door with us.

1409
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,072
No, no, no, no, no,
no. I don't think so.

1410
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,048
I'm afraid you and I...

1411
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,384
we both know, Captain...

1412
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:17,054
no matter what happens to
anybody else in this room...

1413
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:20,057
the two of us aren't
going anywhere.

1414
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:27,565
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm
and his famous friends.

1415
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:32,069
If any of you expect to live,
you'll have to shoot them too.

1416
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:36,740
Looks like little Max
will grow up an orphan.

1417
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:39,410
How sad.

1418
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,085
Well, if this is it, old boy,

1419
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:51,630
I hope you don't mind if I
go out speaking the King's.

1420
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,675
By all means, Captain.

1421
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,703
There's a special
rung in hell reserved

1422
01:32:02,704 --> 01:32:04,351
for people who waste good Scotch.

1423
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,606
Seeing as I may be rapping
on the door momentarily,

1424
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:17,281
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

1425
01:32:20,619 --> 01:32:23,454
Now, about this pickle

1426
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,790
we find ourselves in.

1427
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:32,296
It would appear there's only
one thing left for you to do.

1428
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,298
And what would that be?

1429
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:35,592
Stiglitz.

1430
01:32:35,593 --> 01:32:37,468
Say auf Wiedersehen
to your Nazi balls.

1431
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,006
You outside. Who are you?

1432
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,217
British? American?

1433
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,094
What?

1434
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:22,429
We're American.

1435
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:24,181
What are you?

1436
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:26,517
I'm a German, you idiot.

1437
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:29,520
Speak English pretty
good for a German.

1438
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:30,854
I agree.

1439
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,607
So let's talk.

1440
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,734
Okay, talk.

1441
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:37,903
I'm a father.

1442
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:42,074
My baby was born
today. In Frankfurt.

1443
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:44,118
Five hours ago.

1444
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:48,998
His name is Max. We were in
here drinking, celebrating.

1445
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:51,753
They're the ones that
came in shooting

1446
01:33:51,754 --> 01:33:53,294
and killing. It's not my fault.

1447
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,462
Okay. It wasn't your fault.

1448
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,674
What's your name, soldier?

1449
01:33:58,758 --> 01:33:59,967
Wilhelm.

1450
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:04,388
Now, is there anybody
alive on our side?

1451
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,223
- No.
- I'm alive.

1452
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:07,766
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

1453
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,852
Who's that?

1454
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,648
Is the girl on your side?

1455
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:17,443
Which girl?

1456
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:19,945
Who do you think? Von Hammersmark.

1457
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:22,656
Yeah, she's ours.

1459
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:25,242
Is she okay?

(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

1463
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,166
She's been shot.

1464
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,752
But she's alive.

1465
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,378
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1466
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,174
Okay, Wilhelm.

1467
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:43,594
What do you say we make us a deal?

1468
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:46,347
What's your name?

1469
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:47,473
Aldo.

1470
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,601
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.

1471
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:54,521
You let me and one of my men come
down there and take the girl away.

1472
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:57,149
No guns. No guns me, no guns you.

1473
01:34:57,233 --> 01:35:00,778
And we take the girl and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.

1474
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,614
You go your way, we go ours.

1475
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,575
And little Max gets to grow up
playing catch with his daddy.

1476
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,621
So what do you say,
Willi? We got us a deal?

1477
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:16,126
Aldo.

1478
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,004
I'm here, Willi.

1479
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,424
I want to trust you.

1480
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:23,634
But...

1481
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:26,095
But how can I?

1482
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:30,307
What choice you got, son?

1483
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,190
Okay, okay.

1484
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:40,984
Aldo,

1485
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,695
I'm going to trust you.

1486
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:45,614
Come down.

1487
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:03,114
Hey, Willi, what's
with the machine

1488
01:36:03,115 --> 01:36:04,550
gun? I thought we had us a deal?

1489
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:06,885
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.

1490
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,512
Not so fast.

1491
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:11,181
We only got a deal,
we trust each other.

1492
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:12,891
And a Mexican stand-off
ain't trust.

1493
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,978
You need guns on me for it
to be a Mexican stand-off.

1494
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:19,773
You got guns on us. You
decide to shoot, we're dead.

1495
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:23,152
Up top, they got grenades. They
drop them down here, you're dead.

1496
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:25,612
That's a Mexican stand-off,
and that was not the deal.

1497
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:27,364
No trust, no deal.

1498

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1499
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:44,840
All right, Aldo.

1500
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:47,593
Fine.

1501
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:54,433
Just take that fucking traitor,
and get her out of my sight.

(VON HAMMERSMARK GROANING)

1503
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:09,948
Not so goddamn fast, Doc. Tell
him to go play with his dogs.

01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:11,533
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1505
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:23,976
Before we yank that slug out you,

1506
01:37:23,977 --> 01:37:26,048
you need to answer
a few questions.

1507
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:27,925
Few questions about what?

1508
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:30,594
About I got three men
dead back there.

1509
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,472
Why don't you try telling
us what the fuck happened?

1510
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:35,572
The British officer
blew his German

1511
01:37:35,573 --> 01:37:37,476
act and the Gestapo Major saw it.

1512
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,812
Before we get into who shot John,

1513
01:37:41,648 --> 01:37:43,814
why'd you invite my
men to a rendezvous

1514
01:37:43,815 --> 01:37:45,817
in a basement with
a bunch of Nazis?

1515
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:53,158
I can see since you didn't
see what happened inside,

1516
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:55,911
that the Nazis being
there must look odd.

1517
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:58,497
Yeah, we got a word for that
kind of odd in English.

1518
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,582
It's called suspicious.

1519
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:06,672
Everybody needs to calm down.

1520
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,424
You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.

1521
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:13,762
You met the Sergeant
yourself. Willi.

1522
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:15,681
You remember him, don't you?

1523
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:16,807
Yeah, I remember him.

1524
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:20,602
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...

1525
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:22,396
He had just become a father.

1526
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,346
His commanding
officer gave him and

1527
01:38:24,347 --> 01:38:26,316
his mates the night
off to celebrate.

1528
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:32,702
The Germans being
there was either a

1529
01:38:32,703 --> 01:38:35,951
trap set by me or a
tragic coincidence.

1530
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,744
It couldn't be both.

1531
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:49,881
How'd the shooting start?

1532
01:38:49,966 --> 01:38:52,467
The Englishman gave himself away.

1533
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:54,177
How'd he do that?

1534
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:57,639
He ordered three glasses.

1535
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,726
We order three glasses.

1536
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:02,894
That's the German three.

1537
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,564
The other looks odd.

1538
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,525
Germans would and did notice it.

1539
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,244
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans

1540
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:21,913
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

1541
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,915
What was the next step?

1542
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,375
Tuxedos.

1543
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:28,795
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

1544
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,673
with all the military there
would've been suicide.

1545
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:36,928
But going as members of
the German film industry,

1546
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:40,515
they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else.

1547
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:45,187
I arranged for the tailor to
fit three tuxedos tonight.

1548
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,815
How'd you intend to get
them in that premiere?

1549
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,525
Hand me my purse.

1550
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,788
Lieutenant Hicox was
going as my escort.

1551
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:05,882
The other two were going as a

1552
01:40:05,883 --> 01:40:08,126
German cameraman
and his assistant.

1553
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:10,962
You still get us in that premiere?

1554
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,174
You speak German better
than your friends? No.

1555
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,802
Have I been shot? Yes.

1556
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,445
I don't see me tripping the light

1557
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:22,182
fantastique up a red
carpet anytime soon.

1558
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,644
Least of all, by tomorrow night.

1559
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:41,827
However, there's something
you don't know.

1560
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:46,339
There've been two
recent developments

1561
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,999
regarding Operation Kino.

1562
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:52,424
One, the venue has
been changed from

1563
01:40:52,425 --> 01:40:54,840
The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

1564
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:58,593
Enormous change at the last
minute? That's not very Germatic.

1565
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:01,638
Why the hell is Goebbels doing
stuff so damn peculiar?

1566
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:05,434
It probably has something to do
with the second development.

1567
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:07,060
Which is?

1568
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:13,984
Der Führer is attending
the premiere.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1570
01:41:15,278 --> 01:41:16,528
I've been rethinking
my position...

1571
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:24,327
in regards to your Paris
premiere of "Nation's Pride."

1572
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:27,706
As the weeks have gone on...

1573
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,209
and the Americans
are on the beach...

1574
01:41:32,712 --> 01:41:35,213
I do find myself thinking
more and more...

1575
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:37,340
about this Private Zoller.

1576
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:40,802
This boy has done something
tremendous for us.

1577
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,847
And I'm beginning to think...

1578
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:48,018
my participation in this
event could be meaningful.

1579
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:50,353
Fuck a duck.

1580
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:00,864
What are you thinking?

1581
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,284
I'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old Uncle Adolf

1582
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:06,286
makes this horse a
different colour.

1583
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,038
What is that supposed to mean?

1584
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,040
It means you getting
us in that premiere.

1585
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:13,043
I'm probably going to
end up losing this leg.

1586
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,046
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.

1587
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,882
How do you expect me to
walk the red carpet?

1588
01:42:21,177 --> 01:42:24,137
Doggy Doc's going to dig
that slug out your gam.

1589
01:42:24,222 --> 01:42:26,248
He's going to wrap
it up in a cast,

1590
01:42:26,249 --> 01:42:28,475
and you got a good "how I broke
my leg mountain climbing" story.

1591
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:29,797
That's German, ain't it? You all

1592
01:42:29,798 --> 01:42:31,228
like climbing
mountains, don't you?

1593
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:34,564
I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.

1594
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:36,525
But I see your point.

1595
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:40,237
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

1596
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:43,573
and just limp your little
ass up that rouge carpet.

1597
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:48,411
I know this is a silly
question before I ask it,

1598
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:53,875
but can you Americans speak any
other language than English?

1599
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:56,920
We both speak a little Italian.

1600
01:42:57,046 --> 01:42:59,548
With an atrocious
accent, no doubt.

1601
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:04,761
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.

1602
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:08,390
Germans don't have a
good ear for Italian.

1603
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:16,106
So you mumble Italian and brazen
through it. Is that the plan?

1604
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:17,941
That's about it.

1605
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:22,863
That sounds good.

1606
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:25,282
It sounds like shit. What else
are we going to do? Go home?

1607
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:27,242
No, that sounds good.

1608
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:31,955
If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.

1609
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:34,040
Who does what?

1610
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:38,295
Well, I speak the most Italian,
so I'll be your escort.

1611
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:41,464
Donowitz speaks second most, so
he'll be your Italian cameraman.

1612
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:44,551
Omar, third most. He'll
be Donny's assistant.

1613
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:46,219
I don't speak Italian.

1614
01:43:46,304 --> 01:43:49,723
Like I said, third best. Just
keep your fucking mouth shut.

1615
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:51,441
In fact, why don't you start
practising right now?

1616
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:55,395
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1617
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:00,817
You've moved up in the world.

1618
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,988
Look at you, Lieutenant
First Class.

1619
01:44:06,324 --> 01:44:10,327
And with your record of
insubordination. Truly remarkable.

1620
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:16,833
And that one's name is...

1621
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:18,001
Wilhelm Wicki.

1622
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,671
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who
immigrated to the United States...

1623
01:44:21,923 --> 01:44:24,841
when things began turning
sour for the Israelites.

1624
01:44:24,967 --> 01:44:27,677
They are the two German-born
members of the Basterds.

1625
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:32,182
They've been known to don German
uniforms, to ambush squads.

1626
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:33,600
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1627
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:34,918
What brings you all
the way out here?

1628
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:41,524
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1629
01:44:41,651 --> 01:44:42,817
But that doesn't look like this.

1630
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:46,780
This is odd.

1631
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:04,297
It would appear
somebody's missing.

1632
01:45:05,174 --> 01:45:06,549
Somebody fashionable.

1633
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:09,386
Everybody out.

1634
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:24,150
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1635
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:26,069
"To Max, with love."

1636
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:33,326
Bridget von Hammersmark.

Chapter Five

1638
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:48,341
REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE

1639
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:54,597
Night of "NATION'S PRIDE" premiere

1640
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:19,432
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1641
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:20,600
Remember... in English.

1642
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:21,810
Yes.

1643
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:23,645
Action.

1644
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:25,188
But how do we get it developed?

1645
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:29,025
Only a suicidal idiot like us
would develop that footage.

1646
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:31,861
And suppose someone would
develop the footage...

1647
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,947
how do we get a 35mm
print with a soundtrack?

1648
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,115
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1649
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,561
We find somebody who
can develop and

1650
01:47:36,562 --> 01:47:38,034
process a 35mm print
with a soundtrack.

1651
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:39,869
And we make them do it...

1652
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:41,663
or we kill them.

1653
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:45,875
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1654
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,960
Bring that fucker over here. Put
his head down on that table.

1655
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:50,046
You either do what the
fuck we tell you...

1656
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:51,714
or I'll bury this axe in
your collaborating skull.

1657
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:52,798
(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH)

1658
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:53,882
I'm not a collaborator.

1659
01:47:53,883 --> 01:47:55,508
Marcel, do his wife and
children know you?

1660
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:56,553
Yes.

1661
01:47:56,637 --> 01:47:59,055
Then after we kill this
dog for the Germans...

1662
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:00,974
we'll go and silence them.

1663
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:41,407
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1664
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:42,825
Jannings, come on, show the ring.

1665
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,160
Come on, come on. There you go.

1666
01:49:45,246 --> 01:49:47,284
Fredrick, have a look
at it. This is the

1667
01:49:47,285 --> 01:49:49,123
highest artistic
honour that I give.

1668
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,997
Herr Doctor, I'm also
feeling very honoured.

1669
01:49:50,998 --> 01:49:52,335
You deserve it, my dear Jannings.

1670
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:55,838
But I believe after the premiere
today, we have a new candidate.

1671
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,443
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1672
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:18,653
Ah, Emmanuelle...

1673
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:22,949
I'd like you to meet the
greatest actor in the world...

1674
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:24,450
Emil Jannings.

1675
01:50:24,535 --> 01:50:25,618
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1676
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:28,371
Mademoiselle, I'm
pleased to meet you.

1677
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:29,956
You have a beautiful cinema.

1678
01:50:41,677 --> 01:50:42,719
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1679
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:43,886
Thank you, Hermann.

1680
01:51:07,911 --> 01:51:08,995
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1681
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:10,371
Fräulein von Hammersmark.

1682
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:15,501
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1683
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:16,711
Colonel Landa, it's been years.

1684
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:19,547
Dashing as ever, I see.

1685
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,510
So what's happened
to your lovely leg?

1686
01:51:25,262 --> 01:51:29,724
A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

1687
01:51:30,392 --> 01:51:32,435
Save your flattery, you old dog.

1688
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:34,920
I know too many of your former

1689
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:37,565
conquests to fall
into that honey pot.

1690
01:51:37,858 --> 01:51:39,108
Seriously, what happened?

1691
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:43,738
Well, I tried my hand,
foolishly I might add...

1692
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:46,532
at mountain climbing.

1693
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:49,118
And this is the result.

1694
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:50,286
Mountain climbing?

1695
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:52,455
That's how you injured your
leg, mountain climbing?

1696
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:54,207
Believe it or not, yes it is.

1697
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:21,484
Forgive me, Fräulein. I don't
mean to laugh at your misfortune.

1698
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,319
It's just... mountain climbing?

1699
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:27,323
I'm curious, Fräulein, what
could have ever compelled

1700
01:52:27,408 --> 01:52:29,659
you to undertake such a
foolhardy endeavour?

1701
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:34,914
Well, I shan't be doing it
again, I can tell you that.

1702
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:38,751
That cast looks as fresh
as my old Uncle Gustav.

1703
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:41,963
When were you climbing
this mountain, last night?

1704
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:44,841
Very good eye, Colonel.

1705
01:52:45,843 --> 01:52:47,510
It happened yesterday morning.

1706
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:49,929
And where in Paris
is this mountain?

1707
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:56,185
No, I'm just teasing
you, Fräulein.

1708
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:59,147
You know me, I tease rough.

1709
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:00,940
So, who are your three
handsome escorts?

1710
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,362
I'm afraid neither three
speak a word of German.

1711
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,823
They're friends of
mine from Italy.

1712
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:15,121
This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi.

1713
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:19,834
A very talented cameraman,
Antonio Margheriti.

1714
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:24,338
And Antonio's camera
assistant Dominick Decocco.

1716
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:31,721
Gentlemen, this is an old friend,
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

1717
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:33,389
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1718
01:53:33,474 --> 01:53:34,557
Hello.

1719
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,726
Gentlemen, it's a pleasure...

1720
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:39,103
the friends of our cherished
star, admired by all of us,

1721
01:53:39,188 --> 01:53:40,938
this outright jewel
of our culture...

1722
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:43,381
are naturally going to
be under my personal

1723
01:53:43,382 --> 01:53:45,359
protection for the
duration of their stay.

1724
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:49,989
Thank you.

1725
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:51,991
Gorlomi?

1726
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:53,784
Am I saying it correctly?

1727
01:53:55,162 --> 01:53:56,829
Yes, correct.

1728
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,498
Gorlomi?

1729
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:01,250
Say it for me once please?

1730
01:54:02,377 --> 01:54:03,544
Gorlomi.

1731
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:05,796
I'm sorry, again?

1732
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:08,257
Gorlomi.

1733
01:54:08,342 --> 01:54:09,717
Once more?

1734
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:13,846
Gorlomi.

1735
01:54:13,931 --> 01:54:15,014
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1736
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:16,599
What's your name again?

1737
01:54:16,934 --> 01:54:18,851
Antonio Margheriti.

1738
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:21,229
Again?

1739
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:22,939
Margheriti.

1740
01:54:23,232 --> 01:54:27,026
One more time, but let me
really hear the music in it.

1741
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:30,112
Margheriti.

1742
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:31,697
Margheriti.

1743
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:32,907
And you?

1744
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:34,116
Dominick Decocco.

Well, my two cameraman friends
need to find their seats.

1751
01:54:41,917 --> 01:54:43,459
Let me see your tickets.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1753
01:54:46,421 --> 01:54:47,797
I suppose you getting
premiere tickets

1754
01:54:47,881 --> 01:54:50,049
for your friends wouldn't be

01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:40,785
Let's go over it again.

1767
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:44,288
Reel one is on the
first projector.

1768
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:46,457
Reel two...

1769
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:47,583
is on the second.

1770
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,835
The third one is on the spool.

1771
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,423
And the fourth one is ready to go.

1772
01:56:57,177 --> 01:56:58,803
Okay, the big sniper
battle in the film...

1773
01:56:59,137 --> 01:57:01,389
begins around the middle
of the third reel.

1774
01:57:02,265 --> 01:57:04,308
Our film comes in
on the fourth reel.

Somewhere towards the end
of the third reel...

1776
01:57:07,104 --> 01:57:08,671
go down and lock the
doors of the auditorium.

1777
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:11,565
Then take your place behind the
screen and wait for my cue.

1778
01:57:14,194 --> 01:57:15,653

to toast "Nation's Pride."

1789
01:57:50,355 --> 01:57:53,149

Put your foot in my lap.

1802

Hans, you embarrass me.

1803
01:59:22,072 --> 01:59:26,909
Could you please reach into the
right pocket of my coat...

1804
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:28,786
and give me what
you find in there.

02:02:26,798 --> 02:02:29,174
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.

1830
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:32,928
Alas, you're now in
the hands of the SS.

1831
02:02:33,013 --> 02:02:34,555
My hands to be exact.

1832
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:38,350
And they've been waiting a
long time to touch you.

1833
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:44,023
Caught you flinching.

1834
02:02:48,236 --> 02:02:50,446
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.

- Utivich?
- Is that you, Lieutenant?

Yeah.

happened to Donny?

- The woman?
- No, I do not.

1840
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:06,980
Tell me, Aldo, if I were
sitting where you're sitting,

1841
02:04:07,065 --> 02:04:09,024
would you show me mercy?

1842
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:14,738
Nope.

1843
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:18,659
What is that English expression
about shoes and feet?

1844
02:04:18,743 --> 02:04:20,144
"Looks like the shoe
is on the other

1845
02:04:20,145 --> 02:04:21,620

just thinking that.

So you're Aldo the Apache.

1850
02:04:39,347 --> 02:04:42,349
- So you're The Jew Hunter.
- I'm a detective.

1851
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:44,268
A damn good detective.

1852
02:04:44,602 --> 02:04:46,228
Finding people is my speciality,

1853
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:48,730
so naturally, I worked for
the Nazis finding people.

1854
02:04:48,815 --> 02:04:51,942
And, yes, some of them
were Jews. But Jew Hunter?

1855
02:04:53,278 --> 02:04:55,154
Just a name that stuck.

1856
02:04:55,613 --> 02:04:58,407
Well, you do have to
admit, it is catchy.

1857
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:03,036
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

1858
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:05,622
Aldo the Apache and
the Little Man?

1859
02:05:06,708 --> 02:05:08,834
What do you mean the Little Man?

1860
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:10,711
Germans' nickname for you.

1861
02:05:10,795 --> 02:05:13,839
The Germans' nickname for
me is the Little Man?

1862
02:05:14,215 --> 02:05:16,460
And as if to make my
point, I'm a little

1863
02:05:16,461 --> 02:05:18,760
surprised how tall you
were in real life.

1864
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:21,263
I mean, you're a little fellow,
but not circus-midget little,

1865
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:23,140
as your reputation would suggest.

1866
02:05:23,224 --> 02:05:24,766
Where's my men?

1867
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:27,644
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?

1868
02:05:30,481 --> 02:05:33,692
Well, let's just say, she
got what she deserved.

1869
02:05:36,154 --> 02:05:38,697
And when you purchase friends
like Bridget von Hammersmark,

1870
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:40,782
you get what you pay for.

1871
02:05:42,202 --> 02:05:45,040
Now as far as your
paesanos, Sergeant

1872
02:05:45,041 --> 02:05:47,206
Donowitz and Private Omar...

1873
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:49,166
How you know our names?

1874
02:05:49,792 --> 02:05:51,376
Lieutenant Aldo,

1875
02:05:53,254 --> 02:05:54,671
if you don't think I
wouldn't interrogate

1876
02:05:54,756 --> 02:05:58,133
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

1877
02:06:00,553 --> 02:06:04,139
we simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.

1878
02:06:04,224 --> 02:06:05,807
No, I guess not.

1879
02:06:06,017 --> 02:06:11,146
Well, back to the whereabouts
of your two Italian saboteurs.

1880
02:06:14,317 --> 02:06:16,068
As of this moment,

1881
02:06:16,152 --> 02:06:18,761
both Omar and Donowitz
should be sitting

1882
02:06:18,762 --> 02:06:20,989
in the very seats we left them in.

1883
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:25,202
Double-zero 23 and double-zero
24, if my memory serves.

1884
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:29,414
Explosives still around their
ankles, still ready to explode.

1885
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:32,751
And your mission, some would
call a terrorist plot,

1886
02:06:32,835 --> 02:06:35,379
as of this moment, is still a go.

1887
02:06:35,463 --> 02:06:38,757
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on Ice?

1888
02:06:38,841 --> 02:06:40,050
However,

1889
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:45,097
all I have to do is pick
up this phone right here,

1890
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:48,016
inform the cinema, and
your plan is kaput.

1891
02:06:50,395 --> 02:06:53,071
If they're still
here, and if they're

1892
02:06:53,072 --> 02:06:55,607
still alive, and
that's one big if,

1893
02:06:56,943 --> 02:06:58,651
there ain't no way
you're going to take

1894
02:06:58,652 --> 02:07:00,445
them boys without
setting off them bombs.

1895
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:02,281
I have no doubt.

1896
02:07:02,365 --> 02:07:05,701
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

1897
02:07:05,785 --> 02:07:08,662
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

1898
02:07:08,746 --> 02:07:10,831
for what you've done
to his big night.

1899
02:07:12,083 --> 02:07:14,376
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

1900
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,504
you won't get Göring, and
you won't get Bormann.

1901
02:07:17,588 --> 02:07:20,173
And you need all
four to end the war.

1902
02:07:21,843 --> 02:07:25,053
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

1903
02:07:25,138 --> 02:07:27,389
you may very well get all four.

1904
02:07:28,683 --> 02:07:33,520
And if you get all
four, you end the war

1905
02:07:34,772 --> 02:07:36,023
tonight.

1906
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:38,900
So, gentlemen,

1907
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:42,863
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

1908
02:07:45,742 --> 02:07:47,617
So, the way I see it,

1909
02:07:47,702 --> 02:07:49,655
since Hitler's death or possible

1910
02:07:49,656 --> 02:07:51,913
rescue rests solely
on my reaction,

1911
02:07:52,582 --> 02:07:54,166
if I do nothing,

1912
02:07:54,584 --> 02:07:56,505
it's as if I'm causing
his death even

1913
02:07:56,506 --> 02:07:58,628
more than yourselves.
Wouldn't you agree?

1914
02:07:59,255 --> 02:08:00,630
I guess so.

1915
02:08:03,217 --> 02:08:05,260
How about you, Utivich?

1916
02:08:05,345 --> 02:08:06,928
I guess so, too.

1917
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:13,685
Gentlemen, I have no intention

1918
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:15,314
of killing Hitler and
killing Goebbels

1919
02:08:15,315 --> 02:08:16,897
and killing Göring
and killing Bormann,

1920
02:08:16,981 --> 02:08:19,733
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

1921
02:08:19,817 --> 02:08:23,528
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.

1922
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:29,159
If you want to win
the war tonight,

1923
02:08:30,787 --> 02:08:32,954
we have to make a deal.

1924
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:37,709
What kind of deal?

1925
02:08:37,794 --> 02:08:40,337
The kind you wouldn't have
the authority to make.

1926
02:08:40,421 --> 02:08:44,966
However, I'm sure this mission of
yours has a commanding officer.

1927
02:08:45,968 --> 02:08:47,302
A General.

1928
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:49,638
I'm betting for...

1929
02:08:51,349 --> 02:08:53,266
OSS would be my guess.

1930
02:08:57,188 --> 02:08:59,648
That's a bingo.

1931
02:09:02,652 --> 02:09:05,153
Is that the way you say
it? "That's a bingo."

1932
02:09:05,238 --> 02:09:07,155
You just say, "Bingo."

1933
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,449
Bingo. How fun.

1934
02:09:11,869 --> 02:09:14,955
But I digress. Where were
we? Yeah. Make a deal.

1935
02:09:15,498 --> 02:09:18,038
Over there is a very
capable two-way

1936
02:09:18,039 --> 02:09:19,960
radio and sitting behind it

1937
02:09:20,044 --> 02:09:24,172
is a more than capable radio
operator named Hermann.

1938
02:09:24,507 --> 02:09:26,842
Get me someone on the
other end of that radio

1939
02:09:26,926 --> 02:09:30,011
with the power of the
pen to authorise my,

1940
02:09:30,096 --> 02:09:33,014
let's call it, the terms of
my conditional surrender.

1941
02:09:33,099 --> 02:09:35,475
If that tastes better going down.

1942
02:09:36,269 --> 02:09:37,519
You know, where I'm from...

1943
02:09:37,603 --> 02:09:39,521
Yeah? Where is that exactly?

1944
02:09:39,605 --> 02:09:41,648
Maynardville, Tennessee.

1945
02:09:41,732 --> 02:09:44,151
I've done my share of bootlegging.

1946
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:46,403
Up there, if you engage
in what the federal

1947
02:09:46,404 --> 02:09:48,029
government calls illegal activity,

1948
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:50,281
but what we call just a man trying
to make a living for his family

1949
02:09:50,324 --> 02:09:54,744
selling moonshine liquor, it
behoves oneself to keep his wits.

1950
02:09:56,706 --> 02:10:00,125
Long story short, we hear a
story too good to be true,

1951
02:10:00,793 --> 02:10:02,043
it ain't.

1952
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:06,673
Sitting in your chair, I would
probably say the same thing,

1953
02:10:06,757 --> 02:10:11,428
and 999,999 times out of a
million, you would be correct.

1954
02:10:13,431 --> 02:10:17,017
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,

1955
02:10:17,602 --> 02:10:20,979
fate reaches out and
extends its hand.

1956
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,779
What shall the history books read?

1957
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:39,831
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1958
02:10:56,641 --> 02:10:59,851
I implore you. We must
destroy that tower.

1959
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,896
Sarge, that tower...

1960
02:11:22,458 --> 02:11:24,376
The tower stands.

1961
02:11:25,878 --> 02:11:27,003
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1962
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:28,171
Gum?

1963
02:11:31,551 --> 02:11:33,927
Psst. Psst.

1964
02:11:42,144 --> 02:11:43,937
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1965
02:12:14,343 --> 02:12:15,427
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1966
02:12:15,511 --> 02:12:16,678
It's time.

1967
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:19,221
I should go lock
the auditorium and

1968
02:12:19,222 --> 02:12:20,557
take my place behind the screen.

1969
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:06,329
So when the military history
of this night is written,

1970
02:14:06,414 --> 02:14:10,125
it will be recorded that I
was part of Operation Kino

1971
02:14:10,209 --> 02:14:12,961
from the very beginning
as a double agent.

1972
02:14:13,045 --> 02:14:17,090
Anything I've done in my
guise as an SS Colonel

1973
02:14:17,174 --> 02:14:20,218
was sanctioned by the
OSS as a necessary evil

1974
02:14:20,302 --> 02:14:22,971
to establish my cover
with the Germans.

1975
02:14:23,222 --> 02:14:26,516
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

1976
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:29,602
in Hitler and Goebbels' opera
box that assured their demise.

1977
02:14:30,104 --> 02:14:31,187
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1978
02:14:31,272 --> 02:14:33,306
I informed the Führer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1979
02:14:33,315 --> 02:14:34,691
He should arrive any minute.

1980
02:14:36,110 --> 02:14:37,152
Thank you, Hans.

1981
02:14:46,662 --> 02:14:49,706
By the way, that last
part is actually true.

1982
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:52,434
I want my full
military pension and

1983
02:14:52,435 --> 02:14:54,711
benefits under my proper rank.

1984
02:14:55,045 --> 02:14:57,464
I want to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honour

1985
02:14:57,548 --> 02:15:01,509
for my invaluable assistance in
the toppling of the Third Reich.

1986
02:15:02,928 --> 02:15:06,014
In fact, I want all the
members of Operation Kino

1987
02:15:06,098 --> 02:15:09,017
to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honour.

1988
02:15:09,435 --> 02:15:13,146
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.

1989
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:16,691
And I would like the
United States of America

1990
02:15:16,776 --> 02:15:20,820
to purchase property for
me on Nantucket Island

1991
02:15:20,905 --> 02:15:24,199
as a reward for all the
countless lives I've saved

1992
02:15:24,283 --> 02:15:26,576
by bringing the tyranny of
the National Socialist Party

1993
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:30,288
to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?

1994
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:35,543
I look forward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.

1995
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:38,630
Lieutenant Raine? Right here.

1996
02:15:41,842 --> 02:15:43,051
Yes, sir.

1997
02:15:43,135 --> 02:15:45,168
Colonel Landa will
put you and Private

1998
02:15:45,169 --> 02:15:46,888
Utivich in a truck as prisoners.

1999
02:15:46,972 --> 02:15:49,247
Then he and his radio
operator will get

2000
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:51,351
in the truck and
drive to our lines.

2001
02:15:51,435 --> 02:15:53,852
Upon crossing our
lines, Colonel Landa

2002
02:15:53,853 --> 02:15:56,022
and his man will surrender to you.

2003
02:15:56,106 --> 02:15:58,650
You will then take over
driving of the truck

2004
02:15:58,734 --> 02:16:00,261
and bring them straight to me for

2005
02:16:00,262 --> 02:16:02,111
debriefing. Is that
clear, Lieutenant?

2006
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,321
Yes, sir.

2007
02:16:03,405 --> 02:16:04,864
Over and out.

2008
02:16:28,931 --> 02:16:30,056
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

2009
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:33,226
Herr Dr Goebbels, excuse me.
Could I go out for a moment?

2010
02:16:33,602 --> 02:16:35,019
Perfectly understandable, my boy.

2011
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:36,855
You go now, and we'll
see you after the show.

2012
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:38,106
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

2013
02:17:43,547 --> 02:17:44,589
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

2014
02:17:44,673 --> 02:17:45,798
Who is it?

2015
02:17:45,883 --> 02:17:46,925
Fredrick.

2016
02:17:48,385 --> 02:17:49,427
Shit.

2017
02:17:53,974 --> 02:17:56,225
Are you the manager of this
cinema? I want my money back.

2018
02:17:56,644 --> 02:17:58,186
That actor in the movie stinks.

2019
02:18:00,481 --> 02:18:01,606
What are you doing here?

2020
02:18:01,815 --> 02:18:02,899
I came to visit you.

2021
02:18:04,234 --> 02:18:05,276
Can't you see how busy I am?

2022
02:18:05,569 --> 02:18:07,070
Then allow me to lend an assist.

2023
02:18:08,322 --> 02:18:10,156
Fredrick, it's not funny,
you can't be here.

2024
02:18:11,158 --> 02:18:13,451
This is your premiere, you need
to be out there with them.

2025
02:18:16,580 --> 02:18:17,705
Normally, you would be right.

2026
02:18:18,832 --> 02:18:20,166
And for all the
other films I do...

2027
02:18:20,834 --> 02:18:23,711
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight, in the proper spirit.

2028
02:18:25,881 --> 02:18:27,090
However, the fact remains...

2029
02:18:28,175 --> 02:18:30,301
this film is based on
my military exploits.

2030
02:18:30,928 --> 02:18:34,555
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of killing many men.

2031
02:18:36,016 --> 02:18:38,059
Consequently, the part of the
film that's playing now...

2032
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:41,854
I don't like watching this part.

2033
02:18:43,691 --> 02:18:45,525
- I am sorry, Fredrick, but...
- So, I thought...

2034
02:18:45,859 --> 02:18:48,111
I'd come up here and
do what I do best...

2035
02:18:48,445 --> 02:18:49,529
annoy you.

2036
02:18:50,531 --> 02:18:51,929
And from the look on your face, it

2037
02:18:51,930 --> 02:18:53,533
would appear I haven't
lost my touch.

2038
02:18:55,202 --> 02:18:57,203
Are you so used to the
Nazis kissing your ass...

2039
02:18:57,287 --> 02:18:58,788
you've forgotten what
the word "no" means?

2040
02:18:59,373 --> 02:19:01,332
No... you can't be here.

2041
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,542
Now go away.

2042
02:19:05,504 --> 02:19:06,546
Fredrick, you hurt me.

2043
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:11,217
Well, it's nice to know
you can feel something.

2044
02:19:12,052 --> 02:19:13,886
Even if it's just physical pain.

2045
02:19:14,555 --> 02:19:16,472
I'm not a man you
say, "go away" to.

2046
02:19:17,516 --> 02:19:19,767
There's over three hundred
dead bodies in Italy,

2047
02:19:19,852 --> 02:19:21,686
that if they could,
would testify to that.

2048
02:19:24,314 --> 02:19:25,481
After what I've done for you...

2049
02:19:25,858 --> 02:19:27,900
you disrespect me at your peril.

2050
02:19:28,235 --> 02:19:29,360
Lock the door.

2051
02:19:29,903 --> 02:19:30,945
What?

2052
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:33,281
Lock the door.

2053
02:19:33,365 --> 02:19:34,449
We don't have much time.

2054
02:19:37,369 --> 02:19:38,494
Time for what?

2055
02:19:39,747 --> 02:19:40,872
Forget it.

2056
02:19:40,956 --> 02:19:42,123
No, no, no... wait.

2057
02:19:43,792 --> 02:19:45,752
You want me to... lock the door?

2058
02:19:46,462 --> 02:19:47,628
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.

2059
02:21:49,084 --> 02:21:51,669
When I kill that guy, you got
30 feet to get to that guard.

2060
02:21:51,753 --> 02:21:53,713
- Can you do it?
- I have to.

2061
02:22:23,911 --> 02:22:25,244
Champagne?

2062
02:22:46,308 --> 02:22:47,391
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

2063
02:22:47,476 --> 02:22:49,393
Extraordinary my dear,
simply extraordinary.

2064
02:22:49,478 --> 02:22:50,770
This is your finest film yet.

2065
02:22:52,773 --> 02:22:54,106
Thank you, my Führer.

2066
02:22:56,276 --> 02:22:57,360
Thank you.

2067
02:23:17,172 --> 02:23:19,840
Who wants to send a
message to Germany?

2068
02:23:20,676 --> 02:23:23,010
I have a message for Germany.

2069
02:23:26,515 --> 02:23:28,683
That you are all going to die.

2070
02:23:28,767 --> 02:23:29,809
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

2071
02:23:29,893 --> 02:23:31,060
Enough. Stop it.

2072
02:23:31,186 --> 02:23:32,228
Turn off the projector.

2073
02:23:32,521 --> 02:23:35,031
And I want you to
look deep into the

2074
02:23:35,032 --> 02:23:37,608
face of the Jew who's
going to do it.

2075
02:23:37,693 --> 02:23:38,776
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

2076
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,927
I don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie.

2077
02:23:40,928 --> 02:23:43,846
Marcel, burn it down.

2078
02:23:44,032 --> 02:23:45,533
Yes, Shosanna.

2079
02:24:21,069 --> 02:24:23,154
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus,

2080
02:24:23,572 --> 02:24:25,072
and this is the face

2081
02:24:27,075 --> 02:24:29,410
of Jewish vengeance.

2082
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:26,193
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

2083
02:26:26,278 --> 02:26:28,612
These are the American
lines, Colonel sir.

2084
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:30,197
Excellent, Hermann.

2085
02:26:35,036 --> 02:26:36,871
Hermann, uncuff them.

2086
02:26:55,515 --> 02:26:59,518
I'm officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine.

2087
02:27:00,604 --> 02:27:02,396
We're your prisoners.

2088
02:27:03,231 --> 02:27:05,024
How about my knife?

2089
02:27:10,906 --> 02:27:12,907
Thank you very much, Colonel.

2090
02:27:13,033 --> 02:27:16,035
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's
hands behind his back.

2091
02:27:16,119 --> 02:27:18,329
Is that really necessary?

2092
02:27:18,413 --> 02:27:20,539
I'm a slave to appearances.

2093
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:25,211
Scalp Hermann.

2094
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:28,547
Are you mad?

2095
02:27:28,924 --> 02:27:30,633
What have you done?

2096
02:27:31,218 --> 02:27:34,470
I made a deal with your
General for that man's life.

2097
02:27:35,597 --> 02:27:37,370
Yeah, they made that
deal. But they don't

2098
02:27:37,371 --> 02:27:38,974
give a fuck about
him. They need you.

2099
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:41,060
You'll be shot for this.

2100
02:27:41,645 --> 02:27:43,583
Nah, I don't think
so. More like chewed

2101
02:27:43,584 --> 02:27:45,231
out. I've been chewed out before.

2102
02:27:46,483 --> 02:27:50,736
You know, Utivich and myself heard
that deal you made with the brass.

2103
02:27:51,112 --> 02:27:52,905
End the war tonight?

2104
02:27:54,282 --> 02:27:55,866
I'd make that deal.

2105
02:27:55,951 --> 02:27:57,826
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

2106
02:27:57,953 --> 02:27:59,199
I'd make that deal.

2107
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:01,455
I don't blame you. Damn good deal.

2108
02:28:02,249 --> 02:28:05,334
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

2109
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:08,796
Well, if you're willing to
barbecue the whole High Command,

2110
02:28:08,922 --> 02:28:11,924
I suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

2111
02:28:12,634 --> 02:28:14,760
But I do have one question.

2112
02:28:15,804 --> 02:28:18,556
When you get to your little
place on Nantucket Island,

2113
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:20,999
I imagine you are going
to take off that

2114
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,185
handsome-looking SS
uniform of yours.

2115
02:28:23,311 --> 02:28:24,603
Ain't you?

2116
02:28:28,608 --> 02:28:30,442
That's what I thought.

2117
02:28:31,152 --> 02:28:33,112
Now, that I can't abide.

2118
02:28:34,489 --> 02:28:36,740
How about you, Utivich,
can you abide it?

2119
02:28:36,825 --> 02:28:38,701
Not one damn bit, sir.

2120
02:28:40,328 --> 02:28:42,454
I mean, if I had my way,

2121
02:28:42,956 --> 02:28:45,106
you'd wear that
goddamn uniform for

2122
02:28:45,107 --> 02:28:47,376
the rest of your
pecker-sucking life.

2123
02:28:48,878 --> 02:28:50,045
But I'm aware that
ain't practical.

2124
02:28:50,046 --> 02:28:53,048
I mean, at some point, you're
going to have to take it off.

2125
02:28:53,174 --> 02:28:54,216
So,

2126
02:28:55,176 --> 02:28:58,971
I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.

2127
02:29:23,830 --> 02:29:25,956
You know something, Utivich?

2128
02:29:26,333 --> 02:29:29,126
I think this just might
be my masterpiece.
