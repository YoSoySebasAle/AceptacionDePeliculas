00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:09,852
<i>A little white house...</i>

2
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:13,648
<i>Lingers in my memory...</i>

3
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,985
<i>Of that little white house...</i>

4
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,196
<i>I dream each night...</i>

5
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,741
<i>The windows of that little house...</i>

6
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:27,286
<i>Beautifully shine in the sun...</i>

7
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,873
<i>As if someone's eyes...</i>

8
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,002
<i>Were filling with tears...</i>

9
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:38,006
<i>There was so much happiness
in that little house...</i>

10
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,591
<i>And so many joyous days...</i>

11
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:44,262
<i>When I remember
those blissful moments...</i>

12
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,473
<i>My heart trembles...</i>

13
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,269
<i>A little white house...</i>

14
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:54,522
<i>Lingers in my memory...</i>

15
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:58,276
<i>Of that little white house...</i>

16
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,279
<i>I dream each night...</i>

17
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,413
<i>He was 13 1/2 years old.</i>

18
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:14,542
<i>He had a lovely singing voice
and we heard him.</i>

19
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,170
<i>A little white house...</i>

20
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,797
<i>Lingers in my memory...</i>

21
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:22,383
<i>Of that little white house...</i>

22
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,386
<i>I dream each night...</i>

23
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,473
<i>The windows of that little house...</i>

24
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,517
<i>Beautifully shine in the sun...</i>

25
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:34,896
<i>As if someone's eyes...</i>

26
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,608
<i>Were filling with tears...</i>

27
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,664
<i>When I heard him again,
my heart beat faster,</i>

28
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:57,210
<i>because what happened
here... was a murder.</i>

29
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,922
<i>I really relived what happened.</i>

30
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:08,573
It's hard to recognize, but it was here.

31
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,620
They burned people here.

32
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,623
A lot of people were burned here.

33
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,887
Yes, this is the place.

34
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:11,135
No one ever left here again.

35
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,062
The gas vans came in here...

36
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,940
There were two huge ovens,

37
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:31,155
and afterward,
the bodies were thrown

38
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,909
into these ovens,

39
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,662
and the ﬂames reached to the sky.

40
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,538
<i>To the sky?</i>

41
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,712
It was terrible.

42
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,850
No one can describe it.

43
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,270
No one can...

44
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:07,650
recreate what happened here.

45
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:12,446
Impossible!
And no one can understand it.

46
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:15,992
Even I, here, now.

47
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,294
<i>I can't believe I'm here.</i>

48
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,924
<i>No, I just can't believe it.</i>

49
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,939
<i>It was always this peaceful here.</i>

50
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:54,113
<i>When they burned 2,000 people...
Jews... every day,</i>

51
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,449
<i>it was just as peaceful.</i>

52
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:02,538
<i>No one shouted.
Everyone went about his work.</i>

53
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,041
<i>It was silent. Peaceful.</i>

54
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,835
<i>Just as it is now.</i>

55
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,409
<i>You, girl, don't you cry.</i>

56
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:43,287
<i>Don't be so sad.</i>

57
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,749
<i>For the dear summer is nearing...</i>

58
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,043
<i>and I'll return with it.</i>

59
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:52,630
<i>A mug of red wine, a slice of roast,</i>

60
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,966
<i>that's what the girls
give their soldiers.</i>

61
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,394
<i>When the soldiers march along,</i>

62
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,980
<i>the girls open their doors and windows.</i>

63
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:26,330
<i>They thought the Germans
made him sing on the river.</i>

64
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:33,003
<i>He was a toy to amuse them.</i>

65
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,507
<i>He had to do it.</i>

66
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,301
<i>He sang, but his heart wept.</i>

67
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:47,435
<i>Do their hearts weep
thinking about that now?</i>

68
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,229
<i>Certainly, very much so.</i>

69
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,448
<i>They still talk about it
around the family table.</i>

70
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,162
<i>It was public, so everyone knew of it.</i>

71
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:15,212
<i>He said that was true German irony,</i>

72
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,759
<i>people were being killed,
and he had to sing.</i>

73
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,555
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

74
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,311
What died in him in Chelmno?

75
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,155
<i>Everything died.</i>

76
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,241
<i>But he's only human,
and he wants to live.</i>

77
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,660
<i>So he must forget.</i>

78
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,707
__ The other survivor:
MICHAEL PODCHLEBNIK - ISRAEL

79
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:12,520
<i>He thanks God for what remains
and that he can forget.</i>

80
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,647
<i>And let's not talk about that.</i>

81
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,402
Does he think it's good
to talk about it?

82
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,787
<i>For me it's not good.</i>

83
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,961
Then why is he talking about it?

84
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,272
<i>Because you're insisting on it.</i>

85
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,318
<i>He was sent books on the Eichmann trial,
where he was a witness,</i>

86
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,988
<i>and he didn't even read them.</i>

87
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,538
He survived,
but is he really alive, or...?

88
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,816
<i>At the time, he felt as if he were dead,</i>

89
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,819
<i>because he never thought he'd survive,</i>

90
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,031
<i>but... he's alive.</i>

91
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,330
Why does he smile all the time?

92
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,924
<i>What do you want him to do... cry?</i>

93
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,260
<i>Sometimes you smile, sometimes you cry.</i>

94
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,848
<i>And if you're alive,
it's better to smile.</i>

95
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:21,857
Why was she so curious about this story?

96

97
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,990
Daughter of Motke Za'l'dl,
survivor of Vilna (Lithuania)

98
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,614
<i>It's a long story.</i>

99
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:15,285
<i>As a child,
I had little contact with my father.</i>

100
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,956
<i>He went out to work,
and I didn't see much of him.</i>

101
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,668
<i>Besides, he was a silent man,
he didn 7 talk to me.</i>

102
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:27,214
<i>And when I grew up
and was strong enough to face him,</i>

103
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,926
<i>I questioned him.
I never stopped questioning him</i>

104
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:35,222
<i>until I got at the scraps of truth
he couldn't tell me.</i>

105
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,767
<i>It came out haltingly.</i>

106
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,228
<i>I had to tear the details out of him,</i>

107
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:46,859
<i>and finally, when Mr. Lanzmann came,</i>

108
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:51,905
<i>I heard the whole story
for the second time.</i>

BEN SHEMEN FOREST (ISRAEL)

111
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:24,772
<i>The place resembles Ponary:
the forest, the ditches.</i>

112
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,858
<i>It's as if the bodies were burned here.</i>

113
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,986
<i>Except there were no stones in Ponary.</i>

114
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,908
Ponary: forest where most
of the Vilna Jews were massacred

115
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,993
But the Lithuanian forests

116
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,330
are denser than the Israeli forest, no?

117
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,212
<i>Of course.</i>

118
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:58,180
<i>The trees are similar,
but taller and fuller in Lithuania.</i>

FOREST OF THE EXTERMINATION CAMP
AT SOBIBOR (POLAND)

120
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,231
ls there still hunting
here in Sobibor forest?

121
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:24,998
Yes, there are lots of animals
of all kinds.

122
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,503
Was there hunting then?

123
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,637
Only man hunting.

JAN PIWONSKI

125
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,660
Some victims tried to escape.

126
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,460
But they didn't know the area.

127
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:19,928
At times people heard explosions
in the minefield.

128
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,764
Sometimes they'd find a deer

129
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:26,351
and sometimes a poor Jew
who tried to escape.

130
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,754
<i>That's the charm of our forests:
silence and beauty.</i>

131
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,563
But it wasn't always so silent here.

132
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:26,203
There was a time
when it was full of screams

133
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,788
and gunshots,

134
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,750
of dogs' barking.

135
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,682
And that period especially

136
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,476
is engraved on the minds of the people

137
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,062
who lived here then.

138
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:09,037
After the revolt, the Germans
decided to liquidate the camp,

139
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,498
and early in the winter of 1943,

140
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:15,544
they planted pines
that were three or four years old

141
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,796
to camouﬂage all the traces.

142
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,381
That screen of trees?

143
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:20,674
Yes.

144
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,926
That's where the mass graves were?

145
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,239
When he first came here in 1944,

146
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:48,201
you couldn't guess
what had happened here,

147
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:53,123
that these trees were hiding
the secret of a death camp.

148
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:00,922
How did he react,
the first time he unloaded corpses,

149
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,842
when the gas van doors were opened?

150
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,150
<i>What could he do? He cried.</i>

151
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,953
<i>The 3rd day,
he saw his wife and children.</i>

152
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,728
<i>He placed his wife
in the grave and asked to be killed.</i>

153
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,731
<i>The Germans said
he was strong enough to work,</i>

154
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:02,234
<i>that he wouldn't be killed yet.</i>

155
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,795
<i>Was the weather very cold?</i>

156
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:36,059
<i>It was in the winter of 1942,
in early January.</i>

157
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:43,358
<i>At that time, the bodies
weren't burned, just buried?</i>

158
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:14,890
<i>No, they were buried,
and each row was covered with dirt.</i>

159
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,017
<i>They weren't being burned yet.</i>

160
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,394
<i>There were around four or five layers.</i>

161
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,314
<i>The ditches were funnel-shaped.</i>

162
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,409
<i>They dumped the bodies
in these ditches,</i>

163
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:38,580
<i>and they had to lay them out
like herrings, head to foot.</i>

164
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,137
<i>So it was they who dug up
and burned all the Jews of Vilna?</i>

165
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,556
<i>Yes.</i>

166
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:04,898
<i>In early January 1944,
we began digging up the bodies.</i>

167
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,829
<i>When the last mass grave was opened,</i>

168
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,582
<i>I recognized my whole family.</i>

169
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,672
Whom in his family did he recognize?

170
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:43,395
<i>Mom and my sisters.
3 sisters with their kids.</i>

171
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,730
<i>They were all in there.</i>

172
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,566
How could he recognize them?

00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,974
<i>and it was winter.</i>

176
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,892
<i>They were very well preserved.</i>

177
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,771
<i>I recognized their faces,
their clothes too.</i>

178
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:31,067
They'd been killed relatively recently?

179
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,204
And it was the last grave?

180
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:54,090
The Nazi plan was for them
to open the graves

181
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,884
starting with the oldest?

182
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,140
<i>The last graves were the newest,</i>

183
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:48,937
<i>and we started with the oldest,
those of the first ghetto.</i>

184
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,981
<i>In the first grave,
there were 24,000 bodies.</i>

185
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:08,540
<i>The deeper you dug,
the ﬂatter the bodies were.</i>

186
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:11,292
<i>Each was almost a ﬂat slab.</i>

187
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:19,342
<i>When you tried to grasp a body,
it crumbled,</i>

188
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,678
<i>it was impossible to pick them up.</i>

189
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:34,399
<i>We had to open the graves,
but without tools.</i>

190
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:38,236
<i>They said, “Get used to working
with your hands.”</i>

191
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,905
With just their hands?

192
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,931
<i>When we first opened the graves,</i>

193
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,477
<i>we couldn't help it,
we all burst out sobbing.</i>

194
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,315
<i>But the Germans almost beat us to death.</i>

195
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,194
<i>We had to work
at a killing pace for two days,</i>

196
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,030
<i>beaten all the time, and with no tools.</i>

197
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,950
They all burst out sobbing?

198
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,059
<i>The Germans even forbade us</i>

199
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:54,687
<i>to use the words “corpse</i> ” <i>or “victim.</i> ”

200
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:58,483
<i>The dead were blocks of wood, shit,</i>

201
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,611
<i>with absolutely no importance...</i>

202
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,288
<i>Anyone who said “corpse”
or “victim” was beaten.</i>

203
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:23,633
<i>The Germans made us
refer to the bodies as “F (guren,</i> ”

204
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,553
<i>that is, as puppets, as dolls,</i>

205
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,931
<i>or as “Schmattes,”
which means “rags.”</i>

206
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,727
<i>Were they told at the start</i>

207
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,439
<i>how many “Figuren”
there were in all the graves?</i>

208
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:56,499
<i>The head of the Vilna Gestapo told us,</i>

209
00:31:56,583 --> 00:32:00,211
<i>“There are 90,000 people lying there,</i>

210
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:03,339
<i>and absolutely no trace
must be left of them.”</i>

211
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:14,267
It was at the end of November 1942.

212
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,065
They chased us away from our work

213
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,361
and back to our barracks.

214
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,363
Suddenly,

215
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:36,331
from the part of the camp called

216
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:42,086
the death camp,

217
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,382
ﬂames shot up very high.

218
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:54,307
In a ﬂash, the whole countryside,

219
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,227
the whole camp seemed ablaze.

220
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,857
It was already dark.

221
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,114
We went into our barracks

222
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,951
and ate...

223
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:19,332
And from the window,

224
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:25,421
we kept on watching
the fantastic backdrop of ﬂames

225
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,007
of every imaginable color,

226
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,887
red, yellow, green, purple.

227
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:41,312
And suddenly one of us stood up.

228
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:48,319
We knew he'd been
an opera singer in Warsaw.

229
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,659
His name was Salve, and...

230
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:03,126
facing that curtain of fire,

231
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:07,463
he began chanting a song

232
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:11,050
I didn't know:

233
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,720
“My God, my God,

234
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,974
why hast Thou forsaken us?”

235
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:22,478
RICHARD GLAZAR -
BASEL (SWITZERLAND)

236
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,068
<i>“We have been thrust
into the fire before,</i>

237
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:34,991
<i>but we he ve ne ver denied
Thy Holy L a w. ”</i>

238
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:40,371
<i>He sang in Yiddish,</i>

239
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,832
<i>while, behind him,</i>

240
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:47,962
<i>blazed the pyres</i>

241
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:55,052
<i>on which they had begun
then, in November 1942,</i>

242
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,264
<i>to burn the bodies in Treblinka.</i>

243
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:04,979
<i>That was the first time it happened.</i>

244
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,483
<i>We knew that night</i>

245
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:12,779
<i>that the dead would no longer be buried,</i>

246
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,282
<i>they'd be burned.</i>

247
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,452
TREBLINKA

248
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:50,566
<i>When things were ready,
they poured on fuel</i>

249
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,568
<i>and touched off the fire.</i>

250
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,196
<i>They waited for a high wind.</i>

251
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:59,200
<i>The pyres usually burned
for 7 or 8 days.</i>

252
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,878
<i>There was a concrete platform
some distance away,</i>

253
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:15,132
<i>and the bones that hadn't burned,</i>

254
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:17,885
<i>the big bones of the feet, for example,</i>

255
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,388
<i>we took...</i>

256
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:25,101
<i>There was a chest with two handles.</i>

257
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:28,187
<i>We carried the bones there,</i>

258
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:34,485
where others had to crush them.

259
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:37,321
It was very fine,

260
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:41,409
that powdered bone.

261
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:44,745
Then it was put into sacks,

262
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,792
and when there were enough sacks,

263
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:54,672
we went to a bridge on the Narew river

264
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,508
and dumped the powder.

265
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,385
The current carried it off.

266
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,265
<i>It drifted downstream.</i>

267
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:42,530
PAULA BIREN - CINCINNATI U.S.A.

THE JEWISH CEMETERY
IN LODZ TODAY

269
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,284
AUSCHWITZ: THE TOWN

270
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,830
<i>Mrs. Pietryra, you live in Auschwitz?</i>

271
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,169
<i>Yes, I was born here.</i>

272
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,504
<i>And you've never left Auschwitz?</i>

273
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:44,258
<i>No, never.</i>

274
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:47,303
<i>Were there Jews in Auschwitz
before the war?</i>

275
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,561
<i>They made up 80% of the population.</i>

276
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,984
They even had a synagogue here.

277
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:03,069
Just one?

278
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:06,947
Just one, I think.

279
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:08,532
Does it still exist?

280
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,081
No, it was wrecked.

281
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:17,625
There's something else there now.

282
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,127
Was there a Jewish cemetery
in Auschwitz?

283
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,429
It still exists. it's closed now.

284
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,807
- It still exists?
- Yes.

285
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,313
<i>Closed? What does that mean?</i>

286
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,985
<i>They don't bury there now.</i>

287
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,383
<i>Was there a synagogue in Wlodawa?</i>

288
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:13,347
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

289
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:21,147
When Poland was ruled by the czars,

290
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,816
that synagogue already existed.

291
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:30,156
It's even older than the Catholic church.

292
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,438
<i>It's no longer used.</i>

293
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,567
<i>There's no one to go to it.</i>

294
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:17,536
These buildings haven't changed?

295
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:26,337
Not at all.
There were barrels of herrings here,

296
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,130
and the Jews sold fish.

297
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:32,885
There were stalls, small shops,

298
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,930
Jewish business, as the gentleman says.

299
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,644
That's Barenholz's house.

300
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,147
He sold wood.

301
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,864
Lipschitz's store was there.
He sold cloth.

302
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,784
This was Lichtenstein's.

303
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:58,869
What was there, opposite?

304
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,749
A food store.

305
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,668
A Jewish store?

306
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:12,091
There was a notions shop here,

307
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:15,844
it sold thread, needles, odds and ends,

308
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:21,684
and there were also three barbers.

309
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:25,271
PAN FILIPOWICZ

310
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:29,608
- Was that fine house Jewish?
- It's Jewish.

311
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:32,695
- And this small one?
- Also.

312
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:34,280
And the one behind it?

313
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:36,949
These were all Jewish.

314
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,784
This one on the left, too?

315
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,037
That one too.

316
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:46,041
Who lived in it? Borenstein?

317
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:51,630
He was in the cement business.

318
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:54,258
He was very handsome, and cultivated.

319
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:01,390
Here there was a blacksmith
named Tepper.

320
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,559
It was a Jewish house.

321
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,562
A shoemaker lived here.

322
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:08,731
What was his name?

323
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:12,151
- Yankel?
- Yes.

324
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:16,071
You get the feeling Wlodawa
was a Jewish city.

325
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,202
Yes, because it's true.

326
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:27,082
The Poles lived farther out,
the center was wholly Jewish.

327
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:31,337
<i>What happened to the Jews of Auschwitz?</i>

328
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:40,679
<i>They were expelled and resettled,</i>

329
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:42,848
<i>but I don't know where.</i>

330
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:44,767
<i>What year was that?</i>

331
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:53,525
<i>It began in 1940,
which was when I moved here.</i>

332
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,070
<i>This apartment also belonged to Jews.</i>

333
00:44:56,904 --> 00:45:00,532
According to our information,

334
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:05,037
the Auschwitz Jews
were “resettled,” as they say,

335
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,541
nearby, in Benzin
and Sosnowiec, in Upper Silesia.

336
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:14,671
Yes, because those were Jewish towns.

337
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:19,551
Does she know what happened
to the Jews of Auschwitz?

338
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:28,102
I think they all ended up in the camp.

339
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:30,229
That is, they returned to Auschwitz?

340
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:39,488
AUSCHWITZ - BIRKENAU

341
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:57,714
<i>All kinds of people from everywhere
were sent here.</i>

342
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,677
<i>All the Jews came here... to die.</i>

343
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:14,731
What did they think when Wlodawa's
Jews were all deported to Sobibor?

344
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:19,611
Wlodawa - Sobibor: 10 miles

345
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,789
What could we think?

346
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:36,753
That it was the end of them,
but they had foreseen that.

347
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:38,380
How so?

348
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:58,025
Even before the war,
when you talked to the Jews,

349
00:46:58,108 --> 00:46:59,943
they foresaw their doom.

350
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:01,487
He doesn't know how.

351
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,406
Even before the war,
they had a premonition.

352
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:17,252
<i>How were they taken to Sobibor? On foot?</i>

353
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,637
<i>It was frightful. He watched it himself.</i>

354
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:34,770
<i>They were herded on foot
to a station called Orkrobek.</i>

355
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:49,785
<i>There, they put the old people first
into waiting cattle cars,</i>

356
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:55,040
<i>then the younger Jews,</i>

357
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:01,046
<i>and finally the kids.</i>

358
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:05,842
<i>That was the worst:
They threw them on top of the others.</i>

359
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:45,090
<i>Were there a lot of Jews in Kolo?</i>

360
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:49,886
<i>A great many.</i>

361
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,515
<i>More Jews than Poles.</i>

362
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:57,519
<i>And what happened to the Kolo Jews?</i>

363
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:59,521
<i>Was he an eyewitness?</i>

364
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:04,067
PAN FALBORSKI

365
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,404
Yes. It was frightful.

366
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:25,172
Frightful to see.

367
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:28,133
Even the Germans hid,
they couldn't see that.

368
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:32,638
When the Jews were herded
to the station, they were beaten,

369
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,181
some were even killed.

370
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:39,811
A cart followed the convoy
to pick up the corpses.

371
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:44,900
- Those who couldn't walk, the slain?
- Yes, those who'd fallen.

372
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,069
Where did this happen?

373
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:12,177
The Jews were collected
in the Kolo synagogue.

374
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,514
Then they were herded to the station,

375
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:19,643
where the narrow-gauge rail road
went to Chelmno.

376
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:32,114
<i>It happened to all the Jews
in the area, not just in Kolo?</i>

377
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:41,123
<i>Absolutely.</i>

378
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:43,500
<i>Everywhere.</i>

379
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:50,716
<i>Jews were also murdered
in the forests</i>

380
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:53,301
<i>near Kalisz, not far from here.</i>

381
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:24,703
ABRAHAM BOMBA - TEL AVIV, ISRAEL,
survivor of Treblinka

382
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:57,235
TREBLINKA BY ROAD

383
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:55,729
<i>He was born here</i>

384
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,940
<i>in 1923</i>

385
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:01,484
<i>and has been here even since.</i>

386
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,697
<i>He lived at this very spot?</i>

387
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:07,490
<i>Right here.</i>

388
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:11,244
<i>Then he had a front-row seat
for what happened.</i>

389
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,626
<i>Naturally.</i>

390
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:26,051
<i>You could go up close
or watch from a distance.</i>

391
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,055
CZESLAW BOROWI

392
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,936
They had land
on the far side of the station.

393
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,398
To work it, he had to cross the track,

394
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:42,484
so he could see everything.

395
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:52,577
<i>Does he remember
the first convoy of Jews from Warsaw</i>

396
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,288
<i>on July 22, 1942?</i>

397
00:56:58,792 --> 00:56:59,918
<i>Yes.</i>

398
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,341
<i>He recalls the first convoy very well,</i>

399
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:10,762
<i>and when all those Jews
were brought here,</i>

400
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:19,354
<i>people wondered,
“What's to be done with them?”</i>

401
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:26,027
<i>Clearly, they'd be killed,
but no one yet knew how.</i>

402
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:42,544
When people began
to understand what was happening,

403
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:44,587
they were appalled,

404
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:49,843
and they commented privately
that since the world began,

405
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:53,555
no one had ever murdered
so many people that way.

406
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,480
<i>While all this was happening
before their eyes,</i>

407
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:04,065
<i>normal life went on?</i>

408
00:58:04,149 --> 00:58:05,859
<i>They worked their fields?</i>

409
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:31,092
Certainly they worked,

410
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:35,930
but not as willingly as usual.

411
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:38,516
<i>They had to work,</i>

412
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,186
<i>but when they saw all this,
they thought,</i>

413
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:44,689
<i>“What if our house is surrounded
and we're arrested?”</i>

414
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:49,777
Were they afraid for the Jews, too?

415
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,728
Well, he says it's this way:

416
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:28,399
If I cut my finger, it doesn't hurt him.

417
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:30,818
They saw what happened to the Jews:

418
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:35,531
The convoy came in
and then went to the camp,

419
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,576
and the people vanished.

420
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:46,334
He had a field
less than 100 yards from the camp.

421
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:50,797
He also worked
during the German occupation.

422
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,299
- He worked his field?
- Yes.

423
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:58,513
He saw how they were asphyxiated,

424
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:01,933
he heard them scream, he saw that.

425
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:06,521
There's a small hill:
He could see quite a bit.

426
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:10,525
What did he say?

427
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:17,282
They couldn't stop and watch.

428
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:20,785
It was forbidden.
The Ukrainians shot at them.

429
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:25,707
But they could work a field
100 yards from the camp?

430
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,919
They could.

431
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,339
So occasionally he could steal a glance,

432
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:35,675
if the Ukrainians weren't looking.

433
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,802
He worked with his eyes lowered?

434
01:00:41,431 --> 01:00:42,724
Yes.

435
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:51,065
He worked by the barbed wire
and heard awful screams.

436
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:52,942
His field was there?

437
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:56,904
Yes, right up close.

438
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,491
It wasn't forbidden to work there.

439
01:01:01,451 --> 01:01:03,244
So he worked, he farmed there?

440
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:09,792
Yes.

441
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:14,964
Where the camp is now
was partly his field.

442
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:30,021
It was off limits,
but they heard everything.

443
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:33,358
It didn't bother him to work
so near those screams?

444
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:45,995
At first it was unbearable.
Then you got used to it.

445
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:48,289
You get used to anything?

446
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,419
Yes.

447
01:01:56,506 --> 01:02:00,218
Now he thinks... it's impossible.

448
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:01,969
Yet it was true.

449
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:33,668
So he saw the convoys arriving.

450
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:38,381
There were 60 to 80 cars
in each convoy,

451
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:41,509
and there were two locomotives

452
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:45,430
that took the convoys into the camp,

453
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:49,475
taking 20 cars at a time.

454
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:52,854
And the cars came back empty?

455
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,692
- Yes.
- Does he remember...?

456
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:04,407
Here's how it happened:

457
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:07,201
The locomotive picked up 20 cars

458
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,872
and took them to the camp.

459
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:14,709
That took maybe an hour,

460
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:22,717
and the empty cars came back here.

461
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,927
Then the next 20 cars were taken,

462
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:29,557
and meanwhile, the people
in the first 20 were already dead.

463
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:45,072
<i>They waited, they wept,</i>

464
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:49,243
<i>they asked for water, they died.</i>

465
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:57,376
<i>Sometimes they were naked
in the cars, up to 170 people.</i>

466
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:02,340
<i>This is where they gave
the Jews water, he says.</i>

467
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:04,425
<i>Where was that?</i>

468
01:04:06,177 --> 01:04:10,681
Here. When the convoys arrived,
they gave water to the Jews.

469
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:12,600
Who gave the Jews water?

470
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,771
We did, the Poles.

471
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:22,193
There was a tiny well,
we took a bottle and...

472
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:24,654
Wasn't it dangerous to give them water?

473
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:28,574
Very dangerous.

474
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:38,376
You could be killed
for giving a glass of water.

475
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:41,420
But we gave them water anyway.

476
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,302
<i>Is it very cold here in winter?</i>

477
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:52,848
<i>It depends.</i>

478
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:58,104
<i>It can get to minus 15, minus 20.</i>

479
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:04,735
<i>Which was harder on the Jews,
summer or winter?</i>

480
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:06,612
<i>Waiting here, I mean.</i>

481
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:19,208
<i>He thinks winter,
because they were very cold.</i>

482
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:28,467
<i>They were so packed in the cars,
maybe they weren't cold.</i>

483
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,181
<i>In summer they stiﬂed: It was very hot.</i>

484
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:38,185
<i>The Jews were very thirsty.
They tried to get out.</i>

485
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:46,027
Were there corpses
in the cars on arrival?

486
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,452
Obviously.

487
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:09,634
They were so packed in

488
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:14,221
that even those still alive
sat on corpses for lack of space.

489
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:20,436
Didn't people here
who went by the trains

490
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:23,230
look through the cracks in the cars?

491
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:36,077
Yes, they could look in sometimes
as they went by.

492
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:43,918
When they were allowed,
they gave them water, too.

493
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:46,462
How did the Jews try to get out?

494
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:49,048
The doors weren't opened.
How'd they get out?

495
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:55,096
Through the windows.

496
01:06:58,057 --> 01:06:59,684
They removed the barbed wire

497
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:03,479
and came out of the windows.

498
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,147
They jumped, of course.

499
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:15,491
Sometimes they just deliberately
sat down on the ground,

500
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:20,621
and the guards came
and shot them in the head.

501
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:35,302
Theyjumped from the cars...
What a sight!

502
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:38,139
Jumping from the windows.

503
01:07:40,141 --> 01:07:43,102
There was a mother and child.

504
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:45,354
- Jewish?
- Yes.

505
01:07:45,438 --> 01:07:47,189
She tried to run away,

506
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:51,193
and they shot her in the heart.

507
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,491
- Shot who... the mother?
- Yes, the mother.

508
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:04,498
This gentleman has lived here
a long time, he can't forget.

509
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:18,888
He says that now he can't understand

510
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:23,517
how a man can do that
to another human being.

511
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,562
It's inconceivable,
beyond understanding.

512
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:32,359
Once when the Jews asked for water,
a Ukrainian went by

513
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,362
and forbade giving any.

514
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:41,619
The Jewish woman
that had asked for water...

515
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:47,041
threw her pot at his head.

516
01:08:56,008 --> 01:09:00,137
The Ukrainian moved back,

517
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:05,518
maybe ten yards,
and opened fire on the car.

518
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:09,563
<i>Blood and brains
were all over the place.</i>

519
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,528
<i>Lots of people opened the doors</i>

520
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,616
<i>or escaped through the windows.</i>

521
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:29,500
<i>Sometimes the Ukrainians
fired through the car walls.</i>

522
01:10:02,283 --> 01:10:03,784
It happened chieﬂy at night.

523
01:10:03,868 --> 01:10:08,122
When the Jews talked to each other,
as he showed us,

524
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:12,543
the Ukrainians wanted things quiet,

525
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:15,921
and they asked...
yes, asked them to shut up.

526
01:10:16,005 --> 01:10:20,551
So the Jews shut up
and the guard moved off.

527
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:24,388
Then the Jews started talking again,
in their language,

528
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,348
as he says, ra-ra-ra, and so on.

529
01:10:26,432 --> 01:10:30,895
What's he mean, la-la-la?
What's he trying to imitate?

530
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:33,314
- Their language.
- No, ask him.

531
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,862
Was the Jews' noise something special?

532
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:42,740
They spoke Jew.

533
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:46,452
Does Mr. Borowi understand “Jew”?

534
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:49,246
No.

535
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:36,687
<i>Did he hear screams
behind his locomotive?</i>

536
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:48,323
<i>Obviously, since the locomotive
was next to the camp.</i>

537
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:50,951
<i>They screamed, asked for water.</i>

538
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:03,213
<i>The screams from the cars
closest to the locomotive</i>

539
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:05,924
<i>could be heard very well.</i>

540
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,805
<i>Can one get used to that?</i>

541
01:13:18,312 --> 01:13:19,354
No.

542
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:26,320
<i>It was extremely distressing to him.</i>

543
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:31,658
<i>He knew that the people behind him
were human, like him.</i>

544
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:44,922
<i>The Germans gave him
and the other workers vodka to drink.</i>

545
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:47,883
<i>Without drinking,
they couldn't have done it.</i>

546
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:56,183
<i>There was a bonus</i>

547
01:14:00,813 --> 01:14:04,900
<i>that they were paid
not in money, but in liquor.</i>

548
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:11,532
<i>Those who worked on other trains
didn't get this bonus.</i>

549
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:18,372
HENRIK GAWKOWSKI

550
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:28,465
He drank every drop he got

551
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:33,470
because without liquor
he couldn't stand the stench

552
01:14:33,554 --> 01:14:35,514
when he got here.

553
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:39,977
They even bought more liquor
on their own

554
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:42,229
to get drunk on.

555
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:55,427
From the station
to the unloading ramp in the camp,

556
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,846
how many miles?

557
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,610
Foun

558
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:25,100
AB RAHAM BC) M BA

559
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,084
<i>We traveled for two days.</i>

560
01:17:53,045 --> 01:17:55,380
<i>On the morning of the second day</i>

561
01:17:55,464 --> 01:18:00,052
<i>we saw that
we had left Czechoslovakia</i>

562
01:18:00,135 --> 01:18:04,806
<i>and were heading east.</i>

563
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:13,231
<i>It wasn't the SS guarding us,</i>

564
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:17,652
<i>but the Schutzpolizei,</i>

565
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:20,447
<i>the police, in green uniforms.</i>

566
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:26,870
<i>We were in ordinary passenger cars.</i>

567
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:28,955
<i>All the seats were filled.</i>

568
01:18:30,165 --> 01:18:32,501
<i>You couldn't choose.</i>

569
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:35,337
<i>They were all numbered and assigned.</i>

570
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:41,718
<i>In my compartment
there was an elderly couple.</i>

571
01:18:41,802 --> 01:18:43,595
<i>I still remember:</i>

572
01:18:43,678 --> 01:18:49,601
<i>The good man was always hungry
and his wife scolded him,</i>

573
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:56,274
<i>saying they'd have no food left
for the future.</i>

574
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:02,155
RICHARD GLAZAR

575
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:06,076
<i>Then, on the second day,</i>

576
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:09,413
<i>I saw a sign for Malkinia.</i>

577
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,998
<i>We went on a little farther.</i>

578
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:17,421
<i>Then, very slowly,</i>

579
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:21,425
<i>the train turned off the main track</i>

580
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:25,846
<i>and rolled at a walking pace
through a wood.</i>

581
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,807
<i>While he looked out,</i>

582
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:32,394
<i>we'd been able to open a window.</i>

583
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:36,440
<i>The old man
in our compartment saw a boy...</i>

584
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:40,068
<i>Cows were grazing...</i>

585
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:44,156
<i>And he asked the boy in signs,</i>

586
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,616
<i>“Where are we?”</i>

587
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:50,537
And the kid made a funny gesture. This!

588
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:53,165
Across the throat.

589
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,961
- A Pole?
- A Pole.

590
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,380
Where was this? At the station?

591
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:06,344
It was where the train had stopped.

592
01:20:06,428 --> 01:20:08,305
On one side was the wood,

593
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:11,433
and on the other were fields.

594
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:13,810
And there was a farmer in a field?

595
01:20:13,894 --> 01:20:16,938
We saw cows

596
01:20:17,022 --> 01:20:20,775
watched over by a young man,

597
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:25,864
a farmhand.

598
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:28,283
And one of you questioned him?

599
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:35,165
Not in words, but in signs, we asked,
“What's going on here?”

600
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:38,251
And he made that gesture. Like this.

601
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:43,256
We didn't really

602
01:20:44,174 --> 01:20:47,052
pay much attention to him.

603
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:49,554
We couldn't figure out what he meant.

604
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,868
Once there were foreign Jews...

605
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,204
They were this fat...

606
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,789
This fat?

607
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:19,292
Riding in passenger cars.

608
01:21:19,543 --> 01:21:22,546
There was a dining car,
they could drink

609
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:24,923
and walk around, too.

610
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:28,969
They said they were going to a factory.

611
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:33,807
On arrival, they saw
what kind of a factory it was.

612
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:39,563
We'd gesture...

613
01:21:39,646 --> 01:21:41,147
Gesture how?

614
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:45,402
That they'd be killed.

615
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:47,153
These people made that sign?

616
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:49,322
He says the Jews didn't believe it.

617
01:21:49,406 --> 01:21:51,658
But what does that gesture mean?

618
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:56,788
That death awaited them.

619
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:12,178
The people who had a chance
to get near the Jews

620
01:22:12,262 --> 01:22:14,556
did that to warn them...

621
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,976
- He did it too?
- That they'd be hanged, killed, slain.

622
01:22:19,019 --> 01:22:20,020
Yes.

623
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,444
Even foreign Jews
from Belgium, Czechoslovakia,

624
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:29,863
from France too, surely.

625
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:32,699
And from Holland...

626
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:36,870
These didn't know,

627
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:48,048
but the Polish Jews knew.

628
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:53,887
In the small cities in the area,

629
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:55,305
it was talked about.

630
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:59,476
So the Polish Jews were forewarned,
but not the others.

631
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:02,562
Who'd they warn,
Polish Jews or the others?

632
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:11,363
All the Jews.

633
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:40,183
He says the foreign Jews
arrived here in passenger cars,

634
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:42,769
they were well dressed, in white shirts,

635
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:47,232
there were ﬂowers in the cars,
and they played cards.

636
01:23:48,233 --> 01:23:52,278
From what I know, that was very rare,

637
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:55,990
Jews shipped in passenger cars.

638
01:23:56,074 --> 01:24:00,370
Most arrived in cattle cars.

639
01:24:15,135 --> 01:24:17,053
It's not true.

640
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:19,806
It's not true?

641
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:24,227
What did Mrs. Gawkowska say?

642
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:28,064
She said he may not
have seen everything.

643
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:32,110
He says he did.

644
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:02,432
Once, at the Malkinia station,
for example,

645
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:05,852
a foreign Jew left the train

646
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:08,271
to buy something at the bar.

647
01:25:09,564 --> 01:25:13,985
The train pulled out
and he ran after it...

648
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:15,820
To catch up to it.

649
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:22,410
So he went past these “Pullmans,”
as he calls them,

650
01:25:22,494 --> 01:25:27,624
those Jews who were calm, unsuspecting,

651
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:30,210
and he made that gesture to them.

652
01:25:41,596 --> 01:25:43,807
To all the Jews, in principle.

653
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:46,643
He just went along the platform.
Ask him.

654
01:25:53,775 --> 01:25:58,071
Yes. The road was as it is now.

655
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:04,661
When the guard wasn't looking,

656
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:07,372
he made that gesture.

657
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:15,547
Ask Mr. Gawkowski why he looks so sad.

658
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:27,767
Because I saw men
marching to their death.

659
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:32,856
Precisely where are we now?

660
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:47,495
It's not far...
a mile and a half from here.

661
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:48,872
What, the camp?

662
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:58,965
What's that dirt road he's indicating?

663
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:11,144
That's where the rail line
into the camp was.

664
01:27:29,329 --> 01:27:33,166
<i>Did Mr. Gawkowski,
aside from the trains of deportees</i>

665
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:38,880
<i>he drove from Warsaw or Bialystok
to the Treblinka station...</i>

666
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:43,509
<i>Did he ever drive the deportee cars</i>

667
01:27:43,593 --> 01:27:46,512
<i>into the camp
from the Treblinka station?</i>

668
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:05,114
<i>Did he do it often?</i>

669
01:28:09,035 --> 01:28:11,704
<i>Two or three times a week.</i>

670
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:14,040
<i>Over how long a period?</i>

671
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,922
<i>Around a year and a half.</i>

672
01:28:21,214 --> 01:28:25,134
<i>That is,
throughout the camp's existence?</i>

673
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:06,384
<i>This is the ramp.</i>

674
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,722
Here he is, he goes
to the end with his locomotive,

675
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:14,058
and he has the 20 cars behind him.

676
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:23,192
No, they're in front of him.

677
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:24,902
He pushed them?

678
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,739
That's right, he pushed them.

679
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:28,257
<i>In February 1942,</i>

680
01:30:28,341 --> 01:30:31,469
<i>I began working here
as an assistant switchman.</i>

681
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:36,390
The station building,
the rails, the platforms

682
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:39,519
are just as they were in 1942?

683
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:41,687
Nothing's changed?

684
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:46,442
Nothing.

685
01:30:46,526 --> 01:30:49,403
Exactly where did the camp begin?

686
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,617
JAN PIWONSKI

687
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:57,870
I'll show you exactly.

688
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:18,724
Here,

689
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:29,318
there was a fence that ran
to those trees you see there.

690
01:31:36,242 --> 01:31:39,495
And another fence
that ran to those trees over there.

691
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:44,917
So I'm standing
inside the camp perimeter, right?

692
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:49,839
That's right.

693
01:31:49,922 --> 01:31:53,676
Where I am now
is 50 feet from the station,

694
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,595
and I'm already outside the camp.

695
01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:01,434
Yes.

696
01:32:04,896 --> 01:32:07,857
So this is the Polish part,
and over there was death.

697
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:12,236
Yes.

698
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:27,793
<i>On German orders,
Polish railmen split up the trains.</i>

699
01:32:34,926 --> 01:32:36,886
<i>So the locomotive took 20 cars</i>

700
01:32:36,969 --> 01:32:40,056
<i>and headed toward Chelm.</i>

701
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:45,269
<i>When it reached a switch,</i>

702
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:53,694
<i>it pushed the cars into the camp
on the other track we can see.</i>

703
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:55,780
The ramp began there.

704
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:59,242
So here we're outside the camp,

705
01:32:59,325 --> 01:33:03,746
and back here we enter it.

706
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:08,501
Unlike Treblinka,
the station here is part of the camp.

707
01:33:13,965 --> 01:33:18,469
And at this point,
we are inside the camp.

708
01:33:21,347 --> 01:33:24,183
This track was inside the camp.

709
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:27,353
And it's exactly as it was?

710
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,193
Yes, the same track.

711
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:36,862
It hasn't changed since then.

712
01:33:36,946 --> 01:33:41,033
Where we are now
is what was called the ramp, right?

713
01:33:49,834 --> 01:33:54,630
Yes, those to be exterminated
were unloaded here.

714
01:33:54,714 --> 01:33:56,173
So where we're standing

715
01:33:56,257 --> 01:34:01,137
is where 250,000 Jews
were unloaded before being gassed.

716
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:06,642
Yes.

717
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:16,902
<i>Did foreign Jews arrive here
in passenger cars, too?</i>

718
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,830
<i>Not always.</i>

719
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,462
<i>Often the richest Jews,</i>

720
01:34:36,088 --> 01:34:38,341
<i>from Belgium, Holland, France,</i>

721
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:42,303
<i>arrived in passenger cars,</i>

722
01:34:43,095 --> 01:34:45,348
<i>sometimes even in 1st class.</i>

723
01:34:49,393 --> 01:34:52,438
<i>They were usually better treated
by the guards.</i>

724
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,339
Especially the convoys
of Western European Jews

725
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:20,966
waiting their turn here,

726
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:28,015
Polish railmen saw the women
putting on make-up, combing their hair,

727
01:35:28,099 --> 01:35:31,644
wholly unaware
of what awaited them minutes later.

728
01:35:32,478 --> 01:35:34,313
They dolled up.

729
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:47,660
And the Poles
couldn't tell them anything:

730
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:53,040
The guards forbad contact
with the future victims.

731
01:36:00,965 --> 01:36:03,509
<i>I suppose there were fine days
like today.</i>

732
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:13,853
<i>Unfortunately, some were even finer.</i>

733
01:37:23,589 --> 01:37:26,675
RUDOLF VRBA - NEW YORK, USA,
survivor of Auschwitz

734
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:54,036
AUSCHWITZ - BIRKENAU

735
01:42:47,746 --> 01:42:51,834
And suddenly it started:
the yelling and screaming.

736
01:42:52,835 --> 01:42:54,795
“AII out, everybody out!”

737
01:42:55,254 --> 01:42:59,383
All those shouts,
the uproar, the tumult!

738
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:02,219
“Out! Get out!

739
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:07,140
Leave the baggage!”

740
01:43:07,683 --> 01:43:11,436
We got out, stepping on each other.

741
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:22,114
We saw men wearing blue armbands.

742
01:43:22,197 --> 01:43:26,827
Some carried whips.

743
01:43:28,996 --> 01:43:31,707
We saw some SS men.

744
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:34,918
Green uniforms,

745
01:43:35,002 --> 01:43:40,090
black uniforms...

746
01:43:42,801 --> 01:43:44,803
<i>We were a mass,</i>

747
01:43:47,055 --> 01:43:50,559
<i>and the mass swept us along.</i>

748
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:52,436
<i>It was irresistible.</i>

749
01:43:52,519 --> 01:43:55,856
<i>It had to move to another place.</i>

750
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,662
<i>I saw the others undressing.</i>

751
01:44:12,164 --> 01:44:16,710
<i>And I heard, “Get undressed!
You're to be disinfected!”</i>

752
01:44:19,254 --> 01:44:22,841
<i>As I waited, already naked,</i>

753
01:44:22,925 --> 01:44:29,890
<i>I noticed the SS men
separating out some people.</i>

754
01:44:29,973 --> 01:44:32,309
<i>These were told to get dressed.</i>

755
01:44:34,227 --> 01:44:40,317
<i>A passing SS man
suddenly stopped in front of me,</i>

756
01:44:41,693 --> 01:44:45,280
<i>looked me over, and said,</i>

757
01:44:45,364 --> 01:44:50,118
<i>“Yes, you too, quick,
join the others, get dressed.</i>

758
01:44:50,369 --> 01:44:54,957
<i>You're going to work here,
and if you're good,</i>

759
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,834
<i>you can be a kapo... a squad leader. ”</i>

760
01:48:17,951 --> 01:48:20,871
BIRKENAUI THE RAMP

761
01:48:54,487 --> 01:48:58,450
<i>We were taken to the barracks.</i>

762
01:48:59,868 --> 01:49:03,371
<i>The whole place stank.</i>

763
01:49:05,624 --> 01:49:09,294
<i>Piled about five feet high</i>

764
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:14,633
<i>in a jumbled mass,</i>

765
01:49:14,716 --> 01:49:19,638
<i>were all the things people
could conceivably have brought.</i>

766
01:49:21,056 --> 01:49:24,643
<i>Clothes, suitcases,</i>

767
01:49:24,726 --> 01:49:29,898
<i>everything stacked in a solid mass.</i>

768
01:49:30,982 --> 01:49:34,903
<i>On top of it,
jumping around like demons,</i>

769
01:49:34,986 --> 01:49:40,617
<i>people were making bundles</i>

770
01:49:41,034 --> 01:49:44,329
<i>and carrying them outside.</i>

771
01:49:45,247 --> 01:49:49,417
<i>I was turned over to one of these men.</i>

772
01:49:49,501 --> 01:49:54,214
<i>His armband said, “Squad Leader.”</i>

773
01:49:54,881 --> 01:49:56,466
<i>He shouted,</i>

774
01:49:56,549 --> 01:50:02,639
<i>and I understood that I was also
to pick up clothing, bundle it,</i>

775
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:09,980
<i>and take it somewhere.</i>

776
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:15,944
<i>As I worked, I asked him,</i>

777
01:50:16,027 --> 01:50:20,615
<i>“What's going on?
The undressed ones... Where are they?”</i>

778
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:26,746
<i>And he replied, “Dead! All dead!”</i>

779
01:50:29,124 --> 01:50:33,753
<i>But it still hadn't sunk in,
I didn't believe it.</i>

780
01:50:34,421 --> 01:50:36,256
<i>He'd used the Yiddish word.</i>

781
01:50:36,339 --> 01:50:41,970
<i>It was the first time
I'd heard Yiddish spoken.</i>

782
01:50:44,723 --> 01:50:48,977
He didn't say it very loud,

783
01:50:50,061 --> 01:50:54,941
and I saw he had tears in his eyes.

784
01:50:55,984 --> 01:50:59,821
Suddenly he started shouting

785
01:50:59,904 --> 01:51:01,906
and raised his whip.

786
01:51:02,157 --> 01:51:07,203
Out of the corner of my eyes,
I saw an SS man coming.

787
01:51:07,287 --> 01:51:11,416
And I understood
that I was to ask no more questions,

788
01:51:11,666 --> 01:51:18,006
but just to rush outside
with the package.

789
01:52:41,214 --> 01:52:45,844
<i>All I could think of then
was my friend Care! Unger.</i>

790
01:52:47,554 --> 01:52:51,182
<i>He'd been at the rear of the train,</i>

791
01:52:51,266 --> 01:52:56,062
<i>in a section that had been uncoupled
and left outside.</i>

792
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:02,777
<i>I needed someone.
Near me. With me.</i>

793
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:10,285
<i>Then I saw him.
He was in the 2nd group.</i>

794
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:13,037
<i>He'd been spared too.</i>

795
01:53:15,748 --> 01:53:21,004
On the way, somehow,
he had learned, he already knew.

796
01:53:21,087 --> 01:53:23,715
He looked at me,

797
01:53:25,133 --> 01:53:31,014
all he said was,
“Richard, my father, mother, brother...”

798
01:53:32,974 --> 01:53:36,186
He had learned on the way there.

799
01:53:38,897 --> 01:53:42,650
Your meeting with Carel:

800
01:53:42,734 --> 01:53:46,404
how long after your arrival
did it happen?

801
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:54,662
It was... around 20 minutes
after we reached Treblinka.

802
01:54:01,711 --> 01:54:04,839
<i>Then I left the barracks</i>

803
01:54:04,923 --> 01:54:09,844
<i>and had my first look at the vast space</i>

804
01:54:10,595 --> 01:54:17,769
<i>that I soon learned
was called “the sorting place.”</i>

805
01:54:18,937 --> 01:54:24,275
<i>It was buried under mountains
of objects of all kinds.</i>

806
01:54:25,026 --> 01:54:29,656
<i>Mountains of shoes,
of clothes, 30 feet high.</i>

807
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:36,412
<i>I thought about it and said to Carel,</i>

808
01:54:36,496 --> 01:54:39,707
<i>“I! is a hurricane, a raging sea.</i>

809
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:43,878
<i>We're shipwrecked.
And we're still alive.</i>

810
01:54:43,962 --> 01:54:46,422
<i>We must do nothing</i>

811
01:54:46,506 --> 01:54:49,717
<i>but watch for every new wave,</i>

812
01:54:49,801 --> 01:54:52,887
<i>ﬂoat on it,</i>

813
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:58,893
<i>get ready for the next wave,</i>

814
01:54:58,977 --> 01:55:01,062
<i>and ride the wave at all costs.</i>

815
01:55:01,145 --> 01:55:03,565
<i>And nothing else.”</i>

816
01:57:44,225 --> 01:57:47,270
<i>Greenery, sand everywhere else.</i>

817
01:57:47,645 --> 01:57:50,773
<i>At night, we were put into barracks.</i>

818
01:57:50,857 --> 01:57:52,817
<i>It just had a sand ﬂoor.</i>

819
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:55,361
<i>Nothing else.</i>

820
01:57:55,820 --> 01:58:01,242
<i>Each of us simply dropped
where he stood.</i>

821
01:58:01,993 --> 01:58:08,166
<i>Half asleep,
I heard some men hang themselves.</i>

822
01:58:08,374 --> 01:58:12,587
<i>We didn't react then.
It was almost normal.</i>

823
01:58:14,172 --> 01:58:16,257
Just as it was normal

824
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:23,890
that for everyone behind whom
the gate of Treblinka closed,

825
01:58:24,348 --> 01:58:28,186
there was death, had to be death,

826
01:58:28,436 --> 01:58:35,234
for no one was supposed
to be left to bear witness.

827
01:58:37,028 --> 01:58:41,157
I already knew that,

828
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:46,788
three hours after arriving at Treblinka.

829
02:00:56,834 --> 02:00:59,170
BERLIN

830
02:03:30,571 --> 02:03:33,866
INGE DEUTSCHKRON
Born in Berlin

831
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:37,745
Lived there through the war

832
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:42,166
(In hiding beginning in February 1943)

833
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:46,378
Now lives in Israel

834
02:05:15,217 --> 02:05:18,846
FRANZ SUCHOMEL:
SS Unterscharfuhrer

835
02:05:21,056 --> 02:05:24,894
- <i>Are you ready?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

836
02:05:24,977 --> 02:05:27,646
- <i>Then we can...</i>
- <i>We can begin.</i>

837
02:05:31,317 --> 02:05:35,529
<i>How's your heart?
Is everything in order?</i>

838
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:39,658
<i>Oh, my heart...
For the moment, ifs all right.</i>

839
02:05:39,742 --> 02:05:43,370
<i>If I have any pain, I'll tell you.</i>

840
02:05:43,454 --> 02:05:45,039
<i>We'll have to break off.</i>

841
02:05:45,122 --> 02:05:46,790
<i>Of course.</i>

842
02:05:48,834 --> 02:05:51,295
<i>But your health, in general, is...</i>

843
02:05:51,378 --> 02:05:55,299
<i>The weather today suits me fine.</i>

844
02:05:55,549 --> 02:06:00,262
<i>The barometric pressure is high:
That's good for me.</i>

845
02:06:00,471 --> 02:06:04,391
<i>You look to be in good shape, anyway.</i>

846
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:09,104
<i>Let's begin with Treblinka.</i>

847
02:06:09,188 --> 02:06:10,397
<i>Certainly.</i>

848
02:06:10,481 --> 02:06:12,483
<i>I think that's best.</i>

849
02:06:12,858 --> 02:06:15,611
<i>If you could give us</i>

850
02:06:18,489 --> 02:06:22,451
<i>a description of Treblinka.</i>

851
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:26,580
<i>How did it look when you arrived?</i>

852
02:06:26,664 --> 02:06:31,752
<i>I believe you got there in August?</i>

853
02:06:31,835 --> 02:06:35,005
<i>Was it August 20 or 24?</i>

854
02:06:35,839 --> 02:06:38,801
<i>The 18th?
- I don't know exactly.</i>

855
02:06:38,884 --> 02:06:42,263
<i>Around August 20.</i>

856
02:06:43,472 --> 02:06:47,434
<i>I arrived there with seven other men.</i>

857
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,603
<i>From Berlin?</i>

858
02:06:49,687 --> 02:06:50,980
<i>From Berlin.</i>

859
02:06:51,063 --> 02:06:52,773
<i>From Lublin?</i>

860
02:06:53,565 --> 02:06:57,611
<i>From Berlin to Warsaw,
from Warsaw to Lublin,</i>

861
02:06:57,695 --> 02:07:03,075
<i>from Lublin back to Warsaw
and from Warsaw to Treblinka.</i>

862
02:07:03,367 --> 02:07:07,705
<i>What was Treblinka like then?</i>

863
02:07:08,372 --> 02:07:13,294
Treblinka then was operating
at full capacity.

864
02:07:13,877 --> 02:07:16,547
- Full capacity?
- Full capacity!

865
02:07:18,215 --> 02:07:20,551
Trains arrived...

866
02:07:21,844 --> 02:07:26,265
The Warsaw ghetto
was being emptied then.

867
02:07:28,058 --> 02:07:34,606
Three trains arrived in two days,

868
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:43,282
each with three, four,
five thousand people aboard,

869
02:07:44,241 --> 02:07:46,744
all from Warsaw.

870
02:07:47,411 --> 02:07:52,583
But at the same time,
other trains came in

871
02:07:53,459 --> 02:07:58,255
from Kielce and other places.

872
02:07:59,256 --> 02:08:02,468
So three trains arrived,

873
02:08:03,427 --> 02:08:09,558
and since the offensive
against Stalingrad was in fear,

874
02:08:09,767 --> 02:08:14,646
the trainloads of Jews
were left on a station siding.

875
02:08:15,606 --> 02:08:20,778
What's more, the cars were French,

876
02:08:21,737 --> 02:08:23,822
made of steel.

877
02:08:24,073 --> 02:08:30,287
So that while 5,000 Jews
arrived in Treblinka,

878
02:08:30,913 --> 02:08:33,665
3,000 were dead.

879
02:08:34,333 --> 02:08:36,502
- In the...
- In the cars.

880
02:08:36,585 --> 02:08:39,129
They had slashed their wrists,

881
02:08:41,006 --> 02:08:44,510
or just died.

882
02:08:46,512 --> 02:08:50,891
The ones we unloaded
were half-dead

883
02:08:50,974 --> 02:08:55,896
and half-mad.

884
02:08:58,190 --> 02:09:03,862
<i>In the other trains from Kielce</i>

885
02:09:04,154 --> 02:09:06,657
<i>and elsewhere,</i>

886
02:09:07,366 --> 02:09:10,160
<i>at least half were dead.</i>

887
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:15,249
We stacked them here, here,

888
02:09:17,292 --> 02:09:19,378
here and here.

889
02:09:19,962 --> 02:09:22,840
Thousands of people

890
02:09:23,841 --> 02:09:27,052
piled one on top of another.

891
02:09:29,179 --> 02:09:31,515
- On the ramp?
- On the ramp.

892
02:09:32,182 --> 02:09:35,352
Stacked like wood.

893
02:09:35,727 --> 02:09:36,979
In addition,

894
02:09:37,062 --> 02:09:42,776
other Jews, still alive,
waited there for two days:

895
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:47,239
The small gas chambers
could no longer handle the number.

896
02:09:47,322 --> 02:09:54,246
They functioned
day and night in that period.

897
02:09:54,329 --> 02:09:58,876
Can you please describe, very precisely,

898
02:09:59,251 --> 02:10:03,338
your first impression of Treblinka?

899
02:10:03,422 --> 02:10:07,301
Very precisely. it's very important.

900
02:10:07,384 --> 02:10:11,889
My first impression of Treblinka,

901
02:10:12,514 --> 02:10:18,562
and that of some of the other men,
was catastrophic.

902
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:22,399
For we had not been told

903
02:10:23,233 --> 02:10:28,405
how and what...
that people were being killed there.

904
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:30,324
They hadn't told us.

905
02:10:30,407 --> 02:10:32,534
- You didn't know?
- No!

906
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:35,829
Incredible!

907
02:10:36,079 --> 02:10:40,083
But true. I didn't want to go.

908
02:10:40,792 --> 02:10:43,378
That was proved at my trial.

909
02:10:43,587 --> 02:10:45,881
I was told,

910
02:10:45,964 --> 02:10:47,883
“Mr. Suchomel,

911
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:52,679
there are big workshops there
for tailors and shoemakers,

912
02:10:52,930 --> 02:10:55,766
and you'll be guarding them.”

913
02:10:56,517 --> 02:11:00,938
Nothing more.
- But you knew it was a camp?

914
02:11:01,021 --> 02:11:03,482
Yes. We were told,

915
02:11:03,774 --> 02:11:09,905
“The Fuhrer ordered
a resettlement program.

916
02:11:10,113 --> 02:11:13,116
It's an order from the Fuhrer.”

917
02:11:13,992 --> 02:11:16,411
Understand?
- Resettlement program...

918
02:11:20,082 --> 02:11:22,751
No one ever spoke of killing.

919
02:11:24,127 --> 02:11:25,879
<i>I understand.</i>

920
02:11:25,963 --> 02:11:30,217
<i>Mr. Suchomel, we're not discussing you,</i>

921
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:32,261
<i>only Treblinka.</i>

922
02:11:32,344 --> 02:11:35,764
<i>You are a very important eyewitness,</i>

923
02:11:35,847 --> 02:11:40,686
<i>and you can explain what Treblinka was.</i>

924
02:11:40,769 --> 02:11:42,896
<i>But don't use my name.</i>

925
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:47,192
<i>No, I promise.</i>

926
02:11:49,027 --> 02:11:52,072
<i>All right, you've arrived at Treblinka.</i>

927
02:11:52,155 --> 02:11:55,659
<i>So Stadie, the sarge,</i>

928
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:59,621
<i>showed us the camp</i>

929
02:12:01,290 --> 02:12:04,918
<i>from end to end.</i>

930
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:10,966
<i>Just as we went by,</i>

931
02:12:11,049 --> 02:12:16,722
<i>they were opening the gas chamber doors,</i>

932
02:12:16,805 --> 02:12:21,393
<i>and people fell out like potatoes.</i>

933
02:12:24,688 --> 02:12:29,693
<i>Naturally, that horrified
and appalled us.</i>

934
02:12:30,193 --> 02:12:34,823
<i>We went back and sat down
on our suitcases</i>

935
02:12:34,906 --> 02:12:38,368
<i>and cried like old women.</i>

936
02:12:42,873 --> 02:12:47,544
<i>Each day, 100 Jews were chosen</i>

937
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:52,215
<i>to drag the corpses to the mass graves.</i>

938
02:12:53,550 --> 02:13:01,433
<i>In the evening, the Ukrainians drove
those Jews into the gas chambers</i>

939
02:13:01,683 --> 02:13:03,310
<i>or shot them.</i>

940
02:13:03,393 --> 02:13:05,145
<i>Every day!</i>

941
02:13:07,564 --> 02:13:10,776
<i>It was in the hottest days of August.</i>

942
02:13:14,237 --> 02:13:19,076
The ground undulated like waves

943
02:13:19,284 --> 02:13:21,161
because of the gas.

944
02:13:21,244 --> 02:13:23,455
From the bodies?

945
02:13:23,789 --> 02:13:28,418
Bear in mind, the graves
were maybe 18, 20 feet deep,

946
02:13:29,252 --> 02:13:33,757
all crammed with bodies!

947
02:13:34,549 --> 02:13:38,970
A thin layer of sand
and the heat. You see?

948
02:13:39,221 --> 02:13:41,515
It was hell up there.

949
02:13:41,598 --> 02:13:42,933
You saw that?

950
02:13:43,016 --> 02:13:46,895
Yes, just once, the first day.

951
02:13:46,978 --> 02:13:49,940
We puked and wept.

952
02:13:50,023 --> 02:13:52,776
- You wept?
- We wept too, yes.

953
02:13:56,947 --> 02:13:59,658
The smell was infernal.

954
02:13:59,950 --> 02:14:04,204
Yes, because gas
was constantly escaping.

955
02:14:04,287 --> 02:14:08,750
It stank horribly, for miles around.

956
02:14:09,042 --> 02:14:11,253
- Miles?
- Miles!

957
02:14:11,336 --> 02:14:13,505
You could smell it all around,

958
02:14:14,297 --> 02:14:16,341
not just in the camp?

959
02:14:16,425 --> 02:14:20,595
Everywhere. It depended on the wind.

960
02:14:20,679 --> 02:14:23,640
The stink was carried on the wind.

961
02:14:24,641 --> 02:14:26,560
Understand?

962
02:14:34,651 --> 02:14:38,905
<i>More people kept coming, always more,</i>

963
02:14:38,989 --> 02:14:42,826
<i>whom we hadn't the facilities to kill.</i>

964
02:14:48,707 --> 02:14:54,045
<i>Those gents were in a rush
to clean out the Warsaw ghetto.</i>

965
02:14:57,382 --> 02:15:01,386
<i>The gas chambers
couldn't handle the load.</i>

966
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:04,014
<i>The small gas chambers.</i>

967
02:15:20,697 --> 02:15:24,284
<i>The Jews had to wait their turn</i>

968
02:15:24,367 --> 02:15:28,872
<i>for a day, 2 days, 3 days.</i>

969
02:15:35,170 --> 02:15:37,547
<i>They foresaw what was coming.</i>

970
02:15:38,673 --> 02:15:41,218
<i>They foresaw it.</i>

971
02:15:42,552 --> 02:15:47,891
<i>They may not have been certain,
but many knew.</i>

972
02:15:52,729 --> 02:15:57,317
<i>There were Jewish women</i>

973
02:15:57,859 --> 02:16:01,655
<i>who slashed
their daughters' wrists at night,</i>

974
02:16:01,905 --> 02:16:05,242
<i>then cut their own.</i>

975
02:16:06,034 --> 02:16:08,745
<i>Others poisoned themselves.</i>

976
02:16:10,038 --> 02:16:15,585
<i>They heard the engine
feeding the gas chamber.</i>

977
02:16:18,713 --> 02:16:23,301
<i>A tank engine was used
in that gas chamber.</i>

978
02:16:25,095 --> 02:16:30,642
<i>At Treblinka, the only gas used
was engine exhaust.</i>

979
02:16:31,101 --> 02:16:33,520
<i>Zyklon gas, that was Auschwitz.</i>

980
02:16:40,277 --> 02:16:44,114
<i>Because of the delay,</i>

981
02:16:44,865 --> 02:16:49,661
<i>Eberl, the camp commandant,</i>

982
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:54,958
<i>phoned Lublin and said,</i>

983
02:16:55,709 --> 02:16:59,880
<i>“We can't go on this way.
I can't do it any longer.</i>

984
02:16:59,963 --> 02:17:04,175
<i>We have to break off.”</i>

985
02:17:04,259 --> 02:17:07,971
<i>Overnight, Wirth arrived.</i>

986
02:17:09,097 --> 02:17:12,851
<i>He inspected everything and then left.</i>

987
02:17:12,934 --> 02:17:17,063
<i>He returned with people from Belzec,</i>

988
02:17:17,147 --> 02:17:19,482
<i>experts.</i>

989
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:25,280
<i>Wirth arranged to suspend the trains.</i>

990
02:17:27,824 --> 02:17:33,288
<i>The corpses lying there
were cleared away.</i>

991
02:17:34,331 --> 02:17:38,960
That was the period
of the old gas chambers.

992
02:17:39,502 --> 02:17:44,591
Because there were so many dead

993
02:17:44,674 --> 02:17:47,427
that couldn't be gotten rid of,

994
02:17:48,011 --> 02:17:52,265
for days and days,

995
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:58,688
the bodies piled up
around the gas chambers.

996
02:17:59,981 --> 02:18:04,361
Under this pile of bodies
was a cesspool:

997
02:18:05,111 --> 02:18:09,699
3 inches deep, full of blood, worms...

998
02:18:11,326 --> 02:18:13,536
and shit.

999
02:18:15,747 --> 02:18:18,833
- Where?
- In front of the gas chamber.

1000
02:18:21,461 --> 02:18:24,297
No one wanted to clean it out.

1001
02:18:24,381 --> 02:18:28,426
The Jews preferred to be shot

1002
02:18:29,552 --> 02:18:32,389
rather than work there.

1003
02:18:33,056 --> 02:18:35,558
Preferred to be shot?

1004
02:18:38,395 --> 02:18:44,317
It was awful. Burying
their own people, seeing it all...

1005
02:18:44,401 --> 02:18:48,738
The dead ﬂesh came off in their hands.

1006
02:18:49,864 --> 02:18:52,951
So Wirth went there himself

1007
02:18:53,994 --> 02:18:56,538
with a few Germans

1008
02:18:57,747 --> 02:19:01,751
and had long belts rigged up

1009
02:19:02,210 --> 02:19:06,798
that were wrapped
around the dead torsos to pull them...

1010
02:19:06,881 --> 02:19:09,342
- Who did that?
- SS men.

1011
02:19:09,426 --> 02:19:11,511
- Wirth?
- SS men and Jews.

1012
02:19:11,594 --> 02:19:13,388
SS men and Jews!

1013
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:15,849
Jews too?

1014
02:19:15,932 --> 02:19:18,101
Jews too!

1015
02:19:20,061 --> 02:19:23,314
What did the Germans do?

1016
02:19:23,398 --> 02:19:26,860
They forced the Jews to...

1017
02:19:26,943 --> 02:19:29,195
They beat them?

1018
02:19:29,279 --> 02:19:34,701
Or they themselves helped
with the cleanup.

1019
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:37,620
Which Germans did that?

1020
02:19:39,122 --> 02:19:45,295
Some of our guards
who were assigned up there.

1021
02:19:47,964 --> 02:19:49,507
The Germans themselves?

1022
02:19:49,591 --> 02:19:52,677
They had to.

1023
02:19:53,136 --> 02:19:54,596
They were in command!

1024
02:19:54,679 --> 02:20:00,143
They were in command,
but they were also commanded.

1025
02:20:00,226 --> 02:20:03,646
I think the Jews did it.

1026
02:20:04,898 --> 02:20:10,820
In that case,
the Germans had to lend a hand.

1027
02:20:12,655 --> 02:20:16,701
THE BLACK EXECUTION WALL
IN THE COURTYARD OF BLOCK II

1028
02:20:18,828 --> 02:20:22,957
AT AUSCHWITZ I,
THE ORIGINAL CAMP

1029
02:20:25,752 --> 02:20:29,756
<i>Filip, on that Sunday in May 1942,</i>

1030
02:20:29,839 --> 02:20:36,471
<i>when you first entered
the Auschwitz crematorium,</i>

1031
02:20:36,554 --> 02:20:38,348
<i>how old were you?</i>

1032
02:20:39,432 --> 02:20:41,226
<i>Twenty.</i>

1033
02:20:48,691 --> 02:20:51,694
<i>It was a Sunday in May.</i>

1034
02:20:59,369 --> 02:21:04,749
<i>We were locked
in an underground cell in Block 11.</i>

1035
02:21:06,292 --> 02:21:09,045
<i>We were held in secret.</i>

1036
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:17,053
<i>Then some SS men appeared</i>

1037
02:21:18,888 --> 02:21:23,726
<i>and marched us
along a street in the camp.</i>

1038
02:21:33,987 --> 02:21:38,074
<i>We went through a gate,</i>

1039
02:21:44,539 --> 02:21:47,292
<i>and around 300 feet away,</i>

1040
02:21:48,251 --> 02:21:50,753
<i>300 feet from the gate,</i>

1041
02:21:51,337 --> 02:21:54,757
<i>I suddenly saw a building.</i>

1042
02:21:55,091 --> 02:22:00,805
<i>It had a ﬂat roof, and a smokestack.</i>

1043
02:22:09,689 --> 02:22:12,775
<i>I saw a door in the rear.</i>

1044
02:22:16,613 --> 02:22:22,285
<i>I thought they were taking us
to be shot.</i>

1045

FILIP MULLER - CZECH JEW

1046
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:32,670
Survivor of the 5 liquidations
of the Auschwitz “special detail”

1047
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:39,469
<i>Suddenly, before a door</i>

1048
02:22:40,637 --> 02:22:46,309
<i>under a lamp
in the middle of this building,</i>

1049
02:22:46,392 --> 02:22:51,522
<i>a young SS man told us,</i>

1050
02:22:51,606 --> 02:22:54,734
<i>“Inside, filthy swine!”</i>

1051
02:22:54,817 --> 02:22:58,488
<i>We entered a corridor.</i>

1052
02:22:59,781 --> 02:23:02,659
<i>They drove us along it.</i>

1053
02:23:14,337 --> 02:23:20,343
<i>Right away, the stench,
the smoke choked me.</i>

1054
02:23:29,978 --> 02:23:32,689
<i>They kept on chasing us,</i>

1055
02:23:33,982 --> 02:23:38,361
<i>and then I made out the shapes</i>

1056
02:23:39,362 --> 02:23:42,865
<i>of the first two ovens.</i>

1057
02:23:47,996 --> 02:23:52,583
<i>Between the ovens,
some Jewish prisoners were working.</i>

1058
02:23:58,339 --> 02:24:03,428
<i>We were in the crematorium's
incineration chamber</i>

1059
02:24:03,886 --> 02:24:06,723
<i>in Camp I at Auschwitz.</i>

1060
02:24:13,229 --> 02:24:14,731
<i>From there,</i>

1061
02:24:15,231 --> 02:24:21,321
<i>they herded us to another big room,</i>

1062
02:24:25,575 --> 02:24:30,872
<i>and told us to undress the corpses.</i>

1063
02:24:33,583 --> 02:24:36,044
<i>I looked around me.</i>

1064
02:24:39,172 --> 02:24:42,759
<i>There were hundreds of bodies,</i>

1065
02:24:44,177 --> 02:24:46,554
<i>all dressed.</i>

1066
02:24:48,222 --> 02:24:50,975
<i>Piled with the corpses</i>

1067
02:24:52,268 --> 02:24:55,313
<i>were suitcases, bundles</i>

1068
02:24:56,022 --> 02:24:58,107
<i>and, scattered everywhere,</i>

1069
02:24:58,691 --> 02:25:02,820
<i>strange, bluish-purple crystals.</i>

1070
02:25:02,904 --> 02:25:06,157
<i>I couldn't understand any of it.</i>

1071
02:25:13,456 --> 02:25:19,379
<i>It was like a blow to the head...
as if you'd been stunned.</i>

1072
02:25:19,629 --> 02:25:22,882
<i>I didn't even know where I was.</i>

1073
02:25:22,965 --> 02:25:25,635
<i>Above all, I couldn't understand</i>

1074
02:25:25,718 --> 02:25:29,972
<i>how they managed
to kill so many people at once.</i>

1075
02:25:32,725 --> 02:25:36,187
<i>When we undressed some of them,</i>

1076
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:40,149
<i>the order was given to feed the ovens.</i>

1077
02:25:44,654 --> 02:25:49,325
Suddenly, an SS man
rushed up and told me,

1078
02:25:49,409 --> 02:25:52,787
“Get out of here! Go stir the bodies!”

1079
02:25:53,162 --> 02:25:55,164
What did he mean,

1080
02:25:55,248 --> 02:25:57,625
“Stir the bodies”?

1081
02:25:58,167 --> 02:26:02,755
I entered the cremation chamber.

1082
02:26:02,839 --> 02:26:07,468
There was a Jewish prisoner,

1083
02:26:07,552 --> 02:26:11,639
Fischel, who later became
a squad leader.

1084
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:13,891
He looked at me,

1085
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:21,065
and I watched him
poke the fire with a long rod.

1086
02:26:21,649 --> 02:26:25,403
He told me, “Do as I'm doing

1087
02:26:25,486 --> 02:26:28,656
or the SS Will kill you.”

1088
02:26:29,282 --> 02:26:32,869
I picked up a poker

1089
02:26:32,952 --> 02:26:35,663
and did as he was doing.

1090
02:26:35,746 --> 02:26:38,082
A poker?

1091
02:26:38,166 --> 02:26:40,126
A steel poker.

1092
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:44,630
I obeyed Fischel's order.

1093
02:26:44,714 --> 02:26:49,760
At that point I was in shock
as if I'd been hypnotized,

1094
02:26:50,511 --> 02:26:56,309
ready to do

1095
02:26:56,392 --> 02:26:58,895
whatever I was told.

1096
02:26:58,978 --> 02:27:05,693
I was so mindless, so horrified

1097
02:27:05,776 --> 02:27:13,868
that I did everything Fischel told me.

1098
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:17,413
So the ovens were fed,

1099
02:27:18,164 --> 02:27:21,959
but we were so inexperienced

1100
02:27:23,002 --> 02:27:31,469
that we left the fans on too long.

1101
02:27:31,719 --> 02:27:34,764
- The fans?
- Yes.

1102
02:27:34,847 --> 02:27:39,143
There were fans
to make the fire hotter.

1103
02:27:39,602 --> 02:27:43,523
They worked too long...

1104
02:27:43,606 --> 02:27:48,903
The firebrick suddenly exploded,

1105
02:27:49,904 --> 02:27:55,117
blocking the pipes

1106
02:27:55,201 --> 02:27:58,621
linking the Auschwitz crematorium

1107
02:27:59,413 --> 02:28:02,708
with the smokestack.

1108
02:28:04,627 --> 02:28:08,839
<i>Cremation was interrupted.</i>

1109
02:28:09,465 --> 02:28:13,135
<i>The ovens were out of action.</i>

1110
02:28:15,721 --> 02:28:20,184
<i>That evening, some trucks came,</i>

1111
02:28:20,601 --> 02:28:22,895
<i>and we had to load the rest,</i>

1112
02:28:22,979 --> 02:28:26,065
<i>some 300 bodies,</i>

1113
02:28:26,148 --> 02:28:29,068
<i>into the trucks.</i>

1114
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:34,156
<i>Then we were taken...</i>

1115
02:28:36,158 --> 02:28:39,245
<i>I still don't know where...</i>

1116
02:28:39,328 --> 02:28:44,292
<i>but probably to a field at Birkenau.</i>

1117
02:28:48,588 --> 02:28:55,011
<i>We were ordered
to unload the bodies</i>

1118
02:28:55,344 --> 02:29:01,726
<i>and put them in a pit.</i>

1119
02:29:02,310 --> 02:29:06,272
<i>There was a ditch, an artificial pit.</i>

1120
02:29:06,355 --> 02:29:09,900
<i>Suddenly, water gushed up
from underground</i>

1121
02:29:09,984 --> 02:29:13,195
<i>and swept the bodies down.</i>

1122
02:29:18,659 --> 02:29:23,581
<i>When night came,
we had to stop that horrible work.</i>

1123
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:27,043
<i>We were loaded into the trucks</i>

1124
02:29:27,126 --> 02:29:31,547
<i>and returned to Auschwitz.</i>

1125
02:29:36,177 --> 02:29:37,845
<i>The next day,</i>

1126
02:29:38,137 --> 02:29:44,769
<i>we were taken to the same place.</i>

1127
02:29:52,568 --> 02:29:55,571
<i>But the water had risen.</i>

1128
02:29:57,239 --> 02:30:01,118
<i>Some SS men came
with a fire truck</i>

1129
02:30:01,202 --> 02:30:04,705
<i>and pumped out the water.</i>

1130
02:30:05,956 --> 02:30:10,002
<i>We had to go down
into that muddy pit</i>

1131
02:30:10,086 --> 02:30:13,798
<i>to stack up the bodies.</i>

1132
02:30:17,093 --> 02:30:18,844
But they were slimy.

1133
02:30:18,928 --> 02:30:23,349
For example, I grasped a woman,

1134
02:30:23,432 --> 02:30:25,768
but her hands...

1135
02:30:25,851 --> 02:30:28,187
Her hand was slippery, slimy.

1136
02:30:28,270 --> 02:30:30,856
I tried to pull her,

1137
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:37,613
but I fell over backward,
into the water, the mud.

1138
02:30:39,198 --> 02:30:41,701
It was the same for all of us.

1139
02:30:41,784 --> 02:30:47,873
Up above, at the edge of the pit,
Aumeyer and Grabner yelled,

1140
02:30:47,957 --> 02:30:51,961
“Get cracking, you filth, you bastards!

1141
02:30:52,044 --> 02:30:56,716
We'll show you, you bunch of shits!”

1142
02:30:56,799 --> 02:30:59,969
These were the names they were calling us.

1143
02:31:00,302 --> 02:31:02,138
And in these...

1144
02:31:07,768 --> 02:31:10,354
how shall I say?
...circumstances,

1145
02:31:11,731 --> 02:31:16,652
2 of my “friends”
couldn't take any more.

1146
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:19,488
One was a French student.

1147
02:31:21,490 --> 02:31:24,785
All Jews! They were exhausted.

1148
02:31:30,666 --> 02:31:33,836
They just lay there...

1149
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:37,590
in the mud.

1150
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:41,761
Aumeyer called one of his SS men.

1151
02:31:41,844 --> 02:31:45,681
“Go on, finish off those swine!”

1152
02:31:48,642 --> 02:31:53,189
They were exhausted.
And they were shot in the pit.

1153
02:31:59,153 --> 02:32:04,533
<i>There was no crematorium
at Birkenau then?</i>

1154
02:32:05,242 --> 02:32:09,705
<i>No, there weren't any there yet.</i>

1155
02:32:11,373 --> 02:32:14,376
<i>Birkenau still wasn't completely set up.</i>

1156
02:32:14,877 --> 02:32:20,299
<i>Only Camp BI, which was
the late women's camp, existed.</i>

1157
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:30,476
<i>It wasn't until the spring of 1943</i>

1158
02:32:30,559 --> 02:32:36,065
<i>that skilled workmen
and unskilled laborers, all Jews,</i>

1159
02:32:36,148 --> 02:32:38,734
<i>must have gone to work here</i>

1160
02:32:38,818 --> 02:32:42,029
<i>and built the 4 crematorium.</i>

1161
02:32:45,574 --> 02:32:48,786
<i>Each crematorium had 15 ovens,</i>

1162
02:32:49,912 --> 02:32:54,750
<i>a big undressing room,
around 3,000 square feet,</i>

1163
02:32:55,584 --> 02:32:57,837
<i>and a big gas chamber</i>

1164
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:02,550
<i>where up to 3,000 people at once
could be gassed.</i>

1165
02:33:05,261 --> 02:33:06,720
TREBLINKA

1166
02:33:06,804 --> 02:33:12,101
<i>The new gas chambers
were built in September 1942.</i>

1167
02:33:12,601 --> 02:33:14,937
<i>Who built them?</i>

1168
02:33:15,437 --> 02:33:23,195
<i>Hackenhold and Lambert supervised
the Jews who did the work,</i>

1169
02:33:23,445 --> 02:33:25,990
<i>the bricklaying, at least.</i>

1170
02:33:27,449 --> 02:33:33,747
<i>Ukrainian carpenters made the doors.</i>

1171
02:33:35,583 --> 02:33:39,295
<i>The gas chamber doors themselves</i>

1172
02:33:39,378 --> 02:33:43,507
<i>were armored bunker doors.</i>

1173
02:33:43,591 --> 02:33:47,511
<i>I think they were brought
from Bialystok,</i>

1174
02:33:47,595 --> 02:33:50,180
<i>from some Russian bunkers.</i>

1175
02:33:53,851 --> 02:33:55,936
FRANZ SUCHOMEL

1176
02:33:56,020 --> 02:34:00,190
What was the capacity
of the new gas chambers?

1177
02:34:00,274 --> 02:34:02,901
There were <i>2</i> of them, right?
- Yes.

1178
02:34:02,985 --> 02:34:09,158
But the old ones
hadn't been demolished.

1179
02:34:10,659 --> 02:34:14,955
When there were a lot of trains,
a lot of people,

1180
02:34:15,039 --> 02:34:18,584
the old ovens
were put back into service.

1181
02:34:20,419 --> 02:34:25,799
And here... the Jews say
there were 5 on each side.

1182
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:28,260
I say there were 4,

1183
02:34:28,510 --> 02:34:30,763
but I'm not sure.

1184
02:34:30,846 --> 02:34:34,350
In any case, only the upper row,

1185
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:37,978
on this side,

1186
02:34:38,854 --> 02:34:41,815
was in action.

1187
02:34:41,899 --> 02:34:44,276
Why not the other side?

1188
02:34:44,360 --> 02:34:51,075
Disposing of the bodies
would have been too complicated.

1189
02:34:51,784 --> 02:34:53,285
- Too far?
- Yes.

1190
02:34:53,369 --> 02:34:59,208
Up there,
Wirth had built the death camp,

1191
02:34:59,750 --> 02:35:06,256
assigning a detail
of Jewish workers to it.

1192
02:35:07,049 --> 02:35:10,678
The detail had a fixed number in it,

1193
02:35:10,761 --> 02:35:13,931
around 200 people,

1194
02:35:17,101 --> 02:35:21,188
who worked only in the death camp.

1195
02:35:21,271 --> 02:35:25,943
But what was the capacity
of the new gas chambers?

1196
02:35:27,111 --> 02:35:30,614
The new gas chambers... Let's see...

1197
02:35:31,448 --> 02:35:36,120
They could finish off 3,000 people
in two hours.

1198
02:35:38,831 --> 02:35:43,836
How many people at once
in a single gas chamber?

1199
02:35:44,128 --> 02:35:47,297
I can't say exactly.

1200
02:35:47,381 --> 02:35:49,758
The Jews say 200.

1201
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:53,178
- 200?
- That's right, 200.

1202
02:35:54,430 --> 02:36:00,185
Imagine a room this size.

1203
02:36:00,269 --> 02:36:02,396
They put more in at Auschwitz.

1204
02:36:02,646 --> 02:36:05,149
Auschwitz was a factory!

1205
02:36:07,109 --> 02:36:09,403
And Treblinka?

1206
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:12,823
<i>I'll</i> give you my definition.

1207
02:36:13,657 --> 02:36:15,367
Keep this in mind:

1208
02:36:15,451 --> 02:36:20,998
Treblinka was a primitive,

1209
02:36:21,665 --> 02:36:27,921
but efficient production line of death.

1210
02:36:28,255 --> 02:36:31,049
- A production line?
- Of death.

1211
02:36:32,009 --> 02:36:34,178
Understand?
- Yes.

1212
02:36:38,515 --> 02:36:42,978
But primitive...?
- Primitive, yes.

1213
02:36:43,854 --> 02:36:48,776
But it worked well,
that production line of death.

1214
02:36:49,026 --> 02:36:52,237
Was Belzec even more rudimentary?

1215
02:36:52,321 --> 02:36:55,741
Belzec was the laboratory.

1216
02:36:55,824 --> 02:37:00,204
Wirth was camp commandant.

1217
02:37:01,538 --> 02:37:06,210
He tried everything imaginable there.

1218
02:37:07,211 --> 02:37:10,756
He got off on the wrong foot.

1219
02:37:10,839 --> 02:37:12,841
The pits were overﬂowing,

1220
02:37:12,925 --> 02:37:18,680
and the cesspool seeped out
in front of the SS mess hall.

1221
02:37:18,764 --> 02:37:20,432
It stank...

1222
02:37:21,433 --> 02:37:24,812
in front of the mess-hall,
in front of their barracks.

1223
02:37:25,229 --> 02:37:28,065
- Were you at Belzec?
- No.

1224
02:37:28,690 --> 02:37:31,735
Wirth with his own men.

1225
02:37:32,361 --> 02:37:35,322
With Franz, with Oberhauser

1226
02:37:35,906 --> 02:37:37,658
and Hackenhold...

1227
02:37:37,741 --> 02:37:39,743
he tried everything there.

1228
02:37:40,744 --> 02:37:47,000
Those 3 had to put the bodies
in the pits themselves

1229
02:37:48,043 --> 02:37:53,924
so that Wirth could see
how much space he needed.

1230
02:37:54,925 --> 02:37:58,095
And when they rebelled...

1231
02:37:58,512 --> 02:37:59,721
Franz refused...

1232
02:37:59,805 --> 02:38:02,808
Wirth beat Franz with a whip.

1233
02:38:02,891 --> 02:38:05,644
He whipped Hackenhold, too. You see?

1234
02:38:05,727 --> 02:38:08,146
- Kurt Franz?
- Kurt Franz.

1235
02:38:10,065 --> 02:38:11,567
That's how Wirth was.

1236
02:38:11,650 --> 02:38:15,279
Then, with that experience behind him,

1237
02:38:16,697 --> 02:38:18,282
he came to Treblinka.

1238
02:39:58,006 --> 02:40:05,055
Excuse me. How many quarts
of beer a day do you sell?

1239
02:40:07,849 --> 02:40:10,102
You can't tell me?

1240
02:40:12,229 --> 02:40:15,899
I'd rather not.
I have my reasons.

1241
02:40:16,233 --> 02:40:17,734
But why not?

1242
02:40:18,568 --> 02:40:20,696
<i>Two Pilsners.</i>

1243
02:40:24,866 --> 02:40:31,123
How many quarts of beer a day
do you sell?

1244
02:40:33,208 --> 02:40:35,836
- Go on, tell him.
- Tell him what?

1245
02:40:35,919 --> 02:40:39,089
Just tell him approximately.

1246
02:40:39,339 --> 02:40:42,801
How many quarts of beer a day
do you sell?

1247
02:40:42,884 --> 02:40:44,011
400, 500 quarts.

1248
02:40:44,094 --> 02:40:46,722
- What?
- 400, 500 quarts.

1249
02:40:49,266 --> 02:40:50,809
That's a lot!

1250
02:40:57,274 --> 02:41:00,152
Have you worked here long?

1251
02:41:01,611 --> 02:41:04,406
Around 20 years.

1252
02:41:06,450 --> 02:41:09,745
- Why are you hiding...
- I have my reasons.

1253
02:41:09,828 --> 02:41:12,998
- Your face?
- I have my reasons.

1254
02:41:13,248 --> 02:41:15,167
What reasons?

1255
02:41:17,169 --> 02:41:20,338
- Never mind.
- Why not?

1256
02:41:33,643 --> 02:41:35,812
Do you recognize this man?

1257
02:41:38,356 --> 02:41:39,649
No?

1258
02:41:39,983 --> 02:41:41,777
Christian Wirth?

1259
02:41:41,860 --> 02:41:43,653
Mr. Oberhauser!

1260
02:41:44,154 --> 02:41:46,073
Do you remember Belzec?

1261
02:41:47,365 --> 02:41:49,993
No memories of Belzec?

1262
02:41:57,834 --> 02:42:05,175
Of the overﬂowing graves?

1263
02:42:16,228 --> 02:42:18,188
You don't remember?

1264
02:42:24,361 --> 02:42:29,241
MUNICH

1265
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:40,669
WUPPERTALI ANTON SPIESS,

1266
02:42:40,877 --> 02:42:45,132
German state prosecutor
at the Treblinka trial (Frankfurt, 1960)

1267
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:55,934
<i>When the Action itself
first got under way,</i>

1268
02:42:56,017 --> 02:42:59,062
<i>it was almost totally improvised.</i>

1269
02:43:02,232 --> 02:43:06,778
<i>At Treblinka, for example,</i>

1270
02:43:06,862 --> 02:43:11,950
<i>the commandant, Dr. Eberl,
let more trains come in</i>

1271
02:43:12,033 --> 02:43:16,580
<i>than the camp could handle.</i>

1272
02:43:17,205 --> 02:43:19,291
<i>It was a disaster!</i>

1273
02:43:19,374 --> 02:43:21,501
<i>Mountains of corpses!</i>

1274
02:43:22,085 --> 02:43:27,007
<i>Word of this foul-up</i>

1275
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:31,178
<i>reached the head of the Reinhard Action,</i>

1276
02:43:31,261 --> 02:43:34,681
<i>00770 G/oboczn/k, in Lub//n.</i>

1277
02:43:34,764 --> 02:43:37,559
He went to Treblinka

1278
02:43:37,642 --> 02:43:42,522
to see what was happening.

1279
02:43:42,606 --> 02:43:46,693
There's a very concrete
account of the trip

1280
02:43:46,776 --> 02:43:50,864
by his former driver, Oberhauser.

1281
02:43:50,947 --> 02:43:53,992
Globocznik arrived
on a hot day in August.

1282
02:43:54,075 --> 02:43:59,080
The camp was permeated

1283
02:44:00,081 --> 02:44:03,877
with the stench of rotting ﬂesh.

1284
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:10,800
Globocznik didn't even bother
to enter the camp.

1285
02:44:10,884 --> 02:44:13,762
He stopped here,
before the commandant's office,

1286
02:44:13,845 --> 02:44:15,931
sent for Dr. Eberl

1287
02:44:16,014 --> 02:44:20,435
and greeted him with these words,

1288
02:44:20,518 --> 02:44:24,648
“How dare you accept
so many every day

1289
02:44:24,731 --> 02:44:27,734
when you can only process 3,000?”

1290
02:44:35,992 --> 02:44:38,745
<i>Operations were suspended,</i>

1291
02:44:39,371 --> 02:44:42,874
<i>Eberl was transferred and Wirth came,</i>

1292
02:44:44,167 --> 02:44:46,920
<i>followed immediately by Stangl,</i>

1293
02:44:48,213 --> 02:44:52,384
<i>and the camp was completely reorganized.</i>

1294
02:45:02,102 --> 02:45:06,231
<i>The Reinhard Action
covered 3 extermination camps."</i>

1295
02:45:06,314 --> 02:45:09,859
<i>Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.</i>

1296
02:45:10,235 --> 02:45:15,073
<i>There's also talk of 3 death camps
on the Bug River,</i>

1297
02:45:15,156 --> 02:45:19,369
<i>for they were all located
on or near the Bug.</i>

1298
02:45:23,665 --> 02:45:27,544
<i>The gas chambers
were the heart of the camp.</i>

1299
02:45:29,504 --> 02:45:32,007
<i>They were built first,</i>

1300
02:45:32,382 --> 02:45:36,052
<i>in the woods, or in a field,
as at Treblinka.</i>

1301
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:41,725
<i>The gas chambers were
the only stone buildings.</i>

1302
02:45:42,517 --> 02:45:46,062
<i>All the others were wooden sheds.</i>

1303
02:45:46,563 --> 02:45:50,066
<i>These camps weren't built to last.</i>

1304
02:45:51,401 --> 02:45:56,156
<i>Himmler was in a huny
to begin the 'final solution.</i> ”

1305
02:45:56,239 --> 02:46:00,535
<i>The Germans had to capitalize
on their eastward advance</i>

1306
02:46:00,618 --> 02:46:02,829
<i>and use this remote back-country</i>

1307
02:46:02,912 --> 02:46:10,295
<i>to carry out their mass murder
as secretly as possible.</i>

1308
02:46:15,383 --> 02:46:17,969
<i>So at first they couldn't
manage the perfection</i>

1309
02:46:18,053 --> 02:46:21,139
<i>they achieved 3 months later.</i>

1310
02:46:38,156 --> 02:46:40,950
<i>Near the end of March 1942,</i>

1311
02:46:47,165 --> 02:46:51,252
<i>sizeable groups of Jews
were herded here,</i>

1312
02:46:51,336 --> 02:46:53,463
<i>groups of 50 to 100 people.</i>

1313
02:46:58,927 --> 02:47:00,970
<i>Several trains arrived</i>

1314
02:47:08,269 --> 02:47:12,232
<i>with sections of barracks,
with posts, barbed wire, bricks...</i>

1315
02:47:19,656 --> 02:47:23,535
<i>and construction
of the camp as such began.</i>

1316
02:47:35,213 --> 02:47:37,507
<i>The Jews unloaded these cars</i>

1317
02:47:42,345 --> 02:47:45,682
<i>and carted the sections
of barracks to the camp.</i>

1318
02:47:54,858 --> 02:47:58,611
<i>The Germans made them
work extremely fast.</i>

1319
02:48:09,831 --> 02:48:13,376
<i>When we saw the pace they worked at...</i>

1320
02:48:21,718 --> 02:48:24,095
<i>It was extremely brutal.</i>

1321
02:48:32,604 --> 02:48:36,816
<i>When we saw the complex being built,
and the fence,</i>

1322
02:48:37,066 --> 02:48:40,153
<i>which, after all, enclosed a vast space,</i>

1323
02:48:48,203 --> 02:48:52,207
<i>we realized that
what the Germans were building</i>

1324
02:48:52,290 --> 02:48:55,001
<i>wasn't meant to aid mankind.</i>

1325
02:49:05,261 --> 02:49:07,555
<i>Early in June,</i>

1326
02:49:14,604 --> 02:49:16,773
<i>the first convoy arrived.</i>

1327
02:49:20,360 --> 02:49:22,946
<i>I'd say there were over 40 cars.</i>

1328
02:49:28,910 --> 02:49:32,664
<i>With the convoy
were SS men in black uniforms.</i>

1329
02:49:37,126 --> 02:49:40,922
<i>It happened one afternoon.
He had just finished work.</i>

1330
02:49:41,005 --> 02:49:45,176
JAN PIWONSKI

1331
02:49:45,677 --> 02:49:48,972
But he got on his bicycle and went home.

1332
02:49:50,056 --> 02:49:51,474
Why?

1333
02:50:03,528 --> 02:50:05,363
I merely thought

1334
02:50:06,197 --> 02:50:09,909
these people had come to build the camp,

1335
02:50:10,618 --> 02:50:12,662
as the others had before them.

1336
02:50:14,372 --> 02:50:15,999
That convoy...

1337
02:50:17,542 --> 02:50:21,004
There was no way
of knowing that it was...

1338
02:50:25,008 --> 02:50:27,176
the first earmarked for extermination.

1339
02:50:28,595 --> 02:50:30,179
Besides,

1340
02:50:31,180 --> 02:50:34,517
he couldn't have known that Sobibor

1341
02:50:36,185 --> 02:50:40,857
would be a place for the mass
extermination of the Jews.

1342
02:50:51,284 --> 02:50:55,747
The next morning,
when I came here to work,

1343
02:50:55,997 --> 02:51:00,043
the station was absolutely silent,

1344
02:51:24,692 --> 02:51:29,113
and we realized,

1345
02:51:29,197 --> 02:51:34,911
after talking with the Poles
who worked at the station here,

1346
02:51:36,746 --> 02:51:41,459
that something utterly
incomprehensible had happened.

1347
02:51:47,590 --> 02:51:50,426
First of all, when the camp
was being built,

1348
02:51:56,599 --> 02:51:58,851
there were orders shouted in German,

1349
02:51:59,310 --> 02:52:01,020
there were screams,

1350
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:05,983
Jews were working at the run,
there were shots,

1351
02:52:06,818 --> 02:52:09,946
and here there was that silence,

1352
02:52:15,284 --> 02:52:17,286
no work crews,

1353
02:52:20,790 --> 02:52:22,959
a really total silence.

1354
02:52:31,175 --> 02:52:34,971
40 cars had arrived,
and then... nothing.

1355
02:52:35,179 --> 02:52:37,974
It was all very strange.

1356
02:52:39,308 --> 02:52:41,561
<i>It was the silence that tipped them off?</i>

1357
02:52:41,644 --> 02:52:42,895
<i>That's right.</i>

1358
02:52:42,979 --> 02:52:44,981
<i>Can he describe that silence?</i>

1359
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:49,485
<i>It was a silence...</i>

1360
02:52:50,611 --> 02:52:54,741
<i>Nothing was going on in the camp.
You heard nothing.</i>

1361
02:52:54,824 --> 02:52:56,659
<i>Nothing moved.</i>

1362
02:53:03,499 --> 02:53:06,502
<i>So then they began to wonder,</i>

1363
02:53:09,922 --> 02:53:13,217
<i>“Where have they put those Jews?”</i>

1364
02:53:17,930 --> 02:53:22,852
<i>Cell 13, Block 11 at Auschwitz 1,</i>

1365
02:53:22,935 --> 02:53:26,355
<i>is where
the Special Work Detail was held.</i>

1366
02:53:28,441 --> 02:53:32,028
<i>The cell was underground, isolated.</i>

1367
02:53:32,987 --> 02:53:36,407
<i>For we were...</i>

1368
02:53:37,950 --> 02:53:39,994
<i>“bearers of secrets,”</i>

1369
02:53:41,496 --> 02:53:43,873
<i>we were reprieved dead men.</i>

1370
02:53:45,875 --> 02:53:49,003
<i>We weren't allowed to talk to anyone,</i>

1371
02:53:49,212 --> 02:53:52,006
<i>or contact any prisoner,</i>

1372
02:53:52,548 --> 02:53:55,468
<i>even the SS.</i>

1373
02:53:55,718 --> 02:53:59,931
<i>Only those in charge of the “Action.”</i>

1374
02:54:03,935 --> 02:54:06,062
<i>There was a window.</i>

1375
02:54:06,896 --> 02:54:10,525
<i>We heard what happened in the courtyard.</i>

1376
02:54:12,235 --> 02:54:14,487
<i>The executions,</i>

1377
02:54:15,530 --> 02:54:18,783
<i>the victims' cries, the screams,</i>

1378
02:54:19,492 --> 02:54:21,661
<i>but we couldn't see anything.</i>

1379
02:54:27,542 --> 02:54:30,127
<i>This went on for several days.</i>

1380
02:54:31,504 --> 02:54:35,591
<i>One night an SS man came</i>

1381
02:54:36,509 --> 02:54:38,719
<i>from the political section.</i>

1382
02:54:40,513 --> 02:54:46,227
<i>It was around 4 A.M.</i>

1383
02:54:50,439 --> 02:54:55,736
<i>The whole camp was still asleep.</i>

1384
02:54:58,281 --> 02:55:01,158
<i>There wasn't a sound in the camp.</i>

1385
02:55:09,625 --> 02:55:14,881
<i>We were again taken out of our cell</i>

1386
02:55:16,924 --> 02:55:19,802
<i>and led to the crematorium.</i>

1387
02:55:25,182 --> 02:55:29,061
<i>There, for the first time,
I saw the procedure used</i>

1388
02:55:29,145 --> 02:55:33,274
<i>with those who came in alive.</i>

1389
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:36,569
<i>We were lined up against a wall</i>

1390
02:55:36,652 --> 02:55:40,531
<i>and told, “No one may talk
to those people.”</i>

1391
02:55:44,493 --> 02:55:49,582
<i>Suddenly, the wooden door
to the crematorium courtyard opened,</i>

1392
02:55:49,665 --> 02:55:55,463
<i>and 250 to 300 people filed in:</i>

1393
02:55:55,546 --> 02:55:58,841
<i>old people, and women.</i>

1394
02:56:01,177 --> 02:56:04,972
<i>They carried bundles,
wore the Star of David.</i>

1395
02:56:06,974 --> 02:56:09,685
<i>Even from a distance, I could tell</i>

1396
02:56:09,769 --> 02:56:13,314
<i>they were Polish Jews,</i>

1397
02:56:14,899 --> 02:56:18,486
<i>probably from Upper Silesia,</i>

1398
02:56:18,694 --> 02:56:23,699
<i>from the Sosnowiec ghetto,
some 20 miles from Auschwitz.</i>

1399
02:56:25,910 --> 02:56:27,286
FILIP MULLER

1400
02:56:27,370 --> 02:56:32,583
I caught some of the things they said.

1401
02:56:33,709 --> 02:56:35,544
I heard “fachowitz,”

1402
02:56:35,628 --> 02:56:38,047
meaning “skilled worker.”

1403
02:56:38,464 --> 02:56:41,384
And “Malach-ha-Mavis,”

1404
02:56:42,134 --> 02:56:45,179
which means
“the angel of death” in Yiddish.

1405
02:56:47,974 --> 02:56:51,268
Also, “harginnen”:
“They're going to kill us.”

1406
02:56:54,730 --> 02:56:58,651
From what I could hear,

1407
02:56:58,901 --> 02:57:03,155
I clearly understood
the struggle going on inside them.

1408
02:57:03,406 --> 02:57:05,658
Sometimes they spoke of work

1409
02:57:05,741 --> 02:57:10,246
probably hoping
that they'd be put to work.

1410
02:57:11,414 --> 02:57:15,751
Or they spoke of “Malach-ha-Mavis,”
the angel of death.

1411
02:57:17,336 --> 02:57:21,590
The conﬂicting words echoed
the conﬂict in their feelings.

1412
02:57:22,341 --> 02:57:25,886
Then a sudden silence

1413
02:57:26,429 --> 02:57:30,683
fell over those gathered
in the crematorium courtyard.

1414
02:57:33,310 --> 02:57:36,439
<i>All eyes converged</i>

1415
02:57:37,189 --> 02:57:40,735
<i>on the ﬂat roof of the crematorium.</i>

1416
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:46,532
<i>Who was standing there?</i>

1417
02:57:46,615 --> 02:57:48,951
<i>Aumeyer, of the SS,</i>

1418
02:57:49,869 --> 02:57:52,663
<i>Grabner,
the head of the political section,</i>

1419
02:57:53,247 --> 02:57:55,958
<i>and Hossler, the SS officer.</i>

1420
02:57:57,084 --> 02:58:00,463
<i>Aumeyer addressed the crowd,</i>

1421
02:58:02,423 --> 02:58:06,052
<i>“You're here to work,</i>

1422
02:58:06,135 --> 02:58:11,057
<i>for our soldiers fighting at the front.</i>

1423
02:58:13,309 --> 02:58:16,270
Those who can work will be all right.”

1424
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:25,071
it was obvious
that hope ﬂared in those people.

1425
02:58:25,154 --> 02:58:29,158
You could feel it clearly.

1426
02:58:30,409 --> 02:58:33,996
The executioners had gotten
past the first obstacle.

1427
02:58:34,997 --> 02:58:38,459
They saw it was succeeding.

1428
02:58:40,336 --> 02:58:42,671
Then Grabner spoke up,

1429
02:58:44,006 --> 02:58:48,677
“We need masons, electricians,

1430
02:58:49,345 --> 02:58:51,555
all the trades.”

1431
02:58:52,515 --> 02:58:56,852
Next, Hossler took over.

1432
02:58:58,020 --> 02:59:02,691
He pointed to a short man in the crowd.

1433
02:59:02,775 --> 02:59:04,860
I can still see him.

1434
02:59:04,944 --> 02:59:06,779
“What's your trade?”

1435
02:59:06,862 --> 02:59:08,280
The man said,

1436
02:59:08,364 --> 02:59:11,700
“Mr. Officer, I'm a tailor.”

1437
02:59:12,493 --> 02:59:16,038
“A tailor? What kind of tailor?”

1438
02:59:17,248 --> 02:59:21,544
“A man's... No, for both men and women.”

1439
02:59:21,627 --> 02:59:26,882
“Wonderful! We need people
like you in our workshops.”

1440
02:59:29,051 --> 02:59:32,054
<i>Then he questioned a woman,</i>

1441
02:59:32,805 --> 02:59:35,474
<i>“What's your trade?”</i>

1442
02:59:36,100 --> 02:59:38,644
<i>“Nurse,” she replied.</i>

1443
02:59:38,727 --> 02:59:45,234
<i>“Splendid! We need nurses
in our hospitals for our soldiers.</i>

1444
02:59:45,568 --> 02:59:49,947
<i>We need all of you!
But first, undress.</i>

1445
02:59:50,823 --> 02:59:53,742
<i>You must be disinfected.</i>

1446
02:59:53,951 --> 02:59:57,163
<i>We want you healthy.”</i>

1447
02:59:59,665 --> 03:00:03,043
<i>I could see the people were calmer,</i>

1448
03:00:03,669 --> 03:00:07,923
<i>reassured by what they'd heard,</i>

1449
03:00:08,632 --> 03:00:11,760
<i>and they began to undress.</i>

1450
03:00:13,637 --> 03:00:16,098
<i>Even if they still had their doubts,</i>

1451
03:00:16,932 --> 03:00:19,935
<i>if you want to live, you must hope.</i>

1452
03:00:25,566 --> 03:00:29,153
<i>Their clothing remained
in the courtyard,</i>

1453
03:00:29,987 --> 03:00:32,656
<i>scattered everywhere.</i>

1454
03:00:33,866 --> 03:00:36,535
<i>Aumeyer was beaming,</i>

1455
03:00:36,619 --> 03:00:40,539
<i>very proud of how he'd handled things.</i>

1456
03:00:40,623 --> 03:00:45,169
<i>He turned to some of the SS men
and told them,</i>

1457
03:00:45,252 --> 03:00:48,422
<i>“You see? That's the way to do it!”</i>

1458
03:00:49,882 --> 03:00:52,009
<i>By this device,</i>

1459
03:00:52,259 --> 03:00:58,307
<i>a great leap fon/vard had been made:</i>

1460
03:00:58,933 --> 03:01:02,311
<i>Now the clothing could be used.</i>

1461
03:01:06,482 --> 03:01:09,777
RAUL H I LBERG, historian

1462
03:11:45,328 --> 03:11:48,456
FRANZ SCHALLING

1463
03:11:53,628 --> 03:11:57,132
<i>First, explain to me...</i>

1464
03:11:57,591 --> 03:12:02,012
<i>how you came to Kulmhof, to Chelmno.</i>

1465
03:12:02,804 --> 03:12:04,890
<i>You were at Lodz, right?</i>

1466
03:12:05,223 --> 03:12:07,058
<i>In Lodz, yes.</i>

1467
03:12:07,142 --> 03:12:08,852
<i>In Litzmannstadt.</i>

1468
03:12:09,477 --> 03:12:13,982
<i>We were on permanent guard duty.</i>

1469
03:12:14,816 --> 03:12:17,444
<i>Protecting military objectives: mills,</i>

1470
03:12:17,944 --> 03:12:21,573
<i>the roads,
when Hitler went to East Prussia.</i>

1471
03:12:22,282 --> 03:12:25,160
<i>It was dreary, and we were told,</i>

1472
03:12:25,493 --> 03:12:30,957
<i>“We're looking for men who want
to break out of this routine.”</i>

1473
03:12:31,041 --> 03:12:33,209
<i>So we volunteered.</i>

1474
03:12:34,836 --> 03:12:37,547
<i>We were issued winter uniforms,</i>

1475
03:12:38,006 --> 03:12:42,427
<i>overcoats, fur hats, fur-lined boots,</i>

1476
03:12:43,303 --> 03:12:47,849
<i>and 2 or 3 days later
we were told, “We're off!”</i>

1477
03:12:48,850 --> 03:12:52,437
<i>We were put aboard 2 or 3 trucks...
I don't know...</i>

1478
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:56,775
<i>They had benches,</i>

1479
03:12:57,442 --> 03:12:59,277
<i>and we rode and rode.</i>

1480
03:12:59,527 --> 03:13:02,030
<i>Finally we arrived.</i>

1481
03:13:03,865 --> 03:13:07,327
<i>The place was crawling
with SS men and police.</i>

1482
03:13:07,410 --> 03:13:11,206
<i>Our first question was,
“What goes on here?”</i>

1483
03:13:11,706 --> 03:13:14,668
<i>They said, “You'll find out!”</i>

1484
03:13:14,751 --> 03:13:17,921
<i>- You'll find out?
- You'll find out.</i>

1485
03:13:20,048 --> 03:13:23,385
<i>- You weren't in the SS, you were...
- Police.</i>

1486
03:13:23,468 --> 03:13:27,138
- <i>Which police ?</i>
- <i>Security guards.</i>

1487
03:13:27,931 --> 03:13:32,185
We were ordered
to report to the Deutsche Haus,

1488
03:13:32,268 --> 03:13:36,398
the only big stone building
in the village.

1489
03:13:37,524 --> 03:13:39,484
We were taken into it.

1490
03:13:40,527 --> 03:13:42,862
An SS man immediately told us,

1491
03:13:42,946 --> 03:13:46,032
“This is a top secret mission!”

1492
03:13:46,241 --> 03:13:48,827
- Secret?
- “A top secret mission.”

1493
03:13:48,910 --> 03:13:50,495
“Sign this!”

1494
03:13:50,578 --> 03:13:52,580
We each had to sign.

1495
03:13:52,664 --> 03:13:56,459
There was a form ready for each of us.

1496
03:13:59,421 --> 03:14:01,715
What did it say?

1497
03:14:01,798 --> 03:14:05,010
It was a pledge of secrecy.

1498
03:14:05,093 --> 03:14:07,846
We never even got to read it through.

1499
03:14:07,929 --> 03:14:10,223
You had to take an oath?

1500
03:14:10,306 --> 03:14:13,268
No, just sign,

1501
03:14:13,935 --> 03:14:17,022
promising to shut up
about whatever we'd see.

1502
03:14:17,105 --> 03:14:19,733
- Shut up?
- Not say a word.

1503
03:14:20,400 --> 03:14:24,529
After we'd signed, we were told,

1504
03:14:25,113 --> 03:14:26,906
“Final solution of the Jewish question.”

1505
03:14:26,990 --> 03:14:30,994
We didn't understand what that meant.

1506
03:14:31,077 --> 03:14:32,871
So someone said...

1507
03:14:32,954 --> 03:14:36,082
He told us what was going
to happen there.

1508
03:14:36,166 --> 03:14:40,003
Someone said, “the final solution
of the Jewish question.”

1509
03:14:40,086 --> 03:14:44,424
You'd be assigned to the “final solution”?

1510
03:14:44,507 --> 03:14:47,302
Yes, but what did that mean?

1511
03:14:47,385 --> 03:14:49,471
We'd never heard that before.

1512
03:14:49,679 --> 03:14:51,723
So it was explained to us.

1513
03:14:51,806 --> 03:14:54,017
Just when was this?

1514
03:14:54,100 --> 03:14:56,644
Let's see... when was it...?

1515
03:14:57,979 --> 03:15:00,982
<i>In the winter of 1941-42.</i>

1516
03:15:07,363 --> 03:15:10,366
<i>Then we were assigned to our stations.</i>

1517
03:15:10,617 --> 03:15:14,245
<i>Our guard post was
at the side of the road.</i>

1518
03:15:14,621 --> 03:15:17,373
<i>A sentry box in front of the castle.</i>

1519
03:15:17,832 --> 03:15:21,503
<i>So you were in the “castle detail”?</i>

1520
03:15:24,339 --> 03:15:26,216
<i>That's right.</i>

1521
03:15:27,383 --> 03:15:31,346
<i>Can you describe what you saw?</i>

1522
03:15:32,806 --> 03:15:35,934
<i>We could see.
We were at the gatehouse.</i>

1523
03:15:36,851 --> 03:15:41,564
<i>When the Jews arrived,
the way they looked:</i>

1524
03:15:41,648 --> 03:15:46,152
<i>half-frozen, starved, dirty,
already half-dead.</i>

1525
03:15:46,236 --> 03:15:49,072
<i>Old people, children.</i>

1526
03:15:50,198 --> 03:15:55,578
<i>Think of it! The long trip here
standing in a truck, packed in!</i>

1527
03:15:57,205 --> 03:16:00,166
<i>Who knows if they knew
what was in store!</i>

1528
03:16:00,917 --> 03:16:03,336
<i>They didn't trust anyone,
that's for sure.</i>

1529
03:16:03,419 --> 03:16:06,631
<i>After months in the ghetto,
you can imagine!</i>

1530
03:16:09,592 --> 03:16:12,345
<i>I heard an SS man shout at them,</i>

1531
03:16:12,554 --> 03:16:15,098
<i>“You're going to be deloused</i>

1532
03:16:15,890 --> 03:16:18,226
<i>and have a bath.</i>

1533
03:16:18,726 --> 03:16:20,728
<i>You're going to work here.”</i>

1534
03:16:21,229 --> 03:16:24,524
<i>The Jews consented.</i>

1535
03:16:24,607 --> 03:16:27,902
<i>They said,
“Yes, that's what we want to do.”</i>

1536
03:16:29,571 --> 03:16:31,990
<i>Was the castle big?</i>

1537
03:16:33,449 --> 03:16:36,411
<i>Pretty big, with huge front steps.</i>

1538
03:16:36,494 --> 03:16:41,332
<i>The SS man stood at the top of the steps.</i>

1539
03:16:42,750 --> 03:16:45,211
<i>Then what happened?</i>

1540
03:16:45,587 --> 03:16:50,341
<i>They were hustled into
2 or 3 big rooms on the first ﬂoor.</i>

1541
03:16:50,967 --> 03:16:54,345
<i>They had to undress, give up everything:</i>

1542
03:16:54,429 --> 03:16:57,098
<i>rings, gold, everything.</i>

1543
03:16:59,934 --> 03:17:03,313
<i>How long did the Jews stay there?</i>

1544
03:17:03,771 --> 03:17:06,191
<i>Long enough to undress.</i>

1545
03:17:06,649 --> 03:17:09,068
<i>Then, stark naked,</i>

1546
03:17:09,152 --> 03:17:13,364
<i>they had to run down more steps</i>

1547
03:17:14,449 --> 03:17:16,534
<i>to an underground corridor</i>

1548
03:17:17,619 --> 03:17:21,289
<i>that led back up to the ramp,
where the gas van awaited them.</i>

1549
03:17:23,416 --> 03:17:27,837
<i>Did the Jews enter the van willingly?</i>

1550
03:17:29,464 --> 03:17:31,841
<i>No, they were beaten.</i>

1551
03:17:32,342 --> 03:17:36,387
<i>Blows fell everywhere,
and the Jews understood.</i>

1552
03:17:36,471 --> 03:17:38,014
<i>They screamed.</i>

1553
03:17:38,348 --> 03:17:40,225
<i>It was frightful!</i>

1554
03:17:40,975 --> 03:17:42,727
<i>F rightful!</i>

1555
03:17:44,812 --> 03:17:47,774
<i>I know, because
we went down to the cellar</i>

1556
03:17:47,857 --> 03:17:50,109
<i>when they were all in the van.</i>

1557
03:17:50,193 --> 03:17:56,074
<i>We opened the cells of the work detail,</i>

1558
03:17:56,157 --> 03:17:58,493
<i>the Jewish workers</i>

1559
03:17:58,576 --> 03:18:03,164
<i>who collected the things thrown out
of the 1st-ﬂoor window into there.</i>

1560
03:18:05,333 --> 03:18:07,752
<i>Describe the gas vans.</i>

1561
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:11,089
<i>Like moving vans.</i>

1562
03:18:11,464 --> 03:18:13,383
<i>Very big?</i>

1563
03:18:13,466 --> 03:18:15,885
<i>They stretched, say,</i>

1564
03:18:16,177 --> 03:18:18,763
<i>from here to the window.</i>

1565
03:18:18,846 --> 03:18:20,932
<i>Just big trucks,</i>

1566
03:18:21,015 --> 03:18:24,352
<i>like moving vans, with 2 rear doors.</i>

1567
03:18:27,188 --> 03:18:29,732
What system was used?

1568
03:18:29,816 --> 03:18:33,861
How did they kill them?

1569
03:18:34,195 --> 03:18:37,365
- With exhaust fumes.
- Exhaust fumes?

1570
03:18:37,865 --> 03:18:42,996
It went like this:
A Pole yelled, “Gas!”

1571
03:18:43,079 --> 03:18:48,334
Then the driver got under the van
to hook up the pipe

1572
03:18:49,377 --> 03:18:54,465
that fed the gas into the van.

1573
03:18:54,549 --> 03:18:57,677
- Yes, but how?
- From the motor.

1574
03:18:57,760 --> 03:19:00,138
Yes, but through what?

1575
03:19:00,221 --> 03:19:02,515
A pipe... a tube.

1576
03:19:02,598 --> 03:19:05,435
He fiddled around under the truck.

1577
03:19:05,518 --> 03:19:07,729
I'm not sure how.

1578
03:19:08,813 --> 03:19:11,774
It was just exhaust gas?

1579
03:19:12,775 --> 03:19:14,485
That's all.

1580
03:19:18,239 --> 03:19:20,575
Who were the drivers?

1581
03:19:22,243 --> 03:19:23,953
SS men.

1582
03:19:24,037 --> 03:19:27,206
All those men were SS.

1583
03:19:27,290 --> 03:19:30,376
Were there many of these drivers?

1584
03:19:30,585 --> 03:19:32,128
I don't know.

1585
03:19:32,211 --> 03:19:34,839
Were there 2, 3, 5, 10?

1586
03:19:35,298 --> 03:19:38,760
Not that many.
<i>2</i> or 3, that's all.

1587
03:19:38,843 --> 03:19:41,262
I think there were <i>2</i> vans,

1588
03:19:41,888 --> 03:19:45,475
one big, one smaller.

1589
03:19:47,268 --> 03:19:51,939
Did the driver sit
in the cabin of the van?

1590
03:19:52,440 --> 03:19:54,359
- Mrs. Uwe?
- No.

1591
03:19:55,443 --> 03:19:59,947
He climbed into the cabin
after the doors were closed

1592
03:20:00,615 --> 03:20:02,909
and started the motor.

1593
03:20:03,534 --> 03:20:07,622
Did he race the motor?

1594
03:20:09,082 --> 03:20:11,793
I don't know.

1595
03:20:12,668 --> 03:20:17,340
Could you hear the sound of the motor?

1596
03:20:18,299 --> 03:20:22,387
Yes, from the gate
we could hear it turn over.

1597
03:20:22,470 --> 03:20:26,516
Was it a loud noise?

1598
03:20:26,599 --> 03:20:30,645
The noise of a truck engine.

1599
03:20:34,023 --> 03:20:38,194
The van was stationary
while the motor ran?

1600
03:20:39,362 --> 03:20:41,322
That's right.

1601
03:20:42,865 --> 03:20:45,660
Then it started moving.

1602
03:20:46,119 --> 03:20:50,248
We opened the gate,
and it headed for the woods.

1603
03:20:50,790 --> 03:20:53,376
Were the people already dead?

1604
03:20:53,459 --> 03:20:55,253
I don't know.

1605
03:20:55,545 --> 03:20:58,131
It was quiet. No more screams.

1606
03:20:58,423 --> 03:20:59,424
No screams.

1607
03:20:59,507 --> 03:21:02,677
You couldn't hear anything
as they drove by.

1608
03:21:16,399 --> 03:21:20,570
<i>He recalls: It was 1941,
2 days before the new year.</i>

1609
03:21:24,365 --> 03:21:26,951
<i>They were routed out at night,</i>

1610
03:21:30,163 --> 03:21:33,541
<i>and in the morning they reached Chelmno.</i>

1611
03:21:39,839 --> 03:21:42,049
<i>There was a castle there.</i>

1612
03:21:50,683 --> 03:21:53,060
<i>When he entered the castle courtyard,</i>

1613
03:21:55,021 --> 03:21:57,607
<i>he knew something awful was going on.</i>

1614
03:21:59,233 --> 03:22:01,319
<i>He already understood.</i>

1615
03:22:01,694 --> 03:22:03,738
THE SITE OF THE CASTLE

1616
03:22:08,075 --> 03:22:11,412
<i>They saw clothes and shoes</i>

1617
03:22:13,581 --> 03:22:15,750
<i>scattered in the courtyard.</i>

1618
03:22:20,254 --> 03:22:23,341
<i>Yet they were alone there.</i>

1619
03:22:23,758 --> 03:22:26,135
<i>He knew his parents
had been through there,</i>

1620
03:22:27,470 --> 03:22:30,681
<i>and there wasn't a Jew left.</i>

1621
03:22:36,270 --> 03:22:38,981
<i>They were taken down into a cellar.</i>

1622
03:22:43,611 --> 03:22:48,157
<i>On a wall was written,
“No one leaves here alive.”</i>

1623
03:22:49,283 --> 03:22:51,327
<i>Graffiti in Yiddish.</i>

1624
03:22:52,787 --> 03:22:55,122
<i>There were lots of names.</i>

1625
03:22:56,624 --> 03:23:00,378
<i>He thinks it was the Jews
from villages around Chelmno</i>

1626
03:23:00,461 --> 03:23:04,131
<i>who had come before him,
who had written their names.</i>

1627
03:23:13,933 --> 03:23:16,143
<i>A few days after New Year's,</i>

1628
03:23:18,813 --> 03:23:22,149
<i>the y heard people arrive
in a truck one morning.</i>

1629
03:23:23,651 --> 03:23:26,153
<i>The people were taken
out of the truck</i>

1630
03:23:28,322 --> 03:23:32,618
<i>and up to the first ﬂoor of the castle.</i>

1631
03:23:33,494 --> 03:23:37,665
<i>The Germans lied,
saying they were to be deloused.</i>

1632
03:23:43,713 --> 03:23:46,924
<i>They were chased down the other side,</i>

1633
03:23:48,843 --> 03:23:50,761
<i>where a van was waiting.</i>

1634
03:23:57,059 --> 03:24:02,231
<i>The Germans pushed
and beat them with their weapons</i>

1635
03:24:02,523 --> 03:24:05,234
<i>to hustle them into the trucks faster.</i>

1636
03:24:23,002 --> 03:24:26,797
<i>He heard people praying, “Shma Israel, ”</i>

1637
03:24:29,967 --> 03:24:32,887
<i>and he heard
the van's rear doors being shut.</i>

1638
03:24:37,892 --> 03:24:40,061
<i>Their screams were heard,</i>

1639
03:24:40,269 --> 03:24:43,397
<i>becoming fainter and fainter,</i>

1640
03:24:46,150 --> 03:24:50,112
<i>and when there was total silence,</i>

1641
03:24:50,363 --> 03:24:52,448
<i>the van left.</i>

1642
03:25:06,045 --> 03:25:11,092
<i>He and the 4 others
were brought out of the cellar.</i>

1643
03:25:11,175 --> 03:25:13,260
<i>They went upstairs</i>

1644
03:25:22,436 --> 03:25:26,190
<i>and gathered up
the clothes remaining</i>

1645
03:25:26,482 --> 03:25:28,984
<i>outside the supposed baths.</i>

1646
03:25:38,452 --> 03:25:40,955
Did he understand then how they'd died?

1647
03:25:41,414 --> 03:25:43,624
MICHAEL PODCHLEBNIK,

1648
03:25:43,916 --> 03:25:48,879
the survivor of the 1st period
of extermination at Chelmno

1649
03:25:49,171 --> 03:25:51,465
(the castle period)

1650
03:25:58,139 --> 03:26:03,060
<i>Yes, first because
there had been rumors of it.</i>

1651
03:26:03,144 --> 03:26:06,313
<i>And when he went out,
he saw the sealed vans,</i>

1652
03:26:07,481 --> 03:26:08,774
<i>so he knew.</i>

1653
03:26:08,858 --> 03:26:14,655
He understood that people
were gassed in the vans?

1654
03:26:28,961 --> 03:26:31,922
<i>Yes, because he'd heard the screams</i>

1655
03:26:32,006 --> 03:26:35,009
<i>and heard how they weakened,</i>

1656
03:26:36,010 --> 03:26:40,431
<i>and later the vans
were taken into the woods.</i>

1657
03:26:40,723 --> 03:26:42,767
What were the vans like?

1658
03:27:10,920 --> 03:27:15,925
<i>Like the ones
that deliver cigarettes here.</i>

1659
03:27:16,425 --> 03:27:20,054
<i>They were enclosed,
with double-leaf rear doors.</i>

1660
03:27:20,137 --> 03:27:21,972
What color?

1661
03:27:27,853 --> 03:27:31,899
<i>The color the Germans used,
green, ordinary.</i>

1662
03:27:34,819 --> 03:27:36,403
MARTHA MICHELSOHN

1663
03:27:36,612 --> 03:27:42,618
How many German families
were there in Kulmhof (Chelmno)?

1664
03:27:42,701 --> 03:27:45,913
10 or 11, I'd say.

1665
03:27:47,998 --> 03:27:52,503
Germans from Volhynia
and <i>2</i> families from the Reich,

1666
03:27:52,586 --> 03:27:55,089
the Bauers and us.

1667
03:27:55,965 --> 03:27:58,259
- And you?
- Us, the Michelsohns.

1668
03:27:59,218 --> 03:28:03,264
How did you wind up in Kulmhof?

1669
03:28:06,559 --> 03:28:08,352
I was born in Laage,

1670
03:28:08,435 --> 03:28:12,189
and I was sent to Kulmhof.

1671
03:28:12,606 --> 03:28:18,028
They were looking for volunteer settlers,

1672
03:28:18,445 --> 03:28:20,239
and I signed up.

1673
03:28:20,322 --> 03:28:22,491
That's how I got there.

1674
03:28:22,741 --> 03:28:25,286
<i>First 'm Wafihbrucken (Ken),</i>

1675
03:28:25,619 --> 03:28:29,540
then Chelmno... Kulmhof.

1676
03:28:29,832 --> 03:28:32,042
Directly from Laage?

1677
03:28:32,126 --> 03:28:38,716
No, I left from Munster.

1678
03:28:38,799 --> 03:28:42,595
Did you opt to go to Kulmhof?

1679
03:28:42,678 --> 03:28:45,556
No, I asked for Wartheland.

1680
03:28:45,639 --> 03:28:46,974
Why?

1681
03:28:50,019 --> 03:28:52,313
A pioneering spirit.

1682
03:28:53,731 --> 03:28:57,735
- You were young!
- Oh, yes, I was young.

1683
03:28:57,818 --> 03:29:01,322
- You wanted to be useful?
- Yes.

1684
03:29:02,615 --> 03:29:08,162
What was your first impression
of Wartheland?

1685
03:29:08,829 --> 03:29:12,207
It was primitive. Super-primitive.

1686
03:29:12,291 --> 03:29:13,918
Meaning...?

1687
03:29:14,001 --> 03:29:15,920
Even worse,

1688
03:29:16,545 --> 03:29:18,464
worse than primitive.

1689
03:29:18,547 --> 03:29:21,842
Difficult to understand, right?

1690
03:29:24,386 --> 03:29:25,596
But why. . .?

1691
03:29:25,679 --> 03:29:30,851
The sanitary facilities were disastrous.

1692
03:29:31,143 --> 03:29:35,481
The only toilet was
in WarthbrUcken, in the town.

1693
03:29:35,564 --> 03:29:37,232
You had to go there.

1694
03:29:37,316 --> 03:29:41,779
The rest was a disaster.

1695
03:29:43,364 --> 03:29:47,409
- Why a disaster?
- There were no toilets at all!

1696
03:29:51,205 --> 03:29:54,208
There were privies.

1697
03:29:55,042 --> 03:29:57,419
I can't tell you

1698
03:29:58,045 --> 03:30:01,090
how primitive it was.

1699
03:30:03,008 --> 03:30:04,134
Astonishing!

1700
03:30:04,218 --> 03:30:09,139
Why did you choose
such a primitive place?

1701
03:30:09,223 --> 03:30:12,810
I was young, you know.

1702
03:30:12,893 --> 03:30:15,729
You can't imagine such places exist.

1703
03:30:15,813 --> 03:30:18,816
You don't believe it.
But that's how it was.

1704
03:30:23,737 --> 03:30:25,906
<i>This was the whole village.</i>

1705
03:30:26,740 --> 03:30:29,118
<i>A very small village,</i>

1706
03:30:31,537 --> 03:30:33,372
<i>straggling along the road.</i>

1707
03:30:33,455 --> 03:30:36,750
<i>Just a few houses.</i>

1708
03:30:38,293 --> 03:30:42,339
<i>There was the church, the castle,</i>

1709
03:30:42,423 --> 03:30:44,758
<i>a store, too,</i>

1710
03:30:45,092 --> 03:30:48,429
<i>the administrative building
and the school.</i>

1711
03:30:49,638 --> 03:30:52,391
<i>The castle was next to the church,</i>

1712
03:30:52,474 --> 03:30:55,936
<i>with a high board fence around both.</i>

1713
03:31:00,607 --> 03:31:04,611
<i>How far was your house from the church?</i>

1714
03:31:05,320 --> 03:31:09,116
<i>It was just opposite... 150 feet.</i>

1715
03:31:10,117 --> 03:31:13,704
Mrs. Michelsohn
was the Nazi teacher's wife

1716
03:31:16,290 --> 03:31:18,667
<i>Did you see the gas vans?</i>

1717
03:31:18,751 --> 03:31:19,877
No...

1718
03:31:20,377 --> 03:31:23,756
<i>Yes, from the outside.
They shuttled back and forth.</i>

1719
03:31:23,839 --> 03:31:28,135
<i>I never looked inside...
I didn't see Jews in them.</i>

1720
03:31:29,803 --> 03:31:31,930
<i>I only saw things from outside,</i>

1721
03:31:32,014 --> 03:31:35,476
<i>the Jews' arrival, their disposition,</i>

1722
03:31:36,018 --> 03:31:39,146
<i>how they were loaded aboard.</i>

1723
03:31:42,649 --> 03:31:44,610
<i>Since World War I,</i>

1724
03:31:44,693 --> 03:31:48,405
<i>the castle had been in ruins.</i>

1725
03:31:49,782 --> 03:31:52,993
<i>Only part of it could still be used.</i>

1726
03:31:53,994 --> 03:31:59,041
<i>That's where the Jews were taken.</i>

1727
03:32:05,172 --> 03:32:09,218
This ruined castle was used...

1728
03:32:09,301 --> 03:32:13,305
For housing and delousing
the Poles, and so on.

1729
03:32:13,388 --> 03:32:15,516
- The Jews!
- Yes, the Jews.

1730
03:32:16,600 --> 03:32:21,480
Why do you call them “Poles”
and not “Jews”?

1731
03:32:21,563 --> 03:32:24,191
Sometimes, I get them mixed up.

1732
03:32:25,025 --> 03:32:27,528
There's a difference
between Poles and Jews?

1733
03:32:27,611 --> 03:32:29,947
Oh, yes!

1734
03:32:30,030 --> 03:32:32,199
What difference?

1735
03:32:36,036 --> 03:32:39,248
The Poles weren't exterminated,

1736
03:32:39,706 --> 03:32:41,792
and the Jews were.

1737
03:32:41,875 --> 03:32:45,712
That's the difference.
An external difference, right?

1738
03:32:46,380 --> 03:32:48,298
And the inner difference?

1739
03:32:48,382 --> 03:32:50,634
I can't assess that.

1740
03:32:50,717 --> 03:32:56,682
I don't know enough
about psychology and anthropology.

1741
03:32:57,850 --> 03:33:00,936
The difference between
the Poles and the Jews?

1742
03:33:01,019 --> 03:33:03,897
Anyway, they couldn't stand each other.

1743
03:33:06,441 --> 03:33:08,777
On January 19, 1942,

1744
03:33:08,861 --> 03:33:11,989
the rabbi of Grabow, Jacob Schulmann,

1745
03:33:12,072 --> 03:33:15,909
wrote the following letter
to his friends in Lodz:

1746
03:33:17,035 --> 03:33:18,495
“My very dear friends,

1747
03:33:18,579 --> 03:33:23,500
I didn't write sooner:
I wasn't sure of what I'd heard.

1748
03:33:23,750 --> 03:33:27,796
Alas, to our great grief,
we now know all.

1749
03:33:28,422 --> 03:33:32,593
I've spoken to an eyewitness
who managed to escape.

1750
03:33:32,926 --> 03:33:34,761
He told me everything.

1751
03:33:34,845 --> 03:33:39,057
They're exterminated
in Chelmno, near Dombie,

1752
03:33:39,266 --> 03:33:42,269
and they're all buried
in the nearby Rzeszow forest.

1753
03:33:42,811 --> 03:33:47,608
The Jews are killed in <i>2</i> ways:
by shooting or gas.

1754
03:33:47,941 --> 03:33:52,654
It's just happened
to thousands of Lodz Jews.

1755
03:33:53,989 --> 03:33:58,160
Do not think that
this is being written by a madman.

1756
03:33:58,243 --> 03:34:02,039
Alas, it is the tragic, horrible truth.

1757
03:34:02,998 --> 03:34:07,544
Horror, horror.
Man, shed thy clothes,

1758
03:34:07,628 --> 03:34:10,631
cover thy head with ashes,
run in the streets

1759
03:34:10,923 --> 03:34:13,050
and dance in thy madness.

1760
03:34:14,593 --> 03:34:18,013
I am so weary that my pen
can no longer write.

1761
03:34:18,472 --> 03:34:21,975
Creator of the universe, help us!”

1762
03:34:23,018 --> 03:34:27,064
The creator did not help
the Jews of Grabow.

1763
03:34:27,439 --> 03:34:32,069
With their rabbi,
they all died in the gas van at Chelmno

1764
03:34:32,152 --> 03:34:34,071
a few weeks later.

1765
03:34:34,154 --> 03:34:38,200
Chelmno is only 12 miles from Grabow.

1766
03:35:25,539 --> 03:35:27,958
<i>Were there a lot of Jews here in Grabow?</i>

1767
03:35:30,877 --> 03:35:33,046
<i>A lot, quite a few.</i>

1768
03:35:37,217 --> 03:35:38,802
<i>They were sent to Chelmno.</i>

1769
03:35:38,885 --> 03:35:41,930
Has she always lived near the synagogue?

1770
03:35:53,066 --> 03:35:55,902
- Yes.
- The Polish word is “Buzinica,” not synagogue.

1771
03:36:06,455 --> 03:36:09,374
She says it's now
a furniture warehouse

1772
03:36:09,458 --> 03:36:13,920
but they didn't harm it
from a religious point of view.

1773
03:36:14,004 --> 03:36:17,507
It hasn't been... desecrated.

1774
03:36:18,759 --> 03:36:21,261
Does she remember the rabbi
at the synagogue?

1775
03:36:23,972 --> 03:36:28,685
THE SYNAGOGUE IN GRABOW

1776
03:36:30,437 --> 03:36:35,067
<i>She says she's 80 now,
and her memory isn't too good,</i>

1777
03:36:35,150 --> 03:36:37,986
<i>and the Jews have been gone
for 40 years.</i>

1778
03:36:56,838 --> 03:37:00,175
Barbara, tell this couple
they live in a lovely house.

1779
03:37:03,804 --> 03:37:06,807
Do they agree?
Do they think it's a lovely house?

1780
03:37:17,150 --> 03:37:21,405
Tell me about the decoration
of this house, the doors,

1781
03:37:21,488 --> 03:37:23,240
what's it mean?

1782
03:37:30,122 --> 03:37:32,916
People used to do carvings like that.

1783
03:37:33,166 --> 03:37:35,210
Did they decorate it that way?

1784
03:37:38,130 --> 03:37:41,174
- No, it was the Jews again.
- The Jews did it!

1785
03:37:42,300 --> 03:37:44,636
The door's a good century old.

1786
03:37:45,345 --> 03:37:47,222
Did Jews own this house?

1787
03:37:50,517 --> 03:37:52,436
Yes, all these houses.

1788
03:37:52,519 --> 03:37:55,772
All these houses
on the square were Jewish?

1789
03:37:59,693 --> 03:38:05,115
Jews lived in all the ones in front,
on the street.

1790
03:38:06,199 --> 03:38:08,076
Where did the Poles live?

1791
03:38:11,288 --> 03:38:14,040
In the courtyards,
where the privies were.

1792
03:38:17,752 --> 03:38:20,797
There used to be a store here.

1793
03:38:20,881 --> 03:38:22,132
What kind?

1794
03:38:23,550 --> 03:38:25,469
A food store.

1795
03:38:25,552 --> 03:38:27,471
Owned by Jews?

1796
03:38:27,554 --> 03:38:28,597
Yes.

1797
03:38:29,097 --> 03:38:32,142
So the Jews lived in the front,

1798
03:38:32,225 --> 03:38:35,729
and the Poles in the courtyard
with the privies.

1799
03:38:45,238 --> 03:38:47,741
How long have these two lived here?

1800
03:38:54,789 --> 03:38:57,083
15 years.

1801
03:38:57,417 --> 03:38:59,336
Where'd they live before?

1802
03:39:02,130 --> 03:39:04,174
In a courtyard across the square.

1803
03:39:04,257 --> 03:39:06,134
They've gotten rich.

1804
03:39:06,218 --> 03:39:07,844
- Them?
- Yes.

1805
03:39:09,554 --> 03:39:10,680
Yes.

1806
03:39:11,264 --> 03:39:13,600
How did they get rich?

1807
03:39:17,270 --> 03:39:18,855
They worked.

1808
03:39:19,105 --> 03:39:21,024
How old is the gentleman?

1809
03:39:23,109 --> 03:39:24,486
He's 70.

1810
03:39:24,569 --> 03:39:26,655
He looks young and healthy.

1811
03:39:31,618 --> 03:39:34,371
Do they remember the Jews of Grabow?

1812
03:39:36,790 --> 03:39:37,999
Yes.

1813
03:39:38,083 --> 03:39:40,168
And when they were deported, too.

1814
03:39:40,252 --> 03:39:43,171
They recall the deportation
of the Grabow Jews?

1815
03:39:44,839 --> 03:39:46,716
He says he speaks “Jew” well.

1816
03:39:46,800 --> 03:39:48,552
He speaks “Jew”?

1817
03:39:50,971 --> 03:39:53,974
As a kid he played with Jews
so he speaks “Jew.”

1818
03:40:08,363 --> 03:40:12,242
First, they grouped them there,
where that restaurant is,

1819
03:40:12,325 --> 03:40:13,743
or in this square,

1820
03:40:13,827 --> 03:40:15,328
and took their gold.

1821
03:40:31,344 --> 03:40:35,056
An elder among the Jews
collected the gold

1822
03:40:35,140 --> 03:40:37,934
and turned it over to the police.

1823
03:40:38,268 --> 03:40:43,023
That done, the Jews were put
in the Catholic church.

1824
03:40:43,106 --> 03:40:44,774
A lot of gold?

1825
03:40:48,194 --> 03:40:50,739
Yes, the Jews had gold

1826
03:40:54,326 --> 03:40:57,120
and some handsome candelabras.

1827
03:41:07,797 --> 03:41:11,968
Did the Poles know the Jews
would be killed at Chelmno?

1828
03:41:19,267 --> 03:41:20,894
Yes, they knew.

1829
03:41:22,562 --> 03:41:24,397
The Jews knew it, too.

1830
03:41:26,107 --> 03:41:29,110
Did the Jews try to do
something about it,

1831
03:41:29,194 --> 03:41:31,655
to rebel, to escape?

1832
03:41:47,754 --> 03:41:49,756
The young tried to run away.

1833
03:41:52,926 --> 03:41:55,345
<i>But the Germans caught them</i>

1834
03:41:55,428 --> 03:41:59,307
<i>and maybe killed them
even more savagely.</i>

1835
03:42:08,608 --> 03:42:13,363
<i>In e very to wn and village,
2 or 3 streets were closed,</i>

1836
03:42:13,446 --> 03:42:15,115
<i>and the Jews were kept under guard.</i>

1837
03:42:15,198 --> 03:42:17,117
<i>They couldn't leave there.</i>

1838
03:42:23,581 --> 03:42:27,377
<i>Then they were locked
in the Polish church here in Grebe w</i>

1839
03:42:27,460 --> 03:42:29,963
<i>and later taken to Chelmno.</i>

1840
03:42:31,840 --> 03:42:35,510
BACKGROUND, THE SYNAGOGUE

1841
03:43:00,994 --> 03:43:04,706
The Germans threw children
as small as these

1842
03:43:05,039 --> 03:43:07,500
into the trucks by the legs.

1843
03:43:07,709 --> 03:43:09,502
She saw that?

1844
03:43:10,336 --> 03:43:13,089
- Old folks too.
- Threw kids into the trucks.

1845
03:43:14,007 --> 03:43:17,177
The Poles knew the Jews
would be gassed in Chelmno?

1846
03:43:17,761 --> 03:43:19,429
Did this gentleman know?

1847
03:43:29,147 --> 03:43:32,734
<i>Does he recall
the Jews' deportation from Grabow?</i>

1848
03:43:39,199 --> 03:43:41,785
<i>At that time, he worked in the mill.</i>

1849
03:43:41,868 --> 03:43:45,497
<i>- There, opposite?
- Yes, and they saw it all.</i>

1850
03:43:46,206 --> 03:43:49,709
What did he think of it?
Was it a sad sight?

1851
03:43:58,176 --> 03:43:59,677
Yes, it was...

1852
03:44:03,640 --> 03:44:07,977
Yes. How could you see that
without sadness?

1853
03:44:15,401 --> 03:44:17,445
What trades were the Jews in?

1854
03:44:25,245 --> 03:44:27,622
They were tanners, tradesmen,

1855
03:44:30,542 --> 03:44:31,918
tailors.

1856
03:44:39,133 --> 03:44:45,098
They sold things...
eggs, chickens, butter.

1857
03:44:48,434 --> 03:44:50,603
<i>There were a lot of tailors,</i>

1858
03:44:53,481 --> 03:44:55,316
<i>tradesmen, too.</i>

1859
03:44:56,401 --> 03:44:59,112
But most were tanners.

1860
03:45:02,824 --> 03:45:07,912
- They had beards and side locks.
- Yes.

1861
03:45:07,996 --> 03:45:10,248
He says they weren't pretty.

1862
03:45:10,331 --> 03:45:12,292
They weren't pretty?

1863
03:45:14,043 --> 03:45:16,629
- They stank, too.
- They stank?

1864
03:45:17,630 --> 03:45:19,173
Why did they stink?

1865
03:45:21,593 --> 03:45:25,471
Because they were tanners,
and the hides stink.

1866
03:45:29,517 --> 03:45:31,561
The Jewish women were beautiful.

1867
03:45:34,105 --> 03:45:36,649
The Poles liked to make love with them.

1868
03:45:36,941 --> 03:45:40,320
Are Polish women glad
there are no Jewesses left?

1869
03:45:48,828 --> 03:45:49,829
What'd she say?

1870
03:45:49,913 --> 03:45:54,542
That the women
who are her age now

1871
03:45:55,627 --> 03:45:57,795
also liked to make love.

1872
03:45:57,879 --> 03:46:00,882
So the Jewish women were competitors?

1873
03:46:04,510 --> 03:46:08,097
It's crazy how the Poles
liked the little Jewesses!

1874
03:46:08,181 --> 03:46:10,350
Do the Poles miss the little Jewesses?

1875
03:46:14,896 --> 03:46:17,857
Naturally, such beautiful women!

1876
03:46:18,066 --> 03:46:20,443
Why? What made them so beautiful?

1877
03:46:30,828 --> 03:46:33,998
Because they did nothing.
Polish women worked.

1878
03:46:34,082 --> 03:46:38,419
Jewish women only thought
of their beauty and clothes.

1879
03:46:38,711 --> 03:46:40,880
So Jewesses did no work!

1880
03:46:42,256 --> 03:46:44,592
- None at all.
- Why not?

1881
03:46:46,886 --> 03:46:48,471
They were rich.

1882
03:46:51,849 --> 03:46:55,311
The Poles had to serve them and work.

1883
03:46:55,395 --> 03:46:57,605
I heard her use the word “capital.”

1884
03:46:58,773 --> 03:47:01,401
The capital was
in the hands of the Jews.

1885
03:47:01,484 --> 03:47:03,653
Yes... You didn't translate that.

1886
03:47:04,570 --> 03:47:08,908
Ask her again. So the capital
was in the Jews' hands?

1887
03:47:11,953 --> 03:47:13,913
All Poland was in the Jews' hands.

1888
03:47:13,997 --> 03:47:17,417
Are they glad there are
no more Jews here, or sad?

1889
03:47:40,273 --> 03:47:41,774
It doesn't bother them.

1890
03:47:41,858 --> 03:47:46,779
As you know, Jews and Germans
ran all Polish industry before the war.

1891
03:47:46,863 --> 03:47:49,615
Did they like them on the whole?

1892
03:47:57,457 --> 03:48:04,213
<i>Not much.
Above all, they were dishonest.</i>

1893
03:48:06,466 --> 03:48:10,803
<i>Was life in Grabow more fun
when the Jews were here?</i>

1894
03:48:24,901 --> 03:48:27,070
He'd rather not say.

1895
03:48:27,779 --> 03:48:29,989
Why does he call them dishonest?

1896
03:48:40,792 --> 03:48:44,420
They exploited the Poles.
That's what they lived off.

1897
03:48:44,504 --> 03:48:46,506
How did they exploit them?

1898
03:49:01,354 --> 03:49:03,231
By imposing their prices.

1899
03:49:08,152 --> 03:49:10,238
Ask her if she likes her house.

1900
03:49:11,864 --> 03:49:12,865
Yes,

1901
03:49:14,033 --> 03:49:17,078
but her children live
in much better houses.

1902
03:49:17,870 --> 03:49:19,872
In modern houses!

1903
03:49:23,000 --> 03:49:25,461
They've all gone to college.

1904
03:49:25,545 --> 03:49:29,048
Great! That's progress!

1905
03:49:33,386 --> 03:49:38,349
Her children are
the best educated in the village.

1906
03:49:38,432 --> 03:49:41,727
Very good, Madam!
Long live education!

1907
03:49:44,814 --> 03:49:48,568
Isn't this a very old house?

1908
03:49:51,070 --> 03:49:53,030
Yes, Jews lived here before.

1909
03:49:53,114 --> 03:49:56,617
So Jews used to live here.
Did she know them?

1910
03:49:59,412 --> 03:50:00,663
Yes.

1911
03:50:00,746 --> 03:50:02,582
What was their name?

1912
03:50:08,588 --> 03:50:09,589
She doesn't know.

1913
03:50:09,672 --> 03:50:12,008
What was their trade?

1914
03:50:13,217 --> 03:50:16,179
Benkel, their name was.

1915
03:50:17,597 --> 03:50:19,765
And what was their trade?

1916
03:50:27,899 --> 03:50:29,942
They had a butcher shop.

1917
03:50:30,735 --> 03:50:33,154
A butcher shop.
Why is she laughing?

1918
03:50:35,948 --> 03:50:39,410
Because the gentleman said it was...

1919
03:50:40,786 --> 03:50:44,624
a butcher shop where
you could buy cheap meat. Beef!

1920
03:50:46,083 --> 03:50:49,295
What does he think about
them being gassed in trucks?

1921
03:50:58,429 --> 03:51:00,973
He says he doesn't like that at all.

1922
03:51:10,524 --> 03:51:14,612
If they'd gone to Israel
of their own free will,

1923
03:51:14,695 --> 03:51:16,239
he might have been glad.

1924
03:51:16,322 --> 03:51:20,117
But killing them was unpleasant.

1925
03:51:23,329 --> 03:51:25,414
Does he miss the Jews?

1926
03:51:37,301 --> 03:51:40,638
Yes, because there were
some beautiful Jewesses.

1927
03:51:40,721 --> 03:51:42,765
For the young, it was... fine.

1928
03:51:42,848 --> 03:51:47,895
Are they sorry the Jews
are no longer here or pleased?

1929
03:51:56,445 --> 03:52:01,242
How can I tell?
I never went to school.

1930
03:52:01,534 --> 03:52:05,746
I can only think of how I am now.
Now I'm fine.

1931
03:52:06,580 --> 03:52:08,541
Is she better off?

1932
03:52:15,256 --> 03:52:17,842
Before the war, she picked potatoes.

1933
03:52:17,925 --> 03:52:21,679
Now she sells eggs,
and she's much better off.

1934
03:52:21,762 --> 03:52:25,433
Because the Jews are gone
or because of socialism?

1935
03:52:31,230 --> 03:52:35,985
She doesn't care, she's happy
because she's doing well now.

1936
03:52:36,068 --> 03:52:40,072
How did he feel about
losing his classmates?

1937
03:52:48,247 --> 03:52:50,166
It still upsets him.

1938
03:52:51,083 --> 03:52:52,918
Does he miss the Jews?

1939
03:52:54,253 --> 03:52:55,212
Certainly.

1940
03:52:55,296 --> 03:52:57,715
They were good Jews, Madam says.

1941
03:53:00,051 --> 03:53:03,596
GRABOW IN WINTER

1942
03:53:49,433 --> 03:53:52,645
<i>The Jews came in trucks,</i>

1943
03:53:54,772 --> 03:53:58,692
<i>and later there was
a narrow-gauge railway</i>

1944
03:53:58,776 --> 03:54:01,320
<i>that they arrived on.</i>

1945
03:54:02,488 --> 03:54:07,201
<i>They were packed tightly in the trucks,</i>

1946
03:54:07,284 --> 03:54:10,996
<i>or in the cars
of the narrow-gauge railway.</i>

1947
03:54:12,331 --> 03:54:14,625
Lots of women and children.

1948
03:54:14,959 --> 03:54:18,462
Men too, but most of them were old.

1949
03:54:18,671 --> 03:54:23,384
The strongest were put in work details.

1950
03:54:23,843 --> 03:54:28,055
They walked with chains on their legs.

1951
03:54:28,139 --> 03:54:31,225
In the morning, they fetched water,

1952
03:54:31,308 --> 03:54:34,603
looked for food, and so on.

1953
03:54:36,147 --> 03:54:39,275
These weren't killed right away.

1954
03:54:39,358 --> 03:54:41,444
That was done later.

1955
03:54:41,527 --> 03:54:44,530
I don't know what became of them.

1956
03:54:44,738 --> 03:54:47,324
They didn't survive, anyway.

1957
03:54:47,408 --> 03:54:49,702
Two of them did.

1958
03:54:49,785 --> 03:54:51,454
Only two.

1959
03:54:51,787 --> 03:54:53,789
They were in chains?

1960
03:54:54,832 --> 03:54:56,834
- On the legs.
- All of them?

1961
03:54:56,917 --> 03:55:04,133
The workers, yes.
The others were killed at once.

1962
03:55:04,216 --> 03:55:09,472
The Jewish work squad
went through the village in chains.

1963
03:55:09,805 --> 03:55:11,432
Yes.

1964
03:55:13,017 --> 03:55:15,686
Could people speak to them?

1965
03:55:15,769 --> 03:55:20,149
No, that was impossible.

1966
03:55:20,232 --> 03:55:21,609
Why?

1967
03:55:22,651 --> 03:55:24,695
No one dared.

1968
03:55:25,404 --> 03:55:28,032
- What?
- No one dared.

1969
03:55:28,574 --> 03:55:30,284
Understand?

1970
03:55:30,910 --> 03:55:32,995
Yes... No one dared.

1971
03:55:33,078 --> 03:55:35,080
Why, was it dangerous?

1972
03:55:35,164 --> 03:55:42,254
Yes, there were guards.

1973
03:55:45,299 --> 03:55:48,969
Anyway, people wanted
nothing to do with all that.

1974
03:55:49,970 --> 03:55:51,430
Do you see?

1975
03:55:51,514 --> 03:55:55,768
Gets on your nerves,
seeing that every day.

1976
03:56:03,359 --> 03:56:08,155
<i>You can't force a whole village
to watch such distress.</i>

1977
03:56:09,657 --> 03:56:11,992
<i>When the Jews arrived,</i>

1978
03:56:12,076 --> 03:56:16,038
<i>when they were pushed
into the church or the castle...</i>

1979
03:56:16,789 --> 03:56:18,624
<i>And the screams!</i>

1980
03:56:18,707 --> 03:56:22,336
<i>It was frightful!
Depressing.</i>

1981
03:56:22,586 --> 03:56:26,632
<i>Day after day, the same spectacle!</i>

1982
03:56:30,594 --> 03:56:34,807
<i>It was terrible!
A sad spectacle!</i>

1983
03:56:35,683 --> 03:56:39,311
<i>They screamed.
They knew what was happening.</i>

1984
03:56:40,646 --> 03:56:44,733
<i>At first, the Jews thought
they were going to be deloused.</i>

1985
03:56:45,276 --> 03:56:48,946
<i>But they soon understood.</i>

1986
03:56:49,029 --> 03:56:51,824
<i>Their screams grew wilder and wilder.</i>

1987
03:56:53,659 --> 03:56:56,704
<i>Horrifying screams. Screams of terror.</i>

1988
03:56:56,787 --> 03:57:00,583
<i>Because they knew
what was happening to them.</i>

1989
03:57:03,335 --> 03:57:07,506
<i>Do you know how many Jews
were exterminated there?</i>

1990
03:57:09,341 --> 03:57:13,220
<i>Four something,
400,000... 40,000...</i>

1991
03:57:13,304 --> 03:57:14,888
400, 000.

1992
03:57:16,140 --> 03:57:20,019
<i>400,000, yes.
I knew it had a 4 in it.</i>

1993
03:57:21,395 --> 03:57:23,939
<i>Sad, sad, sad!</i>

1994
03:57:26,150 --> 03:57:29,236
<i>When the soldiers march,</i>

1995
03:57:29,320 --> 03:57:32,865
<i>the girls open
their windows and doors...</i>

1996
03:57:41,206 --> 03:57:47,087
<i>Do you remember
a Jewish child, a boy of 13?</i>

1997
03:57:47,338 --> 03:57:50,215
<i>He was in the work squad.</i>

1998
03:57:50,591 --> 03:57:53,719
<i>He sang on the river.</i>

1999
03:57:53,802 --> 03:57:55,888
- <i>On the Narew River?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

2000
03:57:56,722 --> 03:57:59,058
- <i>Is he still alive ?</i>
- <i>Yes, he is alive.</i>

2001
03:57:59,642 --> 03:58:04,104
<i>He sang a German song</i>

2002
03:58:04,563 --> 03:58:09,985
<i>that the SS in Chelmno taught him.</i>

2003
03:58:10,069 --> 03:58:13,113
<i>“When the soldiers march,</i>

2004
03:58:13,197 --> 03:58:15,658
<i>the girls open
their windows and doors...”</i>

2005
03:58:30,255 --> 03:58:32,508
SIMON SREBNIK,

2006
03:58:32,800 --> 03:58:36,762
the survivor of the 2nd period
of extermination at Chelmno

2007
03:58:37,096 --> 03:58:39,598
(the church period)

2008
03:59:50,085 --> 03:59:52,379
So it's a holiday in Chelmno!

2009
03:59:55,716 --> 03:59:58,051
What holiday?
What's being celebrated?

2010
04:00:03,098 --> 04:00:06,894
The birth of the Virgin Mary.
It's her birthday.

2011
04:00:09,146 --> 04:00:11,523
It's a huge crowd, isn't it?

2012
04:00:17,863 --> 04:00:21,366
But the weather's bad...
it's raining.

2013
04:00:22,034 --> 04:00:25,245
Ask them if they're glad
to see Srebnik again.

2014
04:00:30,000 --> 04:00:31,627
Very. it's a great pleasure.

2015
04:00:31,710 --> 04:00:33,170
Why?

2016
04:00:37,424 --> 04:00:40,636
They're glad to see him again,

2017
04:00:43,263 --> 04:00:46,308
because they know
all he's lived through.

2018
04:00:46,391 --> 04:00:50,270
Seeing him as he is now,
they're very pleased.

2019
04:00:50,354 --> 04:00:52,064
They're pleased?

2020
04:00:52,856 --> 04:00:55,567
Why does the whole village
remember him?

2021
04:01:11,083 --> 04:01:13,544
They remember him well

2022
04:01:14,753 --> 04:01:18,841
because he walked
with chains on his ankles,

2023
04:01:18,924 --> 04:01:22,719
and he sang on the river.

2024
04:01:22,928 --> 04:01:24,638
He was young,

2025
04:01:25,264 --> 04:01:27,140
he was skinny,

2026
04:01:27,683 --> 04:01:31,270
he looked ready for his coffin.

2027
04:01:31,353 --> 04:01:34,314
Ripe for a coffin!

2028
04:01:34,398 --> 04:01:36,692
Did he seem happy or sad?

2029
04:01:45,784 --> 04:01:47,828
Even the lady,

2030
04:01:57,421 --> 04:02:00,966
when she saw that child,

2031
04:02:01,049 --> 04:02:04,553
she told the German,
“Let that child go!”

2032
04:02:04,636 --> 04:02:06,722
He asked her, “Where to?”

2033
04:02:06,805 --> 04:02:08,432
“To his father and mother.”

2034
04:02:08,515 --> 04:02:12,311
Looking at the sky, he said,
“He'll soon go to them.”

2035
04:02:12,394 --> 04:02:14,313
The German said that?

2036
04:02:15,314 --> 04:02:19,151
They remember when the Jews
were locked in this church?

2037
04:02:23,906 --> 04:02:25,699
Yes, they do.

2038
04:02:30,203 --> 04:02:32,456
They brought them
to the church in trucks.

2039
04:02:32,539 --> 04:02:34,708
At what time of day?

2040
04:02:40,380 --> 04:02:42,174
All day long and into the night.

2041
04:02:42,424 --> 04:02:46,720
What happened?
Can they describe it in detail?

2042
04:03:05,864 --> 04:03:08,784
At first, the Jews
were taken to the castle.

2043
04:03:08,867 --> 04:03:12,287
Only later were they put
into the church.

2044
04:03:12,371 --> 04:03:14,539
The second phase, right!

2045
04:03:15,415 --> 04:03:18,460
In the morning,
they were taken into the woods.

2046
04:03:18,543 --> 04:03:22,381
How were they taken into the woods?

2047
04:03:28,971 --> 04:03:31,723
In very big armored vans.

2048
04:03:41,692 --> 04:03:44,444
The gas came through the bottom.

2049
04:03:47,531 --> 04:03:50,826
Then they were carried
in gas vans, right?

2050
04:03:54,413 --> 04:03:56,331
Yes, in gas vans.

2051
04:03:57,541 --> 04:03:59,960
Where did the vans pick them up?

2052
04:04:00,961 --> 04:04:02,713
- The Jews?
- Yes.

2053
04:04:06,091 --> 04:04:08,010
Here, at the church door.

2054
04:04:08,093 --> 04:04:10,762
The trucks pulled up where they are now?

2055
04:04:12,139 --> 04:04:14,182
No, they went right to the door.

2056
04:04:14,266 --> 04:04:17,602
The vans came to the church door?

2057
04:04:19,896 --> 04:04:24,317
And they all knew these were death vans?

2058
04:04:30,949 --> 04:04:33,201
Yes, they couldn't help knowing.

2059
04:04:35,162 --> 04:04:37,748
They heard screams at night?

2060
04:04:42,794 --> 04:04:45,005
The Jews moaned, they were hungry.

2061
04:04:47,883 --> 04:04:49,968
They were shut in and starved.

2062
04:04:50,177 --> 04:04:52,137
Did they have any food?

2063
04:04:58,727 --> 04:05:03,148
You couldn't look there.
You couldn't talk to a Jew.

2064
04:05:10,155 --> 04:05:14,534
Even going by on the road,
you couldn't look there.

2065
04:05:14,618 --> 04:05:16,661
Did they look anyway?

2066
04:05:22,501 --> 04:05:25,504
Yes, vans came,

2067
04:05:25,712 --> 04:05:28,757
and the Jews were moved farther off.

2068
04:05:28,840 --> 04:05:30,842
You could see them, but on the sly.

2069
04:05:30,926 --> 04:05:33,303
- In sidelong glances.
- That's right.

2070
04:05:37,349 --> 04:05:40,227
That's right, in sidelong glances.

2071
04:05:41,061 --> 04:05:44,523
What kind of cries and moans
were heard at night?

2072
04:06:01,748 --> 04:06:05,460
They called on Jesus and Mary and God,

2073
04:06:05,544 --> 04:06:08,213
sometimes in German, as she puts it.

2074
04:06:10,590 --> 04:06:13,677
The Jews called on Jesus, Mary and God!

2075
04:06:17,848 --> 04:06:22,477
The presbytery was full of suitcases.

2076
04:06:22,561 --> 04:06:24,563
The Jews' suitcases?

2077
04:06:26,231 --> 04:06:29,276
Yes, and there was gold.

2078
04:06:32,445 --> 04:06:35,657
How does she know there was gold?

2079
04:06:42,664 --> 04:06:45,876
The procession! <i>We'll</i> stop now.

2080
04:09:25,160 --> 04:09:27,287
Were there as many Jews
in the church

2081
04:09:27,370 --> 04:09:29,831
as there were Christians today?

2082
04:09:38,048 --> 04:09:39,341
Almost.

2083
04:09:39,424 --> 04:09:43,136
How many gas vans
were needed to empty it out?

2084
04:09:53,772 --> 04:09:55,273
An average of 50.

2085
04:09:55,357 --> 04:09:57,901
It took 50 vans to empty it!

2086
04:09:58,777 --> 04:10:00,904
In a steady stream?

2087
04:10:04,616 --> 04:10:05,408
Yes.

2088
04:10:05,492 --> 04:10:07,410
The lady said before

2089
04:10:07,494 --> 04:10:11,623
that the Jews' suitcases
were dumped in the house opposite.

2090
04:10:15,043 --> 04:10:17,587
What was in this baggage?

2091
04:10:22,092 --> 04:10:25,553
Pots with false bottoms.

2092
04:10:25,804 --> 04:10:30,266
What was in the false bottoms?

2093
04:10:35,146 --> 04:10:37,774
Valuables... objects of value.

2094
04:10:40,110 --> 04:10:43,947
They also had gold in their clothes.

2095
04:10:48,076 --> 04:10:52,539
When given food, the Jews
sometimes threw them valuables

2096
04:10:52,622 --> 04:10:54,416
or sometimes money.

2097
04:10:55,083 --> 04:10:59,379
They said before
it was forbidden to talk to Jews.

2098
04:11:05,844 --> 04:11:08,054
Absolutely forbidden.

2099
04:11:11,266 --> 04:11:13,726
Ask them if they miss the Jews.

2100
04:11:20,525 --> 04:11:22,235
Of course.

2101
04:11:25,029 --> 04:11:28,867
We wept too, Madam says.

2102
04:11:32,203 --> 04:11:36,207
And Mr. Kantarowski
gave them bread and cucumbers.

2103
04:11:45,383 --> 04:11:49,387
Why do they think
all this happened to the Jews?

2104
04:11:56,811 --> 04:11:59,230
Because they were the richest!

2105
04:12:00,940 --> 04:12:05,820
Many Poles were also exterminated.

2106
04:12:05,904 --> 04:12:07,405
Even priests.

2107
04:12:07,489 --> 04:12:09,365
Mr. Kantarowski...

2108
04:12:15,038 --> 04:12:17,749
will tell us what a friend told him.

2109
04:12:17,832 --> 04:12:20,752
It happened in Myndjewyce, near Warsaw.

2110
04:12:20,835 --> 04:12:22,295
Go on.

2111
04:12:40,438 --> 04:12:44,651
The Jews were gathered in a square.

2112
04:12:44,901 --> 04:12:48,947
The rabbi asked an SS man,
“Can I talk to them?”

2113
04:12:49,405 --> 04:12:51,449
The guard said yes.

2114
04:13:04,963 --> 04:13:09,717
So the rabbi said
that around 2,000 years ago,

2115
04:13:09,801 --> 04:13:14,305
the Jews condemned
the innocent Christ to death.

2116
04:13:25,483 --> 04:13:28,903
And when they did that,
they cried out,

2117
04:13:28,987 --> 04:13:33,283
“Let his blood fall on our heads
and on our sons' heads.”

2118
04:13:47,463 --> 04:13:51,175
Then the rabbi told them,

2119
04:13:51,259 --> 04:13:56,681
“Perhaps the time has come for that,
so let us do nothing.

2120
04:13:57,140 --> 04:14:00,852
Let us go,
let us do as we're asked.”

2121
04:14:00,935 --> 04:14:03,980
He thinks the Jews expiated
the death of Christ?

2122
04:14:10,361 --> 04:14:13,948
He doesn't think so,
or even that Christ sought revenge.

2123
04:14:14,032 --> 04:14:17,535
He didn't say that.
The rabbi said it.

2124
04:14:20,663 --> 04:14:23,541
It was God's will, that's all!

2125
04:14:39,098 --> 04:14:41,476
- What'd she say?
- So Pilate washed his hands

2126
04:14:41,559 --> 04:14:46,648
and said, “Christ is innocent,”
he sent Barabbas.

2127
04:14:46,731 --> 04:14:48,816
But the Jews cried out,

2128
04:14:48,900 --> 04:14:51,903
“Let his blood fall on our heads.”

2129
04:14:54,864 --> 04:14:56,991
That's all. Now you know!

2130
04:16:21,075 --> 04:16:24,579
<i>Was the road between Chelmno,
the village</i>

2131
04:16:24,662 --> 04:16:26,748
<i>and the woods where the pits were,</i>

2132
04:16:26,831 --> 04:16:29,333
<i>was it asphalted as it is now?</i>

2133
04:16:45,433 --> 04:16:50,188
<i>The road was narrower then,
but it was asphalted.</i>

2134
04:16:59,781 --> 04:17:03,534
<i>How many feet
were the pits from the road?</i>

2135
04:17:28,226 --> 04:17:32,396
<i>They were around 1,600 feet,</i>

2136
04:17:32,480 --> 04:17:35,775
<i>maybe 1,900 or 2,200 feet away.</i>

2137
04:17:36,901 --> 04:17:41,405
<i>So even from the road,
you couldn't see them.</i>

2138
04:17:55,253 --> 04:17:57,755
How fast did the vans go?

2139
04:18:01,050 --> 04:18:04,262
PAN FALBORSKI

2140
04:18:04,595 --> 04:18:09,308
At moderate speed, kind of slow.

2141
04:18:27,118 --> 04:18:28,619
It was a calculated speed

2142
04:18:28,703 --> 04:18:34,083
because they had to kill
the people inside on the way.

2143
04:18:34,166 --> 04:18:35,960
When they went too fast,

2144
04:18:36,043 --> 04:18:40,464
the people weren't quite dead
on arrival in the woods.

2145
04:18:40,715 --> 04:18:47,138
By going slower, they had time
to kill the people inside.

2146
04:18:48,180 --> 04:18:52,435
Once a van skidded on a curve.

2147
04:19:05,156 --> 04:19:07,992
<i>Half an hour later, I arrived</i>

2148
04:19:08,075 --> 04:19:11,454
<i>at the hut of a forest warden
named Senajak.</i>

2149
04:19:22,632 --> 04:19:26,594
<i>He told me, “Too bad you were late.</i>

2150
04:19:26,677 --> 04:19:29,263
<i>You could have seen a van that skidded.</i>

2151
04:19:29,347 --> 04:19:32,642
<i>The rear of the van opened,</i>

2152
04:19:33,017 --> 04:19:35,853
<i>and the Jews fell out on the road.</i>

2153
04:19:38,940 --> 04:19:40,858
<i>They were still alive.</i>

2154
04:19:46,822 --> 04:19:52,370
<i>Seeing those Jews crawling,
a Gestapo man</i>

2155
04:19:52,453 --> 04:19:56,999
<i>took out his revolver and shot them.</i>

2156
04:20:09,136 --> 04:20:11,472
<i>He finished them all off.</i>

2157
04:20:13,140 --> 04:20:18,229
<i>Then they brought Jews
who were working in the woods.</i>

2158
04:20:22,191 --> 04:20:25,611
<i>They righted the van</i>

2159
04:20:26,320 --> 04:20:29,573
<i>and put the bodies back inside.”</i>

2160
04:20:39,083 --> 04:20:41,085
<i>This was the road</i>

2161
04:20:42,128 --> 04:20:47,091
<i>the gas vans used.</i>

2162
04:20:48,926 --> 04:20:52,555
<i>There were 80 people in each van.</i>

2163
04:20:57,768 --> 04:21:01,022
<i>When they arrived, the SS said,</i>

2164
04:21:01,105 --> 04:21:03,149
<i>“Open the doors!”</i>

2165
04:21:03,858 --> 04:21:09,155
<i>We opened them.
The bodies tumbled right out.</i>

2166
04:21:10,614 --> 04:21:13,159
<i>An SS man said, “2 men inside!”</i>

2167
04:21:13,534 --> 04:21:19,248
<i>These 2 men worked at the ovens.
They were experienced.</i>

2168
04:21:20,458 --> 04:21:22,877
<i>Another SS man screamed,</i>

2169
04:21:22,960 --> 04:21:28,132
<i>“Hurry up!
The other van's coming!”</i>

2170
04:21:29,008 --> 04:21:34,764
<i>We worked until
the whole shipment was burned.</i>

2171
04:21:39,518 --> 04:21:43,898
<i>That's how it went, all daylong.
So it went.</i>

2172
04:22:13,886 --> 04:22:18,349
<i>I remember
that once they were still alive.</i>

2173
04:22:21,435 --> 04:22:24,230
<i>The ovens were full,</i>

2174
04:22:26,398 --> 04:22:29,735
<i>and the people lay on the ground.</i>

2175
04:22:30,402 --> 04:22:33,364
<i>They were all moving,</i>

2176
04:22:33,447 --> 04:22:36,158
<i>they were coming back to life,</i>

2177
04:22:39,370 --> 04:22:42,748
<i>and when they were thrown
into the ovens,</i>

2178
04:22:42,832 --> 04:22:44,458
<i>they were all conscious. Alive.</i>

2179
04:22:44,542 --> 04:22:48,045
<i>They could feel the fire burn them.</i>

2180
04:23:09,650 --> 04:23:15,030
<i>When we built the ovens,
I wondered what they were for.</i>

2181
04:23:18,409 --> 04:23:20,786
<i>An SS man told me,</i>

2182
04:23:21,078 --> 04:23:25,958
<i>“To make charcoal.
For laundry irons.”</i>

2183
04:23:26,917 --> 04:23:29,420
<i>That's what he told me.
I didn't know.</i>

2184
04:23:32,590 --> 04:23:35,634
<i>When the ovens were completed,</i>

2185
04:23:37,761 --> 04:23:40,890
<i>the logs put in</i>

2186
04:23:40,973 --> 04:23:44,768
<i>and the gasoline poured on and lighted,</i>

2187
04:23:46,604 --> 04:23:49,607
<i>and when the first gas van arrived,</i>

2188
04:23:50,065 --> 04:23:55,112
<i>then we knew why the ovens were built.</i>

2189
04:24:04,872 --> 04:24:08,334
<i>When I saw all that, it didn't affect me.</i>

2190
04:24:09,501 --> 04:24:14,215
<i>Neither did the 2nd or 3rd shipment.</i>

2191
04:24:17,134 --> 04:24:20,304
<i>I was only 13,</i>

2192
04:24:20,638 --> 04:24:24,558
<i>and all I'd ever seen until then</i>

2193
04:24:24,642 --> 04:24:28,145
<i>were dead bodies.</i>

2194
04:24:32,733 --> 04:24:34,902
Maybe I didn't understand.

2195
04:24:35,736 --> 04:24:41,325
Maybe if I'd been older
I'd have understood,

2196
04:24:41,408 --> 04:24:43,327
but the fact is, I didn't.

2197
04:24:43,535 --> 04:24:47,414
I'd never seen anything else.

2198
04:24:48,332 --> 04:24:53,087
In the ghetto, I saw...
in the ghetto in Lodz,

2199
04:24:53,170 --> 04:24:57,675
that as soon as anyone took a step,
he fell dead.

2200
04:24:58,008 --> 04:25:02,012
I thought that was
the way things had to be.

2201
04:25:02,388 --> 04:25:03,931
It was normal.

2202
04:25:04,014 --> 04:25:06,141
I'd walk the streets of Lodz,

2203
04:25:07,351 --> 04:25:11,855
maybe 100 yards,
and there'd be 200 bodies.

2204
04:25:14,858 --> 04:25:16,694
People were hungry.

2205
04:25:16,777 --> 04:25:20,239
They went into the street
and they fell, they fell...

2206
04:25:21,448 --> 04:25:24,368
Sons took their fathers' bread,

2207
04:25:24,451 --> 04:25:27,663
fathers took their sons'.

2208
04:25:27,746 --> 04:25:31,083
Everyone wanted to stay alive.

2209
04:25:33,210 --> 04:25:36,297
So when I came here, to Chelmno,

2210
04:25:36,797 --> 04:25:38,632
I was already...

2211
04:25:39,383 --> 04:25:42,386
I didn't care about anything.

2212
04:25:42,970 --> 04:25:48,434
I thought, if I survive,

2213
04:25:48,517 --> 04:25:50,728
I just want one thing:

2214
04:25:52,271 --> 04:25:54,606
5 loaves of bread to eat.

2215
04:25:54,690 --> 04:25:56,275
That's all.

2216
04:25:56,525 --> 04:25:59,069
That's what I thought.

2217
04:25:59,153 --> 04:26:00,946
But I dreamed, too,

2218
04:26:01,030 --> 04:26:04,450
that if I survived,
I'd be the only one left in the world,

2219
04:26:04,533 --> 04:26:07,202
not another soul. Just me. One.

2220
04:26:13,667 --> 04:26:17,755
<i>Only me left in the world,
if I get out of here.</i>

2221
04:26:34,521 --> 04:26:37,274
THE RUHR

2222
04:26:38,776 --> 04:26:43,989
<i>“Geheime Reichssache, ”
secret Reich business.</i>

2223
04:26:46,033 --> 04:26:49,620
<i>“Berlin, June 5, 1942.</i>

2224
04:26:52,623 --> 04:26:57,753
<i>Changes to be made
to special vehicles now in service</i>

2225
04:26:57,961 --> 04:27:00,297
<i>at Kulmhof (Chelmno)</i>

2226
04:27:00,672 --> 04:27:02,674
<i>and to those now being built.</i>

2227
04:27:08,180 --> 04:27:11,100
<i>Since December 1941,</i>

2228
04:27:11,975 --> 04:27:18,399
<i>97,000 have been processed
(verarbeitet in German)</i>

2229
04:27:19,316 --> 04:27:23,237
<i>by the 3 vehicles in service,
with no major incident.</i>

2230
04:27:25,531 --> 04:27:30,077
<i>In light of observations
made so far, however,</i>

2231
04:27:30,160 --> 04:27:33,455
<i>the following technical changes
are needed:</i>

2232
04:27:34,665 --> 04:27:35,999
<i>First,</i>

2233
04:27:36,875 --> 04:27:42,423
<i>the van's normal load
is usually 9 to 10 per square yard.</i>

2234
04:27:44,842 --> 04:27:48,846
<i>In Saurer vehicles,
which are very spacious,</i>

2235
04:27:50,013 --> 04:27:53,642
<i>maximum use of space is impossible,</i>

2236
04:27:54,351 --> 04:27:57,521
<i>not because of any possible overload,</i>

2237
04:27:58,856 --> 04:28:02,359
<i>but because loading to full capacity</i>

2238
04:28:02,443 --> 04:28:06,113
<i>would affect the vehicle's stability.</i>

2239
04:28:07,781 --> 04:28:11,994
<i>So reduction of the load space
seems necessary.</i>

2240
04:28:14,246 --> 04:28:17,666
<i>It must absolutely
be reduced by a yard,</i>

2241
04:28:17,749 --> 04:28:22,296
<i>instead of trying to solve the problem,
as hitherto,</i>

2242
04:28:22,379 --> 04:28:25,924
<i>by reducing the number
of pieces loaded.</i>

2243
04:28:29,136 --> 04:28:34,600
<i>Besides, this extends the operating time,</i>

2244
04:28:36,268 --> 04:28:40,647
<i>as the empty void must also
be filled with carbon monoxide.</i>

2245
04:28:42,399 --> 04:28:46,820
<i>On the other hand,
if the load space is reduced</i>

2246
04:28:47,446 --> 04:28:50,449
<i>and the vehicle is packed solid,</i>

2247
04:28:51,241 --> 04:28:55,496
<i>the operating time can be
considerably shortened.</i>

2248
04:28:56,955 --> 04:29:00,709
<i>The manufacturers told us
during a discussion,</i>

2249
04:29:01,293 --> 04:29:05,047
<i>that reducing the size
of the van's rear</i>

2250
04:29:05,631 --> 04:29:08,175
<i>would throw it badly off balance.</i>

2251
04:29:09,259 --> 04:29:13,138
<i>The front axle, they claim,
would be overloaded.</i>

2252
04:29:16,308 --> 04:29:21,980
<i>In fact, the balance
is automatically restored</i>

2253
04:29:23,190 --> 04:29:26,276
<i>because the merchandise aboard</i>

2254
04:29:27,444 --> 04:29:31,031
<i>displays, during the operation,</i>

2255
04:29:31,114 --> 04:29:35,452
<i>a natural tendency
to rush to the rear doors,</i>

2256
04:29:36,662 --> 04:29:41,708
<i>and are mainly found lying there
at the end of the operation.</i>

2257
04:29:44,294 --> 04:29:49,258
<i>So the front axle is not overloaded.</i>

2258
04:29:54,388 --> 04:29:55,973
<i>Secondly:</i>

2259
04:29:58,225 --> 04:30:03,897
<i>The lighting must be
better protected than now.</i>

2260
04:30:06,149 --> 04:30:09,444
<i>The lamps must be enclosed
in a steel grid</i>

2261
04:30:09,528 --> 04:30:12,447
<i>to prevent their being damaged.</i>

2262
04:30:14,533 --> 04:30:17,202
<i>Lights could be eliminated,</i>

2263
04:30:17,286 --> 04:30:20,831
<i>since they apparently are never used.</i>

2264
04:30:22,874 --> 04:30:27,129
<i>However, it has been observed</i>

2265
04:30:27,212 --> 04:30:29,756
<i>that when the doors are shut,</i>

2266
04:30:30,757 --> 04:30:36,763
<i>the load always
presses hard against them</i>

2267
04:30:36,847 --> 04:30:39,182
<i>(against the doors)</i>

2268
04:30:39,266 --> 04:30:41,977
<i>as soon as darkness sets in.</i>

2269
04:30:42,894 --> 04:30:46,189
<i>This is because the load</i>

2270
04:30:46,815 --> 04:30:49,860
<i>naturally rushes toward the light</i>

2271
04:30:51,403 --> 04:30:53,363
<i>when darkness sets in,</i>

2272
04:30:54,698 --> 04:30:57,826
<i>which makes
closing the doors difficult.</i>

2273
04:31:00,245 --> 04:31:05,917
<i>Also, because
of the alarming nature of darkness,</i>

2274
04:31:07,252 --> 04:31:13,091
<i>screaming always occurs
when the doors are closed.</i>

2275
04:31:15,385 --> 04:31:18,555
<i>It would therefore be useful
to light the lamp</i>

2276
04:31:19,556 --> 04:31:23,226
<i>before and during
the first moments of the operation.</i>

2277
04:31:26,313 --> 04:31:27,814
<i>Third:</i>

2278
04:31:30,067 --> 04:31:32,861
<i>For easy cleaning of the vehicle,</i>

2279
04:31:33,737 --> 04:31:38,784
<i>there must be a sealed drain
in the middle of the ﬂoor.</i>

2280
04:31:40,577 --> 04:31:45,957
<i>The drainage hole's cover,
8 to 12 inches in diameter,</i>

2281
04:31:46,958 --> 04:31:49,544
<i>would be equipped with a slanting trap,</i>

2282
04:31:50,462 --> 04:31:53,548
<i>so that ﬂuid liquids</i>

2283
04:31:57,010 --> 04:32:00,263
<i>can drain off during the operation.</i>

2284
04:32:05,686 --> 04:32:07,562
<i>During cleaning,</i>

2285
04:32:07,771 --> 04:32:12,442
<i>the drain can be used
to evacuate large pieces of din'.</i>

2286
04:32:22,494 --> 04:32:25,622
<i>The aforementioned technical changes</i>

2287
04:32:25,706 --> 04:32:28,291
<i>are to be made
to vehicles in service</i>

2288
04:32:28,375 --> 04:32:32,045
<i>only when they come in for repairs.</i>

2289
04:32:34,631 --> 04:32:38,135
<i>As for the 10 vehicles
ordered from Saurer,</i>

2290
04:32:41,805 --> 04:32:47,728
<i>they must be equipped
with all innovations and changes</i>

2291
04:32:48,812 --> 04:32:52,107
<i>shown by use
and experience to be necessary.</i>

2292
04:32:54,985 --> 04:32:59,614
<i>Submitted for decision
to Gruppenleiter II D,</i>

2293
04:32:59,698 --> 04:33:04,161
<i>SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Walter Rauff.</i>

2294
04:33:06,079 --> 04:33:08,707
<i>Signed Just.”</i>

2295
04:33:19,050 --> 04:33:22,012
END OF THE FIRST ERA

00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:36,830
<i>Looking squarely ahead,
brave and joyous,</i>

3
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:41,626
<i>at the world,</i>

4
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:46,172
<i>the squads march to work.</i>

5
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:51,803
<i>All that matters to us now is Treblinka.</i>

6
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:56,099
<i>It is our destiny.</i>

7
00:00:56,307 --> 00:01:00,645
<i>That's why we've become one
with Treblinka</i>

8
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:04,733
<i>in no time at all.</i>

9
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:09,070
<i>We know only the word
of our Commander.</i>

10
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,450
<i>We know only obedience and duty.</i>

11
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:18,121
<i>We want to serve,
to go on serving</i>

12
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,916
<i>until a little luck ends it all.</i>

13
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,710
<i>Hurray!</i>

14
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,048
<i>Once more, but louder.</i>

15
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:34,220
<i>We're laughing about it but it's so sad.</i>

16
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,764
<i>No one's laughing.</i>

17
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:38,141
<i>Don't be sore at me.</i>

18
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:43,021
<i>You want History.
I'm giving you History.</i>

19
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,857
<i>Franz wrote the words.</i>

20
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,777
<i>The melody came from Buchenwald.</i>

21
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,406
<i>Camp Buchenwald,
where Franz was a guard.</i>

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>New Jews who arrived in the morning...</i>

23
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,662
<i>New “worker Jews”?</i>

24
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,624
<i>They were taught the song,</i>

25
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:06,544
<i>and by evening all of them had to sing it.</i>

26
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,339
- <i>Sing it again.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

27
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:11,883
<i>It's very important. But loud!</i>

28
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,808
<i>Looking squarely ahead,
brave and joyous,</i>

29
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:24,604
<i>at the world,</i>

30
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,108
<i>the squads march to work.</i>

31
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:34,197
<i>All that matters to us now is Treblinka.</i>

32
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:38,368
<i>It is our destiny.</i>

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,914
<i>That's why we've become one

34
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:47,043
<i>in no time at all.</i>

35
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:51,631
<i>We know only the word
of our Commander.</i>

36
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:56,427
<i>We know only obedience and duty.</i>

37
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:01,015
<i>We want to serve,

38
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:04,894
<i>until a little luck ends it all.</i>

39
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:06,437
<i>Hurray!</i>

40
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,107
Satisfied?

41
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,610
That's unique.
No Jews know that today!

42
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:36,444
<i>How was it possible in Treblinka</i>

43
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,906
in peak days

44
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,453
to “process” 18,000 people?

45
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,997
18,000 is too high.

46
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:52,502
- But I read that figure in court reports.
- Sure.

47
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:56,255
To “process” 18,000 people.

48
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,592
To liquidate them.

49
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,139
Mr. Lanzmann, that's an exaggeration.

50
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,016
Believe me.

51
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,643
How many?

52
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,562
12,000 t015,000.

53
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:17,443
But we had to spend half the night at it.

54
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:21,948
In January,
the trains started arriving at 6 A.M.

55
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,952
- Always at 6 A.M.?
- Not always.

56
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,996
Often.
- Yes.

57
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,541
- The schedules were erratic.
- Yes.

58
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:37,130
Sometimes one came at 6 A.M.,
then another at noon,

59
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,842
maybe another late in the evening.

60
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,552
You see?

61
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,805
So a train arrived.

62
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:50,476
I'd like you to describe in detail

63
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,354
the whole process.

64
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,982
During the peak period.

65
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:03,489
The trains left Malkinia station,

66
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,117
for Treblinka station.

67
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:21,758
<i>How many miles from Malkinia to Treblinka?</i>

68
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,136
<i>About six miles.</i>

69
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,832
<i>Treblinka was a village.</i>

70
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,047
<i>A small village.</i>

71
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,258
<i>As a station,</i>

72
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:09,722
<i>it gained in importance
because of the transports of Jews.</i>

73
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:21,526
<i>There were at least 30 to 50 cars.</i>

74
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:33,246
<i>They were divided
into sections of 10 or 15,</i>

75
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,917
<i>shunted into Treblinka Camp,</i>

76
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,172
<i>and brought to the ramp.</i>

77
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,929
<i>The other cars waited, loaded with people,</i>

78
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,558
<i>in Treblinka station.</i>

79
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:02,525
<i>The windows were closed off
with barbed wire,</i>

80
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,862
<i>so no one could get out.</i>

81
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:10,783
<i>On the roofs were the “hellhounds,”</i>

82
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,953
<i>the Ukrainians or Latvians.</i>

83
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,456
<i>The Latvians were the worst.</i>

84
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,592
<i>On the ramp, for each car,</i>

85
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,472
<i>there stood
two Jews from Blue Squad</i>

86
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,018
<i>to speed things up.</i>

87
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:43,024
<i>They said,
“Get out, get out. Hurry, hurry!”</i>

88
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:51,032
<i>There were also Ukrainians and Germans.</i>

89
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,004
How many Germans?

90
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,631
3to 5.

91
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,218
- No more?
- No more. I can assure you.

92
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,428
How many Ukrainians?

93
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,804
Ten.

94
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:18,809
10 Ukrainians, 5 Germans.

95
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,066
2... 20 people from the Blue Squad.

96
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,237
Men from the Blue Squad
were here and here.

97
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,114
They sent the people inside.

98
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,118
The Red Squad was here.

99
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,538
So the Red Squad was here.

100
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:44,252
What was the Red Squad's job?

101
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:49,966
The clothes...

102
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,678
to carry the clothes
taken off by the men

103
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,098
and by the women

104
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:04,855
up here immediately.

105
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,902
How much time elapsed
between unloading at the ramp

106
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:12,947
and the undressing,

107
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,865
how many minutes?

108
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:22,915
For the women,

109
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,918
let's say an hour in all.

110
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,130
An hour, an hour and a half.

111
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,801
A whole train took <i>2</i> hours.
- Yes.

112
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:41,058
In <i>2</i> hours, it was all over.

113
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:46,105
Between the time of arrival

114
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,773
and death.

115
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:52,278
It was all over in <i>2</i> hours?
- <i>2</i> hours, 2 1/2 hours, 3 hours.

116
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,904
A whole train?

117
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,073
Yes, a whole train.

118
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:00,995
And for only one section,
for 10 cars, how long?

119
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,331
I can't calculate that

120
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,833
because the sections
came one after another,

121
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:11,756
and people ﬂooded in constantly,

122
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,424
understand?

123
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:17,762
Usually, the men waiting
who sat there, or there,

124
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,600
were sent straight up via the “funnel.”

125
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:27,313
The women were sent last.

126
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,648
At the end.

127
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:34,820
They had to go up there too,
and often waited here.

128
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,659
5... at a time.

129
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:44,955
50 people.
60 women with children.

130
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,836
They had to wait here
until there was room here.

131
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,005
- Naked.
- Naked.

132
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,133
In summer and winter.

133
00:11:57,218 --> 00:12:00,971
<i>Winter in Treblinka can be very cold.</i>

134
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:06,310
<i>Well, in winter, in December,
anyway after Christmas.</i>

135
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,022
<i>But even before Christmas
it was cold as hell.</i>

136
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,152
<i>Between 15 and minus 4.</i>

137
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:22,535
<i>I know: At first
it was cold as hell for us, too.</i>

138
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:26,038
<i>We didn't have suitable uniforms.</i>

139
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,083
<i>It was cold for us too.</i>

140
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,169
But it was colder for...

141
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,755
For those poor people.

142
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,173
In the “funnel.”

143
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:39,677
In the “funnel,” it was very, very cold.

144
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,150
Can you...

145
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:01,699
describe this “funnel” precisely?

146
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:05,828
What was it like?
How wide?

147
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,039
How was it
for the people in this “funnel”?

148
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:13,419
It was about 13 feet wide.

149
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:18,007
As wide as this room.

150
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:24,680
On each side were walls
this high or this high.

151
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:29,393
- Walls?
- No, barbed wire.

152
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:33,564
Woven into the barbed wire

153
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:38,861
were branches of pine trees.

154
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,031
You understand?

155
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,200
It was known as “camouﬂage.”

156
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:48,162
There was a “Camouﬂage Squad” of 20 Jews.

157
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,999
They brought in new branches every day.

158
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,211
- From the woods?
- That's right.

159
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,964
So everything was screened.

160
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,885
People couldn't see anything
to the left or right.

161
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,804
Nothing.

162
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,974
You couldn't see through it.

163
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,351
Impossible.

164
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:15,898
Here and here too.

165
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,483
Here, too.

166
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,156
<i>Impossible to see through.</i>

167
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:31,288
THE CAMP TODAY

168
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:49,765
<i>Treblinka,</i>

169
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:55,020
<i>where so many people
were exterminated,</i>

170
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,524
<i>wasn't big, right?</i>

171
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,278
<i>It wasn't big.</i>

172
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,699
<i>1600 feet at the widest point.</i>

173
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:14,415
<i>It wasn't a rectangle,
more like a rhomboid.</i>

174
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,838
<i>You must realize
that here the ground was ﬂat,</i>

175
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:26,343
<i>and here it began to rise.</i>

176
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,396
<i>And at the top of the slope
was the gas chamber.</i>

177
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,902
You had to climb up to it.

178
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,574
The “funnel” was called
the “Road to Heaven,” right?

179
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:53,370
The Jews called it the “Ascension.”

180
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,958
Also “The Last Road.”

181
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,882
I only heard those two names for it.

182
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,217
I need to see it.

183
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:10,262
The people go into the “funnel.”

184
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,972
Then what happens?

185
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,060
They're totally naked?
- Totally naked.

186
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,561
Here...

187
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,733
stood two Ukrainian guards.

188
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,318
Yes.

189
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,154
Mainly for the men.

190
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,492
If the men wouldn't go in,

191
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:38,457
they were beaten with whips.

192
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,127
Here too. Even here.
- Ah, yes.

193
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,589
The men were “driven” along.
Not the women.

194
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,424
Not the women.

195
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,468
No, they weren't beaten.

196
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,262
Why such humanity?

197
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,765
I didn't see it.

198
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,476
I didn't see it.

199
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,520
Maybe they were beaten too.

200
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,563
Why not?

201
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,235
They were about to die anyway.

202
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,779
Why not?

203
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,618
At the entrance to the gas chambers,

204
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,955
undoubtedly.

205
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:23,127
ABRAHAM BOMBA
- ISRAEL -

206
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:03,973
<i>In the “funnel,” the women had to wait.</i>

207
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:09,437
<i>They heard the motors of the gas chamber.</i>

208
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:16,861
<i>Maybe they also heard people
screaming and imploring.</i>

209
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:31,667
<i>As they waited,
“death-panic” oven/vhetrned them.</i>

210
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,053
“Death-panic” makes people let go.

211
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:47,391
They empty themselves,
from the front or the rear.

212
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:54,190
So often,
where the women stood,

213
00:37:54,273 --> 00:38:00,154
there were 5 or 6 rows
of excrement.

214
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,032
They stood?

215
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:07,745
They could squat or do it standing.

216
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,747
I didn't see them do it.

217
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,042
I only saw the feces.

218
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,961
Only women?

219
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,380
Not the men, only the women.

220
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,800
The men were chased through the “funnel.”

221
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:24,428
The women had to wait

222
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,141
until a gas chamber was empty.

223
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:34,355
- And the men?
- No, they were whipped in first.

224
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:36,649
You understand?

225
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,484
The men were always first?

226
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,070
Yes, they always went first.

227
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,572
They didn't have to wait.

228
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:47,451
They weren't given time to wait, no.

229
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,666
And this “death-panic”...

230
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,127
When this “death-panic” sets in,

231
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,172
one lets go.

232
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:06,512
It's well-known when someone's terrified
and knows he's about to die.

233
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,181
It can happen in bed.

234
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:12,309
My mother was kneeling by her bed.

235
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,565
- Your mother?
- Yes. Then there was a big pile.

236
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,360
That's a fact.

237
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,529
It's been medically...

238
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,282
proven.

239
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,035
Since you wanted to know:

240
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:33,205
As soon as they were unloaded,

241
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:38,210
if they'd been loaded
in Warsaw, or elsewhere,

242
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,463
they'd already been beaten.

243
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,925
Beaten hard, worse than in Treblinka,

244
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,428
I can assure you.

245
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,933
<i>Then during the train journey,</i>

246
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,144
<i>standing in cars,</i>

247
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,188
<i>no toilets,</i>

248
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,858
<i>nothing, hardly any water.</i>

249
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,568
Fean

250
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:06,530
Then the doors opened
and it started again,

251
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:10,159
“Bremze, bremze!”

252
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:15,498
“Szybciej, szybciej !”

253
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:20,544
I can't pronounce it:
I have false teeth.

254
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:21,670
It's Polish.

255
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:24,507
“Bremze” or “szybciej.”

256
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,300
What does “bremze” mean?

257
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:29,762
It's a Ukrainian word.
It means “faster.”

258
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:35,935
Again the chase...
a hail of whiplashes.

259
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,395
The SS man Kuttner's whip was this long.

260
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,732
Women to the left, men to the right.

261
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,736
And always more blows.

262
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,822
No respite?

263
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:49,448
None.

264
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:54,286
Go in there, strip. Hurry, hurry!

265
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,082
- Always running.
- Always running.

266
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,876
Running and screaming.

267
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,463
That's how they were finished off.

268
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:07,633
- That was the technique.
- Yes, the technique.

269
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:14,849
<i>You must remember: it had to go fast.</i>

270
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:20,563
<i>And the Blue Squad
also had the task</i>

271
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:25,484
<i>of leading the sick and the aged...</i>

272
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:28,445
<i>to the “Infirmary,</i> ”

273
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:34,910
<i>so as not to delay the ﬂow
of the people to the gas chambers.</i>

274
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:39,039
<i>Old people would have slowed it down.</i>

275
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:45,504
<i>Assignment to the “infirmary”</i>

276
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,466
<i>was decided by Germans.</i>

277
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:54,430
The Jews of the Blue Squad

278
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:59,018
only implemented the decision:

279
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:02,730
leading the people there,

280
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:07,401
or carrying them on stretchers.

281
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,616
<i>Old women, sick children,</i>

282
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,368
<i>children whose mother was sick,</i>

283
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,997
<i>or whose grandmother was very old,</i>

284
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:23,792
<i>were sent along with the grandma</i>

285
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:27,713
<i>because she didn't know
about the “infirmary.”</i>

286
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:33,010
<i>It had a white ﬂag with a red cross.</i>

287
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,224
<i>A passage led to it.</i>

288
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:42,269
<i>Until they reached the end,
they saw nothing.</i>

289
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,650
<i>Then they'd see the dead in the pit.</i>

290
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,574
<i>They were forced to strip,</i>

291
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,746
<i>to sit on a sandbank,</i>

292
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:05,417
<i>and were killed with a shot in the neck.</i>

293
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:09,421
<i>They fell into the pit.</i>

294
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:17,596
<i>There was always a fire in the pit.</i>

295
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:24,019
<i>With rubbish, paper and gasoline,</i>

296
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,359
<i>people burn very well.</i>

297
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:36,365
RICHARD GLAZAR
- SWITZERLAND -

298
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:43,956
The “infirmary” was a narrow site

299
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,210
very close to the ramp

300
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:54,633
to which the aged were led.

301
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:57,803
I had to do this too.

302
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:08,397
This execution site wasn't covered,

303
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:12,234
just an open place with a roof,

304
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,487
but screened by a fence,

305
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:18,115
so no one could see in.

306
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:28,375
The way in was a narrow passage,

307
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:36,967
very short,
but somewhat similar to the “funnel.”

308
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,804
A sort of tiny labyrinth.

309
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:46,352
In the middle of it, there was a pit.

310
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:53,108
And to the left as one came in,

311
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:55,736
there was a little booth,

312
00:44:55,819 --> 00:45:00,866
with a kind of wooden plank in it,

313
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,410
like a springboard.

314
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:09,416
If people were too weak to stand on it,

315
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:14,630
they'd have to sit on it,

316
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:17,424
and then,

317
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:25,015
as the saying went in Treblinka jargon,

318
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:34,525
SS man Miete would

319
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:40,364
“cure each one with a single pill”:

320
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,660
a shot in the neck.

321
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:52,918
In the peak periods,

322
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,129
that happened daily.

323
00:45:55,212 --> 00:46:00,884
In those days, the pit...

324
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,178
and it was at least

325
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:08,851
10 to 12 feet deep...

326
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,228
was full of corpses.

327
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:24,700
There were also cases

328
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:31,206
of children who
for some reason arrived alone

329
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,711
or got separated from their parents.

330
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:39,673
These children were led
to the “infirmary”

331
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:42,426
and shot there.

332
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:55,481
The “infirmary” was also for us,

333
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:58,025
the Treblinka slaves,

334
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,236
the last stop.

335
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,615
Not the gas chamber.

336
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:10,412
We always ended up in the “infirmary.”

00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:20,227
THE NEW RAMP BUILT IN EARLY 1944

341
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:12,923
<i>Before each gassing operation,</i>

342
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:17,260
<i>the SS took stern precautions.</i>

343
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:25,101
<i>The crematorium
was surrounded by SS men.</i>

344
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:32,651
<i>Many SS men patrolled the court</i>

345
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:38,532
<i>with dogs and machine-guns.</i>

346
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:49,042
<i>To the right were the steps</i>

347
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:54,673
<i>that led underground
to the “undressing room.”</i>

348
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,278
<i>In Birkenau, there were 4 crematoria,</i>

349
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:25,579
<i>Crematorium II, III and IV, V.</i>

350
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:34,254
<i>Crematorium II was similar to III.</i>

351
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:44,097
<i>In II and III,</i>

352
00:53:44,306 --> 00:53:49,060
<i>the “undressing room”
and the gas chambers were underground.</i>

353
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:56,026
<i>A large “undressing room”</i>

354
00:53:57,861 --> 00:54:01,281
<i>of about 3000 square feet</i>

355
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:25,639
<i>and a large gas chamber...</i>

356
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:31,603
<i>where one could...</i>

357
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:40,028
<i>gas up to 3000 people at a time.</i>

358
00:54:51,873 --> 00:55:02,384
<i>Crematorium I V and V
were of a different type</i>

359
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:08,473
<i>in that they weren't located underground.</i>

360
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:12,352
<i>Everything was at ground level.</i>

361
00:55:14,104 --> 00:55:17,691
<i>In IV and V,
there were 3 gas chambers</i>

362
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:19,818
<i>with a total capacity</i>

363
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:24,614
<i>of at most 1800 to 2000 people at a time.</i>

AUSCHWITZ MUSEUM
MODEL OF CREMATORIUMS II AND III

365
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:35,625
Elevators hoisted bodies
to the ovens

366
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:47,971
<i>Crematorium II and III had 15 ovens each.</i>

367
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:53,018
<i>Crematorium IV and V had 8 ovens each.</i>

368
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:09,159
<i>As people reached the crematorium,</i>

369
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:12,078
<i>they saw everything...</i>

370
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:15,373
<i>this horribly violent scene.</i>

371
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,421
<i>The whole area was ringed with SS men.</i>

372
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:24,382
<i>Dogs barked.</i>

373
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:26,843
<i>Machine-guns.</i>

374
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:35,310
<i>They all, mainly the Polish Jews,
had misgivings.</i>

375
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:42,734
<i>They knew something was seriously amiss.</i>

376
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:53,620
<i>But none of them
had the faintest of notions</i>

377
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:57,707
<i>that in 3 or 4 hours
they'd be reduced to ashes.</i>

378
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:07,759
<i>When they reached
the “undressing room,”</i>

379
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:10,428
<i>they saw</i>

380
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:17,811
<i>that it looked like
an International Information Center!</i>

381
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:39,791
<i>On the walls were...</i>

382
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,920
<i>hooks,</i>

383
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:50,343
<i>and each hook had a number.</i>

384
00:57:52,929 --> 00:57:56,224
<i>Beneath the hooks were...</i>

385
00:57:58,184 --> 00:58:00,562
<i>wooden benches.</i>

386
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:06,693
<i>So people could undress
“more comfortably,” it was said.</i>

387
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:13,491
<i>And on the numerous pillars</i>

388
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:19,080
<i>that held up
this underground “undressing room,”</i>

389
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:22,584
<i>there were signs with slogans</i>

390
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:26,421
<i>in several languages:</i>

391
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:31,926
<i>“Clean is good!”</i>

392
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,931
<i>“Lice can kill!”</i>

393
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,768
<i>“Wash yourself!”</i>

394
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,565
<i>“To the disinfection area.”</i>

395
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:53,615
<i>All those signs</i>

396
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:57,118
<i>were only there</i>

397
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:03,541
<i>to lure people into the gas chambers
already undressed.</i>

398
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:28,524
<i>And to the left,</i>

399
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:33,988
<i>at a fight-angle,
was the gas chamber</i>

400
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:44,165
<i>with its massive door.</i>

401
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:08,106
CREMATORIUM III:
THE UNDRESSING ROOM

402
01:00:41,431 --> 01:00:45,852
THE GAS CHAMBER

403
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:06,414
<i>In Crematoria II and III,
Zyklon gas crystals were poured in</i>

404
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:10,376
<i>by a so-called
“SS disinfection squad,”</i>

405
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,588
<i>through the ceiling,</i>

406
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:28,227
<i>and in Crematoria IV and V
through side openings.</i>

407
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:37,779
<i>With 5 or 6 canisters of gas,</i>

408
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:42,450
<i>they could kill around 2000 people.</i>

409
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:54,420
<i>This so-called “disinfection squad”</i>

410
01:01:56,005 --> 01:02:00,301
<i>arrived in a truck
marked with a red cross</i>

411
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:05,807
<i>and escorted people along</i>

412
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:13,272
<i>to make them believe
they were being led to take a bath.</i>

413
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:21,030
<i>But the red cross was only a mark</i>

414
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:26,035
<i>to hide the canisters of Zyklon gas
and the hammers to open them.</i>

415
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:38,923
<i>The gas took about
10 to 15 minutes to kill.</i>

416
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:50,518
<i>The most horrible thing was,</i>

417
01:02:52,395 --> 01:02:55,356
<i>once the doors of the gas chambers
were opened...</i>

418
01:02:56,023 --> 01:03:01,195
<i>the unbearable sight.</i>

419
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:10,538
<i>People were packed together like basalt,</i>

420
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,542
<i>like blocks of stone.</i>

421
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,300
<i>How they tumbled out of the gas chamber!</i>

422
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:28,973
<i>I saw that several times.</i>

423
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,563
<i>That was the toughest thing to take.</i>

424
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:40,818
<i>You could never get used to that.</i>

425
01:03:43,446 --> 01:03:45,740
<i>It was impossible.</i>

426
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:49,577
CREMATORIUM IV

427
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,165
Impossible.

428
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,751
Yes.

429
01:03:56,834 --> 01:04:02,840
You see, once the gas was poured in,
it worked like this:

430
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:06,511
it rose from the ground upwards.

431
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:11,474
And in the terrible struggle
that followed,

432
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:15,603
because it was a struggle.

433
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:22,652
The lights were switched off
in the gas chambers.

434
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:26,614
It was dark, no one could see.

435
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:32,495
So the strongest people
tried to climb higher.

436
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:35,331
Because they probably realized

437
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:38,876
that the higher they got,

438
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,921
the more air there was.

439
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:44,924
They could breathe better.

440
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:49,053
That caused the struggle.

441
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:53,307
Secondly, most people
tried to push their way to the door.

442
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:55,643
It was psychological:

443
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,728
They knew where the door was,

444
01:04:57,812 --> 01:05:00,523
so maybe they could force their way.

445
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:02,483
It was instinctive,

446
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:08,656
a death struggle.

447
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:11,826
Which is why children...

448
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,579
and weaker people,
and the aged,

449
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:16,497
always wound up at the bottom.

450
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:19,667
The strongest were on top.

451
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:26,924
Because in the death struggle...

452
01:05:28,593 --> 01:05:33,889
a father didn't realize his son lay...

453
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,851
beneath him.

454
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:40,354
And when the doors were opened?

455
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:42,481
They fell out.

456
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:46,193
People fell out like blocks of stone,

457
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:50,156
like rocks falling out of a truck.

458
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:54,702
But near the Zyklon gas, there was a void.

459
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:59,081
There was no one
where the gas crystals went in.

460
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:01,626
An empty space.

461
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:07,089
Probably the victims realized that

462
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:12,762
the gas worked strongest there.

463
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:19,644
And the people were...?

464
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:23,564
The people were battered.

465
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:32,239
They struggled and fought
in the darkness.

466
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,411
They were covered in excrement,

467
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,082
in blood,

468
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:45,419
from ears and noses.

469
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:52,843
One also sometimes saw

470
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:56,555
that the people lying on the ground,

471
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:01,644
because of the pressure of the others,

472
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:07,233
were unrecognizable.

473
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:11,779
Children had their skulls crushed.

474
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:15,825
- Yes.
- What?

475
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:18,536
It was awful.

476
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:23,666
Vomit.

477
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:29,797
Blood from the ears and noses.

478
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,260
Probably even menstrual ﬂuid...
sure of it.

479
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:38,055
There was everything
in that struggle for life,

480
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:40,141
that death struggle.

481
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:45,187
It was terrible to see.
That was the toughest part.

482
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:50,151
FILIP MULLER, Czech Jew

483
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:56,782
survivor of the 5 liquidations
of the Auschwitz “special detail”

484
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:29,190
<i>It was pointless</i>

485
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:33,194
<i>to tell the truth to anyone</i>

486
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,200
<i>who crossed the threshold
of the crematorium.</i>

487
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:46,707
<i>You couldn't save anyone there.</i>

488
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:52,588
<i>It was impossible to save people.</i>

489
01:09:03,015 --> 01:09:05,142
<i>One day, in 1943,</i>

490
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:09,605
<i>when I was already in Crematorium V,</i>

491
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:15,069
<i>a train from Bialystok arrived.</i>

492
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:21,534
<i>A prisoner on the “special detail”</i>

493
01:09:21,909 --> 01:09:26,747
<i>saw a woman in the “undressing room,”</i>

494
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:31,418
<i>who was the wife of a friend of his.</i>

495
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:38,592
<i>He came right out and told her,</i>

496
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:41,762
<i>“You are going to be exterminated.</i>

497
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:46,100
<i>In 3 hours, you'll be ashes.”</i>

498
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:58,946
<i>The woman believed him
because she knew him.</i>

499
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:08,706
<i>She ran all over</i>

500
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:11,625
<i>and warned the other women.</i>

501
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:16,088
<i>“We're going to be killed.</i>

502
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:19,133
<i>We're going to be gassed.”</i>

503
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:27,182
<i>Mothers carrying their children
on their shoulders</i>

504
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:29,476
<i>didn't want to hear that.</i>

505
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:33,147
<i>They decided the woman was crazy.</i>

506
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:38,027
<i>They chased her away.</i>

507
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,825
<i>So she went to the men.</i>

508
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,829
<i>To no avail.</i>

509
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:52,374
<i>Not that they didn't believe her.</i>

510
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:55,920
<i>They'd heard rumors
in the Bialystok ghetto,</i>

511
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:57,796
<i>or in Grodno, and elsewhere.</i>

512
01:10:58,756 --> 01:11:01,842
<i>But who wanted to hear that!</i>

513
01:11:08,349 --> 01:11:12,186
<i>When she saw that no one would listen,</i>

514
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:16,357
<i>she scratched her whole face.</i>

515
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:20,277
<i>Out of despair. In shock.</i>

516
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:23,697
<i>And she started to scream.</i>

517
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:29,870
<i>So what happened?</i>

518
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:34,291
<i>Everyone was gassed.
The woman was held back.</i>

519
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:41,215
<i>We had to line up in front of the oven.</i>

520
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:47,137
<i>First they tortured her horribly,</i>

521
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,556
<i>because she wouldn't betray him.</i>

522
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:56,563
<i>In the end, she pointed to him.</i>

523
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:05,072
<i>He was taken out of the line
and thrown alive into the oven.</i>

524
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:10,744
<i>We were told,
“Whoever says anything will end like that!”</i>

525
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:21,088
We, in the “special detail,”
kept trying to figure out

526
01:12:21,672 --> 01:12:24,883
if there was a way

527
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,471
we could tell people

528
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,851
to inform them.

529
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:39,023
But our experience,

530
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:43,610
in several instances
where we were able to tell people,

531
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:47,281
showed that it was of no use.

532
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:52,036
That it made their last moments
even harder to bear.

533
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:56,623
At most, we thought it might help...

534
01:12:56,707 --> 01:13:00,586
Jews from Poland,

535
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:05,132
or Jews from Theresienstadt
(the Czech family camp),

536
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:09,136
who'd already spent 6 months in Birkenau,

537
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:13,390
we thought it might have been
of use in such cases

538
01:13:13,474 --> 01:13:15,476
to tell people.

539
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:19,897
But imagine what it was like
in other cases:

540
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:25,069
Jews from Greece,
from Hungary, from Corfu

541
01:13:25,152 --> 01:13:29,239
who'd been traveling for 10 or 12 days,

542
01:13:29,323 --> 01:13:30,908
starving,

543
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:36,121
without water for days, dying of thirst,

544
01:13:36,205 --> 01:13:39,083
they were half-crazed when they arrived.

545
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:41,752
They were dealt with differently.

546
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:44,379
They were only told,

547
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:50,010
“Get undressed,
you'll soon get a mug of tea.”

548
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:54,807
These people were in such a state

549
01:13:54,890 --> 01:14:00,354
because they'd been traveling so long,

550
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:04,566
that their only thought

551
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:08,612
was to quench their thirst.

552
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:11,990
And the SS executioners
knew that very well.

553
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:16,328
It was all preprogrammed,

554
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,127
a calculated part
of the extermination process

555
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:26,088
that if people were so weak

556
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:28,674
and weren't given something to drink,

557
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:32,219
they'd rush into the gas chamber.

558
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:35,597
But in fact,

559
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:41,937
all these people were already
being exterminated

560
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,730
before reaching the gas chambers.

561
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:46,066
Think of the children.

562
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,653
They begged their mothers, screaming,

563
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:52,698
“Mother, please, water, water!”

564
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:57,744
The adults, too,
who'd spent days without water,

565
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:01,123
had the same obsession.

566
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:04,877
Informing those people
was quite pointless.

567
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:18,348
CORFU

568
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:50,375
- Grab it from there.
- Yes, grab it from there.

569
01:17:50,459 --> 01:17:52,044
- Put it right there.
- Okay.

570
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:53,879
- Right there.
- Okay, yes.

571
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:56,089
Okay, be careful. Wait.

572
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:59,217
You'll come and pick it up later?
- Yes.

573
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:01,303
- Put it down.
- In a second.

574
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:03,805
Hold on a second.

575
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:05,682
Just hold on a second.

576
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,602
Maybe if you removed this?

577
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:11,521
Got it? That's how you'll load it.

578
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,857
Come and pick it up next week.

579
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,443
Understood?
Now move the cart away from here.

580
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:18,236
Move the cart.

581
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,947
Yes, let's make some space.

582
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:23,200
<i>So you're an actor now.</i>

583
01:18:26,286 --> 01:18:27,287
Let's finish this.

584
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:01,780
MOSHE MORDO

585
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:24,511
<i>These are my nephews.</i>

586
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:27,639
<i>They burned them in Birkenau.</i>

587
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:33,770
<i>Two of my brother's kids.</i>

588
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:37,357
<i>They took them
to the crematorium with their mom.</i>

589
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,527
<i>They were all burned in Birkenau.</i>

590
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:53,665
My brother.

591
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:58,295
He was sick,

592
01:19:58,378 --> 01:20:03,508
and they put him in the oven,
in the crematorium, and burned him.

593
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:07,471
That was at Birkenau.

594
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:15,520
The oldest boy was 17,

595
01:20:16,438 --> 01:20:18,857
the second was 15.

596
01:20:20,275 --> 01:20:23,695
Two more kids “kaput” with their mom.

597
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:29,409
Yes, 4 children I lost.

598
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:40,921
Your father too?

599
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:44,591
My dad, him too.

600
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,801
How old was your father?

601
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:53,016
Dad was 85 years old.

602
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:56,478
85 years old and he died in Auschwitz.

603
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:59,356
Auschwitz, that's right.

604
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:04,778
85 and he died at Birkenau.

605
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:07,614
My father.

606
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:10,367
Your father made the whole trip.

607
01:21:19,251 --> 01:21:21,211
The whole family died.

608
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:24,631
First the gas chamber,
then the crematorium.

609
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:40,600
On Friday morning, June 9, 1944,

610
01:23:40,684 --> 01:23:46,231
members of the Corfu Jewish
community came, very frightened,

611
01:23:46,314 --> 01:23:49,025
and reported to the Germans.

612
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:54,197
This square was full
of Gestapo men and police,

613
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:56,366
and we went forward.

614
01:23:56,449 --> 01:24:00,787
There were even traitors,
the Recanati brothers, Athens Jews.

615
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:07,127
After the war they were sentenced
to life imprisonment.

616
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:10,296
But they're already free.

617
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:18,388
We were ordered to go forward.

618
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:21,891
- By the street?
- Yes, by this street.

619
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:26,896
- How many of you were there?
- Exactly 1,650.

620
01:24:31,151 --> 01:24:34,070
- Quite a crowd?
- A lot of people.

621
01:24:34,154 --> 01:24:37,115
Christians stopped there.

622
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:39,492
Christians, that's right.
And they saw.

623
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:41,536
Where were the Christians?

624
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:45,582
- At the street corner?
- Yes.

625
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:47,625
And on the balconies.

626
01:24:48,877 --> 01:24:51,379
After we gathered here,

627
01:24:51,463 --> 01:24:55,425
Gestapo men with machine-guns
came up behind us.

628
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:58,303
What time was it?

629
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:01,389
- It was 6 A.M.
- In the morning.

630
01:25:01,473 --> 01:25:03,808
- A fine day?
- Yes, the day was fine.

631
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,353
6 o'clock in the morning.

632
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:10,231
1,600.
That's a lot of people in the street.

633
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:12,150
People gathered.

634
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:16,946
The Christians heard the Jews
were being rounded up.

635
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:20,366
- Why'd they come?
- To see the show.

636
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:28,708
Let's hope it never happens again.

637
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:32,420
- Were you scared?
- Very scared.

638
01:25:32,504 --> 01:25:35,548
There were young people,

639
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:38,551
sick people, little children,

640
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:41,805
<i>the old, the crazy, and so on.</i>

641
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:50,688
<i>When we saw
they'd even brought the insane,</i>

642
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:54,400
<i>even the sick from the hospital,</i>

643
01:25:54,484 --> 01:25:57,821
<i>we were frightened</i>

644
01:25:57,904 --> 01:26:00,990
<i>for the survival
of the whole community.</i>

645
01:26:03,785 --> 01:26:05,328
What were you told?

646
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,498
That we were
to appear here at the fort

647
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:11,417
to be taken to work in Germany.

648
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:14,754
- Poland.
- Poland, that's right.

649
01:26:16,631 --> 01:26:22,679
The Germans had put up
a proclamation on all the walls in Corfu.

650
01:26:23,471 --> 01:26:26,808
It said all Jews had to report.

651
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:29,018
And once we were all rounded up,

652
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:33,940
life would be better
without us in Greece.

653
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:39,112
It was signed by the police chiefs,
by officials and by the mayors.

654
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:42,073
- That it's better without Jews?
- Yes.

655
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:45,285
We found out after we came back.

656
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,498
Was Corfu anti-Semitic?

657
01:26:54,919 --> 01:26:57,964
Corfu's always had anti-Semitism?

658
01:26:58,214 --> 01:26:59,757
It existed, sure,

659
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:04,929
but it wasn't so strong
in the years just before that.

660
01:27:05,013 --> 01:27:06,264
Why not?

661
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:11,144
Because they didn't
think like that against the Jews.

662
01:27:11,394 --> 01:27:15,106
ARMANDO AARON
President of the Corfu Jewish community

663
01:27:15,315 --> 01:27:19,402
- And now?
- Now we're free.

664
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:24,991
- How do you get on with the Christians now?
- Very well.

665
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,337
- What'd he say?
- He asked me what you said.

666
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:41,257
He agrees our relations
with the Christians are very good.

667
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:59,817
<i>- Did all the Jews live in the ghetto?
- Most of them.</i>

668
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:07,909
<i>What happened after the Jews left?</i>

669
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:12,246
<i>They took all our possessions,
all the gold we had with us.</i>

670
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:16,334
<i>They took the keys to our houses
and stole everything.</i>

671
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:22,757
To whom was all this given?
Who stole it all?

672
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,095
By law, it was to go
to the Greek government.

673
01:28:27,178 --> 01:28:32,100
But the state got only a small part of it.

674
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:35,019
The rest was stolen, usurped.

675
01:28:35,228 --> 01:28:38,690
- By whom?
- By everybody, and by the Germans.

676
01:28:43,486 --> 01:28:46,656
Of the 1,700 people deported...

677
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:50,076
Around 122 were saved.

678
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:53,579
95% of them died.

679
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:59,043
Was it a long trip
from Corfu to Auschwitz?

680
01:28:59,127 --> 01:29:01,671
We were arrested here on June 9,

681
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:05,508
and finally arrived June 29.

682
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:09,429
Most were burned on the night of the 29th.

683
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:12,265
It lasted from June 9 to 29?

684
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:19,188
We stayed here for around 5 days.

685
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:23,651
Here in the fort.

686
01:29:26,654 --> 01:29:31,159
<i>No one dared escape
and leave his father, mother, brothers.</i>

687
01:29:31,242 --> 01:29:36,914
<i>Our solidarity was
on religious and family grounds.</i>

688
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:42,462
<i>The first group left on June 11.</i>

689
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:48,468
<i>I went with the 2nd convoy, on June 15.</i>

690
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:58,436
<i>What kind of a boat were you on?</i>

691
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:05,359
<i>A zattera.
That's a boat made of barrels and planks.</i>

692
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:09,155
<i>It was towed by a small boat
with Germans in it.</i>

693
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:14,619
<i>On our boat there were 1, 2 or 3 guards,</i>

694
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:18,122
<i>not many Germans, but we were terrified.</i>

695
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:21,959
<i>You can understand,
terror is the best of guards.</i>

696
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:47,860
<i>- What was the journey like?
- Terrible! Terrible!</i>

697
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:52,698
<i>No water, nothing to eat.</i>

698
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:58,538
<i>90 cars that were good
for only 20 animals,</i>

699
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:00,790
<i>all of us standing up.</i>

700
01:31:03,543 --> 01:31:05,711
<i>A lot of us died.</i>

701
01:31:06,671 --> 01:31:10,174
<i>Later they put the dead
in another car in quicklime.</i>

702
01:31:10,258 --> 01:31:15,471
<i>They burned them in Auschwitz, too.</i>

703
01:31:24,564 --> 01:31:29,485
Next figure: WALTER STIER
Ex-member of the Nazi party

704
01:31:30,361 --> 01:31:34,574
Former head, Reich Railways, Bureau 33
(“Railroads of the Reich”)

705
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:38,327
<i>You never saw a train?</i>

706
01:31:38,703 --> 01:31:40,496
<i>No, never.</i>

707
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:44,709
<i>We had so much work,
I never left my desk.</i>

708
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,045
<i>We worked day and night.</i>

709
01:31:54,427 --> 01:31:56,012
<i>“GE. D. O.B. ”</i>

710
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:00,683
<i>“GE DOB</i> ” <i>means
'Head office of Eastbound Traffic.</i> ”

711
01:32:05,271 --> 01:32:09,775
<i>In January 1940, I was assigned
to GEDOB Krakow.</i>

712
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:16,699
<i>In mid-1943, I was moved to Warsaw.</i>

713
01:32:17,909 --> 01:32:23,497
<i>I was made chief traffic planner.</i>

714
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:26,459
<i>Chief of the traffic planning office.</i>

715
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:35,009
<i>But your duties were the same
before and after 1943?</i>

716
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:40,973
<i>The only change:
I was promoted to head of the department.</i>

717
01:32:44,185 --> 01:32:50,441
<i>What were your specific duties
at GEDOB in Poland during the war?</i>

718
01:32:51,484 --> 01:32:54,237
<i>The work was barely different</i>

719
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,281
<i>from the work in Germany:</i>

720
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:01,494
<i>preparing timetables,</i>

721
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:07,667
<i>coordinating the movement
of special trains with regular trains.</i>

722
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:12,380
- <i>There were several departments?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

723
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:17,885
<i>Department 33 was in charge
of special trains</i>

724
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:20,638
<i>and regular trains.</i>

725
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:25,017
<i>The special trains
were handled by Department 33.</i>

726
01:33:25,935 --> 01:33:29,522
<i>You were always
in the Department of Special Trains?</i>

727
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:31,148
<i>Yes.</i>

728
01:33:32,108 --> 01:33:36,529
<i>What's the difference between
a special and a regular train ?</i>

729
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,658
<i>A regular train may be used</i>

730
01:33:40,741 --> 01:33:45,162
<i>by anyone
who purchases a ticket.</i>

731
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:50,876
<i>Say from Krakow to Warsaw.</i>

732
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,546
<i>Or from Krakow to Lemberg.</i>

733
01:33:55,214 --> 01:34:00,803
<i>A special train has to be ordered.</i>

734
01:34:04,098 --> 01:34:07,977
The train is specially put together

735
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:11,230
and people PaY---

736
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:14,358
group fares.

737
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:17,653
Are there still special trains now?

738
01:34:17,737 --> 01:34:19,572
Of course.

739
01:34:19,989 --> 01:34:22,325
Just as there were then.

740
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:26,829
For group vacations
you can organize a special train?

741
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:29,707
Yes, for instance,

742
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:34,712
for immigrant workers
returning home for the holidays,

743
01:34:35,463 --> 01:34:40,551
special trains are scheduled.

744
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:44,805
Or else one couldn't handle the traffic.

745
01:34:47,016 --> 01:34:52,980
You said after the war you handled
trains for visiting dignitaries.

746
01:34:53,064 --> 01:34:55,775
After the war, yes.

747
01:34:56,734 --> 01:35:00,613
If a king visits Germany by train,

748
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:02,531
that's a special train?

749
01:35:02,615 --> 01:35:04,784
That's a special train.

750
01:35:05,326 --> 01:35:10,456
But the procedure isn't the same

751
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:18,005
as for special trains
for group tours, and so on.

752
01:35:18,089 --> 01:35:23,052
State visits are handled
by the Foreign Service.

753
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:24,804
Right.

754
01:35:26,389 --> 01:35:29,308
May I ask you another question?

755
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:35,815
Why were there more special trains

756
01:35:35,898 --> 01:35:38,359
during the war, than before or after?

757
01:35:38,442 --> 01:35:41,654
I see what you're getting at.

758
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:48,619
You're referring to
the so-called “Resettlement trains.”

759
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:53,666
- “Resettlement.” That's it.
- That's what they were called.

760
01:35:53,749 --> 01:35:57,128
Those trains were ordered

761
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:08,347
by the Ministry of Transport of the Reich.

762
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:14,979
You needed an order from the Ministry
of Transport of the Reich...

763
01:36:18,065 --> 01:36:20,443
- In Berlin?
- Correct.

764
01:36:24,113 --> 01:36:27,491
As for the implementation of those orders,

765
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:32,955
the Head Office of Eastbound Traffic
in Berlin dealt with it.

766
01:36:33,038 --> 01:36:34,874
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

767
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:37,543
<i>- Is that clear?
- Perfectly.</i>

768
01:36:37,877 --> 01:36:43,716
<i>But mostly, at that time,
who was being “resettled”?</i>

769
01:36:44,175 --> 01:36:46,510
<i>No! We didn't know that.</i>

770
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:50,431
<i>Only when we were ﬂeeing
from Warsaw ourselves,</i>

771
01:36:50,514 --> 01:36:54,101
<i>did we learn
that they could have been Jews</i>

772
01:36:54,185 --> 01:36:57,688
<i>or criminals, or similar people.</i>

773
01:36:57,771 --> 01:36:59,315
<i>Jews, criminals?</i>

774
01:36:59,398 --> 01:37:01,442
<i>Criminals. All kinds.</i>

775
01:37:01,525 --> 01:37:03,903
<i>Special trains for criminals?</i>

776
01:37:03,986 --> 01:37:09,492
<i>No, that was just an expression.</i>

777
01:37:09,575 --> 01:37:11,785
<i>You couldn't talk about that.</i>

778
01:37:11,869 --> 01:37:15,331
<i>Unless you were tired of life,</i>

779
01:37:15,414 --> 01:37:18,375
<i>it was best not to mention that.</i>

780
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:26,050
<i>But you knew that the trains
to Treblinka or Auschwitz were...</i>

781
01:37:26,133 --> 01:37:28,552
<i>Of course we knew.</i>

782
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:30,846
I was the last district:

783
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:34,600
Without me, these trains
couldn't reach their destination.

784
01:37:35,351 --> 01:37:37,561
For instance,
a train that started in Essen

785
01:37:37,645 --> 01:37:42,233
had to go through
the district of Wuppertal,

786
01:37:42,316 --> 01:37:47,112
Hannover, Magdeburg, Berlin,

787
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:53,035
Frankfurt/Oder, Posen, Warsaw, etc.

788
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,662
So I had to.

789
01:37:54,745 --> 01:37:59,625
Did you know that Treblinka
meant extermination?

790
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:01,126
Of course not!

791
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:03,128
You didn't know?

792
01:38:03,212 --> 01:38:05,381
Good God, no!
How could we know?

793
01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:08,092
I never went to Treblinka.

794
01:38:08,175 --> 01:38:14,974
I stayed in Krakow, in Warsaw,
glued to my desk.

795
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:16,809
You were a...

796
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:19,979
<i>I was strictly a bureaucrat!</i>

797
01:38:20,062 --> 01:38:21,230
<i>I see.</i>

798
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:23,190
<i>But it's astonishing</i>

799
01:38:23,274 --> 01:38:28,279
<i>that people in the Department
of Special Trains</i>

800
01:38:28,362 --> 01:38:32,908
<i>never knew about the “final solution. ”</i>

801
01:38:32,992 --> 01:38:34,076
<i>We were at war.</i>

802
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,830
Because there were others

803
01:38:37,913 --> 01:38:40,958
who worked for the rail roads who knew.

804
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:43,836
Like the train conductors.

805
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:46,255
Yes, they saw it. They did.

806
01:38:46,338 --> 01:38:50,676
But as to what happened, I know...

807
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:54,346
What was Treblinka for you?
Treblinka or Auschwitz?

808
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:58,517
Yes, for us Treblinka,
Belzec, and all that,

809
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:01,312
were concentration camps.

810
01:39:01,395 --> 01:39:04,106
- A destination.
- Yes, that's all.

811
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:06,358
- But not death.
- No.

812
01:39:06,442 --> 01:39:08,485
People were put up there.

813
01:39:08,569 --> 01:39:12,698
For instance,
for a train coming from Essen

814
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:19,622
or Cologne, or elsewhere,
room had to be made for them there.

815
01:39:19,705 --> 01:39:24,251
With the war and the allies
advancing everywhere,

816
01:39:24,335 --> 01:39:28,631
those people had to be
concentrated in camps.

817
01:39:28,714 --> 01:39:32,092
When exactly did you find out?

818
01:39:32,176 --> 01:39:38,015
When the word got around,

819
01:39:38,098 --> 01:39:40,768
when it was whispered.

820
01:39:40,851 --> 01:39:44,271
It was never said outright.
Good God, no!

821
01:39:44,355 --> 01:39:46,065
They'd have hauled you off at once!

822
01:39:46,148 --> 01:39:48,734
We heard things...

823
01:39:49,068 --> 01:39:52,571
- Rumors?
- That's it, rumors.

824
01:39:52,655 --> 01:39:54,657
During the war?

825
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:57,451
Towards the end of the war.

826
01:39:57,534 --> 01:39:59,328
- Not in 1942?
- No!

827
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:01,747
Good God, no! Not a word!

828
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:06,502
Towards the end of 1944, maybe.

829
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:08,462
- End of 1944?
- Not before.

830
01:40:08,545 --> 01:40:10,005
What did you...?

831
01:40:10,089 --> 01:40:12,549
It was said that

832
01:40:12,633 --> 01:40:16,345
people were being sent to camps,

833
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:21,475
and those who weren't in good health
probably wouldn't survive.

834
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:25,229
Extermination came to you
as a big surprise?

835
01:40:25,312 --> 01:40:27,106
Completely. Yes.

836
01:40:27,523 --> 01:40:30,192
- You had no idea.
- Not the slightest.

837
01:40:30,275 --> 01:40:33,779
Like that camp, what was its name...?

838
01:40:34,446 --> 01:40:37,825
It was in the Oppeln district.

839
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:40,536
I've got it: Auschwitz!
- Yes.

840
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:43,831
Auschwitz was in the Oppeln district.
- Right.

841
01:40:43,914 --> 01:40:48,460
Auschwitz wasn't far from Krakow.
- That's true.

842
01:40:48,544 --> 01:40:50,963
We never heard a word about that.

843
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:55,759
- Auschwitz to Krakow is 40 miles.
- That's not very far.

844
01:40:56,135 --> 01:40:58,929
And we knew nothing.
Not a clue.

845
01:41:00,472 --> 01:41:03,851
But you knew that the Nazis...

846
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:09,064
that Hitler didn't like the Jews?

847
01:41:09,148 --> 01:41:10,524
That we did.

848
01:41:10,607 --> 01:41:14,653
It was well-known,
it appeared in print.

849
01:41:14,737 --> 01:41:16,488
It was no secret.

850
01:41:16,989 --> 01:41:22,119
But as to their extermination,
that was news to us.

851
01:41:22,202 --> 01:41:26,540
I mean, even today people deny it.

852
01:41:26,623 --> 01:41:30,419
They say there couldn't
have been so many Jews.

853
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:32,421
Is it true? I don't know.

854
01:41:32,504 --> 01:41:34,339
That's what they say.

855
01:41:34,548 --> 01:41:38,469
Anyway what was done was an outrage.

856
01:41:38,552 --> 01:41:40,888
- What?
- The extermination.

857
01:41:40,971 --> 01:41:44,892
Everyone condemns it.
Every decent person.

858
01:41:44,975 --> 01:41:47,352
But as for knowing about it, we didn't.

859
01:41:50,397 --> 01:41:52,649
The Poles, for instance.

860
01:41:53,108 --> 01:41:57,279
The Polish people knew everything.

861
01:41:57,362 --> 01:42:00,365
That's not surprising, Dr. Sorel.

862
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:05,370
They lived nearby,
they heard, they talked.

863
01:42:05,454 --> 01:42:08,832
And they didn't have to keep quiet.

864
01:50:45,724 --> 01:50:50,395
TREBLINKA - THE STATION

865
01:58:02,493 --> 01:58:05,913
<i>The “special detail's” life depended</i>

866
01:58:05,997 --> 01:58:09,459
<i>on the trainloads due for extermination.</i>

867
01:58:25,016 --> 01:58:27,602
<i>When a lot of them came in,</i>

868
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,024
<i>the “special detail” was enlarged.</i>

869
01:58:43,868 --> 01:58:46,704
<i>They couldn't do without the detail,</i>

870
01:58:47,038 --> 01:58:50,666
<i>so there was no weeding-out.</i>

871
01:58:52,293 --> 01:58:56,464
OSWIECIM (AUSCHWITZ)
THE STATION TODAY

872
01:58:56,881 --> 01:59:00,885
<i>But when there were fewer trainloads,</i>

873
01:59:04,388 --> 01:59:09,894
<i>it meant immediate extermination for us.</i>

874
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:18,653
<i>We, in the “special detail, ” knew</i>

875
01:59:18,736 --> 01:59:21,614
<i>that a lack of trains</i>

876
01:59:22,073 --> 01:59:24,784
<i>would lead to our liquidation.</i>

877
01:59:46,097 --> 01:59:50,351
- FILIP MULLER -
The “special detail” lived in a crisis situation.

878
01:59:50,434 --> 01:59:54,397
Every day,

879
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:58,359
we saw thousands
and thousands of innocent people

880
01:59:58,609 --> 02:00:01,571
disappear up the chimney.

881
02:00:02,488 --> 02:00:06,951
With our own eyes,
we could truly fathom

882
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:10,538
what it means to be a human being.

883
02:00:11,289 --> 02:00:13,708
There they came,

884
02:00:13,791 --> 02:00:19,005
men, women, children, all innocent.

885
02:00:20,047 --> 02:00:23,426
They suddenly vanished,

886
02:00:23,509 --> 02:00:25,803
and the world said nothing!

887
02:00:25,887 --> 02:00:30,266
We felt abandoned.
By the world, by humanity.

888
02:00:30,725 --> 02:00:35,730
But the situation taught us fully

889
02:00:36,898 --> 02:00:41,527
what the possibility of survival meant.

890
02:00:42,987 --> 02:00:44,906
For we could gauge

891
02:00:45,489 --> 02:00:48,618
the infinite value of human life.

892
02:00:49,744 --> 02:00:52,288
And we were convinced

893
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:58,169
that hope lingers in man
as long as he lives.

894
02:00:58,252 --> 02:01:02,256
Where there's life,
hope must never be relinquished.

895
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:06,677
That's why we struggled
through our lives of hardship,

896
02:01:06,969 --> 02:01:11,641
day after day, week after week,
month after month,

897
02:01:11,724 --> 02:01:14,560
year after year,

898
02:01:15,353 --> 02:01:20,024
hoping against hope to survive,

899
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:26,447
to escape that hell.

900
02:01:57,728 --> 02:02:00,106
<i>At that time,</i>

901
02:02:00,773 --> 02:02:05,069
<i>in January, February,</i>

902
02:02:06,570 --> 02:02:08,114
<i>March,</i>

903
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:12,743
<i>hardly any trains arrived.</i>

904
02:02:20,084 --> 02:02:23,212
Was Treblinka glum without the trains?

905
02:02:25,589 --> 02:02:29,510
I wouldn't say the Jews were glum.

906
02:02:29,593 --> 02:02:32,972
They became so when they realized...

907
02:02:33,931 --> 02:02:38,352
I'll come to that later,
it's a story in itself.

908
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:44,984
- Yes, it's a story in itself.
- It's a story in itself.

909
02:02:45,067 --> 02:02:46,861
Yes, I know.

910
02:02:47,361 --> 02:02:49,488
The Jews,

911
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:54,243
those in the work squads,
thought at first...

912
02:02:54,326 --> 02:02:57,997
- Those in the work squads, yes.
- that they'd survive.

913
02:03:00,041 --> 02:03:04,253
But in January,

914
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:06,589
when they stopped receiving food,

915
02:03:06,672 --> 02:03:12,303
for Wirth had decreed
that there were too many of them,

916
02:03:12,386 --> 02:03:16,307
there were a good 500 to 600
of them in Camp I...

917
02:03:16,724 --> 02:03:19,226
- Up there?
- Yes.

918
02:03:21,187 --> 02:03:24,815
To keep them from rebelling,

919
02:03:24,899 --> 02:03:27,943
they weren't shot or gassed,

920
02:03:28,027 --> 02:03:30,821
but starved.

921
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:33,449
Then an epidemic broke out,

922
02:03:33,991 --> 02:03:37,036
a kind of typhus.

923
02:03:38,496 --> 02:03:42,249
The Jews stopped believing they'd make it.

924
02:03:42,333 --> 02:03:46,087
They were left to die.
They dropped like ﬂies.

925
02:03:47,671 --> 02:03:49,673
It was all over.

926
02:03:50,174 --> 02:03:53,594
FRANZ SUCHOMEL

927
02:03:54,011 --> 02:03:56,222
They'd stopped believing.

928
02:03:57,515 --> 02:04:01,185
It was all very well to say...

929
02:04:01,268 --> 02:04:04,063
We kept on insisting,
“You're going to live!”

930
02:04:04,146 --> 02:04:06,524
We almost believed it ourselves.

931
02:04:06,607 --> 02:04:10,444
If you lie enough,
you believe your own lies.

932
02:04:10,528 --> 02:04:11,904
Yes.

933
02:04:12,863 --> 02:04:15,866
But they replied to me,

934
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:21,872
“No, chief, we're just reprieved corpses.”

935
02:04:31,632 --> 02:04:35,803
<i>The “dead season,”
as it was called,</i>

936
02:04:36,387 --> 02:04:43,727
<i>began in February 1943,</i>

937
02:04:44,937 --> 02:04:49,066
<i>after the big trainloads came in
from Grodno and Bialystok.</i>

938
02:04:50,651 --> 02:04:52,778
<i>Absolute quiet.</i>

939
02:04:54,405 --> 02:04:59,493
<i>It quieted in late January,
February and into March.</i>

940
02:04:59,577 --> 02:05:00,911
<i>Nothing.</i>

941
02:05:01,412 --> 02:05:04,665
<i>Not one trainload.</i>

942
02:05:07,293 --> 02:05:10,212
<i>The whole camp was empty,</i>

943
02:05:14,258 --> 02:05:19,346
<i>and suddenly, everywhere,
there was hunger.</i>

944
02:05:26,437 --> 02:05:29,023
<i>It kept increasing.</i>

945
02:05:33,944 --> 02:05:37,323
<i>And one day when the famine
was at its peak,</i>

946
02:05:38,782 --> 02:05:45,623
<i>Oberscharfuhrer Kurt Franz
appeared before us</i>

947
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:49,543
<i>and told us,</i>

948
02:05:50,377 --> 02:05:57,092
<i>“The trains will be coming in again,
starting tomorrow.”</i>

949
02:06:09,647 --> 02:06:11,482
<i>We didn't say anything.</i>

950
02:06:11,565 --> 02:06:14,735
<i>We just looked at each other,</i>

951
02:06:15,069 --> 02:06:20,991
<i>and each of us thought,</i>

952
02:06:21,533 --> 02:06:23,410
<i>“Tomorrow</i>

953
02:06:25,829 --> 02:06:29,083
<i>the hunger will end.”</i>

954
02:06:32,670 --> 02:06:35,673
<i>At that period,</i>

955
02:06:36,799 --> 02:06:41,679
<i>we were actively planning the rebellion.</i>

956
02:06:42,554 --> 02:06:46,308
<i>We all wanted to survive
until the rebellion.</i>

957
02:06:52,356 --> 02:06:57,194
<i>The trainloads came from
an assembly camp in Saloniki.</i>

958
02:06:58,612 --> 02:07:03,242
<i>They'd brought in Jews
from Bulgaria, Macedonia.</i>

959
02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:06,954
<i>These were rich people:</i>

960
02:07:07,037 --> 02:07:11,041
<i>The passenger cars bulged
with possessions.</i>

961
02:07:14,962 --> 02:07:21,927
<i>Then an awful feeling gripped us,</i>

962
02:07:22,553 --> 02:07:24,888
<i>all of us, my companions
as well as myself.</i>

963
02:07:24,972 --> 02:07:30,769
<i>A feeling of helplessness,</i>

964
02:07:30,853 --> 02:07:33,939
<i>a feeling of shame.</i>

965
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:39,445
<i>For we threw ourselves on their food.</i>

966
02:07:40,070 --> 02:07:47,453
<i>A de tail brought a crate
full of crackers,</i>

967
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:50,831
<i>another full of jam.</i>

968
02:07:50,914 --> 02:07:55,085
<i>They deliberately dropped the crates,</i>

969
02:07:56,211 --> 02:07:58,964
<i>falling over each other,</i>

970
02:07:59,048 --> 02:08:06,138
<i>filling their mouths
with crackers and jam.</i>

971
02:08:15,314 --> 02:08:20,944
<i>The trainloads
from the Balkans brought us</i>

972
02:08:21,195 --> 02:08:23,822
<i>to a terrible realization:</i>

973
02:08:27,451 --> 02:08:30,412
RICHARD GLAZAR

974
02:08:31,038 --> 02:08:34,917
We were the workers
in the Treblinka factory,

975
02:08:35,459 --> 02:08:37,628
and our lives depended

976
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:43,092
on the whole manufacturing process,

977
02:08:43,842 --> 02:08:47,388
that is, the slaughtering process
at Treblinka.

978
02:08:52,601 --> 02:08:57,147
This realization came suddenly

979
02:08:57,231 --> 02:08:59,483
with the fresh trainloads?

980
02:08:59,566 --> 02:09:02,403
Maybe it wasn't so sudden,

981
02:09:03,445 --> 02:09:07,157
but it was only
with the Balkans trainloads

982
02:09:07,241 --> 02:09:10,661
that it became...

983
02:09:12,037 --> 02:09:15,958
so stark to us, unadorned.

984
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,419
Why?

985
02:09:18,961 --> 02:09:22,464
24,000 people,

986
02:09:25,384 --> 02:09:30,264
probably with not a sick person
among them,

987
02:09:33,767 --> 02:09:38,147
not an invalid, all healthy and robust!

988
02:09:39,022 --> 02:09:43,110
I recall our watching them
from our barracks.

989
02:09:44,361 --> 02:09:48,740
They were already naked,
milling among their baggage.

990
02:09:48,824 --> 02:09:51,034
And David...

991
02:09:51,702 --> 02:09:54,037
David Bratt said to me,

992
02:09:54,538 --> 02:09:56,248
“Maccabees!

993
02:09:56,331 --> 02:09:59,710
The Maccabees have arrived in Treblinka!”

994
02:10:03,589 --> 02:10:07,968
Sturdy, physically strong people,

995
02:10:10,262 --> 02:10:12,890
unlike the others...

996
02:10:13,891 --> 02:10:14,975
Fighters!

997
02:10:15,058 --> 02:10:18,395
Yes, they could have been fighters.

998
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:24,693
It was staggering for us,

999
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:31,158
for these men and women, all splendid,

1000
02:10:32,784 --> 02:10:36,663
were wholly unaware
of what was in store for them.

1001
02:10:36,747 --> 02:10:39,249
Wholly unaware.

1002
02:10:44,796 --> 02:10:50,719
Never before had things gone
so smoothly and quickly.

1003
02:10:50,802 --> 02:10:52,179
Never.

1004
02:10:57,100 --> 02:11:00,395
We felt ashamed,

1005
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:06,777
and also that this couldn't go on,
that something had to happen.

1006
02:11:09,029 --> 02:11:12,282
Not just a few people acting

1007
02:11:13,158 --> 02:11:16,245
but all of us.

1008
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:31,218
The idea was almost ripe
back in November 1942.

1009
02:11:35,347 --> 02:11:40,310
Beginning in November '42

1010
02:11:41,144 --> 02:11:43,272
we'd noticed

1011
02:11:43,355 --> 02:11:47,651
that we were being “spared,”

1012
02:11:48,694 --> 02:11:51,071
in quotes.

1013
02:11:52,155 --> 02:11:55,075
We noticed it

1014
02:11:55,158 --> 02:11:57,327
and we also learned

1015
02:11:58,328 --> 02:12:03,584
that Stangl, the commandant,
wanted, for efficiency's sake,

1016
02:12:03,667 --> 02:12:06,670
to hang on to men
who were already trained,

1017
02:12:07,754 --> 02:12:11,967
specialists in the various tasks:

1018
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:14,469
sorters, corpse-haulers,

1019
02:12:14,553 --> 02:12:19,600
barbers who cut the women's hair,

1020
02:12:19,683 --> 02:12:21,184
and so on.

1021
02:12:26,064 --> 02:12:33,405
This in fact is what later
gave us the chance

1022
02:12:34,031 --> 02:12:35,741
to prepare,

1023
02:12:35,824 --> 02:12:39,328
to organize the uprising.

1024
02:12:50,714 --> 02:12:52,883
We had a plan

1025
02:12:52,966 --> 02:12:57,387
worked out in January 1943,

1026
02:12:58,096 --> 02:13:02,059
code-named “The Time.”

1027
02:13:04,186 --> 02:13:06,146
At a set time,

1028
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:13,153
we were to attack the SS everywhere,

1029
02:13:14,154 --> 02:13:19,242
seize their weapons
and attack the Kommandantur.

1030
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:25,040
But we couldn't do it

1031
02:13:25,624 --> 02:13:30,087
because things were
at a standstill in the camp,

1032
02:13:30,671 --> 02:13:34,091
and because typhus had already broken out.

1033
02:13:58,198 --> 02:14:02,452
<i>In the fall of 1943,</i>

1034
02:14:04,121 --> 02:14:10,127
<i>when it was clear to all of us</i>

1035
02:14:11,044 --> 02:14:14,381
<i>that no one would help us</i>

1036
02:14:16,007 --> 02:14:19,094
<i>unless we helped ourselves,</i>

1037
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:25,642
<i>a key question faced us all:</i>

1038
02:14:27,936 --> 02:14:31,273
<i>For us in the 'Special detail,</i> ”

1039
02:14:32,023 --> 02:14:35,485
<i>was there any chance
to halt this wave of extermination</i>

1040
02:14:35,986 --> 02:14:39,656
<i>and still save our lives?</i>

1041
02:14:46,872 --> 02:14:51,835
<i>We could see only one:</i>

1042
02:14:54,045 --> 02:14:58,425
<i>armed rebellion.</i>

1043
02:15:02,846 --> 02:15:05,348
<i>We thought</i>

1044
02:15:06,308 --> 02:15:11,354
<i>that if we could get hold
of a few weapons</i>

1045
02:15:14,483 --> 02:15:19,780
<i>and secure the participation
of all the inmates</i>

1046
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:24,367
<i>throughout the camp,</i>

1047
02:15:24,451 --> 02:15:28,038
<i>there was a chance of success.</i>

1048
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:33,293
<i>That was the essential thing.</i>

1049
02:15:36,296 --> 02:15:39,549
<i>That's why our liaison men</i>

1050
02:15:40,675 --> 02:15:47,140
<i>contacted the leaders
of the Resistance movement,</i>

1051
02:15:47,224 --> 02:15:48,725
<i>first in Birkenau,</i>

1052
02:15:48,975 --> 02:15:51,561
<i>then in Auschwitz I,</i>

1053
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:57,859
<i>so the revolt could be
coordinated everywhere.</i>

1054
02:16:02,572 --> 02:16:04,616
FILIP MULLER

1055
02:16:04,866 --> 02:16:07,410
The answer came

1056
02:16:07,494 --> 02:16:11,623
that the Resistance command
in Auschwitz I

1057
02:16:11,706 --> 02:16:14,751
agreed with our plan

1058
02:16:15,502 --> 02:16:20,173
and would join with us.

1059
02:16:29,266 --> 02:16:34,062
<i>Unfortunately,
among the Resistance leaders,</i>

1060
02:16:35,313 --> 02:16:39,401
<i>there were very few Jews.</i>

1061
02:16:40,402 --> 02:16:43,280
<i>Most were political prisoners</i>

1062
02:16:44,322 --> 02:16:47,409
<i>whose lives weren't at stake,</i>

1063
02:16:48,618 --> 02:16:52,581
<i>and for whom each day of life
lived through</i>

1064
02:16:52,664 --> 02:16:58,086
<i>increased their chances of survival.</i>

1065
02:16:59,296 --> 02:17:03,925
<i>For us in the “special detail, ”
it was the opposite.</i>

1066
02:17:10,682 --> 02:17:14,102
RUDOLF VRBA

1067
02:18:27,842 --> 02:18:31,221
AUSCHWITZ - BIRKENAU

RUTH ELIAS - ISRAEL
Deported from Theresienstadt

1069
02:38:25,873 --> 02:38:29,084
CREMATORIUM V

1070
02:38:30,335 --> 02:38:32,254
<i>At the end of February,</i>

1071
02:38:33,213 --> 02:38:37,551
<i>I was in a night squad at Crematorium V.</i>

1072
02:38:40,804 --> 02:38:43,015
<i>Around midnight,</i>

1073
02:38:44,266 --> 02:38:48,186
<i>there appeared a man
from the political section:</i>

1074
02:38:49,021 --> 02:38:51,523
<i>Oberscharfuhrer Hustek.</i>

1075
02:38:55,235 --> 02:38:59,698
<i>He handed Oberscharfuhrer Voss a note.</i>

1076
02:39:07,706 --> 02:39:15,547
<i>Voss was then in charge
of the 4 crematoria.</i>

1077
02:39:19,676 --> 02:39:24,848
<i>I saw Voss unfold the note</i>

1078
02:39:29,978 --> 02:39:34,816
and talk to himself,
saying, “Sure, always Voss.

1079
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:41,073
What'd they do without Voss?
How can we do it?”

1080
02:39:41,156 --> 02:39:43,116
That's how he talked to himself.

1081
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:47,245
Suddenly he told me, “Go get the kapos.”

1082
02:39:47,329 --> 02:39:51,750
I fetched the kapos, kapo Schloime,

1083
02:39:52,292 --> 02:39:55,003
and kapo Wacek.

1084
02:39:55,087 --> 02:39:59,049
They came in, and he asked them,

1085
02:39:59,132 --> 02:40:00,968
“How many pieces are left?”

1086
02:40:01,051 --> 02:40:04,012
By “pieces” he meant bodies.

1087
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:08,558
They told him, “Around 500 pieces.”

1088
02:40:09,559 --> 02:40:14,314
He said, “By morning,
those 500 pieces must be...

1089
02:40:18,151 --> 02:40:20,570
reduced to ashes.

1090
02:40:21,488 --> 02:40:24,074
You're sure it's 500?”

1091
02:40:24,157 --> 02:40:26,118
“Just about,” they said.

1092
02:40:26,201 --> 02:40:29,871
“Assholes!
What do you mean, just about?”

1093
02:40:30,622 --> 02:40:33,250
Then he left

1094
02:40:33,333 --> 02:40:38,463
for the “undressing room”
to see for himself.

1095
02:40:38,547 --> 02:40:40,090
Where the bodies were?

1096
02:40:40,173 --> 02:40:42,634
They were piled there:

1097
02:40:42,718 --> 02:40:46,138
At Crematorium V,
the “undressing room” also served

1098
02:40:46,221 --> 02:40:48,807
as a warehouse for bodies.

1099
02:40:48,890 --> 02:40:49,975
After the gassing?

1100
02:40:50,058 --> 02:40:54,688
After the gassing
the bodies were dragged there.

1101
02:40:54,771 --> 02:40:57,941
Voss went there to check.

1102
02:40:58,025 --> 02:41:04,614
He forgot the note,
leaving it on the table.

1103
02:41:06,033 --> 02:41:10,328
I quickly scanned it

1104
02:41:11,329 --> 02:41:14,875
and was shocked by what I read.

1105
02:41:16,418 --> 02:41:19,880
BIRKENAU
THE LAKE OF ASHES

1106
02:41:25,469 --> 02:41:30,432
<i>The crematorium was
to be gotten ready</i>

1107
02:41:32,517 --> 02:41:38,982
<i>for “special treatment”
of the Czech family camp.</i>

1108
02:41:46,782 --> 02:41:51,787
<i>In the morning,
when the day squad came on,</i>

1109
02:41:53,121 --> 02:41:56,792
<i>I ran into kapo Kaminski,</i>

1110
02:41:57,417 --> 02:42:03,298
<i>one of the Resistance leaders
in the “special detail”</i>

1111
02:42:04,341 --> 02:42:07,552
<i>and told him the news.</i>

1112
02:42:08,804 --> 02:42:10,680
<i>He informed me</i>

1113
02:42:11,973 --> 02:42:18,480
<i>that Crematorium II
was also being prepared.</i>

1114
02:42:18,897 --> 02:42:22,567
<i>That the ovens were ready there, too.</i>

1115
02:42:30,575 --> 02:42:32,661
<i>And he exhorted me,</i>

1116
02:42:33,370 --> 02:42:37,666
<i>“You have friends and fellow countrymen.</i>

1117
02:42:39,292 --> 02:42:44,047
<i>Go see them. They're locksmiths
and can move around</i>

1118
02:42:44,131 --> 02:42:47,717
<i>so they can go to Camp B II B.</i>

1119
02:42:48,468 --> 02:42:51,513
<i>Tell them to warn these people</i>

1120
02:42:51,596 --> 02:42:54,182
<i>of what's in store for them,</i>

1121
02:42:54,266 --> 02:42:57,018
<i>and say that if they defend themselves,</i>

1122
02:42:57,102 --> 02:43:02,607
<i>we'll reduce the crematoria to ashes.</i>

1123
02:43:03,817 --> 02:43:07,279
<i>And at Camp B II B,</i>

1124
02:43:07,737 --> 02:43:10,323
<i>they can immediately
burn down their barracks.”</i>

1125
02:43:15,203 --> 02:43:18,540
We were certain that the next night,

1126
02:43:18,623 --> 02:43:21,251
these people would be gassed.

1127
02:43:21,668 --> 02:43:26,756
But when no night squad went out,
we were relieved.

1128
02:43:28,466 --> 02:43:31,052
The deadline had been postponed

1129
02:43:31,887 --> 02:43:35,390
for a few days.

1130
02:43:35,473 --> 02:43:37,100
But many prisoners,

1131
02:43:37,184 --> 02:43:41,563
including the Czechs in the family camp,

1132
02:43:41,646 --> 02:43:45,317
accused us of spreading panic,

1133
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:47,736
of having...

1134
02:43:49,571 --> 02:43:54,826
of having circulated false reports.

1135
02:54:22,411 --> 02:54:26,499
<i>That night I was at Crematorium II.</i>

1136
02:54:32,296 --> 02:54:37,927
As soon as the people got out of the vans,

1137
02:54:38,177 --> 02:54:41,639
they were blinded by ﬂoodlights

1138
02:54:41,722 --> 02:54:44,225
and forced through a corridor

1139
02:54:44,308 --> 02:54:52,275
to the stairs leading
to the “undressing room.”

1140
02:54:52,358 --> 02:54:56,487
They were blinded, made to run.

1141
02:54:56,571 --> 02:54:59,198
Blows were rained on them.

1142
02:55:00,199 --> 02:55:04,829
Those who didn't run fast enough
were beaten to death

1143
02:55:04,912 --> 02:55:07,164
by the SS.

1144
02:55:07,248 --> 02:55:12,587
The violence used against them
was extraordinary.

1145
02:55:13,296 --> 02:55:14,839
And suddenly...

1146
02:55:14,922 --> 02:55:16,757
Without explanation?

1147
02:55:16,841 --> 02:55:18,551
Not a word.

1148
02:55:18,634 --> 02:55:22,388
As soon as they left the vans,

1149
02:55:22,471 --> 02:55:25,766
the beatings began.

1150
02:55:26,934 --> 02:55:30,521
When they entered the “undressing room,”

1151
02:55:30,897 --> 02:55:37,737
I was standing near the rear door,

1152
02:55:38,779 --> 02:55:43,034
and from there
I witnessed the frightful scene.

1153
02:55:43,117 --> 02:55:46,621
The people were bloodied.

1154
02:55:47,496 --> 02:55:49,790
They knew then where they were.

1155
02:55:49,874 --> 02:55:52,752
They stared at the pillars

1156
02:55:53,127 --> 02:56:00,343
of the so-called “international
Information Center” I've mentioned,

1157
02:56:00,801 --> 02:56:03,137
and that terrified them.

1158
02:56:03,220 --> 02:56:05,264
What they read didn't reassure them.

1159
02:56:05,348 --> 02:56:10,519
On the contrary, it panicked them.

1160
02:56:10,603 --> 02:56:13,022
They knew the score.

1161
02:56:13,105 --> 02:56:17,777
They'd learned at Camp B ll B
what went on there.

1162
02:56:17,860 --> 02:56:19,737
They were in despair.

1163
02:56:19,820 --> 02:56:22,323
Children clung to each other.

1164
02:56:22,823 --> 02:56:25,159
Their mothers,

1165
02:56:26,577 --> 02:56:30,456
their parents, the old people all cried,

1166
02:56:30,539 --> 02:56:32,124
overcome with misery.

1167
02:56:32,208 --> 02:56:34,168
Suddenly,

1168
02:56:34,251 --> 02:56:39,548
some SS officers appeared on the steps,

1169
02:56:39,632 --> 02:56:46,180
including the camp commandant,
Schwarzhuber.

1170
02:56:46,263 --> 02:56:52,895
He'd given them his word
as an SS officer

1171
02:56:52,979 --> 02:56:59,026
that they'd be transferred to Heydebreck.

1172
02:56:59,110 --> 02:57:04,991
So they all began to cry out, to beg,

1173
02:57:05,866 --> 02:57:10,496
shouting, “Heydebreck was a trick!

1174
02:57:10,579 --> 02:57:15,459
We were lied to!
We want to live! We want to work!”

1175
02:57:15,543 --> 02:57:20,715
They looked
their SS executioners in the eye,

1176
02:57:20,798 --> 02:57:23,801
but the SS men

1177
02:57:26,345 --> 02:57:28,681
remained impassive,

1178
02:57:28,764 --> 02:57:30,599
just staring at them.

1179
02:57:30,683 --> 02:57:33,561
There was a movement in the crowd.

1180
02:57:33,644 --> 02:57:39,025
They probably wanted
to rush to the SS men

1181
02:57:39,108 --> 02:57:41,736
and tell them how they'd been lied to.

1182
02:57:41,819 --> 02:57:47,116
Then some guards surged forward,

1183
02:57:47,199 --> 02:57:50,536
wielding clubs,

1184
02:57:50,619 --> 02:57:53,164
and more people were injured.

1185
02:57:53,873 --> 02:57:56,208
In the “undressing room.”

1186
02:57:56,292 --> 02:57:58,586
The violence climaxed

1187
02:57:58,669 --> 02:58:07,511
when they tried to force
the people to undress.

1188
02:58:07,595 --> 02:58:09,722
A few obeyed,

1189
02:58:09,805 --> 02:58:13,142
only a handful.

1190
02:58:13,225 --> 02:58:19,774
Most of them refused to follow the order.

1191
02:58:20,024 --> 02:58:23,944
Suddenly, as though in chorus,

1192
02:58:25,404 --> 02:58:28,616
like a chorus...

1193
02:58:28,699 --> 02:58:32,369
they all began to sing.

1194
02:58:34,330 --> 02:58:38,959
The whole “undressing room” rang

1195
02:58:39,043 --> 02:58:43,631
with the Czech national anthem,

1196
02:58:43,714 --> 02:58:46,342
and the “Hatikva.”

1197
02:58:46,884 --> 02:58:51,305
That moved me terribly, that...

1198
02:59:09,990 --> 02:59:12,284
Please stop!

1199
02:59:13,869 --> 02:59:18,499
That was happening to my countrymen,

1200
02:59:18,707 --> 02:59:20,918
and I realized

1201
02:59:21,710 --> 02:59:25,464
that my life had become meaningless.

1202
02:59:26,298 --> 02:59:29,426
Why go on living? For what?

1203
02:59:31,762 --> 02:59:36,767
So I went into the gas chamber with them,

1204
02:59:39,728 --> 02:59:42,523
resolved to die.

1205
02:59:44,400 --> 02:59:46,443
With them.

1206
02:59:47,027 --> 02:59:51,991
Suddenly, some who recognized me
came up to me.

1207
02:59:52,491 --> 02:59:55,911
For my locksmith friends and I

1208
02:59:55,995 --> 02:59:59,123
had sometimes gone into the family camp.

1209
03:00:02,418 --> 03:00:08,424
A small group of women approached.

1210
03:00:08,716 --> 03:00:13,387
They looked at me and said right there
in the gas chamber...

1211
03:00:13,470 --> 03:00:15,681
You were inside the gas chamber?

1212
03:00:15,764 --> 03:00:18,142
One of them said,

1213
03:00:22,229 --> 03:00:25,399
“So you want to die.

1214
03:00:25,733 --> 03:00:27,568
But that's senseless.

1215
03:00:27,651 --> 03:00:32,072
Your death won't give us back our lives.

1216
03:00:32,990 --> 03:00:35,409
That's no way.

1217
03:00:36,994 --> 03:00:41,415
You must get out of here alive,

1218
03:00:42,583 --> 03:00:46,545
you must bear witness to our suffering,

1219
03:00:46,629 --> 03:00:50,257
and to the injustice done to us.”

1220
03:02:36,697 --> 03:02:39,700

<i>You don't remember those days?</i>

1235
03:46:24,364 --> 03:46:26,115
<i>Not much.</i>

1236
03:46:27,867 --> 03:46:31,579
<i>I recall more clearly

<i>and those days in Warsaw.</i>

1239
03:46:40,338 --> 03:46:44,759
<i>All in all, those were bad times.</i>

1240
03:46:47,971 --> 03:46:50,932
<i>It's a fact: we tend to forget,</i>

1241
03:46:51,599 --> 03:46:53,226

<i>The bad times are repressed.</i>

1244
03:47:10,535 --> 03:47:13,746
<i>I'll help you remember...</i>

1245
03:47:18,793 --> 03:47:24,716
<i>In Warsaw,
you were Dr. Auerswald's deputy.</i>

1246
03:47:25,842 --> 03:47:27,176
<i>Yes.</i>

1247
03:47:29,887 --> 03:47:31,889
<i>Dr. Auerswald was...</i>

1248
03:47:31,973 --> 03:47:35,518
<i>Commissioner
of the “Jewish district” of Warsaw.</i>

1249
03:47:38,688 --> 03:47:42,734
Dr. Grassier, this is Czerniakow's diary.

1250
03:47:42,817 --> 03:47:44,610
You're mentioned in it.

1251
03:47:44,694 --> 03:47:47,196
It's been printed, it exists?

1252
03:47:47,405 --> 03:47:50,783
He kept a diary

1253
03:47:51,826 --> 03:47:56,789
that was recently published.

1254
03:48:00,209 --> 03:48:07,508
He wrote on July 7, 1941

1255
03:48:07,967 --> 03:48:09,218
July 7, 1941?

1256
03:48:09,302 --> 03:48:13,806
That's the first time
I've relearned a date.

1257
03:48:15,433 --> 03:48:17,518
May I take notes?

1258
03:48:17,769 --> 03:48:21,689
After all... it interests me too.

1259
03:48:22,607 --> 03:48:26,235
So in July I was already there!

1260
03:48:28,071 --> 03:48:32,033
He wrote on July 7, 1941,

1261
03:48:33,159 --> 03:48:39,165
“Morning in the Community”
- the Jewish Council HQ -

1262
03:48:39,582 --> 03:48:43,544
“and later with Auerswald, Schlosser...”

1263
03:48:44,545 --> 03:48:45,755
Schlosser was...

1264
03:48:45,838 --> 03:48:48,216
“and Grassier,

1265
03:48:50,551 --> 03:48:53,554
on routine matters.”

1266
03:48:54,013 --> 03:48:56,349
That's the first time...

1267
03:48:56,432 --> 03:48:58,184
That my name is mentioned...

1268
03:48:58,726 --> 03:49:01,062
Yes, but there were 3 of us.

1269
03:49:01,145 --> 03:49:04,899
Schlosser... was in...
the “economic department.”

1270
03:49:04,982 --> 03:49:08,653
I think he had to do with economics.

1271
03:49:10,029 --> 03:49:14,117
And the second time

1272
03:49:15,284 --> 03:49:18,955
was on July 22.

1273
03:49:20,081 --> 03:49:25,378
Czerniakow was president
of the Warsaw Jewish Council

1274
03:49:26,295 --> 03:49:28,422
He wrote every day?

1275
03:49:28,506 --> 03:49:29,632
Yes.

1276
03:49:30,216 --> 03:49:31,926
Yes, every day.

1277
03:49:32,635 --> 03:49:35,513
It's quite amazing...

1278
03:49:36,681 --> 03:49:38,891
That the diary was saved.

1279
03:49:39,475 --> 03:49:42,603
It's amazing that it was saved.

1280
03:49:47,984 --> 03:49:52,238
BURLINGTON - VERMONT (USA)

1281
03:50:50,588 --> 03:50:53,216
RAUL HILBERG

1282
03:56:30,344 --> 03:56:32,805
Did you go into the ghetto?

1283
03:56:33,389 --> 03:56:37,184
Seldom. When I had to visit Czerniakow.

1284
03:56:38,185 --> 03:56:41,480
What were the conditions like?

1285
03:56:41,564 --> 03:56:43,190
Awful.

1286
03:56:43,274 --> 03:56:46,110
Yes' appalling
- Yes?

1287
03:56:46,193 --> 03:56:51,490
I never went back
when I saw what it was like.

1288
03:56:51,574 --> 03:56:53,492
Unless I had to.

1289
03:56:53,576 --> 03:57:01,333
In the whole period
I think I only went once or twice.

1290
03:57:01,417 --> 03:57:05,462
We, at the Commission, tried

1291
03:57:06,088 --> 03:57:09,717
to maintain the ghetto
for its labor force,

1292
03:57:09,800 --> 03:57:14,805
and especially to prevent epidemic,
like typhus.

1293
03:57:14,888 --> 03:57:16,765
That was the big danger.

1294
03:57:22,104 --> 03:57:23,897
- Yes.
- Yes?

1295
03:57:24,148 --> 03:57:27,735
Can you tell us about typhus?

1296
03:57:29,528 --> 03:57:31,405
I'm not a doctor.

1297
03:57:31,488 --> 03:57:36,702
I only know that typhus
is a very dangerous epidemic

1298
03:57:36,785 --> 03:57:41,624
that wipes people out like the plague,

1299
03:57:41,707 --> 03:57:44,710
and that it can't be confined to a ghetto.

1300
03:57:44,793 --> 03:57:47,755
If typhus had broken out...

1301
03:57:47,838 --> 03:57:49,423
I don't think it did,

1302
03:57:49,506 --> 03:57:52,259
but there was fear that it might...

1303
03:57:52,343 --> 03:57:55,262
it would have killed
the Poles and the Germans.

1304
03:57:55,346 --> 03:57:58,932
Why was there typhus in the ghetto?

1305
03:57:59,433 --> 03:58:00,934
I don't know if there was,

1306
03:58:01,018 --> 03:58:05,397
but there was a danger,
because of the famine.

1307
03:58:05,481 --> 03:58:08,442
People didn't get enough to eat.

1308
03:58:08,734 --> 03:58:13,530
That's what was so awful.

1309
03:58:13,614 --> 03:58:18,410
We, at the Commission,

1310
03:58:18,494 --> 03:58:22,373
did our best to feed the ghetto,

1311
03:58:22,456 --> 03:58:29,588
so it wouldn't become
an incubator of epidemics.

1312
03:58:29,672 --> 03:58:34,968
Aside from humanitarian factors,
that's what mattered.

1313
03:58:35,427 --> 03:58:40,432
If typhus had broken out...
and it didn't...

1314
03:58:40,516 --> 03:58:44,144
it wouldn't have stopped at the ghetto.

1315
03:58:44,687 --> 03:58:48,732
Czerniakow also wrote that

1316
03:58:48,816 --> 03:58:54,321
one of the reasons
the ghetto was walled in

1317
03:58:54,697 --> 03:58:57,574
was because of this German fear.

1318
03:58:57,991 --> 03:59:00,953
Yes, absolutely!
Fear of typhus.

1319
03:59:01,036 --> 03:59:08,127
He says Germans always
associated Jews with typhus.

1320
03:59:08,210 --> 03:59:09,461
Maybe.

1321
03:59:09,545 --> 03:59:13,048
I'm not sure
if there were grounds for it.

1322
03:59:13,966 --> 03:59:18,679
But imagine that mass of people
packed in the ghetto...

1323
03:59:18,762 --> 03:59:22,850
There weren't only the Warsaw Jews,

1324
03:59:22,933 --> 03:59:24,810
but others who came later.

1325
03:59:24,893 --> 03:59:27,646
The danger kept on growing.

1326
04:02:42,299 --> 04:02:48,472
The Germans had a policy
on the Warsaw ghetto.

1327
04:02:50,515 --> 04:02:53,060
What was that policy?

1328
04:02:55,979 --> 04:02:58,774
You're asking more than I know.

1329
04:02:58,857 --> 04:03:02,611
The policy that wound up
with extermination,

1330
04:03:03,278 --> 04:03:04,821
the Final Solution...

1331
04:03:04,905 --> 04:03:07,491
we knew nothing about it.

1332
04:03:07,574 --> 04:03:10,661
Ourjob was to maintain the ghetto,

1333
04:03:10,744 --> 04:03:15,707
and try to preserve
the Jews as a work force.

1334
04:03:16,333 --> 04:03:21,838
The Commission's goal,

1335
04:03:21,922 --> 04:03:23,966
in fact, was very different

1336
04:03:24,049 --> 04:03:29,346
from the one that later
led to extermination.

1337
04:03:30,555 --> 04:03:33,684
Yes, but do you know
how many people died

1338
04:03:33,767 --> 04:03:37,354
in the ghetto each month in 1941?

1339
04:03:37,437 --> 04:03:40,649
I don't know now... if I ever knew it.

1340
04:03:40,732 --> 04:03:45,195
But you did know.
There are exact figures.

1341
04:03:46,947 --> 04:03:48,532
I probably knew...

1342
04:03:48,615 --> 04:03:52,995
Yes: 5,000 a month.

1343
04:03:53,078 --> 04:03:55,580
5,000 a month? Yes, well...

1344
04:03:55,664 --> 04:03:58,291
- That's a lot.
- That's a lot, of course.

1345
04:03:58,375 --> 04:04:03,171
But there were far too many people
in the ghetto.

1346
04:04:03,255 --> 04:04:05,549
That was it. Far too many.

1347
04:04:06,550 --> 04:04:09,219
Far too many.

1348
04:04:15,517 --> 04:04:18,478
<i>My question is philosophical.</i>

1349
04:04:19,646 --> 04:04:23,358
<i>What does a ghetto mean, in your opinion?</i>

1350
04:04:27,863 --> 04:04:32,743
<i>History's full of ghettos,</i>

1351
04:04:33,326 --> 04:04:36,913
<i>going back centuries, for all I know.</i>

1352
04:04:39,082 --> 04:04:41,877
<i>Persecution of the Jews
wasn't a German invention,</i>

1353
04:04:41,960 --> 04:04:45,505
<i>and it didn't start with World War II.</i>

1354
04:04:48,216 --> 04:04:50,886
<i>The Poles persecuted them too.</i>

1355
04:04:55,223 --> 04:04:57,768
<i>But a ghetto like Warsaw's,</i>

1356
04:04:57,851 --> 04:05:00,353
<i>in a great capital,</i>

1357
04:05:01,313 --> 04:05:03,273
<i>in the heart of the city.</i>

1358
04:05:03,523 --> 04:05:05,984
<i>That was unusual.</i>

1359
04:05:13,867 --> 04:05:18,080
You say you wanted to maintain the ghetto.

1360
04:05:18,163 --> 04:05:23,001
Our mission wasn't
to annihilate the ghetto,

1361
04:05:23,085 --> 04:05:26,171
but to keep it alive, to maintain it.

1362
04:05:26,254 --> 04:05:29,382
What does “alive” mean in such...

1363
04:05:30,217 --> 04:05:31,885
That was the problem.

1364
04:05:31,968 --> 04:05:33,637
That was the whole problem...

1365
04:05:33,720 --> 04:05:36,723
The problem needed to be resolved.
I knew that.

1366
04:05:36,807 --> 04:05:40,894
But people were dying in the streets.

1367
04:05:41,978 --> 04:05:44,940
There were bodies everywhere.
- Yes.

1368
04:05:47,484 --> 04:05:50,570
That was the paradox.

1369
04:05:50,654 --> 04:05:54,282
- You see it as a paradox?
- I'm sure of it.

1370
04:05:54,366 --> 04:05:56,076
Why?

1371
04:05:57,119 --> 04:05:59,371
Can you explain?
- No.

1372
04:06:00,872 --> 04:06:02,332
Why not?

1373
04:06:02,833 --> 04:06:06,753
Explain what?

1374
04:06:06,837 --> 04:06:09,798
But the fact is...

1375
04:06:09,881 --> 04:06:14,678
Jews were being exterminated
daily in the ghetto.

1376
04:06:15,011 --> 04:06:16,263
Czerniakow wrote...

1377
04:06:16,346 --> 04:06:18,849
To maintain it properly,

1378
04:06:18,932 --> 04:06:22,727
we'd have needed
more substantial rations,

1379
04:06:22,811 --> 04:06:25,605
and less crowding.

1380
04:06:26,439 --> 04:06:31,027
Why weren't the rations more humane?

1381
04:06:33,280 --> 04:06:35,073
Why weren't they?

1382
04:06:35,866 --> 04:06:38,827
That was a German decision, no?

1383
04:06:39,202 --> 04:06:44,875
There was no real decision
to starve the ghetto.

1384
04:06:44,958 --> 04:06:51,339
The big decision to exterminate
came much later.

1385
04:06:51,548 --> 04:06:55,385
That's right, later. In 1942.

1386
04:06:55,677 --> 04:06:57,554
Precisely!

1387
04:06:58,221 --> 04:07:00,974
- 3 years later.
- Just so.

1388
04:07:01,057 --> 04:07:04,895
Our mission, as I recall it,

1389
04:07:04,978 --> 04:07:09,941
was to manage the ghetto,

1390
04:07:10,942 --> 04:07:17,324
and, naturally,
with those inadequate rations,

1391
04:07:17,407 --> 04:07:19,701
and the overcrowding,

1392
04:07:19,784 --> 04:07:24,915
a high, even excessive death rate
was inevitable.

1393
04:07:25,248 --> 04:07:26,583
Yes.

1394
04:07:29,502 --> 04:07:34,716
What does “maintain” the ghetto
mean in such conditions...

1395
04:07:34,799 --> 04:07:37,761
the food, sanitation, etc.?

1396
04:07:38,470 --> 04:07:42,807
What could the Jews do
against such measures?

1397
04:07:48,605 --> 04:07:50,982
They couldn't do anything.

1398
04:10:55,166 --> 04:10:59,754
The Final Solution Conference
was held here

1399
04:12:55,203 --> 04:13:00,124
BELZEC
SITE OF THE EXTERMINATION CAMP

1400
04:14:48,191 --> 04:14:52,445
Why did Czerniakow commit suicide?

1401
04:14:53,529 --> 04:15:00,662
Because he realized
there was no future for the ghetto.

1402
04:15:00,745 --> 04:15:06,042
He probably saw before I did
that the Jews would be killed.

1403
04:15:08,836 --> 04:15:16,219
I suppose the Jews already had
their excellent secret services.

1404
04:15:16,511 --> 04:15:19,263
They were too well informed,

1405
04:15:19,347 --> 04:15:21,432
better than we were.

1406
04:15:22,016 --> 04:15:24,018
- Think so?
- Yes, I do.

1407
04:15:24,102 --> 04:15:26,771
The Jews knew more than you?

1408
04:15:26,854 --> 04:15:29,357
I'm convinced of it!

1409
04:15:29,440 --> 04:15:32,360
It's hard to believe.

1410
04:15:32,443 --> 04:15:36,531
The German administration
was never informed

1411
04:15:36,614 --> 04:15:39,951
of what would happen to the Jews.

1412
04:15:43,996 --> 04:15:47,625
When was the first deportation
to Treblinka?

1413
04:15:54,966 --> 04:15:58,428
Before Auerswald's suicide, I think.

1414
04:15:59,804 --> 04:16:00,972
Auerswald's?

1415
04:16:01,055 --> 04:16:04,392
I mean Czerniakow's. Sorry.

1416
04:16:05,309 --> 04:16:07,437
July 22.

1417
04:16:08,604 --> 04:16:11,983
Those are dates...

1418
04:16:12,608 --> 04:16:17,196
So the deportations began July 22, 1942.

1419
04:16:17,280 --> 04:16:18,656
Yes.

1420
04:16:19,949 --> 04:16:21,367
To... Treblinka.

1421
04:16:21,451 --> 04:16:25,705
And Czerniakow killed himself July 23.

1422
04:16:26,539 --> 04:16:28,249
Yes, that is...

1423
04:16:28,332 --> 04:16:29,834
- The next day.
- The next day.

1424
04:16:29,917 --> 04:16:33,713
So that was it, he'd realized

1425
04:16:33,796 --> 04:16:36,716
that his idea...

1426
04:16:36,799 --> 04:16:41,220
it was his idea, I think, of working
in good faith with the Germans,

1427
04:16:41,304 --> 04:16:45,224
in the Jews' best interests.

1428
04:16:45,308 --> 04:16:50,980
He'd realized this idea,
this dream was destroyed.

1429
04:16:51,731 --> 04:16:55,485
- That the idea was a dream.
- Yes.

1430
04:16:55,818 --> 04:17:00,740
And when the dream faded,
he took the logical way out.

1431
04:22:07,963 --> 04:22:12,718
Did you think this idea of a ghetto
was a good one?

1432
04:22:12,802 --> 04:22:16,472
A sort of self-management, right?
- That's right.

1433
04:22:16,555 --> 04:22:18,474
A mini-State?

1434
04:22:18,849 --> 04:22:21,310
It worked well.

1435
04:22:21,977 --> 04:22:25,147
But it was self-management for death, no?

1436
04:22:25,815 --> 04:22:28,818
We know that now.
But at the time...

1437
04:22:28,901 --> 04:22:31,237
- Even then!
- No!

1438
04:22:31,320 --> 04:22:32,905
Czerniakow wrote,

1439
04:22:32,988 --> 04:22:37,868
“We're puppets, we have no power.”

1440
04:22:37,952 --> 04:22:38,786
Yes.

1441
04:22:38,869 --> 04:22:40,412
No power.

1442
04:22:40,496 --> 04:22:42,915
Sure... that was...

1443
04:22:43,165 --> 04:22:48,170
- You Germans were the overlords.
- Yes.

1444
04:22:48,254 --> 04:22:50,965
The overlords. The masters.

1445
04:22:51,048 --> 04:22:52,925
Obviously.

1446
04:22:53,008 --> 04:22:57,888
Czerniakow was merely a tool.

1447
04:22:58,180 --> 04:23:03,102
Yes, but a good tool.

1448
04:23:03,185 --> 04:23:07,940
Jewish self-management worked well,
I can tell you.

1449
04:23:09,150 --> 04:23:13,070
It worked well for 3 years,

1450
04:23:15,531 --> 04:23:19,410
<i>1941,1942,1943...
2112 years... and 'm the end...</i>

1451
04:23:19,493 --> 04:23:21,120
In the end...

1452
04:23:21,203 --> 04:23:24,707
“Worked well” for what?

1453
04:23:24,790 --> 04:23:26,667
To what end?

1454
04:23:27,293 --> 04:23:30,462
For self-preservation.

1455
04:23:30,546 --> 04:23:32,506
No! For death!

1456
04:23:32,590 --> 04:23:33,632
Yes, but...

1457
04:23:33,716 --> 04:23:36,802
Self-management, self-preservation...

1458
04:23:36,886 --> 04:23:39,221
That's easy to say now.

1459
04:23:39,513 --> 04:23:45,436
You admitted the conditions were inhuman.

1460
04:23:45,519 --> 04:23:47,855
Atrocious... horrible!

1461
04:23:49,023 --> 04:23:52,985
So it was clear even then...

1462
04:23:54,069 --> 04:23:57,239
No! Extermination wasn't clear.

1463
04:23:58,240 --> 04:24:00,951
Now we see the result.

1464
04:24:01,035 --> 04:24:03,454
Extermination isn't so simple.

1465
04:24:03,537 --> 04:24:05,831
One step was taken,

1466
04:24:05,915 --> 04:24:09,335
then another, and another, and another...

1467
04:24:09,418 --> 04:24:10,961
Yes.

1468
04:24:11,754 --> 04:24:16,508
But to understand the process, one must...

1469
04:24:16,592 --> 04:24:23,641
I repeat: extermination did not
take place in the ghetto, not at first.

1470
04:24:23,724 --> 04:24:26,310
Only with the evacuations.

1471
04:24:26,393 --> 04:24:28,395
Otherwise, in the ghetto, we would have...

1472
04:24:28,604 --> 04:24:30,731
Evacuations?

1473
04:24:30,814 --> 04:24:32,983
The evacuations to Treblinka.

1474
04:24:33,067 --> 04:24:37,196
The ghetto could have been
wiped out with weapons,

1475
04:24:38,322 --> 04:24:41,659
as it was finally done,
after the rebellion.

1476
04:24:41,951 --> 04:24:45,496
After I'd left.
But at the start...

1477
04:24:46,330 --> 04:24:48,874
Mr. Lanzmann, this is getting us nowhere.

1478
04:24:50,584 --> 04:24:53,796
We're reaching no new conclusions.

1479
04:24:54,630 --> 04:25:00,261
I don't think we can.

1480
04:25:00,344 --> 04:25:04,390
I didn't know then what I know now.

1481
04:25:06,141 --> 04:25:09,561
You weren't a nonentity.

1482
04:25:10,354 --> 04:25:12,982
- But I was!
- You were important.

1483
04:25:14,275 --> 04:25:17,528
- You overestimate my role.
- No.

1484
04:25:19,697 --> 04:25:24,910
You were 2nd to the Commissioner
of the Warsaw “Jewish district.”

1485
04:25:24,994 --> 04:25:26,704
But I had no power.

1486
04:25:26,787 --> 04:25:28,747
It was something.

1487
04:25:28,831 --> 04:25:33,127
You were part of the vast
German power structure.

1488
04:25:33,210 --> 04:25:36,922
Correct. But a small part.

1489
04:25:37,006 --> 04:25:41,760
You overestimate the authority
of a deputy of 28 then.

1490
04:25:41,844 --> 04:25:43,971
- You were 30.
- 28.

1491
04:25:44,054 --> 04:25:46,348
At 30, you were...

1492
04:25:50,519 --> 04:25:53,731
you were mature.

1493
04:25:53,814 --> 04:25:59,945
Yes, but for a lawyer
who got his degree at 27,

1494
04:26:00,029 --> 04:26:01,822
it's just a beginning.

1495
04:26:06,452 --> 04:26:07,953
You had a doctorate.

1496
04:26:08,037 --> 04:26:10,331
The title proves nothing.

1497
04:26:11,373 --> 04:26:13,792
- Did Auerswald have one too?
- No.

1498
04:26:13,876 --> 04:26:16,545
But the title's irrelevant.

1499
04:26:16,795 --> 04:26:18,881
Doctor of Law...

1500
04:26:19,590 --> 04:26:22,634
What did you do after the war?

1501
04:26:23,469 --> 04:26:28,766
I was with a mountaineering
publishing house.

1502
04:26:28,849 --> 04:26:30,059
That so?

1503
04:26:30,142 --> 04:26:35,230
I wrote and published mountain guidebooks.

1504
04:26:35,856 --> 04:26:38,692
I published a climbers' magazine.

1505
04:26:39,234 --> 04:26:42,279
Is climbing your main interest?

1506
04:26:43,238 --> 04:26:44,698
Yes.

1507
04:26:45,574 --> 04:26:47,493
The mountains, the air...

1508
04:26:47,576 --> 04:26:48,577
Yes.

1509
04:26:48,660 --> 04:26:51,580
The sun, the pure air...

1510
04:26:51,663 --> 04:26:53,749
Not like the ghetto air.

1511
04:27:43,465 --> 04:27:46,969
<i>The words
The words that I write to you</i>

1512
04:27:47,428 --> 04:27:50,722
<i>Are not written with ink,
but with tears</i>

1513
04:27:50,973 --> 04:27:54,393
<i>The best years are ending now</i>

1514
04:27:54,643 --> 04:27:57,980
<i>Are not written with ink,
but with tears</i>

1515
04:27:58,272 --> 04:28:01,733
<i>The best years are ending now</i>

1516
04:28:02,025 --> 04:28:05,112
<i>And are gone, not to return</i>

1517
04:28:05,654 --> 04:28:09,575
<i>It is difficult to fix
that which is shattered</i>

1518
04:28:09,825 --> 04:28:14,705
<i>And it is difficult to unite our love</i>

1519
04:28:14,955 --> 04:28:17,666
<i>Oh, show your tears</i>

1520
04:28:17,749 --> 04:28:20,586
<i>The fault is not mine</i>

1521
04:28:20,669 --> 04:28:24,256
<i>Because it must be so</i>

1522
04:28:24,339 --> 04:28:28,469
<i>It must be so
It must be so</i>

1523
04:28:28,844 --> 04:28:32,347
<i>We must both separate</i>

1524
04:28:32,639 --> 04:28:36,268
<i>It must be so
It must be so</i>

1525
04:28:36,518 --> 04:28:39,646
<i>The love that ends for both of us</i>

04:28:44,902 --> 04:28:48,780
<i>My fate dictated I must leave you</i>

<i>The Jewish Combat Organization (J.C.O.)
in the Warsaw ghetto</i>

1534
04:29:09,843 --> 04:29:14,139
<i>was officially formed on July 28, 1942.</i>

1535
04:29:14,223 --> 04:29:18,602
<i>After the first mass
deportation to Treblinka,</i>

1536
04:29:18,685 --> 04:29:21,980
<i>which was interrupted on September 30,</i>

1537
04:29:22,064 --> 04:29:26,360
<i>some 60,000 Jews remained in the ghetto.</i>

1538
04:29:26,443 --> 04:29:30,822
<i>On January 18, 1943,
the deportations were resumed.</i>

1539
04:29:30,906 --> 04:29:34,159
<i>Despite a severe lack of weapons,</i>

1540
04:29:34,243 --> 04:29:38,622
<i>the members of the J.C.O.
called for resistance,</i>

1541
04:29:38,705 --> 04:29:43,001
<i>and started fighting,
to the Germans' total surprise.</i>

1542
04:29:43,085 --> 04:29:45,337
<i>It lasted 3 days.</i>

1543
04:29:45,420 --> 04:29:48,715
<i>The Nazis withdrew with losses,</i>

1544
04:29:48,799 --> 04:29:53,178
<i>abandoning weapons the Jews grabbed.</i>

1545
04:29:53,262 --> 04:29:56,515
<i>The deportations were stopped.</i>

1546
04:29:56,598 --> 04:29:58,850
<i>The Germans now knew</i>

1547
04:29:58,934 --> 04:30:03,313
<i>they had to fight to conquer the ghetto.</i>

1548
04:30:03,397 --> 04:30:07,693
<i>The battle began
on the evening of April 19, 1943,</i>

1549
04:30:07,776 --> 04:30:12,155
<i>the eve of Pessach Passover.</i>

1550
04:30:12,239 --> 04:30:16,660
<i>It had to be a fight to the death.</i>

1553
04:31:25,062 --> 04:31:28,523
2nd in command of the J.C.O.

1554
04:31:32,361 --> 04:31:35,489
<i>I began drinking after the war.</i>

1555
04:31:43,872 --> 04:31:46,208
<i>It was very difficult.</i>

1556
04:32:02,516 --> 04:32:05,769
<i>Claude, you asked for my impression.</i>

1557
04:32:07,270 --> 04:32:10,857
<i>If you could lick my heart,</i>

1558
04:32:10,941 --> 04:32:13,443
<i>it would poison you.</i>

1559
04:32:16,738 --> 04:32:20,951
<i>At the request of Mordechai Anielewicz,</i>

1560
04:32:21,243 --> 04:32:24,329
<i>commander-in-chief of the J. C. O.</i> ,

1561
04:32:24,621 --> 04:32:29,167
<i>Antek had left the ghetto
6 days before the German attack.</i>

1562
04:32:29,459 --> 04:32:31,503
<i>His mission:</i>

1563
04:32:31,795 --> 04:32:35,924
<i>To ask Polish Resistance leaders
to arm the Jews.</i>

1564
04:32:36,258 --> 04:32:38,260
<i>They refused.</i>

1565
04:33:50,916 --> 04:33:56,421
I don't think the human tongue
can describe

1566
04:33:56,505 --> 04:33:59,382
the horror we went through in the ghetto.

1567
04:34:01,009 --> 04:34:05,096
In the streets,
if you can call them that,

1568
04:34:05,347 --> 04:34:08,308
for nothing was left of the streets,

1569
04:34:08,391 --> 04:34:13,355
we had to step over heaps of corpses.

1570
04:34:13,772 --> 04:34:16,775
There was no room to pass beside them.

1571
04:34:16,858 --> 04:34:20,612
Besides fighting the Germans,
we fought hunger

1572
04:34:20,695 --> 04:34:22,864
and thirst.

1573
04:34:22,948 --> 04:34:25,951
We had no contact with the outside world,

1574
04:34:26,034 --> 04:34:30,121
we were completely isolated,
cut off from the world.

1575
04:34:45,887 --> 04:34:48,306
We were in such a state

1576
04:34:48,390 --> 04:34:51,643
that we could no longer understand

1577
04:34:51,726 --> 04:34:55,605
the very meaning of
why we went on fighting.

1578
04:35:03,405 --> 04:35:07,158
We thought of attempting a breakout

1579
04:35:07,242 --> 04:35:10,996
to the Aryan part of Warsaw,
outside the ghetto.

1580
04:35:26,094 --> 04:35:28,346
Just before May 1,

1581
04:35:28,430 --> 04:35:30,891
Sigmund and I were sent

1582
04:35:30,974 --> 04:35:35,896
to try to contact Antek in Aryan Warsaw.

1583
04:35:53,330 --> 04:35:57,792
<i>We found a tunnel
under Bonifrateska Street</i>

1584
04:35:57,876 --> 04:36:02,339
<i>that led out into Aryan Warsaw.</i>

1585
04:36:34,746 --> 04:36:36,414
<i>Early in the morning,</i>

1586
04:36:36,498 --> 04:36:41,086
<i>we suddenly emerged
into a street in broad daylight.</i>

1587
04:36:49,886 --> 04:36:53,515
<i>Imagine us on that sunny May 1,</i>

1588
04:36:53,807 --> 04:36:58,436
<i>stunned to find ourselves in the street,
among normal people.</i>

1589
04:36:58,520 --> 04:37:02,065
<i>We'd come from another planet.</i>

1590
04:37:40,812 --> 04:37:45,567
<i>People immediately jumped on us</i>

1591
04:37:45,650 --> 04:37:48,987
<i>because we certainly looked exhausted,</i>

1592
04:37:49,070 --> 04:37:51,364
<i>skinny, in rags.</i>

1593
04:37:52,407 --> 04:37:57,203
<i>Around the ghetto,
there were always suspicious Poles</i>

1594
04:37:57,287 --> 04:37:59,164
<i>who grabbed Jews.</i>

1595
04:38:09,466 --> 04:38:12,594
<i>By a miracle, we escaped them.</i>

1596
04:38:27,442 --> 04:38:30,028
<i>In Aryan Warsaw,</i>

1597
04:38:30,111 --> 04:38:35,492
<i>life went on as naturally
and normally as before.</i>

1598
04:38:53,134 --> 04:38:55,428
<i>The cafes operated normally,</i>

1599
04:38:55,512 --> 04:38:58,473
<i>the restaurants, buses, streetcars...</i>

1600
04:38:58,556 --> 04:39:01,309
<i>The movies were open.</i>

1601
04:39:06,856 --> 04:39:11,986
<i>The ghetto was an isolated island
amid normal life.</i>

1602
04:39:45,520 --> 04:39:50,859
<i>Our job was to contact
Itzhak Zuckermann</i>

1603
04:39:51,442 --> 04:39:54,737
<i>to try to mount a rescue operation,</i>

1604
04:39:54,821 --> 04:39:57,407
<i>to try to save the few fighters</i>

1605
04:39:57,490 --> 04:40:00,535
<i>who might still be alive in the ghetto.</i>

1606
04:40:04,581 --> 04:40:08,710
<i>We managed to contact Zuckermann.</i>

1607
04:40:16,885 --> 04:40:20,555
<i>We found two sewer workers.</i>

1608
04:40:39,824 --> 04:40:41,784
<i>On the night of May 8-9,</i>

1609
04:40:41,868 --> 04:40:45,038
<i>we decided to return to the ghetto</i>

1610
04:40:45,121 --> 04:40:49,584
<i>with another buddy, Riszek,
and the 2 sewer workers.</i>

1611
04:40:50,084 --> 04:40:54,422
<i>After the curfew, we entered the sewers.</i>

1612
04:41:07,769 --> 04:41:12,232
<i>We were entirely
at the mercy of the two workmen,</i>

1613
04:41:12,315 --> 04:41:16,945
<i>since only they knew
the ghetto's underground layout.</i>

1614
04:41:31,334 --> 04:41:35,296
<i>Halfway there, they decided to turn back,</i>

1615
04:41:35,380 --> 04:41:40,093
<i>they tried to drop us,
and we had to threaten them with our guns.</i>

1616
04:41:45,974 --> 04:41:50,436
<i>We went on through the sewers,</i>

1617
04:41:59,988 --> 04:42:05,785
<i>until one of the workmen told us
we were under the ghetto.</i>

1618
04:42:10,540 --> 04:42:15,461
<i>Riszek guarded them
so they couldn't escape.</i>

MILA 18.
J.C.O. BUNKER HEADQUARTERS

1620
04:42:23,136 --> 04:42:26,347
<i>I raised the manhole cover</i>

1621
04:42:26,431 --> 04:42:28,933
<i>to go up into the ghetto.</i>

1622
04:42:49,454 --> 04:42:53,708
<i>At bunker Mila 18, I missed them by a day.</i>

1623
04:43:08,890 --> 04:43:12,560
<i>I had returned the night of May 8-9.</i>

1624
04:43:15,063 --> 04:43:20,777
<i>The Germans found the bunker
on the morning of the 8th.</i>

1625

WARSAW - THE MONUMENT
TO THE GHETTO FIGHTERS

1626
04:43:42,173 --> 04:43:46,594
<i>Most of its survivors committed suicide,</i>

1627
04:43:46,677 --> 04:43:49,597
<i>or succumbed to gas in the bunkers.</i>

1628
04:43:50,306 --> 04:43:55,228
THE REPLICA OF THE MONUMENT
TO THE GHETTO FIGHTERS

1629
04:43:55,311 --> 04:43:58,231
JERUSALEM

1630
04:44:46,112 --> 04:44:50,450
I went to bunker Franciszkanska 22.

1631
04:44:51,325 --> 04:44:55,413
There was no answer
when I yelled the password,

1632
04:44:58,082 --> 04:45:01,169
so I had to go on through the ghetto.

1633
04:45:01,252 --> 04:45:05,423
I suddenly heard a woman
calling from the ruins.

1634
04:45:46,422 --> 04:45:50,968
It was darkest night,
no lights, you saw nothing.

1635
04:45:51,052 --> 04:45:54,805
All the houses were in ruins,
and I heard only one voice.

1636
04:45:54,889 --> 04:45:59,352
I thought some evil spell
had been cast on me,

1637
04:45:59,435 --> 04:46:02,188
a woman's voice talking from the rubble.

1638
04:46:02,271 --> 04:46:04,565
I circled the ruins.

1639
04:46:04,649 --> 04:46:06,234
I didn't look at my watch,

1640
04:46:06,317 --> 04:46:10,488
but I must have spent
a half hour exploring,

1641
04:46:10,571 --> 04:46:13,824
trying to find the woman
whose voice guided me,

1642
04:46:13,908 --> 04:46:16,911
but, unfortunately, I didn't find her.

1643
04:46:19,747 --> 04:46:22,083
Were there fires?

1644
04:46:43,980 --> 04:46:47,525
Strictly speaking, no,
for the ﬂames had died down,

1645
04:46:47,608 --> 04:46:49,944
but there was still smoke,

1646
04:46:50,027 --> 04:46:52,405
and that awful smell
of charred ﬂesh

1647
04:46:52,488 --> 04:46:56,117
of people who had surely
been burned alive.

1648
04:47:32,737 --> 04:47:35,406
I continued on my way,

1649
04:47:35,489 --> 04:47:40,119
going to other bunkers
in search of fighting units,

1650
04:47:40,202 --> 04:47:42,496
but it was the same everywhere.

1651
04:47:42,580 --> 04:47:46,292
I'd give the password: “Jan.”

1652
04:47:48,336 --> 04:47:51,005
That's a Polish first name, Jan.

1653
04:47:55,301 --> 04:47:57,887
Right. And I got no answer.

1654
04:47:57,970 --> 04:48:01,599
I went from bunker to bunker,

1655
04:48:01,682 --> 04:48:06,062
and after walking for hours in the ghetto,

1656
04:48:06,145 --> 04:48:09,273
I went back toward the sewers.

1657
04:48:09,357 --> 04:48:11,525
Was he alone then?

1658
04:48:15,279 --> 04:48:17,782
Yes, I was alone all the time.

1659
04:49:13,254 --> 04:49:15,631
Except for that woman's voice,

1660
04:49:15,715 --> 04:49:20,261
and a man I met
as I came out of the sewers,

1661
04:49:20,344 --> 04:49:23,556
I was alone throughout my tour
of the ghetto.

1662
04:49:23,639 --> 04:49:26,851
I didn't meet a living soul.

1663
04:49:26,934 --> 04:49:29,645
At one point, I recall

1664
04:49:29,729 --> 04:49:34,066
feeling a kind of peace, or serenity,

1665
04:49:34,150 --> 04:49:37,319
when I said to myself, “I'm the last Jew.

1666
04:49:37,403 --> 04:49:41,449
<i>I'll</i> wait for morning
and for the Germans.”
