2
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
How you doin', Keaton?

3
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,770
I can't feel my legs,

4
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,440
Keyser.

5
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,620
Ready?

6
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:03,711
What time is it?

7
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,471
12.30.

8
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:22,061
[two gunshots]...

9
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:05,154
...[sirens]

10
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:14,104
It all started back
in New York six weeks ago.

11
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:17,774
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

12
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:21,404
The driver saw nobody, but
somebody fucked up. He heard a voice.

13
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,734
Sometimes that's all you need.

14
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:26,094
NEW YORK CITY

15
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:27,994
Mr. McManus?

16
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,034
Christ, don't you fuckin' guys ever sleep?

17
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:35,384
We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

18
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,885
Todd Hockney?

19
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:47,980
Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

20
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,455
Shit. Freeze.

21
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,745
Hold it.

22
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:02,421
Sure you brought enough guys?

23
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:41,198
It's quite simple.
A restaurant that changes with the taste...

24
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:43,777
...without losing the overall aesthetic.

25
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:48,328
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

26
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:51,287
Where will it be?
- Let me give you an example.

27
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:54,058
This I had to see for myself.

28
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,228
David.

29
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:01,338
I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

30
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:04,068
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

31
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,238
Special Agent Kujan, US Customs.

32
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:10,848
These gentlemen are from
the New York Police Department.

33
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:13,939
You look good, Keaton.
Better than I would have thought.

34
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,519
Il y a un problème?

35
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:19,783
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

36
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,419
Mr. Keaton?
- Will you excuse us for a moment?

37
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,409
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

38
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,749
Peut-être nous vous laisserions...
- No, no, no, please. Please sit down.

39
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,940
This is... This is a small problem.

40
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:42,759
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.
- OK.

41
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:48,100
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé là?
- Non, c'est pas du tout un problème.

42
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,060
C'est la police, n'est-ce pas?
- Ça a l'air.

43
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,201
Ça va.

44
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,691
Unique.

45
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,791
Oui.

46
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,621
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

47
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,581
I mean, these guys
were hard-core hijackers.

48
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,721
But there I was.

49
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,081
At that point I wasn't scared.

50
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:19,841
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

51
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:24,617
Besides, it was fun.
I got to make like I was notorious.

52
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:27,221
[man over PA] You know the drill.

53
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:32,271
When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.

54
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:34,497
Number one, step forward.

55
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:42,272
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

56
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:45,797
Number two, step forward.

57
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:52,083
Give me the fucking keys,
you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker...

58
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:56,433
Knock it off. Get back.
Number three, step forward.

59
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:08,513
[thick accent] Hand me the keys.
- In English, please.

60
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:11,703
Excuse me?
- In English.

61
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:15,234
Hand me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker. What the fuck?

62
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,544
Number four, step forward.

63
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,524
[number five] It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.

64
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:23,864
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

65
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:28,744
It was all the cops' fault. You don't
put guys like that into a room together.

66
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,914
Who knows what can happen?

67
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:35,105
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

68
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:38,675
This has really gotta be
embarrassing for you guys, huh?

69
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:43,425
They drilled us all night. Somebody was
pissed about that truck getting hijacked.

70
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:46,725
They were hoping somebody
would give them something to go on.

71
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:50,725
They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.

72
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:54,725
Our rights went out the window.
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

73
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:57,646
They went after McManus first -
a top-notch entry man.

74
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:01,485
What truck?
- The truck with the guns, fucko.

75
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,585
Fucko?

76
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,156
He was a good guy. Crazy though.

77
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,116
Wanna know what Fenster told us?

78
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:13,955
Say who?
- McManus. He told us another story.

79
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:17,716
Oh, is that the one about
the hooker with dysentery?

80
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:20,887
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a tight-ass,

81
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,466
but when it came to the job
he was right-on a smart man.

82
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,176
What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

83
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:29,976
He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

84
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,437
Yeah, I'm shakin'[. ] Come on.
- OK.

85
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:36,527
Answer my question.
- Can you hear me in the back?

86
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,067
Hello?

87
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:43,067
I want my lawyer. I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

88
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:46,142
Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.

89
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:49,787
Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

90
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:52,247
You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

91
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:56,168
You think so? I could put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

92
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,757
Really?

93
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,837
I live in Queens. Did you put
that together yourself, Einstein?

94
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:04,388
Got a team of monkeys workin' on this?

95
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:09,333
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

96
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:13,769
Fuck your father in the shower, then
have a snack. You gonna charge me?

97
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,309
When I'm ready.

98
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,279
With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

99
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,148
But Keaton was the real prize for them,
for obvious reasons.

100
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,799
It was your mistake, not mine.

101
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,969
Did you ever stop to ask me? Hm?

102
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:36,459
I mean, I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

103
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,380
I'm a business man.
- What's that, the restaurant business?

104
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,219
From now on you're in
the getting-fucked-by-us business.

105
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,850
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

106
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,830
Like I said, it was your mistake. Not mine.

107
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,790
Now, you charge me
with this shit and I'll beat it.

108
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,130
OK?

109
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,531
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

110
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,361
Argh.

111
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,200
[Fenster] I really, really think somebody
should do something about this shit.

112
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,331
So I did a little time. Does that mean I get
railed every time a truck finds its way...

113
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,091
Fuck 'em.

114
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:22,551
Fenster, will you relax? These guys
don't have any probable cause.

115
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:26,012
You're fucking-A right.
No PC. No goddamn right.

116
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,511
You do some time, never let you go.
They treat me like a criminal.

117
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:34,351
I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

118
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:38,387
Now, what you gotta go and do that?

119
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:41,782
I'm tryin' to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

120
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:44,112
You're makin' me tired all over.

121
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:45,952
Well, fuck it then.

122
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:49,582
I heard you were dead.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you heard right.

123
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:53,122
Word I got is you hung up your
spurs, man. What's that all about?

124
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,222
[McManus] What's this?

125
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,832
Rumour has it Keaton's gone straight.

126
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:00,962
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
- Who's that?

127
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:05,723
A heavyweight criminal lawyer from
uptown. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

128
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:09,743
How about it, Keaton?
You a lawyer's wife?

129
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:14,064
What kind of retainer are you givin' her?
- Whoops.

130
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:17,393
Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favour.

131
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,414
Tell him to keep quiet.

132
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,214
Dean Keaton.

133
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,174
Gone clean, huh?

134
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:29,954
Say it ain't so.
Or was it you that hit that truck?

135
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:33,204
Mac, Mac, forget him.
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

136
00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:34,834
[chuckles]...

137
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:38,334
This whole thing was a shakedown.
- What makes you say that?

138
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,344
How many times you been in a line-up?

139
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:47,224
It's always you and four dummies. PD pay
homeless guys $10 a head half the time.

140
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:50,725
And there's no way
they'd line five felons in the same row.

141
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:54,474
And a voice line-up? A public
defender can get you outta that one.

142
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:58,195
So why the hell was I strip-searched?
- That was the feds.

143
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:03,155
Truckload of guns get snagged. Customs
comes down on NYPD wanting answers.

144
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:05,946
They come up with us.
They're clutching at straws.

145
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,976
I had a guy's finger up my asshole.
- Is it Friday already?

146
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:15,976
Yeah, lover boy. You want a piece?

147
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,546
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

148
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:23,716
[Hockney] What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

149
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:27,096
I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, working man?

150
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,727
Fuck who did it.
I wanna know who's the gimp.

151
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,146
[Keaton] He's OK.
- How do I know that?

152
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,187
What about it? What's your story?
- His name is Verbal.

153
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,337
Verbal Kint.
- Verbal?

154
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:42,537
Yeah.
- Roger really. People say I talk too much.

155
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:46,237
I was just gonna tell you to shut up.
- We met before once or twice.

156
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:50,827
In county. I was in for fraud.
- A line-up then, too. What happened?

157
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:53,848
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

158
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,122
So you did it.
- All right, now, look.

159
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:01,007
We've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

160
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:05,257
So I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity, hm?

161
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:08,718
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

162
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:13,978
Why don't you just calm down?
- What do you care what he has to say?

163
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,328
I'm just talkin' here.

164
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:22,239
It seems like Mr. Hockney wants to hear
what I got to say. I know Fenster's down.

165
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,378
What about you, guy?

166
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,509
I'm interested. Sure.

167
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:32,709
There, see? So now I'd like
to exercise my right to free assembly.

168
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:35,104
Why don't you just shut up?

169
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:43,104
You're missing the point.

170
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,049
No.

171
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,319
You're missing the point.

172
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:50,270
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

173
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,750
I don't care about your job.

174
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,290
And, um,

175
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,230
I want nothing to do with any of you.

176
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,155
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

177
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,050
Dean Keaton, gone the high road.

178
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,851
What is the world coming to?

179
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,600
Fuck him.

180
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:28,431
That was how it started. Five men
brought in on a trumped-up charge...

181
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:31,167
...to be leaned on by halfwits.

182
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,521
OK. Now I really can't
talk about it much here...

183
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,192
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now,

184
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:44,281
was that these men would
never break, never lie down,

185
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:47,422
never bend over for anybody.

186
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,592
Anybody.

187
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,612
[bell ringing, waves lapping]...

188
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,182
...[horn blows]

189
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:01,193
SAN PEDRO...

190
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,992
Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead?

191
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:13,273
15 so far. They're still pulling
bodies out of the water though.

192
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:15,313
Any survivors?
- Yeah, two.

193
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,983
One guy's in county hospital,
but he's in a coma.

194
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,273
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York, I think.

195
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:28,258
The chief wants this place sealed off.
If you have any questions, give him a call.

196
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,655
[ringing tone]

197
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:04,285
This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

198
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:10,075
If you need to reach me, call Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro PD on extension 112.

199
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:14,085
Have a nice day.
- [answering machine beeps]...

200
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,625
Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you.

201
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:22,886
The DA came last night ready to arraign
even before they moved him to county.

202
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,306
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later,

203
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:28,726
DA comes out the office looking like
he'd been smacked around.

204
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:32,056
They take his statement
and they cut him a deal.

205
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:36,437
Did they charge him with anything?
- Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanour two.

206
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:38,537
What is that?

207
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:42,156
Listen, I give the DA credit
for getting that much. Understand?

208
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,297
Excuse me, sir.

209
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:47,197
This whole thing has turned political.

210
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:52,037
The mayor was here last night. The chief.
This morning the governor called, OK?

211
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:56,377
I'm telling you this guy is protected from
up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

212
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:59,007
Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

213
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:01,337
Two hours, tops.
- I wanna see him.

214
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,337
No, Dave.
- I gotta see him.

215
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:08,967
Dave, no. I cannot do this for you.
- You gotta. I came a long way for this.

216
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,117
Dave, please.

217
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:18,318
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

218
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:22,068
He's paranoid. He knows the
interrogation rooms are all wired.

219
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:26,029
I quit. This won't be an interrogation.
Just a friendly chat.

220
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:29,199
He will not go in the interrogation room.
- Someplace else.

221
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,299
Where?

222
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:33,918
No, no, no, no, no...

223
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:37,549
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it in?

224
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:42,429
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories.
- They know damn well what I think.

225
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:47,759
That's crazy. Besides, the guy's got
total immunity. His story checks out.

226
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:52,309
He doesn't know what you wanna know.
- I don't think he does. Not exactly.

227
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,520
But there's more to his story.

228
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:59,150
Jeffrey, look, I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier...

229
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,700
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

230
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,320
And, above all, I wanna
be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

231
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,510
He's dead.
- Come on. Two hours.

232
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,760
Just till he makes bail.

233
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,460
They're all dead. I don't care how
tough a guy you say Keaton was,

234
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,385
nobody on that boat
could have come out alive.

235
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:25,630
Is he talking?
- He just regained consciousness.

236
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,181
He spoke... not English, then he lapsed.
- Hungarian.

237
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:32,351
Might have been.
- Most were Hungarians.

238
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:36,811
You gotta put on one of these.
- Burn victims are susceptible to infection.

239
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:39,886
And, of course, there's no smoking.

240
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:51,832
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

241
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:54,752
Is he gonna die?
- He has burns over 60% of his body.

242
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:58,462
A number of ribs are broken.
- Call Security. Put a man on the door.

243
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,692
Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

244
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,592
Do it.

245
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:05,752
Do it now.
- [muttering in Hungarian]

246
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:09,643
Joel? Yeah, Baer down at LA County.

247
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:13,852
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbour is Arkosh Kovash.

248
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:17,703
Yes. Yes. I'm sure.
No, he's all fucked up.

249
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:21,732
[shouts in Hungarian]
- What? What? I can't hear you.

250
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,809
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

251
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:26,363
Yes?

252
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:31,034
Well, not until I put a man on him. Send
me someone who can speak Hungarian.

253
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:35,553
Yeah, he's talking like a Thai hooker.
- Keyser Söze.

254
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:40,814
What?
- Keyser Söze. Keyser Söze.

255
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:45,389
[coughs and splutters] Keyser Söze.
- No shit.

256
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:51,934
Joel. Yeah, call Dan Metzheiser at Justice
and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

257
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,034
Mm-hm.

258
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:29,471
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

259
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:31,846
Nice to meet you.

260
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:34,106
He wants to ask you a few questions.

261
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:37,606
What about?
- About a Dean Keaton mostly.

262
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,406
But I'd like to start at
the line-up in New York.

263
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:44,826
Can I get coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the line-up.

264
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:48,366
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

265
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:51,826
One time I got so bad, my piss
come out like snot. It was thick...

266
00:22:51,926 --> 00:22:57,452
I'll get your fucking coffee.
- Get me one too while you're at it.

267
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:00,717
[opens door]

268
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:04,487
That guy is tense. Tension is a killer.

269
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,518
I was in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

270
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:11,557
The baritone was a guy named Kip Diskin.
Big, fat guy. I mean, like, orca fat.

271
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:15,478
He was so stressed in the morning...
- Verbal, we're trying to help you.

272
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:19,398
Sure. And I appreciate that.
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.

273
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,197
I like cops. I would have liked
to have been a fed myself, but...

274
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:27,368
Verbal, you're not telling us everything.
I know you know something.

275
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:30,953
[Verbal] I told the DA everything I know.

276
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:36,499
Verbal, I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man.

277
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,379
[Verbal] I know he was good.
- He was a corrupt cop.

278
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:42,969
Sure, 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.

279
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:49,274
Anyway, cops wouldn't let him go legit.
- Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

280
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:53,559
Are you trying to get
a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?

281
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,570
I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

282
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,829
May I have a cigarette?

283
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:06,745
According to your statement...
- I need a light.

284
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,175
According to your statement, you're
a short-con operator. Run-of-the-mill...

285
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,301
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

286
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:26,590
Run-of-the-mill scams.
- It's been suppressed. It's inadmissible.

287
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:31,111
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

288
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:36,771
Well, I do have the weapons charge. I'm
looking at six whole months' hard time.

289
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:40,231
You know a dealer
named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

290
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:42,491
Know a religious guy named John Paul?

291
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:45,701
You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

292
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:50,162
I know Ruby. He's big on respect. He's a
good friend of mine, likes me very much.

293
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:55,922
I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby has
a lot of friends inside do favours for him.

294
00:24:56,022 --> 00:25:00,042
What do you think he'd say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

295
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:03,712
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
- I'll mention that to him.

296
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:06,722
First thing on the job
I learnt how to spot a murderer.

297
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:10,643
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing and put 'em in jail.

298
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,022
Next day whoever's sleeping is your man.

299
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:17,982
If you're guilty, you know you're caught,
you get some rest. You follow me?

300
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,058
No.
- Let me get right to the point.

301
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:26,863
I'm smarter than you and
I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

302
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:30,413
And I'm gonna get it from you
whether you like it or not.

303
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:32,553
I'm not a rat.

304
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,014
[door opens]

305
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:40,474
Thanks.

306
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:49,434
When I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we'd make fresh coffee right off the trees.

307
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:52,854
That was good. This is shit,
but, hey, I'm in a police station...

308
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:58,394
Can we get started again?
- Now, what happened after the line-up?

309
00:26:03,335 --> 00:26:07,285
The desk sergeant told me he couldn't
release you. Can you believe that?

310
00:26:07,385 --> 00:26:10,870
You weren't even charged.
New York police.

311
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:17,625
I want pictures taken of your face.
I'll take 'em to the DA first thing.

312
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:21,585
Forget about it.
- No. I'll have this in front of a grand jury.

313
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:25,426
Look, I don't wanna talk about it, Edie. OK?

314
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,386
So what did Fortier and Renault say?

315
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:35,105
They need more time to think about it.
- Dammit. More time for what, Edie?

316
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:39,196
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they'll still find out about me.

317
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:42,406
Give me some credit. I got you this far.

318
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:48,196
Let's go to the grand jury. It won't stop.
- Look, it's never gonna stop, period.

319
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:53,747
By next week every investor in the city's
gonna be walkin' away from us.

320
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:55,496
It's finished.

321
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,806
I'm finished.
- [footsteps]

322
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,237
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

323
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:08,988
It's never gonna stop.

324
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:18,458
I love you.

325
00:27:18,578 --> 00:27:21,297
They ruined me in there tonight.

326
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,007
I love you.

327
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,928
Do you hear me?

328
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:36,268
What?

329
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:40,268
All right.

330
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:42,608
Let's just go to my place.

331
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,854
[Edie] We'll worry about this tomorrow.

332
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,750
Let's go.

333
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,539
Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition.

334
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,614
A fast jump, high risk, long money.

335
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,540
We all knew it could be done.

336
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,340
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

337
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,905
To do it right took five men.

338
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,020
Five men meant Keaton.

339
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:26,320
Keaton took convincing.

340
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:31,166
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

341
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,570
Bullshit.

342
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
Bullshit.

343
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,400
They don't operate any more.

344
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,651
McManus has a friend in the 14th
Precinct. They're coming out for one job.

345
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:47,361
They're picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds. McManus already has a fence.

346
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,451
A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California named Redfoot.

347
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:53,411
I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

348
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:58,212
What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

349
00:28:58,312 --> 00:29:00,922
They won't take me unless you go.

350
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:03,401
Look at me. I need this.

351
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:07,512
Oh, you're telling me you don't
need this? Is this your place?

352
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:13,562
I'm not knocking you. You got a good
scam going with this lawyer... Oh.

353
00:29:15,702 --> 00:29:17,752
Sorry.

354
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:19,912
It's OK. It's OK.

355
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:24,567
You say it's the real thing, that's cool.

356
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:29,053
You OK?
- I was outta line.

357
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:33,243
But they're never gonna
stop with us. You know that.

358
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:36,043
As clean as you could get,
they'll never let you go.

359
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:42,178
This way we hit the cops where it hurts
and we get well in the meantime.

360
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,734
You sure you're OK?
- I'll be all right.

361
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,294
Look, I, uh...

362
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:06,974
I sometimes get...
- Forget it.

363
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:12,705
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

364
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:14,805
[Keaton snorts]

365
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:25,605
So, uh...

366
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:29,740
...how do they wanna do it?

367
00:30:30,826 --> 00:30:34,311
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

368
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,325
Fenster? Hockney?

369
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:40,486
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

370
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:47,471
I got a way to do it without killing anyone,
but they won't let me in without you.

371
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:06,317
Three million?

372
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,617
Maybe more.

373
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,617
No killing?

374
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:18,577
Not if we do it my way.

375
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:55,598
New York's Finest Taxi Service
was not your normal service.

376
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:59,569
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket...

377
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,358
...driving smugglers and
drug dealers round the city.

378
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:06,240
For a few hundred dollars a mile
you got your own police escort.

379
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:08,199
They even had business cards.

380
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,369
After a while somebody started asking
questions and the service shut down.

381
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:16,170
Since then Internal Affairs have
been waiting to catch them in the act.

382
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,130
That's where we came in.

383
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,545
So, how was the flight?
- Fucking great.

384
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,910
Will this get me to Staten Island?

385
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,100
You kidding me?
This'll get you to Cape Cod.

386
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,681
McManus brought us the job. Fenster got
the vans, Hockney supplied the hardware.

387
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:36,271
I came up with how to do it
so no one got killed.

388
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,196
But Keaton? Keaton
put on the finishing touch.

389
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:44,586
A little 'fuck you'
from the five of us to the NYPD.

390
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:50,661
All right, watch this, watch this.
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.

391
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,351
Come on, asshole. Fuck.

392
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,022
Holy shit.

393
00:32:56,141 --> 00:33:00,292
Don't move, you fuckers.
- Drop it now, motherfucker.

394
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:03,732
Hurry up.
- Drop it. Don't fuckin' move.

395
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:07,011
What do you want?
- [Fenster] Put the fuckin' thing away.

396
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:11,682
[McManus] Stupid asshole.
- [Fenster] Don't fuckin' move, mama.

397
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:15,607
[Hockney] You want
a buckshot shampoo, chubby?

398
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:18,242
[McManus] Aw, fuck.

399
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:24,822
Afternoon, pork chops. Give me the shit.
- Give him the fuckin' shit.

400
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,783
Give him the fuckin' thing.

401
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:29,413
Give him the fuckin' shit, man.

402
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:30,532
Hurry up.

403
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,763
Come on.
- Now the money.

404
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:34,872
There's no money.
- Give me the money.

405
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,162
There's no fuckin' money.
- Give me it.

406
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:40,253
Give me the fuckin' money.
- Give him the money.

407
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,593
Give me the money.
- Give him the money.

408
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:44,863
[McManus] Hurry up.

409
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:49,223
Motherfucker. You know who the fuck I
am? You people know who the fuck I am?

410
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:52,469
Fuck.
- [Hockney] We do now, jerk-off.

411
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,993
[stamping]

412
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,458
Wait a minute. What's that?

413
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,424
What the fuck...? Holy shit.

414
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,424
[McManus] Go. Go. Go.

415
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:21,985
[sirens]

416
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:27,595
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.
The press arrived before the police did.

417
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:30,435
Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.

418
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,475
Within a few weeks
50 more cops went down with them.

419
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:37,316
Everybody got it right in the ass
from the chief on down.

420
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,455
It was beautiful.

421
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,176
I owe you $2.50.

422
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:52,215
Dr. Keaton.

423
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:58,256
There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

424
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:02,297
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

425
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:04,857
In California?

426
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,846
Yes, Verbal. In California.

427
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:09,637
Fenster and I...
- Wait. Hold the fuckin' phone.

428
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:13,687
You and Fenster? No, no, no, no, no.
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

429
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:16,537
OK, so everyone's gonna go.

430
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:19,037
We all go.

431
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:22,397
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

432
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:26,028
My fuckin' problem is that
you and Fenster are off in California...

433
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:31,248
...while we're sittin' here holdin' our dicks.
- Hey. The job's over.

434
00:35:31,348 --> 00:35:33,348
Cool it.

435
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:36,872
LA's a good place to lie low for a while.

436
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:41,108
You wanna dance?

437
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,698
Ladies...

438
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:59,589
I would like to propose a toast.

439
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:02,039
There you go.

440
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:06,218
To Mr. Verbal.

441
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,389
The man with the plan.

442
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:25,130
[Verbal] We're gonna miss the flight.

443
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,800
Don't do this. Send her a note, something.

444
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,160
I said we'll make it.

445
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:07,116
We're gonna miss the plane.

446
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:10,191
She'll understand.

447
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:31,972
That's heart-warming. Really.

448
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:36,262
I'm weepy.

449
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:38,858
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

450
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:44,843
You guys wanted to know
what happened after the line-up.

451
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:49,013
Come on, Verbal.
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

452
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:52,303
You expect me to believe that he retired?

453
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,453
For a woman?

454
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:58,623
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

455
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,043
He loved her.
- Sure.

456
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:04,614
I'm supposed to believe
hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea?

457
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:08,454
That was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.

458
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:13,624
[Kujan] Who'd know the service better?
- But Edie had him turned around.

459
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:17,164
Let me tell you something.
I know Dean Keaton.

460
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:20,124
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

461
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:23,135
The guy I know was
a cold-blooded bastard.

462
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:27,425
IAD indicted him on three murder counts
before he was kicked off the force.

463
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:32,435
So don't sell me the hooker with a heart.
- You got him all wrong.

464
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:38,645
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total
of seven times while he was on the force.

465
00:38:38,745 --> 00:38:42,695
In every case the witnesses
either reversed their testimony,

466
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,755
or died before they could testify.

467
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:50,365
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

468
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:52,955
He killed three prisoners inside.

469
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:55,606
Of course, I can't prove this.

470
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:59,621
But I can't prove the best part either.

471
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,316
Dean Keaton was dead.

472
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:07,767
Did you know that? He died in a fire
two years ago during an investigation...

473
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:11,556
...into the murder of a witness
who was going to testify against him.

474
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:16,937
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into
a warehouse he owned before it blew up.

475
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:20,686
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

476
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:24,697
It blew up and took
all of Dean Keaton with it.

477
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:30,367
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

478
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,707
One killed himself in his car,

479
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:36,462
the other fell down an open elevator shaft.

480
00:39:37,138 --> 00:39:39,478
[beeping]
- Agent Baer...

481
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:42,927
Get this show on the road.
- There are too many people here.

482
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:46,388
Doctor, we'll be out of here
before he blows his porch light.

483
00:39:46,488 --> 00:39:48,758
I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

484
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:50,928
Everyone, calm down, all right?

485
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:54,438
I want you to ask this man
about the shoot-out in the harbour.

486
00:39:54,538 --> 00:39:56,998
[speaks Hungarian]...

487
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:10,073
He says they were buying...
- Dope. We know.

488
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:19,209
He doesn't know what they were buying,
but not dope. Uh, people.

489
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:22,454
What?
- [Kovash continues speaking]...

490
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:30,970
He needs guarantees.
- What is he talking about?

491
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,535
He says his life's in danger.

492
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,249
He saw the devil, looked him in the eye.

493
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,980
I'm on my way.
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

494
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,200
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

495
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:46,340
...about the devil.

496
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,721
Who's the devil?

497
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,351
Keyser Söze.

498
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:04,611
Keyser Söze?
- He was in the harbour killing many men.

499
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:09,151
He saw Keyser Söze?
- [Kovash carries on speaking]...

500
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:18,622
He saw his face.
- Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

501
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:20,792
Describe him.
- OK.

502
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:29,742
[Kujan] Six weeks ago
an anonymous call tells me

503
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:34,162
I can find Keaton at Mondino's
with his attorney. And there he is.

504
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:37,372
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

505
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:41,002
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him,

506
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:43,562
we had to let him go.

507
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:46,843
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over,

508
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:48,943
and then he had lunch.

509
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:53,063
I don't know about that.
- Oh, I don't think you do.

510
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:58,393
But you say you saw Keaton die. You're
covering his ass and he's still out there.

511
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:04,574
I think he's behind that whole circus at the
harbour. He's using you cos you're stupid.

512
00:42:04,674 --> 00:42:10,114
You tell me he's dead, so be it. I wanna be
sure he is before I go back to New York.

513
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:13,534
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

514
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:15,724
What lawyer?

515
00:42:15,844 --> 00:42:19,834
What lawyer, Verbal?
- When I was in that barbershop quartet...

516
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:24,094
I know you held out on the DA.
What did you leave out of that testimony?

517
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:27,884
I can call up Ruby in ten minutes.
- The DA gave me immunity.

518
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:31,684
Not from me. You get no immunity
from me, you piece of shit.

519
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:35,185
Every criminal I've put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favour,

520
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:39,444
every creep that walks the street for
a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

521
00:42:39,544 --> 00:42:43,195
Now you talk to me, or that immunity
they seem so fit to grant you...

522
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:49,671
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

523
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,715
There was a lawyer.

524
00:42:52,726 --> 00:42:55,055
Kobayashi.

525
00:42:55,186 --> 00:43:00,466
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No. But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

526
00:43:00,565 --> 00:43:02,566
Convince me.

527
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:05,155
And tell me every last detail.

528
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:28,577
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus's fence, Redfoot.

529
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:32,367
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.

530
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:34,627
Still, we should've known better.

531
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:36,627
How you doin'?
- Good. You?

532
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:39,097
Not bad. Can't complain.

533
00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:41,517
How's it goin', Fenster?

534
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:44,732
Don't need to open it, right?

535
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:52,408
You must be Keaton.

536
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:56,648
Redfoot, Dean Keaton,
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

537
00:43:56,748 --> 00:43:59,723
Verbal. The man with the plan, huh?

538
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:03,738
Interested in any more work?
- We're always lookin' for extra work.

539
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,969
We're on vacation.
- Well, that's too bad.

540
00:44:08,928 --> 00:44:12,289
I got a ton of work and I don't have
any good people like you guys.

541
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:16,498
What's the job?
- A jeweller out of Texas named Saul.

542
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:22,549
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.
He does free appraisals for people.

543
00:44:22,649 --> 00:44:25,889
Anyway, the word is
he carries around a lot of cash.

544
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:31,489
So I figure I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green. Simple.

545
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,349
What about security?
- Bodyguards. Nothing you can't handle.

546
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:42,070
Give me time to check it out?
- I'd expect nothing less from you, man.

547
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,279
Good to see you. We'll call you.

548
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:47,340
Enjoy LA, huh? Get yourself laid.

549
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,510
Hey, uh...

550
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,830
A friend of mine in New York tells me that
you know, that you knew Spook Hollis.

551
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,091
The way I hear it,
you did time with old Spook.

552
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:02,400
Good man, wasn't he?

553
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,901
I used to run dope for him.

554
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:07,620
Too bad he got shieved.
- Yeah.

555
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,491
I shieved him.

556
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:17,851
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

557
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,001
I appreciate that.

558
00:45:21,171 --> 00:45:26,131
Just out of curiosity,
was it business or personal?

559
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:30,301
A bit of both.

560
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:37,047
Well, like I said, you give me a call
if you're interested, all right?

561
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:42,352
Is there a problem?

562
00:45:43,692 --> 00:45:46,653
One job. That was the deal.

563
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:54,912
One job? [McManus laughs]

564
00:45:56,493 --> 00:45:58,543
One job.

565
00:45:59,502 --> 00:46:01,713
That's a good one, Keaton.

566
00:46:03,713 --> 00:46:07,403
Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

567
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:10,573
He can convince anyone
he's someone else, but never himself.

568
00:46:10,673 --> 00:46:16,283
It took one day with McManus
nagging him, and we went back to work.

569
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:31,514
So, I get out of my car.
I think it's wrecked.

570
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:34,934
In the back seat of the other car,
this woman's totally naked.

571
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:38,354
I'm laughin' so hard, I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

572
00:46:38,454 --> 00:46:40,495
Freeze. Freeze.

573
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:45,645
There's a second one here somewhere.

574
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:52,285
Give me the case.
Give me the fuckin' case.

575
00:46:58,105 --> 00:46:59,625
Give me the case.

576
00:46:59,726 --> 00:47:04,740
I'm telling you for the last time,
give me the fuckin' case.

577
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:12,026
[Hockney] Come on.
- [Fenster] Hey. Don't move.

578
00:47:15,496 --> 00:47:17,536
[car alarm]

579
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:48,617
Look, just hand over the case.

580
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:51,032
Hand over the fuckin' case.

581
00:48:14,718 --> 00:48:17,269
[Hockney] Come on. Let's go.

582
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:20,399
Come on.
- Bad day. Fuck it.

583
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:22,984
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

584
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:31,869
[hammering]

585
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:48,380
Fuck.

586
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,425
[Fenster] Looks like
a lot of china to me. Shit.

587
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,341
Guys, come on.
- [vehicle approaches]...

588
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:04,840
What're you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

589
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,761
We did it your way, now my way.
- You gonna kill him?

590
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,931
I'm gonna deal with it.
- You better.

591
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,750
I'm gonna deal with it. Shut up.

592
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:22,151
What am I supposed to do with that?

593
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,242
Feed it to the gimp, ease his pain.
I don't know what it is.

594
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:29,701
What do you mean? Sh.
- I don't know. I got this job from a lawyer.

595
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,222
Yeah, who?
- I don't know. Some limey.

596
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:36,832
He's a middle man for somebody, OK?
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

597
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,252
You're fuckin' full of shit.
- Fuck you.

598
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:43,732
Fuck you.
- Listen to me. We wanna meet him, OK?

599
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:45,903
That's funny.

600
00:49:46,023 --> 00:49:50,142
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

601
00:49:50,243 --> 00:49:52,812
OK. We'll meet him.
- I'll call you.

602
00:49:52,912 --> 00:49:56,643
Good. Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it, Dean. Wait.

603
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:02,523
One more thing, tough guy. Any more
surprises and I'm gonna kill you.

604
00:50:02,673 --> 00:50:06,993
Such a tough guy, McManus.
Do me a favour, get the fuck off my dick.

605
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:09,843
Fuck.
- No. No.

606
00:50:10,763 --> 00:50:13,634
Better put a leash on that puppy.

607
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:18,544
You know, it's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

608
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:21,923
The cops are gonna be
lookin' for the guys who did it.

609
00:50:22,024 --> 00:50:26,358
Sooner or later they're gonna
come around askin' me.

610
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,659
You have a sweet night, ladies.

611
00:50:32,994 --> 00:50:35,034
Fuck you.

612
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,375
So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

613
00:50:44,255 --> 00:50:46,794
Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

614
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:49,704
Why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

615
00:50:49,805 --> 00:50:52,135
Dave, someone to see you.

616
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:57,345
Jack.

617
00:50:57,725 --> 00:51:02,335
Been lookin' for you. Still after that coke
from the harbour blood bath yesterday?

618
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:06,106
Yeah.
- Stop lookin'. There was no coke.

619
00:51:06,235 --> 00:51:11,686
I been in LA County talkin' to a guy they
pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro.

620
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:13,825
He came to this morning.

621
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:19,776
He's in a Hungarian mob doing a deal with
Argentinians. Says it was no dope deal.

622
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:23,236
But the $91 million...
- We know. He says no way on the dope.

623
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:26,907
He tells me they were pulling
stumps for Turkey the next day.

624
00:51:27,006 --> 00:51:30,656
They had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it.

625
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:33,916
What's the money for?
- He didn't know. No one knew.

626
00:51:34,016 --> 00:51:38,297
Except for a few key people.
They were all very hush about it, he says.

627
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:42,547
Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don' t get it.

628
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:46,797
They tell me you got the cripple from
New York. Did he mention Keyser Söze?

629
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:48,758
Who?

630
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,908
Just bear with me here.

631
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:55,287
Who's Keyser Söze?
- Aw, fuck.

632
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:59,568
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

633
00:51:59,668 --> 00:52:03,528
What we need to do is find Redfoot,
Keaton, and get the hell outta here.

634
00:52:03,628 --> 00:52:07,028
What we need to do is think. Think back.

635
00:52:08,298 --> 00:52:11,468
Somebody with power.

636
00:52:11,598 --> 00:52:14,578
Somebody capable of
trackin' us from New York to LA.

637
00:52:14,678 --> 00:52:18,498
Dean, what the hell are we doin' here?
- We're waitin'.

638
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:19,839
I'm out.
- Sit down.

639
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:22,379
No. It's hot and I'm fuckin' bored.

640
00:52:22,478 --> 00:52:24,939
[man] Mr. Hockney, do stay.

641
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:26,719
Mr. Keaton.

642
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:31,019
Mr. Fenster I recognise from
his mug shots, as well as Mr. McManus.

643
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,979
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

644
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,899
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

645
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:42,860
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

646
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,740
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

647
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,430
What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

648
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,600
One job. One day's work. Very dangerous.

649
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,170
He does not expect all of you to live,
but those of you who do...

650
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,421
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

651
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,570
Who's your boss?

652
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:10,190
I work for Keyser Söze.

653
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:25,111
Who's Keyser Söze?
- Judging by the change in mood, Mr. Kint,

654
00:53:25,211 --> 00:53:28,241
I feel sure the rest of
your associates can tell you.

655
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:31,372
I come with an offer directly from Mr. Söze.

656
00:53:31,472 --> 00:53:35,202
An order, actually.
- What do you mean 'an order'?

657
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:40,792
In 1981, Mr. Keaton, you participated in a
hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

658
00:53:40,892 --> 00:53:44,632
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr. Söze...

659
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:48,842
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

660
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:52,142
A most profitable violation
of UN regulations.

661
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:55,813
You had no way of knowing this
because the fellow shipping the steel...

662
00:53:55,913 --> 00:53:59,312
...was working for Mr. Söze
without his knowledge.

663
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:05,832
Earlier this year Mr. Fenster and Mr.
McManus hijacked a flight out of Newark.

664
00:54:06,002 --> 00:54:10,782
The plane was carrying gold and
platinum wiring, also set for Pakistan.

665
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:17,088
Two months ago Mr. Hockney stole a
truck carrying gun parts through Queens.

666
00:54:17,104 --> 00:54:20,884
Gun parts which were set to be
destroyed by the State of New York.

667
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:24,714
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

668
00:54:24,814 --> 00:54:28,014
Again Mr. Söze,
using pawns who had no knowledge.

669
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:30,654
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

670
00:54:31,443 --> 00:54:35,684
Nine months ago one of
Mr. Söze's less than intelligent couriers...

671
00:54:35,783 --> 00:54:40,715
...was taken in a complicated
confidence scam by a cripple.

672
00:54:41,204 --> 00:54:44,294
He was relieved of $62,000.

673
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:47,614
Now, it has taken us some time to find you.

674
00:54:47,715 --> 00:54:51,495
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

675
00:54:51,595 --> 00:54:53,784
You set up the line-up?
- Yes.

676
00:54:53,885 --> 00:54:56,375
You were not to be released until I arrived.

677
00:54:56,475 --> 00:55:03,235
It seems Ms. Finneran was a little
too effective in expediting his release.

678
00:55:03,355 --> 00:55:05,505
Holding the rest of you was a moot point.

679
00:55:05,605 --> 00:55:08,465
What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

680
00:55:08,565 --> 00:55:11,265
Mr. Söze rarely works
with the same people for long,

681
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:14,145
and they never know
who they're working for.

682
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:17,986
One cannot be betrayed,
if one has no people.

683
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:20,461
So, why are you telling us?

684
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:26,005
Because you have stolen from
Mr. Söze, Mr. Fenster. All of you.

685
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:30,497
That you did not know you stole from him
is the only reason you are still alive.

686
00:55:30,596 --> 00:55:34,377
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

687
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:38,667
All right, fuck the debt and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Söze?

688
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:41,627
I don't think that is relevant, Mr. Hockney.

689
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:46,346
All five of you are responsible for the
murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

690
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:50,977
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your
involvement and we can see to it he will.

691
00:55:51,077 --> 00:55:54,267
What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

692
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,417
Mr. Söze's primary interest is narcotics.

693
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:03,947
He's been competing, shall we say, with
a group of Argentinians for years now.

694
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:07,617
Competing with Mr. Söze has taken its toll.

695
00:56:07,628 --> 00:56:14,428
The Argentinians are negotiating the sale
of $91m in cocaine in three days' time.

696
00:56:14,558 --> 00:56:20,839
This purchase will revitalise the
diminishing strength of their organisation.

697
00:56:20,938 --> 00:56:24,478
Mr. Söze would like you to stop the deal.

698
00:56:25,528 --> 00:56:28,259
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

699
00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:31,619
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

700
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:37,149
Mr. Söze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine on board.

701
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:42,008
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr. Söze.

702
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:48,729
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

703
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:51,339
A gift from Mr. Söze.

704
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:56,970
Good day, gentlemen.

705
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:09,322
My whole life's in here -
everything I've done since I was 18.

706
00:58:09,422 --> 00:58:11,573
They fuckin' know everything.

707
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:15,753
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

708
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:30,983
No.

709
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:34,264
This isn't right.
- I don't know.

710
00:58:34,364 --> 00:58:39,124
Who was that guy who used
to talk about Söze in New York?

711
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:43,863
Bricks Marlin.
- Yeah, I did jobs for him. Indirect stuff.

712
00:58:43,964 --> 00:58:48,364
He said he always made five times
more money than the job was worth.

713
00:58:48,464 --> 00:58:52,745
This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's
usin' him for window-dressing.

714
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:56,204
I don't know. This is bad.
- No, it's bullshit.

715
00:58:56,304 --> 00:58:59,544
This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' set-up.

716
00:58:59,644 --> 00:59:02,834
The way I hear it,
Söze is some kind of butcher.

717
00:59:02,934 --> 00:59:08,375
A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Söze.

718
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:12,285
Who is Keyser Söze?

719
00:59:12,865 --> 00:59:16,645
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

720
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:18,935
Nobody ever believed he was real.

721
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:22,316
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that worked directly for him,

722
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:26,695
but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody
could've worked for him. You never knew.

723
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:29,176
That was his power.

724
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:32,616
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...

725
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:36,456
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

726
00:59:37,226 --> 00:59:41,716
One story the guys told me - the story
I believe - was from his days in Turkey.

727
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:44,507
A gang of Hungarians
wanted their own mob.

728
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:49,596
They realised that to be in power you
didn't need guns or money or numbers.

729
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:53,437
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

730
00:59:53,537 --> 00:59:56,807
After a while they come into power,
and they come after Söze.

731
00:59:56,907 --> 01:00:01,242
He was small-time then,
just running dope, they say.

732
01:00:02,877 --> 01:00:06,948
They come to his home in the afternoon
looking for his business.

733
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:12,828
They find his wife and kids in the house
and decide to wait for Söze.

734
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:31,518
He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

735
01:00:31,618 --> 01:00:38,078
The Hungarians knew Söze was tough, so
they let him know they meant business.

736
01:00:42,129 --> 01:00:45,779
They tell him they want
his territory, all his business.

737
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:50,219
Söze looks over the faces of his family,

738
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:55,844
then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

739
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:17,730
He tells him he would
rather see his family dead...

740
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,890
...than live another day after this.

741
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,980
He lets the last Hungarian go,

742
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,201
waits until his family are buried,
then goes after the rest of the mob.

743
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:33,911
He kills their kids, their wives,
their parents and their parents' friends.

744
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:39,291
He burns down the houses they live in
and the stores they work in.

745
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,541
He kills people that owe them money.

746
01:01:41,641 --> 01:01:45,312
And like that... he's gone.

747
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:47,721
Underground.
Nobody's ever seen him since.

748
01:01:47,821 --> 01:01:52,011
He becomes a myth, a spook story
that criminals tell their kids at night.

749
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:56,107
'Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Söze will get you.'

750
01:01:56,202 --> 01:01:58,312
But no one ever really believes.

751
01:01:58,412 --> 01:02:00,962
Do you believe in him, Verbal?

752
01:02:02,872 --> 01:02:04,922
Keaton always said...

753
01:02:05,043 --> 01:02:09,037
'I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him.'

754
01:02:10,172 --> 01:02:12,472
Well, I believe in God.

755
01:02:12,592 --> 01:02:16,672
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Söze.

756
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:25,753
Do you give any weight to this?

757
01:02:25,853 --> 01:02:29,973
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice. He has a file on Söze in DC.

758
01:02:30,073 --> 01:02:35,223
Been a hobby of his. Guys equate him
to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.

759
01:02:35,323 --> 01:02:37,373
[knock at door]...

760
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,773
You've heard of him?
- On the street?

761
01:02:42,874 --> 01:02:44,874
Yeah.
- A few times.

762
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:48,034
Outside stuff.
Somebody working for a guy...

763
01:02:48,134 --> 01:02:53,204
...who worked for a guy who got some
money from Keyser Söze, shit like that.

764
01:02:53,304 --> 01:02:58,624
It could be an old badge, a hex sign,
to keep people from fucking with you.

765
01:02:58,724 --> 01:03:00,875
But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

766
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:05,345
I got a guy trying to leave hospital on
a fried drumstick cos he's afraid of Söze.

767
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:08,334
Yeah, I'll run it up the flagpole.

768
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:13,435
I told it like it happened on the boat.
So what if I left out how I got there?

769
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:18,725
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

770
01:03:18,826 --> 01:03:22,065
That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me, Agent Kujan.

771
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:25,405
If I said the Loch Ness Monster
hired me, what would you say?

772
01:03:25,505 --> 01:03:30,366
Turn state's evidence, we'll hear it out.
- I got immunity. What can you offer me?

773
01:03:30,466 --> 01:03:34,376
If there really is a Keyser Söze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

774
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:38,165
Where's your head? Where do you
think the pressure's coming from?

775
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:41,546
Keyser Söze, or whatever you
wanna call him, knows where I am.

776
01:03:41,646 --> 01:03:45,836
He's got the front burner under your ass
to let me go, so he can scoop me up later.

777
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:49,676
Immunity was to deal with you.
I got a new problem when I post bail.

778
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:52,517
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

779
01:03:52,617 --> 01:03:56,896
Oh, gee, thanks, Dave.
Bang-up job so far - extortion, coercion.

780
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:58,997
Kiss my pucker.

781
01:03:59,037 --> 01:04:05,412
The fuckers that rounded us up and sank
us are now bailing me out? Fuck you.

782
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:08,697
You think you can catch Keyser Söze?

783
01:04:08,797 --> 01:04:13,538
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

784
01:04:13,638 --> 01:04:16,538
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

785
01:04:16,638 --> 01:04:21,398
After that, my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

786
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,028
[beeping]

787
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,279
What happened next?

788
01:04:45,378 --> 01:04:50,909
The next morning Fenster was gone.
He couldn't handle slumming for Söze.

789
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:55,829
He left us a note wishing us good luck
and took a chunk of the money.

790
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:58,649
Then what?
- McManus was furious.

791
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:03,710
He was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out, all sorts of shit.

792
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:07,440
That night we got the call.
- What call?

793
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,395
Kobayashi told us
where we could find Fenster.

794
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:21,520
[Hockney] Let's get the fuck outta here.

795
01:05:22,171 --> 01:05:25,630
We gotta bury him.
- With what?

796
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,800
With our hands.

797
01:05:37,011 --> 01:05:40,501
Oh, this is nuts.
It's dry fucking sand, McManus.

798
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:44,211
When he rots, the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

799
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:48,181
Dig, you fuck.
- What we gonna do? He's gonna kill us.

800
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:53,011
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

801
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:57,231
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

802
01:05:57,331 --> 01:06:02,112
If you run, we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you. You got that?

803
01:06:02,211 --> 01:06:06,402
This ain't my boy we're buryin'.
I don't owe anybody.

804
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:10,362
So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

805
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:15,912
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count, so fuck you.

806
01:06:16,012 --> 01:06:19,412
Cos now it's payback.
- It's not payback.

807
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:27,543
It's precaution. You want payback,
you wanna run, I don't care.

808
01:06:29,863 --> 01:06:32,498
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

809
01:06:32,783 --> 01:06:34,908
I'm not doin' it for you.

810
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:38,283
I'm doin' this for me.

811
01:06:39,873 --> 01:06:42,253
I'm gonna finish this thing.

812
01:06:42,453 --> 01:06:46,449
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

813
01:07:06,854 --> 01:07:11,475
After they killed Fenster nobody'd run?
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.

814
01:07:11,575 --> 01:07:15,725
Why didn't you say anything?
- I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.

815
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:20,185
It was too far-fetched for him.
Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop.

816
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:24,865
To a cop, the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

817
01:07:24,965 --> 01:07:27,655
There's no mystery,
no arch criminal behind it all.

818
01:07:27,755 --> 01:07:31,326
If you got a dead body and
think his brother did it, you're right.

819
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:37,716
Nobody argued with Keaton. They just
set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

820
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:47,776
They're coming up.

821
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:51,176
Did you hear me? He's coming up.

822
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,326
He's on his way down.

823
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:47,628
[two gunshots]

824
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:51,588
Don't move.

825
01:08:51,639 --> 01:08:53,678
Press 20. Do it now.

826
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:15,659
Move.

827
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:21,020
The answer is no.
- Mr. Söze will be most upset...

828
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,530
Listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser
Söze. You mention him again, I'll kill you.

829
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:31,580
A strange threat. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

830
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:38,560
We know that you can get to us.

831
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,961
But now you know that we can get to you.

832
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:44,961
I'm giving you one
last chance to call this off.

833
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:50,221
Mr. Sö... My employer has made up
his mind. He does not change it.

834
01:09:50,321 --> 01:09:51,891
Neither do we.

835
01:09:51,991 --> 01:09:56,851
You got Fenster, but you won't get all of
us before one of us gets through to you.

836
01:09:56,951 --> 01:10:01,041
I believe you, Mr. McManus.
I most sincerely do.

837
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:06,191
You would not have been chosen were
you not suitable, but it's not my decision.

838
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:08,901
Whatever you threaten
me with is ludicrous...

839
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:16,057
...in comparison to what will be done to me
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

840
01:10:21,062 --> 01:10:23,868
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

841
01:10:25,272 --> 01:10:27,907
I just wanted you to know that.

842
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:30,782
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

843
01:10:30,902 --> 01:10:33,723
I implore you, Mr. Keaton, believe me,

844
01:10:33,823 --> 01:10:37,308
Mr. Söze is very real and very determined.

845
01:10:37,322 --> 01:10:39,372
We'll see.

846
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:49,844
Before you do me in, Mr. McManus,

847
01:10:49,964 --> 01:10:55,744
you will let me finish my business
with Ms. Finneran first, won't you?

848
01:10:58,933 --> 01:11:01,314
What did you say?

849
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:03,134
Edie Finneran.

850
01:11:03,234 --> 01:11:08,114
She's upstairs in my office
for an extradition deposition.

851
01:11:09,114 --> 01:11:14,895
I requested she be put on the case
personally. She flew in yesterday.

852
01:11:15,824 --> 01:11:17,564
No matter.

853
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:19,705
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

854
01:11:24,335 --> 01:11:27,625
You're lyin'.
- Am I?

855
01:11:44,855 --> 01:11:50,426
Ms. Finneran's escort while she's here in
LA. Never leaves her side for a moment.

856
01:11:50,526 --> 01:11:54,861
I thought you'd be glad
to know she's in good hands.

857
01:11:58,037 --> 01:12:00,817
Now rest. The boat will
be ready for you on Friday.

858
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,486
If I see you or any of
your friends before then,

859
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:08,407
Ms. Finneran will find herself the victim
of a gruesome violation before she dies.

860
01:12:08,507 --> 01:12:11,367
As, indeed, will your father, Mr. Hockney,

861
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:15,217
and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

862
01:12:15,347 --> 01:12:19,342
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus's nephew David.

863
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:23,727
Do I make myself clear?

864
01:12:24,267 --> 01:12:29,678
We'll take care of the bodies downstairs.
We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.

865
01:12:29,777 --> 01:12:32,413
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

866
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:10,009
[sighing]

867
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:15,990
It's a logistical nightmare.
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

868
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:19,979
No tellin' how many more are below.
- Can we stealth these guys?

869
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,075
Nah. With all that coke,
they're gonna be ready.

870
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,449
Which brings me to
sunny point number two.

871
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:32,030
Even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

872
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:36,760
What if we wait for the money?
- Ten more men at least.

873
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:42,381
In my opinion it can't be done. Anybody
who goes in there is not comin' out alive.

874
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:45,341
I'm gonna wait for the money.
- [Hockney] Me, too.

875
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,091
Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

876
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,241
Me, too.

877
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:54,876
There's nothing that can't be done.

878
01:13:56,831 --> 01:14:01,591
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk into certain death.

to stop and answer you.

01:16:10,886 --> 01:16:15,562
I'm ready. McManus,
you better be set up in ten seconds.

890
01:16:17,227 --> 01:16:19,227
I'm ready.

891
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:22,147
I want you to stay here.

- Listen, if we fail, take the money and go.

- Find Edie, tell her what happened.

She knows people, she knows what to do.

895
01:16:33,077 --> 01:16:36,018
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

896

What if I...
- Just do what I say. Please.

897
01:16:43,668 --> 01:16:45,708
Tell her that...

898
01:16:48,758 --> 01:16:50,798

Why didn't you run?
- I froze up.

I thought about Fenster and
how he looked when we buried him.

928
01:22:40,742 --> 01:22:45,323

Two men from the Bureau identified him.
- What else?

His name was Arturro Marquez,
a smuggler from Argentina.

He was arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

- New York faxed a copy of his testimony.

He was a rat.
- Yeah, a big fucking rat.

Arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison,

01:30:34,661 --> 01:30:38,351
I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear.

978
01:30:38,451 --> 01:30:43,807
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun. He was your friend.

979
01:30:46,962 --> 01:30:50,632
Because I was afraid. OK?

980
01:30:50,962 --> 01:30:53,222
Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

981
01:30:54,802 --> 01:30:57,163
I knew it was Keyser Söze.
- But Keaton...

982
01:30:57,263 --> 01:31:02,193
It was Keyser Söze, Agent Kujan.
I mean, the devil himself.

983
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:05,538
How do you shoot the devil in the back?

984
01:31:09,402 --> 01:31:11,573
What if you miss?

985
01:31:15,863 --> 01:31:19,094
All right. Let's get back to the pier.

986
01:32:34,196 --> 01:32:36,246
[sirens]...

987
01:32:41,576 --> 01:32:44,897
Arturro Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

988
01:32:44,997 --> 01:32:47,907
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

989
01:32:48,007 --> 01:32:51,327
He swore out a statement
saying that he had seen...

990
01:32:51,427 --> 01:32:55,508
...and could positively identify
one Keyser Söze.

991
01:32:55,558 --> 01:32:59,207
It says in the report: 'He had
intimate knowledge of his businesses,

992
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:03,338
including but not exclusive
to drug-trafficking and murder.'

993
01:33:03,438 --> 01:33:05,048
I never heard of him.

994
01:33:05,148 --> 01:33:07,838
His people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

995
01:33:07,937 --> 01:33:11,558
Most likely the same Hungarians
Söze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

996
01:33:11,658 --> 01:33:13,718
The money wasn't there for dope.

997
01:33:13,818 --> 01:33:18,188
The Hungarians were gonna buy the one
guy that could incriminate Keyser Söze.

998
01:33:18,289 --> 01:33:20,729
I said I never heard of him.
- Keaton did.

999
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:25,779
Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition
adviser. She knew what he knew.

1000
01:33:25,879 --> 01:33:30,119
I don't under...
- There were no drugs. It was a hit.

1001
01:33:30,219 --> 01:33:34,949
A suicide mission to whack out the
one guy that could finger Keyser Söze.

1002
01:33:35,049 --> 01:33:39,879
So Söze put some thieves to it, men he
knew he could march into certain death.

1003
01:33:39,979 --> 01:33:43,549
You're saying Söze
sent us to kill someone?

1004
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:46,589
Keaton did. Verbal,
he left you behind for a reason.

1005
01:33:46,689 --> 01:33:48,730
Just do what I tell you.

1006
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:53,810
If you all knew Söze'd find you anywhere,
why did he give you the money to run?

1007
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:58,599
He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1008
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:01,359
A one-time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world...

1009
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:04,940
...finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple.

1010
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,380
No, sir. Why?

1011
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,951
Edie.
- I don't buy the reform story for a minute.

1012
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:16,201
Even if I did, I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1013
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,350
So why?

1014
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:22,015
Because he was my friend.

1015
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:24,461
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.

1016
01:34:24,561 --> 01:34:27,551
Keaton didn't have friends.
- What are you doin' here?

1017
01:34:27,651 --> 01:34:31,931
He saved you because
he wanted it that way. It was his will.

1018
01:34:32,031 --> 01:34:34,611
Keaton was Keyser Söze.
- No.

1019
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:38,231
The kind of man who could wrangle
men like Hockney and McManus.

1020
01:34:38,331 --> 01:34:43,481
The kind of man who could engineer
a line-up through all his contacts at NYPD.

1021
01:34:43,581 --> 01:34:47,746
The kind of man who
could've killed Edie Finneran.

1022
01:34:51,261 --> 01:34:57,552
She was found yesterday at a hotel
in Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head.

1023
01:35:00,972 --> 01:35:04,543
What do you think
about Keaton now, Verbal?

1024
01:35:04,853 --> 01:35:06,092
Edie?

1025
01:35:06,193 --> 01:35:10,173
He used all of you to get him on that boat.
He couldn't get on alone.

1026
01:35:10,273 --> 01:35:13,843
He had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

1027
01:35:13,943 --> 01:35:17,003
The one man that could identify him.

1028
01:35:17,033 --> 01:35:18,893
This is all bullshit.

1029
01:35:18,993 --> 01:35:21,118
You said you saw him die.

1030
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,983
Or did you? You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

1031
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:29,693
You said you heard the shot before the fire.

1032
01:35:29,793 --> 01:35:33,664
But you didn't see him die.
- I knew him. He would never...

1033
01:35:33,764 --> 01:35:37,584
He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to.

1034
01:35:37,684 --> 01:35:40,043
He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.

1035
01:35:40,143 --> 01:35:44,334
Where was the political pressure
coming from? It was Keaton.

1036
01:35:44,434 --> 01:35:46,294
Immunity was your reward.

1037
01:35:46,394 --> 01:35:48,254
But why me?

1038
01:35:48,354 --> 01:35:53,134
Why not Fenster, McManus or Hockney?
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?

1039
01:35:53,234 --> 01:35:57,144
Because you're a cripple, Verbal.
Because you're stupid.

1040
01:35:57,245 --> 01:35:59,965
Because you're weaker than them.

1041
01:36:03,455 --> 01:36:07,375
If he's dead, if what you say is true,

1042
01:36:07,505 --> 01:36:09,545
then it won't matter.

1043
01:36:10,635 --> 01:36:14,995
It was his idea to hit the taxi service
in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.

1044
01:36:15,095 --> 01:36:18,095
It was all Keaton.

1045
01:36:18,226 --> 01:36:21,201
We followed him from the beginning.

1046
01:36:22,435 --> 01:36:26,526
I didn't know. I saw him die.

1047
01:36:26,646 --> 01:36:30,315
I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ.

1048
01:36:31,066 --> 01:36:33,526
You're not safe on your own.

1049
01:36:36,906 --> 01:36:39,786
You think he's...
- Keyser Söze?

1050
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:42,706
I don't know, Verbal.

1051
01:36:43,787 --> 01:36:48,547
Keyser Söze's a shield.
Or, like you said, a spook story.

1052
01:36:48,876 --> 01:36:53,197
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1053
01:36:53,297 --> 01:36:56,827
Stay and let us protect you.
- No way. I'm not bait. I post today.

1054
01:36:56,926 --> 01:36:58,787
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1055
01:36:58,887 --> 01:37:02,497
Captain Leo wants you out of here ASAP,
unless you turn state's.

1056
01:37:02,597 --> 01:37:04,337
I'll take my chances.

1057
01:37:04,437 --> 01:37:08,257
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1058
01:37:08,357 --> 01:37:11,758
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1059
01:37:11,858 --> 01:37:13,908
Maybe so.

1060
01:37:14,657 --> 01:37:17,292
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1061
01:37:33,338 --> 01:37:35,388
Fuckin' cops.

1062
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:02,600
Excuse me. Can I use your fax machine?

1063
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:09,275
You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.

1064
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,890
One watch, gold.
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1065
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,371
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1066
01:38:18,471 --> 01:38:20,750
We've still got nothing, Dave.

1067
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:23,210
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

1068
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:25,170
Which is nothing.

1069
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:29,265
No matter. He'll have
to know how close we came.

1070
01:38:29,481 --> 01:38:32,340
[Rabin] Keyser Söze or no Keyser Söze,

1071
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:35,681
if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.

1072
01:38:35,781 --> 01:38:37,911
[Kujan] I'll find him.

1073
01:38:38,031 --> 01:38:40,081
[Rabin] Waste of time.

1074
01:38:42,202 --> 01:38:45,152
[Kujan] A rumour's not
a rumour that doesn't die.

1075
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:48,252
[Rabin] What?
- Nothin'.

1076
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:55,382
Man, you're a slob.
- Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.

1077
01:38:55,552 --> 01:39:01,122
It all makes sense when you look at
it right. You gotta stand back from it.

1078
01:39:01,222 --> 01:39:06,153
You wanna see a real horror show,
you should see my garage.

1079
01:39:41,513 --> 01:39:43,563
[Kujan] Convince me.

1080
01:39:43,683 --> 01:39:47,884
When I was in that barbershop quartet in
Skokie. Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

1081
01:39:47,984 --> 01:39:51,804
[Keaton] We need to think back.
- [Kobayashi] You've heard many tales.

1082
01:39:51,904 --> 01:39:54,935
[McManus] Bricks Marlin.
- [Kujan] I wanna hear your story.

1083
01:39:55,034 --> 01:39:59,525
[Verbal] It's all there. Some guy
in California, his name is Redfoot.

1084
01:39:59,624 --> 01:40:03,275
[Kobayashi] A gift from Mr. Söze.
- [Keaton] What about Redfoot?

1085
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:08,275
[Kobayashi] Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
- [Verbal] Big, fat guy. I mean, orca fat.

1086
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:11,004
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.

1087
01:40:12,294 --> 01:40:15,616
When I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we'd make fresh coffee.

1088
01:40:15,715 --> 01:40:21,085
[Kujan] You thought he was a good man.
- [Verbal] I know he was good.

1089
01:40:21,185 --> 01:40:25,585
[Kujan] Tell me every last detail.
- [Verbal] How do you shoot the devil?

1090
01:40:25,685 --> 01:40:31,216
[Rabin] He's protected by the Prince of...
- [Hockney] What's your story?

1091
01:40:31,315 --> 01:40:33,515
There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer, Verbal?

1092
01:40:33,615 --> 01:40:36,476
I am Mr. Kobayashi.
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.

1093
01:40:36,576 --> 01:40:39,646
Tell me every last detail.
- I work for Keyser Söze.

1094
01:40:39,746 --> 01:40:42,126
Convince me. Convince me.

1095
01:40:56,967 --> 01:41:02,167
Every creep that works the street for a
living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1096
01:41:02,267 --> 01:41:03,917
The cripple, did you see him?

1097
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:07,047
The cripple. Which way did he go?
- That way.

1098
01:41:07,147 --> 01:41:09,637
[Kujan] I know you know something.

1099
01:41:09,737 --> 01:41:13,428
I'm smarter than you and
I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

1100
01:41:13,528 --> 01:41:17,898
To a cop, the explanation's simple.
- You know what I'm gettin' at. The truth.

1101
01:41:17,997 --> 01:41:22,188
...no arch criminal behind it all.
- [Keaton] Somebody with power.

1102
01:41:22,288 --> 01:41:25,898
[Kovash in Hungarian] Keyser Söze.
- Who's Keyser Söze?

1103
01:41:25,998 --> 01:41:31,828
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

1104
01:41:31,928 --> 01:41:35,038
Because you're stupid, Verbal.
Because you're a cripple.

1105
01:41:35,138 --> 01:41:38,619
Who's the gimp?
- You've known the whole fuckin' time.

1106
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,749
Who's Keyser Söze?
- Who's Keyser Söze?

1107
01:41:41,849 --> 01:41:46,549
[Verbal] I'm sure Keaton is dead.
- [Keaton] I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1108
01:41:46,649 --> 01:41:50,139
[Kujan] First thing I learnt on the job
was how to spot a murderer.

1109
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:54,259
[Baer] They tell me you got the cripple
from New York. He mention Keyser Söze?

1110
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:55,469
[Kujan] Who?

1111
01:41:55,570 --> 01:42:01,264
[Verbal] After that... my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

1112
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:28,156
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1113
01:42:28,651 --> 01:42:30,941
And like that...

1114
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:33,111
...he's gone.
