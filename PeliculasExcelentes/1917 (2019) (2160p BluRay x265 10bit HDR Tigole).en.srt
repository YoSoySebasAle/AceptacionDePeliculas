1
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:32,019
Blake.

2
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:35,165
Blake.

3
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,000
Sorry, Sarge.

4
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,036
Pick a man.

5
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,838
Bring your kit.

6
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:42,795
Yes, Sarge.

7
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,762
Don't dawdle.

8
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,121
No, Sarge.

9
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:18,075
Did they feed us?

10
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,767
No. Just mail.

11
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:24,715
Time for some tea!

12
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,207
Tea's up!

13
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:43,090
Myrtle's having puppies.

14
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:47,204
You get anything?

15
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:50,040
No.

16
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:53,110
Oh, I'm bloody starving.
Aren't you?

17
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:56,113
Thought we might get
some decent grub out here.

18
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:59,106
It was the only reason I
decided against the priesthood.

19
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:06,123
What you got there?

20
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:07,958
Ham and bread.

21
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:10,093
Where did you find that?

22
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,129
I have my uses.

23
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:14,186
Here.

24
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:20,137
Ugh.

25
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,105
Tastes like old shoe.

26
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:23,541
Cheer up.

27
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:26,810
This time next week,
it'll be chicken dinner.

28
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,046
Not me.

29
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,114
My leave got canceled.

30
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:33,250
They say why?

31
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:36,119
No idea.

32
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:39,178
It's easier
not to go back at all.

33
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,017
Coming through.

34
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,867
Something's up.

35
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:54,271
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

36
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:57,841
Has to be the push, right?

37
00:03:57,865 --> 00:04:00,244
Ten bob says we're going up.

38
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:02,379
I'm not taking that bet.

39
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:04,281
Why? 'Cause you know I'm right?

40
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:06,439
No. Because you haven't
got ten bob.

41
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:13,824
In your own time, gentlemen.

42
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:15,158
Is there any news, Sarge?

43
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,261
- News of what?
- The big push.

44
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:18,895
It was supposed to happen
weeks ago.

45
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,598
They told us we'd be home
by Christmas.

46
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:22,366
Yes, well, sorry to
disrupt your crowded schedule,

47
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,901
Blake, but the brass hats
didn't fancy it in the snow.

48
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,069
More's the pity, Sarge.

49
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,237
I could've done with
some turkey.

50
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:28,839
Well, I'll make sure

51
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:30,974
to relay your displeasure
to command.

52
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:32,610
So what's on
the cards, then, Sergeant?

53
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,177
The Hun are up to something.

54
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:35,912
Any idea what?

55
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:38,873
No. But it's
about to ruin our weekend.

56
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,291
Now, listen.

57
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:51,094
Erinmore is inside,
so tidy yourselves up.

58
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:52,396
Never know.

59
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,999
Might be mentions in dispatches
for this one.

60
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:57,958
If you don't bugger it up.

61
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:03,230
Must be something big
if the general's here.

62
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:16,043
Lance Corporals
Blake and Schofield, sir.

63
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:20,090
Which one of you is Blake?

64
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:21,925
Sir.

65
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,062
You have a brother,
a lieutenant in the 2nd Devons?

66
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:26,129
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:28,198
- Joseph Blake. Is he...
- Alive.

68
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:30,233
As far as I know.

69
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:33,203
And with your help,
I'd like to keep it that way.

70
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,105
Sanders tells me
you're good with maps.

71
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:36,507
That true?

72
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,076
Good enough, sir.

73
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,079
So...

74
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:45,015
we are here.

75
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,318
The 2nd Devons
are advancing here.

76
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,443
How long will it take you
to get there?

77
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:53,323
I don't understand, sir.

78
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:55,258
Sir, that land
is held by the Germans.

79
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:57,394
Germans have gone.

80
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,329
Don't get your hopes up.

81
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:02,999
It appears to be
a strategic withdrawal.

82
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,535
They seem to have
created a new line,

83
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,337
nine miles back here
by the looks of it.

84
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:10,941
Colonel Mackenzie
is in command of the 2nd.

85
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:12,275
He sent word yesterday morning

86
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:15,312
he was going after
the retreating Germans.

87
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:17,515
He is convinced
he has them on the run.

88
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,383
That if he can
break their lines now,

89
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:22,285
he will turn the tide.

90
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,054
He is wrong.

91
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:27,057
Colonel Mackenzie
has not seen these aerials

92
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,426
of the enemy's new line.

93
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,317
Come around here, gentlemen.

94
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:35,365
Three miles deep,
field fortifications, defenses,

95
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:39,169
artillery the like of which
we've never seen before.

96
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:41,071
The 2nd are due
to attack the line

97
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:43,273
shortly after dawn tomorrow.

98
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,443
They have no idea
what they're in for.

99
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,277
And we can't warn them.

100
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:51,314
As a parting gift, the enemy
cut all our telephone lines.

101
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:54,384
Your orders are to get
to the 2nd at Croisilles Wood,

102
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:58,054
one mile southeast
of the town of Écoust.

103
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:00,056
Deliver this
to Colonel Mackenzie.

104
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,461
It is a direct order to call
off tomorrow morning's attack.

105
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:06,363
If you don't,
it will be a massacre.

106
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,298
We will lose two battalions...

107
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:11,602
1,600 men,
your brother among them.

108
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:14,070
You think you can
get there in time?

109
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:15,105
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,373
Any questions?

111
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,241
- No, sir.
- Good.

112
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,100
Over to you, Lieutenant.

113
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:25,282
Supplies, gentlemen.

114
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:30,220
Map, torches, grenades, and,
uh, a couple of little treats.

115
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:31,589
Leave immediately.

116
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:34,057
Take this trench west
up on Sauchiehall Street,

117
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,226
then northwest on
Paradise Alley at the front.

118
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,196
Continue along the front line
until you find the Yorks.

119
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,031
Give this note
to Major Stevenson.

120
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,366
He's holding the line at the
shortest span of no-man's-land.

121
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,368
You'll cross there.

122
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,070
It'll be daylight, sir.
They'll see us.

123
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:48,406
There's no need to be concerned.

124
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,397
You should meet no resistance.

125
00:07:57,104 --> 00:08:00,383
Sir, is... is it just us?

126
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,587
"Down to Gehenna
or up to the Throne,

127
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:05,823
He travels the fastest
who travels alone."

128
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:07,257
Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?

129
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,016
Yes, sir, I would.

130
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:12,419
Good luck.

131
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,475
Blake, let's talk about this
for a minute.

132
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,466
Why?

133
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,042
Blake.

134
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,159
We just need to think about it.

135
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,327
There's nothing to think about.

136
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,463
It's my big brother.

137
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,297
We should at least
wait until it's dark.

138
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,699
Erinmore said
to leave immediately.

139
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:51,167
Erinmore's
never seen no-man's-land.

140
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:52,870
We won't make it ten yards.

141
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:54,872
- If we just wait...
- You heard him.

142
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,874
He said the Boche have gone.

143
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:59,364
Is that why he gave us grenades?

144
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,074
Oy.

145
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,254
Watch where you're going.

146
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:12,545
Sorry.

147
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:23,634
All I'm saying is that we wait.

148
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:27,227
Yes, you would say that, 'cause
it's not your brother, is it?

149
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:31,709
Look, the last time I was told
the Germans were gone,

150
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,344
it didn't end well.

151
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,571
You don't know, Blake.
You weren't there.

152
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:41,519
Excuse me. Excuse me.

153
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:43,110
Excuse me.

154
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:49,427
You're going up the
down trench, you bloody idiot.

155
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:51,385
Orders of the general, sir.

156
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:06,510
All right.
Say the Boche have gone.

157
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,512
Nine miles will take us,
what, six hours?

158
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,246
Eight at the very most.

159
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,248
So we've got time to wait
until the sun sets.

160
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:13,684
- It's enemy territory.
- Otherwise, we'll be wide open.

161
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,553
We've got no idea
what we're walking into.

162
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:18,254
Blake, if we're not
clever about this,

163
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:20,625
no one will get to your brother.

164
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,416
I will.

165
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:26,554
We're here.
This is the front line.

166
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:31,223
Now we need to find the Yorks.

167
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:17,548
- Sorry, mate.
- Jesus!

168
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:18,549
Watch who you're shoving.

169
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:20,316
All right,
get out of the way, then.

170
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,585
Hey, who the fuck
do you think you are,

171
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:22,586
pushing wounded soldiers
around?!

172
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,854
Let go! Let go of me!

173
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:25,456
Arsehole knocked down
our sergeant!

174
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,457
The man's fucking wounded!

175
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,459
All right, I'm sorry.
All right? I'm sorry!

176
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:29,660
- We're on commission.
- Just let me through.

177
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:33,329
- Orders from the general.
- Just let me through.

178
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:36,266
Get out of the way.

179
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,535
Fine.

180
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,357
Just watch where you're going.

181
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:57,779
Yorks.

182
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,668
It's bloody quiet.

183
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:13,404
Was it like this
before Thiepval?

184
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,371
Don't remember.

185
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,340
You don't remember the Somme?

186
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:18,676
- Not really.
- Hey, mind us.

187
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,400
Come on.

188
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:24,582
Well, you did all right
out of it.

189
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,917
At least wear your ribbon.

190
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,520
Don't have it anymore.

191
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:31,889
What? You lost your medal?

192
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:34,592
Heads down, boys.

193
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:37,417
Come on, lads. Keep digging.

194
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,524
Stay low.

195
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:50,708
For God's sake. Careful there.

196
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:52,543
You're stepping on the dead.

197
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,411
That's our sergeant.

198
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,714
Be better washing them out of
this dugout with a bloody hose.

199
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:58,516
Do you know where the Yorks are?

200
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,450
The next bend,

201
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:01,351
you'll be standing
on top of half of them.

202
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,909
Shot to hell two nights ago.

203
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,698
- Yorks?
- Yes, Corp.

204
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:16,534
Where's Major Stevenson?

205
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:19,570
He was killed,
couple of nights ago, Corporal.

206
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,572
Lieutenant Leslie has command.

207
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:23,474
Where can we find him?

208
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,498
Next dugout.

209
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:33,741
Here.

210
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,558
Sir?

211
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:42,760
- Lieutenant Leslie, sir?
- What is it?

212
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,662
We have a message
from General Erinmore.

213
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,530
- Are you our relief?
- No, sir.

214
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,566
Well, when the fucking hell
are they due?

215
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,968
We don't know, sir, but we've
got orders to cross here.

216
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:52,770
That is the German front line.

217
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:54,471
We know, sir.

218
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:56,464
If you'll just take the letter.

219
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,911
Settle a bet.
What day is it?

220
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:02,813
- Friday.
- Friday. Well, well, well.

221
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:03,981
None of us was right.

222
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:05,783
This idiot thought
it was Tuesday.

223
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,552
Sorry, sir.

224
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:10,754
Are they out of
their fucking minds?

225
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:13,824
One slow night, the brass think
the Hun have just gone home.

226
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:16,760
Do you think they're wrong, sir?

227
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:19,029
We lost an officer
and three men two nights ago.

228
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,898
They were shot to bits
patching up wire.

229
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,801
We dragged two of them
back here. Needn't bothered.

230
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:26,971
Sir, the general is sure
the enemy have withdrawn.

231
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,772
There are aerials
of the new line that...

232
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:29,940
Shut up.
We fought and died

233
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:31,775
over every inch
of this fucking place.

234
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,444
Now they suddenly give us miles?

235
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,402
It's a trap.

236
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:40,217
But chin up. There's a medal
in it, for sure.

237
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:43,410
Nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow.

238
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:47,546
All right.

239
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:51,729
Where's the nearest
way through, sir?

240
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:54,765
Our wire's a mess, but there is
a path through of sorts.

241
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:56,923
Rushworth, let him look.

242
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:03,941
Straight ahead to the left,
past the dead horses.

243
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:06,810
There's a gap
directly behind them.

244
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,780
Useful, because if it's dark,
you follow the stench.

245
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:11,682
When you get to the second wire,

246
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,684
look out for the bowing chap.

247
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,719
There's a small break
just beside him.

248
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:19,023
The German line is
150-odd yards after that.

249
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,859
Watch out for the craters;
they're deeper than they look.

250
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:23,961
You fall in,
there's no getting out.

251
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:25,053
This way.

252
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,832
Wake up, Kilgour.

253
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:30,100
Bloody waste of space.

254
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:32,503
Any cover, sir?
Anywhere to jump off from?

255
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,672
No, the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago.

256
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:35,940
It was full of bodies anyway.

257
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:38,666
Your best bet
is to pop over here.

258
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:44,648
If you do get shot, try to
make it back to the wire.

259
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,583
We won't come after you,
not till it's dark.

260
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:49,620
And if by some fucking miracle
you do make it,

261
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,754
send up a flare.

262
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:52,790
Don't have any, sir.

263
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:54,925
Well, get him one, Kilgour.
Make yourself useful.

264
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:56,549
Yes, sir.

265
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,098
Through this holy unction,

266
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:02,800
may the Lord
pardon you your faults

267
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:04,892
and whatever sins
thou has committed.

268
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,974
I do hate losing these
to the Hun,

269
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:12,576
so when they start
shooting at you,

270
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,645
could you be so kind
as to throw it back?

271
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,037
There's a good chap.

272
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,007
Cheerio.

273
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:29,960
You sure?

274
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,886
Yes.

275
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,794
Age before beauty.

276
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,169
You all right?

277
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:32,106
Look for cover.

278
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:55,696
Sap trench.

279
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,850
Stay still.

280
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:35,906
They're ours.

281
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,032
Keep going. We're halfway.

282
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,365
There's a gap, in the wire.

283
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:44,426
Sco.

284
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:10,182
There. That's the front line.

285
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:37,387
Fuck me.

286
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,113
They really have gone.

287
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:03,213
Your hand all right?

288
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:06,484
Put it through an effing German.

289
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:08,251
Patch it up.

290
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:11,456
You'll be wanking again
in no time.

291
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,414
Wrong hand.

292
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,344
They're not long gone.

293
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:10,070
No good.

294
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,137
Blocked.

295
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:36,096
This might be a way through.

296
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:53,080
Jesus.

297
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:03,634
Look at this.

298
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:05,359
It's massive.

299
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:10,264
They built all this.

300
00:26:56,544 --> 00:26:58,388
Here's our way through.

301
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:00,691
Sco.

302
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:02,347
How about this?

303
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:08,556
Bloody hell.

304
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,428
Even their rats
are bigger than ours.

305
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:23,447
What do you think's in the bags?

306
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:25,440
You cannot be that hungry.

307
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:35,392
Look at him,
cocky little bastard.

308
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,293
You could eat this, though.

309
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:39,554
- What is it?
- Boche dog meat.

310
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,558
What's in the other boxes?

311
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:48,673
- What's wrong?
- Trip wire.

312
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:50,841
Don't move.

313
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:52,634
Where is it?

314
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:56,638
Goes from here to the door.

315
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:00,584
Oh, Jesus!

316
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:02,209
Oh, no.

317
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:13,553
Sco!

318
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:21,627
Sco?

319
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:26,766
Sco!

320
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,403
Sco! Sco.

321
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:41,346
Sco! Sco.

322
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:44,729
Sco.

323
00:28:44,753 --> 00:28:47,531
Sco! Wake up!

324
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:48,721
Wake up!

325
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:52,625
Sco! Sco!

326
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,373
Stand up! Stand up!

327
00:28:57,397 --> 00:28:59,910
Come on. Stand up!

328
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:03,481
Up! Up! Up!

329
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:04,782
Come on!

330
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:07,473
Stand up!

331
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:11,889
The whole thing's coming down!

332
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:13,746
Come on.

333
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:20,753
You keep hold of me!

334
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:35,713
We need to keep moving!

335
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:37,114
Come on!

336
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:40,383
I can't see. I can't see!

337
00:29:40,407 --> 00:29:42,419
Oh! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

338
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:43,621
Stop!

339
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:45,856
It's a mine shaft!

340
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,925
Right, we'll have to jump.

341
00:29:47,949 --> 00:29:49,316
Come on!

342
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:53,631
You're going to have to jump.

343
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,398
- Just jump!
- I can't.

344
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:57,635
- I can't see!
- You need to trust me.

345
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,560
Jump!

346
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:08,503
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go!

347
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:13,940
Light. There's light.

348
00:30:25,587 --> 00:30:28,532
Stop. Stop.

349
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:29,822
Just let me stand.

350
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,896
Dirty bastards!

351
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,503
Careful. They may have
left other traps.

352
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,548
Jesus.

353
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:05,769
Dust.

354
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:07,860
So much dust in my eyes.

355
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,215
Here.

356
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,407
Have some of mine.

357
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,859
I wish I'd shot that rat now.

358
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:31,862
I wish you picked
some other bloody idiot.

359
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:35,466
- What?
- Why in God's name did you have to choose me?

360
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,601
Well, I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

361
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,003
No, you didn't.

362
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,729
You never know.
That's your problem.

363
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,611
All right, then, go back.

364
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:48,812
Nothing's stopping you.

365
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:51,782
- You can go all the way bloody home if you want.
- Don't.

366
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:54,752
Just don't.

367
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:56,954
I-I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

368
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:59,657
I thought they were going to
send us back up the line

369
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:02,026
or for food or something.

370
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,695
I thought it was going to be
something easy.

371
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:07,264
All right?

372
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:09,457
I never thought
it would be this.

373
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:17,665
So do you want to go back?

374
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,671
Just fire the fucking flare.

375
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,021
Up yours, Lieutenant.

376
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:58,506
Do you know where we are?

377
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:03,954
Écoust is directly southeast.

378
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:08,549
And if we keep that bearing,
we should make it.

379
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,020
Come on, then.

380
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,657
Look at that.

381
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:43,627
They destroyed their own guns.

382
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:46,830
They destroyed
their own trenches, too.

383
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:48,766
What do you mean?

384
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,068
I think they wanted us
to go that way.

385
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:53,061
They wanted to bury us.

386
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:02,603
You bastard rats.

387
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:10,954
Hey.

388
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:13,190
Did you hear that story
about Wilko?

389
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:16,060
- How he lost his ear.
- I'm not in the mood.

390
00:34:16,084 --> 00:34:17,828
Keep your eyes on the trees.

391
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:19,821
Top of the ridge.

392
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,625
Bet he told you it was shrapnel.

393
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,806
What was it, then?

394
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,876
Well, you know his girl's
a hairdresser, right?

395
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,212
And he was moaning about
the lack of bathing facilities

396
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:37,415
when he wrote to her.

397
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:39,149
Remember those
rancid jakes at Arras?

398
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:40,784
Yeah.

399
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:45,089
Anyway, she sends him over
this hair oil.

400
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:48,116
Smells sweet.
Like Golden Syrup.

401
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:53,063
Wilko loves the smell,

402
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:56,733
but he doesn't want
to cart it around in his pack.

403
00:34:56,757 --> 00:35:02,206
So he slathers it all over
his barnet, goes to sleep.

404
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,075
And in the middle of the night,
he wakes up,

405
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,979
and a rat is sitting
on his shoulder,

406
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:11,281
licking the oil off his head.

407
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:14,118
Wilko panics, and he jumps up.

408
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:17,821
And when he does, the rat bites
clean through his fucking ear

409
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,890
- and runs off with it.
- No.

410
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:22,092
Oh, he made a hell of a fuss...

411
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:24,728
yelling, screaming.

412
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:28,065
The best of it was he put
so much bloody oil on himself

413
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,800
that he couldn't wash it off.

414
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:31,068
He was like a magnet.

415
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:32,803
The rats left us alone,

416
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:34,738
but they couldn't get
enough of him.

417
00:35:34,762 --> 00:35:36,762
Poor bastard.

418
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:45,782
Heading back home.

419
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:49,253
I wonder what they saw.

420
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,212
Watch the ridgelines.

421
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:59,062
Well, that's your medal
sorted, then.

422
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,064
What do you mean?

423
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:03,033
"Lance Corporal Blake
showed unusual valor

424
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:05,736
rescuing a comrade
from certain death."

425
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,506
Blah, blah, blah.

426
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,741
You reckon?

427
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:12,099
I do.

428
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:16,213
Well, that'd be nice.

429
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:18,081
Since you lost yours.

430
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:21,051
I didn't lose mine.

431
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:22,920
What happened to it, then?

432
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:25,880
- Why do you care?
- Why do you not?

433
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:30,160
I swapped it
with a French captain.

434
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:32,162
- Swapped it?
- Mm-hmm.

435
00:36:32,186 --> 00:36:33,897
For what?

436
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:36,033
Bottle of wine.

437
00:36:36,057 --> 00:36:37,935
Well, what did you do that for?

438
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,160
I was thirsty.

439
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:42,863
What a waste.

440
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:46,843
You should've
taken it home with you.

441
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,337
You should've given it
to your family.

442
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,284
Men have died for that.

443
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:56,554
If I got a medal,
I'd take it back home.

444
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:58,088
Why didn't you just
take it home?

445
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:00,190
Look, it's just
a bit of bloody tin.

446
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:02,025
It doesn't make you special.

447
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:05,028
Doesn't make
any difference to anyone.

448
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:07,064
Yes, it does.

449
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:08,966
And it's not just a bit of tin.

450
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,192
It's got a ribbon on it.

451
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:17,274
I hated going home.

452
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:19,166
I hated it.

453
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:24,047
When I knew I couldn't stay,

454
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:27,041
when I knew I had to leave
and they might never see...

455
00:37:58,072 --> 00:37:59,307
Jesus.

456
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,211
They chopped them all down.

457
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:09,817
Cherries.

458
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:14,989
Lamberts.

459
00:38:18,092 --> 00:38:20,137
They might be dukes.

460
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:23,073
Hard to tell
when they aren't in fruit.

461
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,342
What's the difference?

462
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:28,211
Well, people think
there's one type.

463
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:29,880
But there's lots of them.

464
00:38:29,904 --> 00:38:32,149
Cuthberts, Queen Annes,
Montmorencys,

465
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:34,051
sweet ones, sour ones.

466
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:36,421
Why on earth
would you know this?

467
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:39,089
Mum's got an orchard back home.

468
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:41,426
Only a few trees.

469
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,895
This time of year, it looks
like it's been snowing.

470
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:47,498
Blossom everywhere.

471
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:51,101
And then in May,
we have to pick them.

472
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,360
Me and Joe.

473
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:56,940
Takes the whole day.

474
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:59,309
So these ones are all goners?

475
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,044
Oh, no.

476
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:03,380
They'll grow again
when the stones rot.

477
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:05,339
You'll end up with
more trees than before.

478
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:13,023
It looks abandoned.

479
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:15,258
Let's hope so.

480
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:17,151
We have to make sure.

481
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,520
I'll take front. You take back.

482
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:36,206
Anything?

483
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,965
Nothing.

484
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:58,453
- Did you find any food?
- No.

485
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:02,256
I don't like this place.

486
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:13,538
Map says get over that ridge,

487
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:17,173
and it's a straight shot
to Écoust.

488
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:18,667
Good.

489
00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:05,221
Is that our friends again?

490
00:43:05,245 --> 00:43:07,525
Looks like it.

491
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:10,327
Dogfight.

492
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:12,362
Who's winning?

493
00:43:12,386 --> 00:43:14,498
Us, I think.

494
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:16,256
Two on one.

495
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:21,463
They got him.

496
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:20,798
We should put him
out of his misery.

497
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,757
No. Get him some water.
He needs water.

498
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:27,303
It's all right.
It's all right. Steady.

499
00:44:27,327 --> 00:44:30,297
- St-Steady. Stay still.
<i>- Nein.</i>

500
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:40,718
Stop. Stop!

501
00:44:40,742 --> 00:44:42,675
No, no, no!

502
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:48,559
No!

503
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,315
You bastard!

504
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:53,653
You bloody bastard.

505
00:44:57,058 --> 00:44:58,469
Oh.

506
00:44:58,493 --> 00:44:59,704
- Oh, God, no.
- Oh.

507
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:01,326
My God, no!

508
00:45:02,697 --> 00:45:05,443
Jes... Jesus, no!

509
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:07,343
- Oh, Je...
- We have to stop the bleeding.

510
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:09,480
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

511
00:45:09,504 --> 00:45:11,482
It's all right. It's all right.
It's going to be all right.

512
00:45:11,506 --> 00:45:12,683
Ow.

513
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:14,552
We're going to stand up.

514
00:45:14,576 --> 00:45:16,454
- Yes. Yes.
- Right?

515
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:18,412
Okay.

516
00:45:20,615 --> 00:45:22,426
No! I can't. I can't.

517
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,495
Ow!

518
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,630
- We have to get to an aid post.
- I can't!

519
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:28,331
I'll carry you.
It isn't very far.

520
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:29,700
Just bring a doctor here.

521
00:45:29,724 --> 00:45:31,657
We can't.
We have to go together.

522
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:36,429
We're going to get up.
We're going to get up.

523
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:44,314
Stop.

524
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:45,783
Please stop!

525
00:45:45,807 --> 00:45:47,084
Put me down!

526
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:48,652
Put me down, you bastard!

527
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:50,710
Please! Put me down!

528
00:46:01,388 --> 00:46:02,933
You have to try to keep moving.

529
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:04,635
Let's just sit.

530
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:06,504
- Let me sit.
- No, we can't.

531
00:46:06,528 --> 00:46:08,439
We have to find the 2nd,
remember?

532
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:09,807
Your brother.
We have to go now.

533
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:11,742
You can start on without me.
I'll catch up.

534
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:12,743
No.

535
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,712
You can't stay here.

536
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:16,847
We have to move.
All right?

537
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:18,482
We have to move.

538
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:20,383
Come on. Come on!

539
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:22,419
Come on.

540
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:24,354
That's it. Come on.

541
00:46:24,378 --> 00:46:27,747
Come on. Come on.

542
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:33,430
Your brother.

543
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:35,454
We have to find your brother.

544
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:40,704
You'll recognize him.

545
00:46:40,728 --> 00:46:42,673
He looks like me.

546
00:46:42,697 --> 00:46:45,164
And he's a bit older.

547
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:59,747
What are they?

548
00:47:01,816 --> 00:47:04,795
Are we being shelled?

549
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:06,430
They're embers.

550
00:47:06,454 --> 00:47:08,388
The barn is on fire.

551
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:13,828
I've been hit.

552
00:47:15,897 --> 00:47:18,609
What was it?

553
00:47:18,633 --> 00:47:20,367
You were stabbed.

554
00:47:25,807 --> 00:47:27,775
Am I dying?

555
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:38,896
Yes.

556
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,855
Yes, I think you are.

557
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:48,594
Oh. No. No.

558
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,216
This?

559
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,873
Inside.

560
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:28,012
Will you write to my mum for me?

561
00:48:28,036 --> 00:48:29,737
I will.

562
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:34,573
Tell her I wasn't scared.

563
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,279
Anything else?

564
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,918
I love them.

565
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:47,755
I wish that...

566
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:51,759
I wish that...

567
00:48:57,298 --> 00:48:58,866
Talk to me.

568
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:03,037
Tell me you know the way.

569
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:09,620
I know the way.

570
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:12,990
I'm going to head southeast
until I hit Écoust.

571
00:49:13,014 --> 00:49:15,960
I'll pass through the town
and out to the east,

572
00:49:15,984 --> 00:49:18,662
all the way to Croisilles Wood.

573
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:21,131
It'll be dark by then.

574
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:23,767
That won't bother me.

575
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:25,769
I'll find the 2nd,

576
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:27,838
I'll give them the message,

577
00:49:27,862 --> 00:49:30,107
and then I'll find your brother.

578
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:31,909
Just like you.

579
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:33,901
A little older.

580
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:39,002
You all right, mate?

581
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:41,939
Hey, it's all right.
It's okay.

582
00:51:41,963 --> 00:51:43,798
Come on, help him.

583
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:57,020
Jesus. What happened to him?

584
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:58,755
Was it the plane?

585
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:00,982
- We saw the smoke.
- Yeah.

586
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:19,877
Go and fetch his things.

587
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:21,736
- Sir.
- Sir.

588
00:52:25,173 --> 00:52:26,874
A friend?

589
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,922
What are you doing here?

590
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:34,758
I have an urgent message
for the 2nd Devons.

591
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:37,161
Orders to stop
tomorrow morning's attack.

592
00:52:37,185 --> 00:52:39,062
And where are they stationed?

593
00:52:39,086 --> 00:52:41,499
Just beyond Écoust.

594
00:52:41,523 --> 00:52:43,090
Come with me.

595
00:52:49,197 --> 00:52:51,942
Come with me, Corporal.
It's an order.

596
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:53,076
We're passing through Écoust.

597
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,036
We can take you some of the way.

598
00:52:56,971 --> 00:52:58,172
Sir.

599
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:24,942
Oh, come on, Sergeant!

600
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:27,211
Put more men on the base.

601
00:53:27,235 --> 00:53:30,047
At the trunk.
It'll be heavier there.

602
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:31,915
Might be a tight squeeze.

603
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:34,251
No, you're not going
to be able to just lift it.

604
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:36,853
Pivot the front end to the left.

605
00:53:36,877 --> 00:53:39,156
Jesus, they don't
make things easy, do they?

606
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,992
They could at least have
retreated with a bit of grace.

607
00:53:42,016 --> 00:53:43,093
Bastards!

608
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:44,861
Sir.

609
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:46,863
- You're not one of mine.
- No, sir.

610
00:53:46,887 --> 00:53:49,333
He has an urgent message to
deliver to the 2nd Devons, sir.

611
00:53:49,357 --> 00:53:50,934
Can you get past it?

612
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:52,403
- No, sir.
- Oh, for God's sake.

613
00:53:52,427 --> 00:53:54,871
Just move it!

614
00:53:54,895 --> 00:53:57,374
There's room
in the casuals' truck, sir.

615
00:53:57,398 --> 00:53:59,876
- He has orders.
- Yes, yes, all right.

616
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,901
Come on, now. You can
get through there sideways.

617
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:09,119
How did you get here, sir?

618
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:12,889
Crossed no-man's-land,
just outside Bapaume.

619
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:14,358
Took us the whole night.

620
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:16,860
Bumped into a couple of
Hun stragglers on the way

621
00:54:16,884 --> 00:54:19,062
who made a nuisance
of themselves.

622
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:20,897
You're going up to the new line?

623
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:22,366
Attempting to.

624
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,101
The Newfoundlands
have pushed forwards

625
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:26,060
and requested reinforcements.

626
00:54:28,129 --> 00:54:31,174
I'm sorry about your friend.

627
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:34,035
May I tell you something
that you probably already know?

628
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:39,049
It doesn't do to dwell on it.

629
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:41,018
No, sir.

630
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:42,308
Hop on.

631
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:45,980
Make some space there.

632
00:54:47,948 --> 00:54:50,015
Come on, in you get.

633
00:55:05,966 --> 00:55:08,836
All right.
Here we go again, boys.

634
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:14,842
Welcome aboard the night bus
to fuck-knows-where.

635
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:21,325
Is that a dead dog?

636
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:23,349
- You got a fag?
- Yeah. There you go.

637
00:55:40,034 --> 00:55:41,378
- Butler.
- Oy.

638
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:44,181
- Carry on with that story.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

639
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:48,318
So, when we get off the train,
Beaufoy comes up to us,

640
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:50,987
and he's having a right go.

641
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:52,956
"Lance Corporal,
whatever one does,

642
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,425
one never lets standards slip."

643
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:56,293
Then Scott comes
out the latrine.

644
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:59,062
He wipes his hand on the back
of Beaufoy's jacket.

645
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:01,331
Shit all down his back.

646
00:56:01,355 --> 00:56:03,033
Was that meant to be
Captain Beaufoy?

647
00:56:03,057 --> 00:56:06,103
Oh, piss off, you.
You can't do any better.

648
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:07,705
"Men, your rifle stocks are

649
00:56:07,729 --> 00:56:10,273
an embarrassment to the entire
Expeditionary Force."

650
00:56:10,297 --> 00:56:11,542
- Nah.
- No.

651
00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:13,343
You're both bloody awful.

652
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:16,012
You don't know. You barely even
speak the bloody language.

653
00:56:16,036 --> 00:56:18,014
He's got a better grasp
of it than you, Cooke.

654
00:56:18,038 --> 00:56:20,238
Well, go on, then, Jondalar.
Give it a go. Let's see it.

655
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:26,089
"Rossi! Never in my 200 years
as a soldier

656
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:28,526
have I seen such a sorry excuse
for a latrine pit."

657
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,293
Shite.

658
00:56:30,317 --> 00:56:32,497
That is total shit.

659
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:34,532
Oy. Could've taken
my teeth out with that.

660
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:36,491
You could do with a new set.

661
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,564
You got somewhere
you need to be?

662
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,333
- No.
- Arsehole needs driving lessons.

663
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:07,397
- He should reverse.
- Yeah.

664
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:09,467
Try it in reverse.

665
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,223
Reverse!

666
00:57:18,365 --> 00:57:19,410
No. Stop.

667
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:21,244
Stop!

668
00:57:21,268 --> 00:57:23,514
- Everyone needs to get out.
- Who the fuck is he?

669
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:26,417
All out!

670
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,051
- Come on!
- All right.

671
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:31,054
All right,
keep your bloody hair on.

672
00:57:31,078 --> 00:57:32,457
Right.

673
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:35,314
One, two, three!

674
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:44,267
We need to get some wood,
put it under the wheels.

675
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,470
No, we haven't got the time.

676
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:47,505
We all need to push.
Come on.

677
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,094
Come on!

678
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:57,615
Please. I have to go now.

679
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:00,518
Please.

680
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,252
All right, come on, lads.

681
00:58:02,276 --> 00:58:03,253
Come on.

682
00:58:03,277 --> 00:58:04,354
Come on, boys.

683
00:58:04,378 --> 00:58:07,379
One, two, three.

684
00:58:18,392 --> 00:58:20,538
Come on, boys!
One last push, yeah?!

685
00:58:20,562 --> 00:58:23,362
One, two, three!

686
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:37,254
Back in.

687
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:38,623
Get back in.

688
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:40,558
Go.

689
00:58:40,582 --> 00:58:42,627
Are you all right?

690
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:44,394
Here, driver, how about you try

691
00:58:44,418 --> 00:58:46,564
to keep it on the bloody road
for a change?

692
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:48,320
Oh, piss off.

693
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:10,287
So, where are you going?

694
00:59:10,311 --> 00:59:14,124
I have to get to the
2nd Devons, just past Écoust.

695
00:59:14,148 --> 00:59:16,293
Why?

696
00:59:16,317 --> 00:59:17,895
They're attacking at dawn.

697
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:19,597
I have orders to stop them.

698
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:22,232
How come?

699
00:59:22,256 --> 00:59:24,200
They're walking into a trap.

700
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:26,202
How many?

701
00:59:26,226 --> 00:59:27,405
Sixteen hundred.

702
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:29,372
Ooh.

703
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:31,098
Jesus.

704
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:36,246
Why did they send you
on your own?

705
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,648
They didn't.

706
00:59:37,672 --> 00:59:40,383
There were two of us.

707
00:59:40,407 --> 00:59:42,553
So now it's down to you?

708
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:45,221
Yes.

709
00:59:45,245 --> 00:59:47,181
You'll never make it.

710
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:52,587
Yes, I will.

711
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
Thank you.

712
01:00:02,697 --> 01:00:04,642
Look at it.

713
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:07,445
Fucking look at it.

714
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:10,313
Three years fighting over this.

715
01:00:10,337 --> 01:00:13,283
We should've just let
the bastards keep it.

716
01:00:13,307 --> 01:00:15,218
I mean, who machine-guns cows?

717
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:17,455
Huns with extra bullets.

718
01:00:17,479 --> 01:00:19,523
Bastards.

719
01:00:19,547 --> 01:00:21,358
Clever.

720
01:00:21,382 --> 01:00:25,663
They know if they don't shoot
the cow, you will eat it.

721
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:27,364
Still bastards.

722
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:29,767
Yeah, it's not even
our bloody country.

723
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,702
How long gone
do you reckon they are?

724
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:33,236
Why?

725
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,605
Worried we'll catch up
with them?

726
01:00:34,629 --> 01:00:36,239
Yeah.

727
01:00:36,263 --> 01:00:38,442
Right. Be a bloody miracle
at this rate.

728
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:40,678
Yeah, they're probably
right round the next corner.

729
01:00:40,702 --> 01:00:43,514
Piss off. No, they're not.

730
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:46,216
Why don't they just
bloody well give up?

731
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,819
Eh? Don't they want to go home?

732
01:00:48,843 --> 01:00:51,287
They hate
their wives and mothers.

733
01:00:51,311 --> 01:00:53,311
And Germany must be a shithole.

734
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:56,661
They're retreating.

735
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:58,496
They're miles back.

736
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,297
Got 'em on the ropes, at least.

737
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:04,691
No. We don't.

738
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,304
Oh, bollocks.
What's up now?

739
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:09,840
Not another bloody tree.

740
01:01:09,864 --> 01:01:11,442
Bridge is down.

741
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:13,678
Oh. That's a shame.

742
01:01:13,702 --> 01:01:15,713
Looks like I'll be
getting out here.

743
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:17,615
Good luck.

744
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:19,450
Keep some of that luck
for yourself, pal.

745
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:21,317
- Think you'll be needing it.
- Good luck, mate.

746
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:22,586
- Good luck.
- Good luck, gov.

747
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,722
- Good luck.
- Don't balls it up.

748
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:27,625
I hope you get there.

749
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:29,349
Thank you.

750
01:01:32,587 --> 01:01:34,364
The next bridge is six miles.

751
01:01:34,388 --> 01:01:35,733
We'll have to divert.

752
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:37,435
I can't, sir.

753
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:39,369
I don't have the time.

754
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:42,372
Of course.

755
01:01:42,396 --> 01:01:44,442
Best of luck.

756
01:01:44,466 --> 01:01:45,800
Thank you, sir.

757
01:01:49,403 --> 01:01:51,415
Corporal?

758
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:55,351
If you do manage to get
to Colonel Mackenzie,

759
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,822
make sure there are witnesses.

760
01:01:57,846 --> 01:01:59,523
They are direct orders, sir.

761
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:01,792
I know.

762
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:04,450
But some men
just want the fight.

763
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:08,388
Thank you, sir.

764
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,395

No. Just me.

O-Only me.

775
01:13:29,069 --> 01:13:32,048
I need to be somewhere.

776
01:13:32,072 --> 01:13:35,075
I need to find a wood
to the southeast.

777
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:39,022
Uh, trees.

778
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:40,948

Who is her mother?

790
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:39,169
I have food.

flags or fire the signal flares

A Company will advance.

887
01:34:18,687 --> 01:34:20,831
B Company will then move
to the front line.

called off the attack.

We're about to go over.

- You don't.

894
01:34:31,466 --> 01:34:32,576
Please don't send your men over.

895
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,844
Get out of the way, Corporal!

901
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:45,723
- Yes, sir!
- Two Mills bombs per man.

NCOs collect flares
and signal flags.

903
01:34:48,348 --> 01:34:50,317

- Oy. Oy!

We will advance
on the first whistle blast.

906
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,377
- 11 and 12...
- not slow down.

907
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,680
The man next to you falls,
keep moving.

908
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,716
Your orders are
to break the lines.

909
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,349
Where is the captain?

910
01:35:13,373 --> 01:35:15,385
He's over there.

911
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:16,654
Keep in your section formation.

912
01:35:16,678 --> 01:35:18,622
Sir! Sir!

913
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:21,892
Captain, I have a message.

914
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,894
This attack is called off.

915
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:26,488
You have to stop.
You have to stop!

916
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:32,368
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?

917
01:35:32,392 --> 01:35:34,361
Where is Mackenzie?!

918
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:03,333
Get back! Back!

919
01:36:03,357 --> 01:36:05,102
Return to your sections! Back!

920
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:06,670
Hold fast!

921
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:08,806
Seven Platoon, one minute!

922
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:12,409
Sir, I have orders
to stop this attack!

923
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:13,444
What?

924
01:36:13,468 --> 01:36:15,679
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?!

925
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,648
He's further up the line.

926
01:36:17,672 --> 01:36:19,416
- How far?
- 300 yards.

927
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,118
He's in a cut-and-cover.

928
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,821
You'll have to wait until
the first wave goes over.

929
01:36:23,845 --> 01:36:25,780
No. No, I can't.

930
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:36,858
Seven Platoon, 30 seconds!

931
01:36:48,837 --> 01:36:50,714
You can't possibly
make it that way, man.

932
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:52,674
Are you bloody insane?

933
01:36:56,678 --> 01:36:59,423
What the hell are you doing,
Lance Corporal?

934
01:36:59,447 --> 01:37:01,516
No. No, no, no, no!

935
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:05,789
Into position!

936
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:07,524
Get ready!

937
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,784
- Colonel Mackenzie.
- He's in there.

938
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:13,864
- Two minutes!
- Let me through!

939
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,666
Hey. Hey!

940
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:17,468
- Let me through!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

941
01:38:17,492 --> 01:38:18,636
I have to get through!

942
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,004
I have to see Colonel Mackenzie.

943
01:38:20,028 --> 01:38:21,739
- What are you doing?
- I have to stop this attack.

944
01:38:21,763 --> 01:38:22,973
Colonel, we've seen flares.

945
01:38:22,997 --> 01:38:25,542
The men on the left flank have
made it to the German line.

946
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,678
- Colonel! Colonel!
- Hold him. Hold him.

947
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:29,914
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I have a letter.

948
01:38:29,938 --> 01:38:31,749
I need to see Colonel Mackenzie!

949
01:38:31,773 --> 01:38:33,684
There's no bloody way
you're getting in there, mate.

950
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:34,818
Sergeant, send the next wave.

951
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:36,487
No!

952
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:38,589
Second wave, prepare yourselves!

953
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:40,591
- Colonel Mackenzie!
- Concentrate everything there.

954
01:38:40,615 --> 01:38:42,693
This attack is not to go ahead!

955
01:38:42,717 --> 01:38:45,696
You have been ordered to stop.
You have to stop.

956
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,564
Who the hell are you?

957
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,833
Lance Corporal Schofield,
sir, 8th.

958
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:51,568
I have orders from
General Erinmore

959
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:52,703
to call off this attack.

960
01:38:52,727 --> 01:38:54,071
You're too late, Lance Corporal.

961
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,106
Sir, these orders
are from army command.

962
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,708
You have to read them.

963
01:38:57,732 --> 01:38:59,510
Shall we hold back
the second wave, sir?

964
01:38:59,534 --> 01:39:00,811
No, Major.
Hesitate now, and we lose.

965
01:39:00,835 --> 01:39:02,579
Victory's only 500 yards away.

966
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,515
Sir, please read the letter.

967
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:07,518
I have heard it all before.

968
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:09,586
I'm not going to wait
until dusk or for fog.

969
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:10,888
I'm not calling back my men

970
01:39:10,912 --> 01:39:12,556
only to send them
out there again tomorrow,

971
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,958
not when we've got
the bastards on the run.

972
01:39:13,982 --> 01:39:15,592
This is their last stand.

973
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:18,028
The Germans planned this, sir.

974
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:19,830
They've been planning it
for months.

975
01:39:19,854 --> 01:39:22,733
They want you to attack.

976
01:39:22,757 --> 01:39:24,692
Read the letter.

977
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,614
- Major?
- Yes, sir?

978
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:51,628
- Stand them down.
- Yes, sir.

979
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,764
Call up the
orderlies. Tend the wounded.

980
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:55,566
Hold the line
in case they counter.

981
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:57,001
Yes, sir.

982
01:39:57,025 --> 01:40:00,626
Stand down! Stand down!

983
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:03,696
Stand down!

984
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:09,035
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Stand down!

985
01:40:13,074 --> 01:40:15,676
I hoped today might be
a good day.

986
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:20,148
Hope is a dangerous thing.

987
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:23,761
That's it for now,
and then next week,

988
01:40:23,785 --> 01:40:26,797
command will send
a different message.

989
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:28,756
"Attack at dawn."

990
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,961
There is only one way
this war ends.

991
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:38,566
Last man standing.

992
01:40:43,838 --> 01:40:45,807
Have someone see to your wounds.

993
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,945
Now fuck off, Lance Corporal.

994
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:57,895
Bearers!

995
01:40:57,919 --> 01:41:00,864
Stretcher bearers!

996
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:02,633
Bearers!

997
01:41:02,657 --> 01:41:04,635
Stretcher bearers!

998
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:07,037
Well done, lad.

999
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:08,729
Thank you, sir.

1000
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:13,043
Do you know where
Lieutenant Blake is, sir?

1001
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,845
Blake?

1002
01:41:14,869 --> 01:41:16,747
There were two of us.

1003
01:41:16,771 --> 01:41:19,049
I was sent here
with his brother.

1004
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:21,118
Ah.

1005
01:41:21,142 --> 01:41:22,920
Well, knowing Lieutenant Blake,

1006
01:41:22,944 --> 01:41:24,855
he would have gone over
with his men.

1007
01:41:24,879 --> 01:41:27,991
He was in the first wave.

1008
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,860
How could I find him, sir?

1009
01:41:29,884 --> 01:41:32,062
You can try
the casualty clearing station

1010
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,932
behind the line.

1011
01:41:34,956 --> 01:41:36,657
Otherwise...

1012
01:41:39,727 --> 01:41:41,138
Thank you, sir.

1013
01:41:41,162 --> 01:41:43,162
Major Hepburn, sir.

1014
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,907
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Nearly there.

1015
01:42:03,718 --> 01:42:05,052
Ow!

1016
01:42:07,755 --> 01:42:08,823
Will I make it?

1017
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,960
Will I make it?

1018
01:42:17,165 --> 01:42:19,810
- Go the fuck up.
- Clear the way.

1019
01:42:19,834 --> 01:42:21,245
Come on, quickly.

1020
01:42:21,269 --> 01:42:23,247
Get a medic!

1021
01:42:23,271 --> 01:42:26,807
Medic! Medic!

1022
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:35,225
Just keep moving.

1023
01:42:35,249 --> 01:42:37,161
Keep moving, keep moving.

1024
01:42:37,185 --> 01:42:38,951
That's it.

1025
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:05,022
Sergeant, I have to find
Lieutenant Blake.

1026
01:43:05,046 --> 01:43:06,981
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

1027
01:43:11,786 --> 01:43:13,096
Make way for the stretchers!

1028
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,798
Minor injuries to the far field.

1029
01:43:14,822 --> 01:43:16,233
Stretchers to me.

1030
01:43:16,257 --> 01:43:18,835
Walking wounded
to the collection area.

1031
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,260
Move aside to let
the stretcher bearers through.

1032
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:27,768
- Move it.
- Clear the way.

1033
01:43:28,903 --> 01:43:31,048
Sir, is Lieutenant Blake here?

1034
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:33,317
No idea.

1035
01:43:33,341 --> 01:43:36,253
Move along, Corporal.

1036
01:43:36,277 --> 01:43:39,056
If you can walk,
move to the triage area.

1037
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,857
I can't move.

1038
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,083
Help me.

1039
01:43:44,852 --> 01:43:46,096
Let me go home.

1040
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,364
Lieutenant Blake!

1041
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,323
I need an M.O. over here.

1042
01:43:52,827 --> 01:43:54,204
Sir, he's out.

1043
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:57,007
Get him out of here, now.

1044
01:43:57,031 --> 01:44:00,077
Out of the bloody way.

1045
01:44:00,101 --> 01:44:02,212
Blake?!

1046
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:03,880
Out of the way!

1047
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:05,973
Has anyone seen
Lieutenant Blake?!

1048
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:08,986
He's hemorrhaging.
Go quickly.

1049
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:10,988
He needs a surgeon.

1050
01:44:11,012 --> 01:44:14,024
I want to be left here.

1051
01:44:14,048 --> 01:44:16,393
Tourniquet!

1052
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,295
- Don't look. It's okay.
- Amputation.

1053
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:20,219
Straight to surgery.

1054
01:44:22,056 --> 01:44:25,259
My leg! My leg.

1055
01:44:28,396 --> 01:44:30,307
I need some help here, quickly!

1056
01:44:30,331 --> 01:44:31,908
He's gone.

1057
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,177
I can't die.

1058
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:36,179
Don't let me fucking die.

1059
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:38,339
- I need something now!
- I need my mum.

1060
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:42,243
Coming through.

1061
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:58,302
All right, come on, boys.

1062
01:44:58,326 --> 01:45:00,203
He's taken one in the leg.

1063
01:45:00,227 --> 01:45:02,205
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Sir.

1064
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:03,641
Lieutenant Blake?

1065
01:45:03,665 --> 01:45:06,276
Yes?

1066
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,346
Do you need medical assistance?

1067
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,148
No, sir.

1068
01:45:11,172 --> 01:45:12,450
I'm from the 8th.

1069
01:45:12,474 --> 01:45:15,085
What the hell
are you doing here?

1070
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:16,953
I was sent here
to deliver a message.

1071
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,155
The 8th?

1072
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:20,924
You must know my brother.

1073
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:22,259
I was sent here with him.

1074
01:45:22,283 --> 01:45:24,251
Tom's here? Where is he?

1075
01:45:30,525 --> 01:45:32,461
It was very quick.

1076
01:45:34,529 --> 01:45:36,230
I'm sorry.

1077
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:02,199
What's your name?

1078
01:46:02,223 --> 01:46:04,158
Schofield, sir.

1079
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:09,072
I'm sorry, what?

1080
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:10,941
It's Schofield, sir.

1081
01:46:10,965 --> 01:46:13,377
William Schofield.

1082
01:46:13,401 --> 01:46:14,969
Will.

1083
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:18,382
Well, you need some food.

1084
01:46:18,406 --> 01:46:20,341
Get yourself to the mess tent.

1085
01:46:35,122 --> 01:46:40,003
If I may, I'd like
to write to your mother.

1086
01:46:40,027 --> 01:46:41,962
Tell her that Tom wasn't alone.

1087
01:46:44,599 --> 01:46:46,535
Of course.

1088
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,048
He was...

1089
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,941
He was a good man.

1090
01:46:55,777 --> 01:46:57,945
Always telling funny stories.

1091
01:47:00,482 --> 01:47:02,451
He saved my life.

1092
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:08,189
I am glad you were with him.

1093
01:47:14,228 --> 01:47:16,163
Thank you, Will.
