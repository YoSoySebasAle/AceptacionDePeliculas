1
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:35,813
First, my contours.

2
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:40,382
The outline.

3
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:49,753
Not too fast.

4
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:57,835
Take time to look at me.

5
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,334
See how my arms are placed.

6
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,740
My hands.

7
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,919
Who brought that painting out?

8
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,397
From the stock.
I shouldn't have?

9
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:37,186
No.

10
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,170
Did you paint it?

11
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,655
Yes.

12
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,039
A long time ago.

13
00:02:58,354 --> 00:02:59,653
What's the title?

14
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,028
<i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire.</i>

15
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:16,506
Where do I go?

16
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,542
Head straight up to the trees.

17
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,078
I'm Marianne.

18
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,287
It was a reception room.

19
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,285
I've never seen it used.

20
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,552
Have you been here long?

21
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:32,020
Three years.

22
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,315
Do you like it here?

23
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,213
Yes.

24
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:45,857
I'll let you get dry.

25
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:41,151
Sorry, I helped myself.

26
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,379
I was hungry.

27
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,485
Is there any wine?

28
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:48,993
Yes.

29
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:09,563
May I be curious?

30
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:21,103
What is your young mistress like?

31
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,528
I don't know her well.

32
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,863
You've been here three years.

33
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,611
She only arrived a few weeks ago.

34
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:35,197
Where from?

35
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,224
The Benedictines.

36
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:41,451
Has she left holy orders?

37
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:45,477
They brought her home.

38
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:51,211
Her sister died.

39
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,628
She was the only one due to marry?

40
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,189
Did disease take her?

41
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,075
No.

42
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,469
Will you manage it?

43
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,734
Manage what?

44
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,392
To paint her.

45
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:22,390
Why do you ask?

46
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,488
Another painter was here.

47
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,823
He wasn't able to.

48
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:31,531
What happened?

49
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:37,764
I don't know.

50
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:33,079
I'm afraid it's the only one.

51
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:42,709
She has no dresses yet
and wears her convent clothes.

52
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,645
She has blond hair?

53
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,134
Yes.

54
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,768
This will do.

55
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,847
Do you recognize it?

56
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,394
My father painted it.

57
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,229
One of his first.

58
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:16,905
It was Milan, before my marriage.

59
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,735
My daughter's suitor is Milanese.

60
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:29,552
We'll go there if he likes the portrait.

61
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:31,141
You'll leave.

62
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,928
I have to tell you...

63
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,784
She wore out one painter before you.

64
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:42,200
In a very simple manner:
she refused to pose.

65
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:44,877
He never saw her face.

66
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,495
Why won't she be painted?

67
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,163
She refuses this marriage.

68
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:56,715
You must paint her without her knowing.

69
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:01,291
She thinks you're a companion
for walks.

70
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,728
She's delighted.

71
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:06,775
Since she arrived, I don't let her out.

72
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,093
Why not?

73
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,958
I wasn't wary enough with her sister.

74
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,822
She thinks I'll watch over her.

75
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,159
And you, observe her.

76
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,964
Is painting her that way feasible?

77
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,272
More than being a companion.

78
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,806
The portrait arrived here before me.

79
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:42,370
When I first entered this room,

80
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,896
I found myself facing my image
hanging on the wall.

81
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:48,793
She was waiting for me.

82
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:22,170
She's waiting to go out.

83
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,537
Come in.

84
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,511
Tell me, what happened to your mistress?

85
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:32,489
How did she die?

86
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:36,875
We were walking by the cliffs.

87
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,322
She was behind me and vanished.

88
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:42,100
I saw her broken body below.

89
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,166
Did you see her fall?

90
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,494
No.

91
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:48,873
I think she jumped.

92
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,759
Why do you think that?

93
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,424
She didn't cry out.

94
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:22,619
I've dreamt of that for years.

95
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:26,245
Dying?

96
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,483
Running.

97
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:41,770
One must show the ear
and study its cartilage closely,

98
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,637
even if covered with hair.

99
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:48,833
It must be
of a warm and transparent hue,

100
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:52,069
except for the hole,
which is always strong.

101
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:57,224
Its tone, even in light,
must yield to the cheek,

102
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:00,461
which is more prominent.

103
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:04,337
Did you bring a book?

104
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,214
Yes.

105
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,652
May I borrow it?

106
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,699
I'll fetch it.

107
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:55,346
Thank you.

108
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:58,283
It's odd you sleep here.

109
00:25:13,338 --> 00:25:14,637
Miss...

110
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:16,745
Miss!

111
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:21,000
She's waiting.

112
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:37,524
Is she downstairs?

113
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,702
I must cover you up.

114
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,540
It's windy.

115
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:13,098
I'd like to bathe.

116
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:21,979
On a calmer day.

117
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:23,847
Yes.

118
00:27:27,823 --> 00:27:29,152
How long will you stay?

119
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:31,290
Six more days.

120
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:39,272
Do you swim?

121
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:45,406
I don't know.

122
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:49,392
It's too dangerous if you don't.

123
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,038
I meant, I don't know if I can swim.

124
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:50,990
How was your day?

125
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:53,867
Difficult.

126
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:01,180
She always stays ahead of me

127
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,027
and walks alone on the beach.

128
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:09,002
Have you started painting?

129
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,839
Not yet.

130
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:14,796
I haven't even seen her smile.

131
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:18,153
Have you tried to be funny?

132
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,438
Is it unfinished?

133
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,613
My sister was embroidering it.

134
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,569
Do you think she wanted to die?

135
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:49,112
You're the first person
unafraid to ask that.

136
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,939
Apart from you?

137
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:56,375
Not out loud. But yes.

138
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,348
In her last letter, she apologized.

139
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,026
For no reason.

140
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:08,503
What could she be apologizing for?

141
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,506
For leaving me her fate.

142
00:31:16,504 --> 00:31:18,283
You make it sound terrible.

143
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:25,525
What do you know of my marriage?

144
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:30,730
You're to wed
a Milanese gentleman, that's all.

145
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,087
That's all I know too.

146
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:36,265
You see why it worries me.

147
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:41,080
Put that way, yes.

148
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:43,837
I put it the way it is.

149
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:49,154
You'd rather have stayed
in the convent?

150
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,949
It's a life that has advantages.

151
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,757
There's a library.

152
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:55,995
You can sing or hear music.

153
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:03,627
And equality is a pleasant feeling.

154
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:09,432
I found the convent unjust.

155
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,299
I left after my first communion.

156
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:15,825
They punished me
for drawing in my notebooks' margins.

157
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:17,993
You draw?

158
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,650
Yes. A little.

159
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:31,809
What about you?
When will you marry?

160
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:36,864
I don't know if I will.

161
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:39,282
- You don't have to?
- No.

162
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,917
I'll take over my father's business.

163
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:57,114
You can choose.
That's why you don't understand me.

164
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,118
I understand you.

165
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,303
How are your days?

166
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,879
We return late
and I have little light to work.

167
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,564
I'll keep here here tomorrow afternoon.

168
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,142
You'll be free to make progress.

169
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,637
Perhaps you could allow her
to go out alone.

170
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,962
Fear not. She isn't sad, but angry.

171
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,078
You think I don't know her anger?

172
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:36,754
I know it well.

173
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:38,962
Yes, I know it too.

174
00:33:42,518 --> 00:33:44,007
Where did you learn Italian?

175
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,155
In Milan.

176
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:48,003
You know Milan?

177
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:50,321
I can't wait to go back.

178
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,258
I haven't gone back in 20 years.

179
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:56,085
Tell her Milan is beautiful.

180
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,283
And that life will be sweeter.

181
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:00,960
She doesn't talk much to me.

182
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:05,116
I'm not marrying her
to the local gentry.

183
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,164
I'm trying

184
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,182
to take her elsewhere.

185
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,849
She'll be less bored there.

186
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,007
And you too.

187
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:15,575
Indeed. Why not?

188
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,969
I'll leave for the coast
at the same time as you.

189
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:25,186
If you don't have to return to Paris,

190
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:28,742
I have a friend
who'd like her portrait done.

191
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,919
Thank you.

192
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:33,797
It won't be easy.

193
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,843
My friend is particularly ugly.

194
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,219
She's very ugly.

195
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,839
You've made me laugh.

196
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:55,765
It's ages since that happened.

197
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:58,512
I didn't do anything.

198
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:01,070
You're here.

199
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,627
It takes two to be funny.

200
00:35:55,435 --> 00:35:56,734
Marianne?

201
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,257
Do you have tobacco?

202
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:45,945
Yes.

203
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:14,816
Your mother will let you
go out alone tomorrow.

204
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:17,903
You'll be free.

205
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,218
Being free is being alone?

206
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:25,945
You don't think so?

207
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:27,933
I'll tell you tomorrow.

208
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:35,915
I'll go to mass.

209
00:37:37,263 --> 00:37:38,642
To receive Communion?

210
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,770
I want to hear music.

211
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:44,136
Organ music is pretty but bleak.

212
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,105
It's all I know.

213
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:48,852
You've never heard an orchestra?

214
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:50,550
No.

215
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:52,908
Have you?

216
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:58,572
Tell me about it.

217
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:05,565
It's not easy to relate music.

218
00:38:55,395 --> 00:38:56,694
What is it?

219
00:38:57,673 --> 00:38:58,972
A piece that I love.

220
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,074
Is it merry?

221
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:09,911
Not merry, but it's lively.

222
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:27,523
It's about a coming storm.

223
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,646
The insects sense it.

224
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:40,960
They become agitated.

225
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,748
Then the storm brakes.

226
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,814
With lightning and the wind.

227
00:39:58,132 --> 00:39:59,621
I can't remember it...

228
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:08,981
You'll hear the rest.
Milan is a city of music.

229
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:15,195
Then I can't wait for Milan.

230
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,068
I'm saying there will be good things.

231
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,372
You're saying that, now and then,

232
00:40:29,811 --> 00:40:31,219
I'll be consoled.

233
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:19,151
How was mass?

234
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,467
You look cheerful.

235
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,965
I sang a lot.

236
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:27,763
Are you leaving me already?

237
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:29,441
Yes.

238
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:31,179
Will you come out tomorrow?

239
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:34,476
Yes.

240
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:38,682
In solitude,
I felt the liberty you spoke of.

241
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:44,975
But I also felt your absence.

242
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,279
The portrait is finished.

243
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:25,375
Are you happy with it?

244
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:28,771
I think so.

245
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:32,388
Let's go to see it.

246
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,848
May I ask a favour?

247
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:47,363
Go on.

248
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,077
I'd like to show her first.

249
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:56,704
And tell her the truth myself.

250
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:02,468
I understand.

251
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:04,995
She's very fond of you.

252
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:09,760
How do you know?

253
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:15,824
She talks about you.

254
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:13,477
Héloïse...

255
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,373
I must tell you something.

256
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,479
I'm a painter.

257
00:46:22,428 --> 00:46:23,726
I came here to paint you.

258
00:46:27,782 --> 00:46:29,431
I've finished your portrait.

259
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,299
I see now why you praised
the charms of exile.

260
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,366
You felt guilty.

261
00:46:55,385 --> 00:46:56,693
Are you leaving?

262
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,750
Later today. With your mother.

263
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,249
Then I shall bathe today.

264
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:35,584
Well, can you swim?

265
00:48:36,703 --> 00:48:38,222
I still don't know if I can.

266
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,859
Did you see me?

267
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:43,097
You can float.

268
00:48:52,987 --> 00:48:54,286
Let's go back.

269
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:05,514
It explains all your looks.

270
00:49:32,877 --> 00:49:34,176
You're saying nothing?

271
00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:40,529
Is that me?

272
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:44,216
Yes.

273
00:49:46,703 --> 00:49:48,002
Is that how you see me?

274
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:54,995
It's not only me.

275
00:49:56,883 --> 00:49:58,391
What do you mean, not only you?

276
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,535
There are rules, conventions, ideas.

277
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,129
You mean there's no life?

278
00:50:12,587 --> 00:50:13,886
No presence?

279
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:19,231
Your presence is made up
of fleeting moments that may lack truth.

280
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:23,127
Not everything is fleeting.

281
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:27,872
Some feelings are deep.

282
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,056
The fact it isn't close to me,

283
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:36,613
that I can understand.

284
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,457
But I find it sad
it isn't close to you.

285
00:50:43,396 --> 00:50:46,124
How do you know
it isn't close to me?

286
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,030
I didn't know you were an art critic.

287
00:50:51,408 --> 00:50:52,837
I didn't know you were a painter.

288
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,109
I'll fetch my mother.

289
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:47,782
It wasn't good enough. I'll start again.

290
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:51,598
You're joking.

291
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:55,354
I'm sorry.

292
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:57,682
It wasn't satisfactory.

293
00:51:58,341 --> 00:51:59,740
You're incompetent then.

294
00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:01,598
You can leave.

295
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,986
She's staying.

296
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:07,962
I'll pose for her.

297
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,318
Really?

298
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:14,216
Yes.

299
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:24,915
Why?

300
00:52:28,951 --> 00:52:30,259
What does it change for you?

301
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:36,623
Nothing.

302
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:42,497
I'll be away five days.

303
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:45,005
When I return, it will be finished.

304
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,002
And I decide, not you.

305
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:50,889
Understood?

306
00:52:56,803 --> 00:52:58,861
Say goodbye like when you were little.

307
00:53:34,265 --> 00:53:35,564
Sit down.

308
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:48,561
Turn your chest towards me.

309
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:52,457
A little more.

310
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:57,622
Turn your head slightly.

311
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:12,367
Rest your arm here.

312
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:16,163
Not like that. May I?

313
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,649
Take your hand.

314
00:54:21,848 --> 00:54:23,146
The other way.

315
00:54:24,215 --> 00:54:25,514
Like this.

316
00:54:35,864 --> 00:54:37,562
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

317
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:40,179
Can you hold this position?

318
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:41,688
Yes.

319
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:49,390
Look at me.

320
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:05,924
The heat will do you good.

321
00:56:06,923 --> 00:56:08,331
The cherrystones hold it in.

322
00:56:22,577 --> 00:56:23,876
Thank you.

323
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,438
I usually have one ready,

324
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:33,606
but I haven't had my monthlies.

325
00:56:37,672 --> 00:56:38,971
More than once?

326
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,088
Three times.

327
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:46,363
Is this the first time?

328
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:47,971
Yes.

329
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:52,027
Do you want a child?

330
00:56:52,217 --> 00:56:53,516
No.

331
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:57,132
I was waiting for Madam to leave
to see to it.

332
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:22,047
I can't.

333
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:23,426
A little more.

334
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,965
I can't go on.

335
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,145
No.

336
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,703
It mustn't be in flower.

337
00:58:55,774 --> 00:58:57,072
It's ready.

338
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:23,885
Will it be enough?

339
00:59:24,045 --> 00:59:25,344
We'll see.

340
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:52,507
Has it happened to you?

341
00:59:57,772 --> 00:59:59,070
Yes.

342
01:00:01,758 --> 01:00:03,126
You've known love.

343
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:07,981
Yes.

344
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:11,598
What is it like?

345
01:00:14,135 --> 01:00:15,594
It's hard to say.

346
01:00:17,222 --> 01:00:18,800
I mean, how does it feel?

347
01:04:02,816 --> 01:04:04,365
I can't make you smile.

348
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:09,030
I feel I do it
and then it vanishes.

349
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,624
Anger always comes to the fore.

350
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:16,802
Definitely with you.

351
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:23,336
I didn't mean to hurt you.

352
01:04:24,804 --> 01:04:26,103
You haven't hurt me.

353
01:04:26,503 --> 01:04:27,801
I have, I can tell.

354
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:30,409
When you're moved,
you do this with your hand.

355
01:04:32,207 --> 01:04:33,425
Really?

356
01:04:33,505 --> 01:04:34,804
Yes.

357
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:39,699
And when you're embarrassed,

358
01:04:41,707 --> 01:04:43,006
you bite your lips.

359
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,290
And when you're annoyed,

360
01:04:51,797 --> 01:04:53,096
you don't blink.

361
01:04:53,855 --> 01:04:55,154
You know it all.

362
01:04:56,572 --> 01:04:58,700
Forgive me,
I'd hate to be in your place.

363
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:02,766
We're in the same place.

364
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:05,124
Exactly the same place.

365
01:05:07,481 --> 01:05:08,780
Come here.

366
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:12,337
Come.

367
01:05:21,098 --> 01:05:22,397
Step closer.

368
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,508
Look.

369
01:05:33,465 --> 01:05:34,764
If you look at me,

370
01:05:35,653 --> 01:05:36,952
who do I look at?

371
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:44,564
When you don't know what to say,
you touch your forehead.

372
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,127
When you lose control,
you raise your eyebrows.

373
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:01,158
And when you're troubled,

374
01:06:02,636 --> 01:06:03,935
you breathe through your mouth.

375
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,837
- I didn't touch!
- I win.

376
01:07:01,997 --> 01:07:03,296
I win.

377
01:07:03,595 --> 01:07:04,884
You touched it.

378
01:07:04,964 --> 01:07:06,442
Try to concentrate.

379
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,468
Your turn.

380
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:17,401
You're cheating.

381
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:19,589
I'm not cheating, I play fast.

382
01:07:23,076 --> 01:07:24,294
Go on.

383
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,673
Two.

384
01:07:25,983 --> 01:07:27,391
- Two cards.
- Two.

385
01:07:27,591 --> 01:07:28,890
Two sixes.

386
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:31,048
- I win.
- You win, yes.

387
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:39,140
Your turn.

388
01:07:39,459 --> 01:07:40,758
No, go on.

389
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:43,006
Go on.

390
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:03,415
Uncover your throat.

391
01:08:10,229 --> 01:08:11,527
More.

392
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:20,378
You have my future husband in mind.

393
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:29,869
Do you paint nude models too?

394
01:08:31,557 --> 01:08:33,166
Women, yes.

395
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:35,154
Why not men?

396
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:38,670
I'm not allowed to.

397
01:08:39,469 --> 01:08:40,768
Why not?

398
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,605
Because I'm a woman.

399
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,368
Is it a matter of modesty?

400
01:08:53,605 --> 01:08:56,722
It's mostly to prevent us
from doing great art.

401
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:03,515
Without any notion of male anatomy,
the major subjects escape us.

402
01:09:04,035 --> 01:09:05,333
How do you manage?

403
01:09:06,252 --> 01:09:07,611
I do it in secret.

404
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,979
It's tolerated.

405
01:09:14,924 --> 01:09:16,482
What do you tell your models

406
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:18,600
to amuse them?

407
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:21,797
- Are you bored?
- No.

408
01:09:22,436 --> 01:09:23,735
I'm interested in you.

409
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,337
Your complexion is remarkable today.

410
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,330
You're very elegant.

411
01:09:44,874 --> 01:09:46,192
You pose beautifully.

412
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:53,615
You're pretty.

413
01:10:01,857 --> 01:10:03,195
That's what I tell them.

414
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:17,301
Then, striking the lyre
to accompany his words, he sang,

415
01:11:17,651 --> 01:11:19,499
Oh, Gods of the Underworld

416
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,406
to which all mortals descend,

417
01:11:22,956 --> 01:11:25,163
I am here to seek my wife.

418
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:28,081
A viper that she trod on

419
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,068
poisoned her
and robbed her of her youth.

420
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:32,966
I beseech you,

421
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:36,892
unravel the thread
of Eurydice's early demise.

422
01:11:37,421 --> 01:11:38,920
All will be yours.

423
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,277
We all end up here.

424
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,645
This is our final abode.

425
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:45,973
You reign over the human race.

426
01:11:47,032 --> 01:11:51,237
After living out her fair span of years,

427
01:11:51,497 --> 01:11:52,826
she will be yours.

428
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:56,442
If the fates refuse my wife this favour,

429
01:11:56,632 --> 01:11:59,149
I am determined not to return.

430
01:11:59,799 --> 01:12:02,366
You may delight in both our deaths.

431
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:04,414
- He's convincing.
- Very.

432
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:06,302
I hope they say yes.

433
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,855
Then, for the first time,

434
01:12:14,005 --> 01:12:17,021
tears wet the cheeks of the Eumenides,

435
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:18,560
won over by his words.

436
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,128
Neither the king's bride,

437
01:12:20,218 --> 01:12:23,645
nor the ruler of Hades
could resist his prayer.

438
01:12:24,114 --> 01:12:25,603
They sent for Eurydice.

439
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:28,840
She was there, among the recent spirits,

440
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:31,717
and approached, limping from her wound.

441
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:35,153
She was returned to Orpheus on condition

442
01:12:35,233 --> 01:12:37,871
that he would not look back
until outside

443
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,829
or the favour would be void.

444
01:12:41,637 --> 01:12:46,092
In deep silence,
they took a sloping path,

445
01:12:46,392 --> 01:12:48,480
steep and dark,

446
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,278
shrouded in thick mist.

447
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:53,355
They were nearing the surface,

448
01:12:53,895 --> 01:12:56,322
approaching the threshold, when...

449
01:12:56,602 --> 01:12:59,769
fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,

450
01:13:00,068 --> 01:13:02,366
her loving spouse turned

451
01:13:02,556 --> 01:13:05,063
and she was instantly drawn back.

452
01:13:05,503 --> 01:13:07,651
She reached out for his embrace

453
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:09,129
and wished to hold him.

454
01:13:09,729 --> 01:13:12,576
Her poor hands
clutched only the empty air.

455
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:15,403
Dying a second time,

456
01:13:15,703 --> 01:13:17,241
she did not complain.

457
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,478
His sole fault was loving her.

458
01:13:20,748 --> 01:13:22,046
That's horrible.

459
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:24,344
Poor woman. Why did he turn?

460
01:13:24,824 --> 01:13:27,641
He was told not to but did,
for no reason.

461
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:28,870
There are reasons.

462
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,248
You think so?

463
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:31,837
Read it again.

464
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:36,112
They were nearing the surface,
approaching the threshold,

465
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:40,208
when, fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,

466
01:13:40,638 --> 01:13:42,326
her loving spouse turned.

467
01:13:42,716 --> 01:13:46,172
No, he can't look at her
for fear of losing her.

468
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,689
That's no reason.
He was told not to do that.

469
01:13:49,879 --> 01:13:52,256
He's madly in love. He can't resist.

470
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:54,654
I think Sophie has a point.

471
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:57,591
He could resist.
His reasons aren't serious.

472
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,859
Perhaps he makes a choice.

473
01:14:00,218 --> 01:14:01,517
What choice?

474
01:14:01,897 --> 01:14:06,092
He chooses the memory of her.
That's why he turns.

475
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,537
He doesn't make the lover's choice,
but the poet's.

476
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,947
She spoke a last farewell

477
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:23,875
that scarcely reached his ears

478
01:14:24,184 --> 01:14:26,222
and fell back into the abyss.

479
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:36,722
Perhaps she was the one
who said,

480
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,269
Turn around.

481
01:16:09,059 --> 01:16:12,786
She says I'm still pregnant
and to come back in two days.

482
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:14,923
I'll come with you.

483
01:21:31,896 --> 01:21:33,195
What about Héloïse?

484
01:21:33,934 --> 01:21:36,142
She isn't well. She doesn't want dinner.

485
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:31,626
I thought you had been scared off.

486
01:23:34,054 --> 01:23:35,362
You were right.

487
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:38,150
I am scared.

488
01:23:56,661 --> 01:24:00,188
Do all lovers feel
they're inventing something?

489
01:24:05,233 --> 01:24:06,641
I know the gestures.

490
01:24:09,099 --> 01:24:11,476
I imagined it all, waiting for you.

491
01:24:12,306 --> 01:24:13,604
You dreamt of me?

492
01:24:15,572 --> 01:24:16,871
No.

493
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,979
I thought of you.

494
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,068
You don't want to come anymore?

495
01:25:02,915 --> 01:25:04,214
I'm coming.

496
01:25:09,388 --> 01:25:10,687
Get up.

497
01:25:54,643 --> 01:25:55,942
Wait.

498
01:26:15,902 --> 01:26:17,200
That's good.

499
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,308
Lie down.

500
01:26:32,895 --> 01:26:34,223
Lift your legs.

501
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:37,141
There.

502
01:26:42,465 --> 01:26:43,764
Thank you.

503
01:26:51,866 --> 01:26:53,334
Deep breaths.

504
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:09,738
Look.

505
01:28:00,937 --> 01:28:02,235
Go to bed.

506
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,202
I'll watch over her.

507
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,178
I don't want to go to bed.

508
01:28:13,065 --> 01:28:14,363
Sophie?

509
01:28:15,302 --> 01:28:16,601
Are you asleep?

510
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:18,989
No.

511
01:28:20,277 --> 01:28:21,676
Can you get up?

512
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,049
Help her.

513
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,757
Get your things.

514
01:29:01,396 --> 01:29:02,725
We're going to paint.

515
01:29:05,952 --> 01:29:07,250
Sophie...

516
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:08,689
Come here.

517
01:29:09,308 --> 01:29:10,607
Sit down.

518
01:29:11,976 --> 01:29:13,274
Come closer.

519
01:29:15,872 --> 01:29:17,170
Lie down.

520
01:29:35,122 --> 01:29:36,421
Look at her.

521
01:29:38,559 --> 01:29:40,397
Arch your back a little.

522
01:29:45,142 --> 01:29:46,441
Sophie...

523
01:29:46,741 --> 01:29:48,059
Straighten your head.

524
01:29:51,596 --> 01:29:52,895
Yes.

525
01:30:54,183 --> 01:30:55,482
Stop that.

526
01:30:55,672 --> 01:30:56,970
What?

527
01:30:59,957 --> 01:31:01,286
What you're doing.

528
01:31:08,988 --> 01:31:10,287
Be serious.

529
01:31:20,877 --> 01:31:22,175
Keep still.

530
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:07,500
I bought it from a woman at the feast.

531
01:32:08,299 --> 01:32:09,598
It's a plant.

532
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:13,534
She said it makes you fly.

533
01:32:15,901 --> 01:32:17,230
Have you ever tried it?

534
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:19,298
Never.

535
01:32:21,276 --> 01:32:22,575
Do you want to?

536
01:32:23,034 --> 01:32:24,333
Now?

537
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:28,129
She said it makes time last longer.

538
01:33:26,161 --> 01:33:27,460
Your eyes.

539
01:34:18,868 --> 01:34:20,377
You have to drink.

540
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:36,401
This time, I like it.

541
01:35:38,818 --> 01:35:41,206
Perhaps because I know you better.

542
01:35:42,275 --> 01:35:43,943
Perhaps I've changed.

543
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:45,382
Perhaps.

544
01:35:53,594 --> 01:35:56,131
You didn't destroy the last one for me.

545
01:35:58,479 --> 01:35:59,907
You did it for you.

546
01:36:03,244 --> 01:36:05,512
I'd like to destroy this one too.

547
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,549
Why?

548
01:36:18,249 --> 01:36:20,237
Through it, I give you to another.

549
01:36:36,001 --> 01:36:37,430
It's terrible.

550
01:36:39,438 --> 01:36:41,825
Now you possess me a little,
you bear me a grudge.

551
01:36:43,154 --> 01:36:44,722
- I don't.
- You do.

552
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:47,669
You know you do.

553
01:36:51,915 --> 01:36:53,573
You're not on my side now.

554
01:36:53,843 --> 01:36:56,810
You blame me for what comes next.
My marriage.

555
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:58,738
You don't support me.

556
01:37:00,307 --> 01:37:01,675
You're right.

557
01:37:07,849 --> 01:37:09,248
Go on.

558
01:37:10,507 --> 01:37:12,345
Say what burdens your heart.

559
01:37:20,087 --> 01:37:22,145
I believed you braver.

560
01:37:22,225 --> 01:37:24,313
I believed you braver too.

561
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:28,469
That's it then.

562
01:37:29,657 --> 01:37:31,056
You find me docile.

563
01:37:32,275 --> 01:37:33,573
Worse...

564
01:37:34,832 --> 01:37:36,660
You imagine I'm collusive.

565
01:37:38,838 --> 01:37:40,257
You imagine my pleasure.

566
01:37:40,946 --> 01:37:42,874
It's a way of avoiding hope.

567
01:37:45,022 --> 01:37:49,178
Imagine me happy or unhappy
if that reassures you.

568
01:37:50,387 --> 01:37:52,534
But do not imagine me guilty.

569
01:37:55,601 --> 01:37:57,380
You'd prefer me to resist.

570
01:38:02,005 --> 01:38:03,304
Yes.

571
01:38:03,703 --> 01:38:05,531
Are you asking me to?

572
01:38:09,478 --> 01:38:10,776
Answer me.

573
01:38:12,405 --> 01:38:13,703
No.

574
01:38:47,559 --> 01:38:48,998
Have you seen Héloïse?

575
01:38:49,487 --> 01:38:52,075
No. She isn't in her room.

576
01:38:55,531 --> 01:38:56,920
We've had news.

577
01:38:59,318 --> 01:39:00,856
Madam returns tomorrow.

578
01:39:01,495 --> 01:39:02,794
Very well.

579
01:39:03,234 --> 01:39:04,672
Will you be ready?

580
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:08,369
Yes.

581
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:38,309
Forgive me.

582
01:39:44,263 --> 01:39:45,671
Forgive me.

583
01:39:57,929 --> 01:39:59,847
Your mother returns tomorrow.

584
01:41:03,883 --> 01:41:05,311
Come here.

585
01:41:05,681 --> 01:41:07,090
With me.

586
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:34,512
When do we know it's finished?

587
01:41:37,699 --> 01:41:39,268
At one point, we stop.

588
01:42:29,917 --> 01:42:31,285
Finished.

589
01:42:42,354 --> 01:42:43,653
Who is that for?

590
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:47,180
For me.

591
01:42:53,803 --> 01:42:56,320
You can reproduce that image
to infinity.

592
01:42:57,789 --> 01:42:59,088
Yes.

593
01:43:04,642 --> 01:43:06,101
After a while,

594
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:08,838
you'll see her

595
01:43:09,647 --> 01:43:10,996
when you think of me.

596
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:18,129
I'll have no image of you.

597
01:43:22,604 --> 01:43:24,512
Do you want an image of me?

598
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,589
Yes.

599
01:43:30,276 --> 01:43:31,575
Which one?

600
01:43:32,764 --> 01:43:34,063
That one.

601
01:43:40,656 --> 01:43:42,055
Give me your book.

602
01:43:45,481 --> 01:43:46,880
Give me a figure.

603
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:48,978
28.

604
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,074
Your eyes are closing.

605
01:44:49,127 --> 01:44:50,526
Don't go to sleep.

606
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:08,039
I feel something new.

607
01:45:10,876 --> 01:45:12,174
What?

608
01:45:14,382 --> 01:45:15,781
Regret.

609
01:45:20,286 --> 01:45:21,705
Don't regret.

610
01:45:25,071 --> 01:45:26,370
Remember.

611
01:45:35,311 --> 01:45:38,748
I'll remember when you fell asleep
in the kitchen.

612
01:45:43,403 --> 01:45:45,121
I'll remember...

613
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:48,718
your dark look

614
01:45:49,167 --> 01:45:51,265
when I beat you at cards.

615
01:45:58,388 --> 01:46:00,896
I'll remember
the first time you laughed.

616
01:46:02,514 --> 01:46:04,612
You took your time being funny.

617
01:46:05,321 --> 01:46:06,650
That's true.

618
01:46:07,189 --> 01:46:08,678
I wasted time.

619
01:46:10,466 --> 01:46:11,985
I wasted time too.

620
01:46:18,018 --> 01:46:21,545
I'll remember
the first time I wanted to kiss you.

621
01:46:25,321 --> 01:46:26,720
When was that?

622
01:46:28,268 --> 01:46:29,667
You didn't notice?

623
01:46:34,202 --> 01:46:36,100
At the feast around the bonfire.

624
01:46:38,518 --> 01:46:39,917
I wanted to, yes.

625
01:46:40,756 --> 01:46:42,764
But that wasn't the first time.

626
01:46:45,901 --> 01:46:47,269
Tell me.

627
01:46:48,478 --> 01:46:50,126
No, you tell me.

628
01:46:59,577 --> 01:47:01,915
When you asked if I had known love.

629
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,268
I could tell the answer was yes.

630
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:10,926
And that it was now.

631
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:18,278
I remember.

632
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:57,479
Good morning.

633
01:47:57,729 --> 01:47:59,027
Good morning.

634
01:48:14,202 --> 01:48:15,501
They're here.

635
01:48:58,558 --> 01:48:59,856
Very good.

636
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:08,578
For you.

637
01:49:09,836 --> 01:49:11,135
Thank you.

638
01:49:19,287 --> 01:49:20,596
Héloïse...

639
01:49:21,085 --> 01:49:22,484
Come with me.

640
01:49:24,182 --> 01:49:25,571
In a minute.

641
01:49:25,721 --> 01:49:27,209
No, now.

642
01:49:27,848 --> 01:49:29,457
I have a gift for you.

643
01:50:18,718 --> 01:50:20,236
I'll say goodbye here.

644
01:50:29,766 --> 01:50:31,065
Goodbye.

645
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,738
Have a safe journey.

646
01:51:33,513 --> 01:51:34,841
Turn around.

647
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:08,128
You've made me look so sad.

648
01:52:13,063 --> 01:52:14,392
You were.

649
01:52:15,631 --> 01:52:16,959
I'm not anymore.

650
01:52:26,689 --> 01:52:28,588
I saw her again a first time.

651
01:52:52,584 --> 01:52:54,042
Are you standing guard?

652
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:56,689
I'm observing reactions.

653
01:52:57,139 --> 01:52:58,538
Do you want mine?

654
01:52:58,877 --> 01:53:00,566
This Orpheus is excellent.

655
01:53:01,245 --> 01:53:02,863
Your father is in shape.

656
01:53:03,073 --> 01:53:05,970
It's my painting.
I submitted it in his name.

657
01:53:09,097 --> 01:53:11,804
Usually, he's portrayed before he turns

658
01:53:12,114 --> 01:53:14,432
or after, as Eurydice dies.

659
01:53:15,091 --> 01:53:17,768
Here, they seem to be saying goodbye.

660
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,168
I saw her one last time.

661
01:55:51,115 --> 01:55:52,883
She didn't see me.
