1
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,029
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

2
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,856
I better get back to the office.

3
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,034
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,597
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him

5
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,954
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,407
Friday anyway,
and hot.

7
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,670
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,998
Well, we could laze around here
a while longer.

9
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,710
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,181
Hotels of this sort aren't interested
in you when you come in,

11
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,300
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,932
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,791
I've heard of married couples
who deliberately spend

14
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,295
an occasional night in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,360
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,438
You sure talk like a girl
who's been married.

17
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,320
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.

18
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,157
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,494
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,291
You come down here on business trips,
and we steal lunch hours.

21
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,668
I wish you wouldn't even come.

22
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,752
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

23
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,054
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

24
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,180
- I can come down next week.
- No.

25
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,189
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?

26
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,690
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

27
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,230
But respectably.

28
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,112
In my house,
with my mother's picture on the mantel

29
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,616
and my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

30
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,613
And after the steak,

31
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,290
do we send sister to the movies,
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

32
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,457
Sam!

33
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,997
All right.

34
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,886
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

35
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,218
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

36
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,477
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

37
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,148
Oh, no, I'm all for it.

38
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,819
It requires patience, temperance,
a lot of sweating out.

39
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,148
Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.

40
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,824
But if I can see you and touch you,
even as simply as this, I won't mind.

41
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,908
I'm tired of sweating for people
who aren't there.

42
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,037
I sweat to pay off my father's debts,
and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,399
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,

44
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,133
and she's living on the other side
of the world somewhere.

45
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,340
I pay, too.

46
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,431
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,853
A couple of years
and my debts will be paid off.

48
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,522
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.

49
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,978
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,188
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,615
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,834
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,538
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,463
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,221
Marion, you want to cut this off,

56
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,769
go out and find yourself
somebody available?

57
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,642
I'm thinking of it.

58
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,236
How could you even think a thing like that?

59
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,774
- Don't miss your plane.
- Hey, we can leave together, can't we?

60
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,826
I'm late and you have to put your shoes on.

61
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,958
Is Mr Lowery back from lunch?

62
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,531
He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris Street property.

63
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,469
You know, the oil lease man.
That's why he's late. You got a headache?

64
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,016
It'll pass.

65
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,684
Headaches are like resolutions,

66
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,728
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

67
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,898
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

68
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,647
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

69
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,526
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilisers.

70
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,532
Any calls?

71
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,907
Teddy called me.
My mother called to see if Teddy called.

72
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,785
Oh, your sister called to say
she's going to Tucson to do some buying

73
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,144
and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...

74
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,001
Wow.

75
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,208
It's as hot as fresh milk.

76
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,675
Hey, you girls ought to get your boss
to air condition you up.

77
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,131
He can afford it today.

78
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,788
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?

79
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,271
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.

80
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,900
Oh, not you. My daughter.

81
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,985
A baby.

82
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,734
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

83
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,862
I want you to take a look at my baby.

84
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,662
Eighteen years old

85
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,921
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

86
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,958
Come on, Tom. My office is air conditioned.

87
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,885
Do you know what I do about unhappiness?

88
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,341
I buy it off.

89
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,802
Are... Are you unhappy?

90
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,184
Not inordinately.

91
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,437
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

92
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,939
$40,000 cash.

93
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:56,943
Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.

94
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,577
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

95
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,543
- Count them!
- I declare!

96
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,336
I don't. That's how I get to keep it.

97
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,214
Tom, a cash transaction of this size
is most irregular.

98
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,421
So what? It's my private money.

99
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,846
Now it's yours.

100
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,173
Suppose we put it in the safe,

101
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,760
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

102
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,016
Oh, speaking of feeling good,

103
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,224
where's that bottle you said
was in your desk?

104
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,479
Uh-oh!

105
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,615
You know, sometimes I can keep
my mouth shut.

106
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,491
Lowery, I am dying of thirst-aroonie.

107
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,711
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

108
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,007
Put it in the safe deposit box in the bank,

109
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,237
and we'll get him to give us
a cheque on Monday instead.

110
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,342
Yes.

111
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,600
He was flirting with you.

112
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,520
I guess he must've noticed
my wedding ring.

113
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,364
Come in.

114
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,620
The copies. Mr Lowery, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go right on home after the bank.

115
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,952
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

116
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,129
Because me and your boss are going out

117
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,753
and get ourselves a little drinking done.
Right?

118
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,961
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

119
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:42,389
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

120
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,718
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
Thank you.

121
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,149
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

122
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,602
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.

123
00:10:55,947 --> 00:11:00,658
I guess I'll go put this money in the bank
and then go home and sleep it off.

124
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,942
<i>Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?</i>

125
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,903
<i>Of course I'm glad to see you.
always am.</i>

126
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,784
<i>What is it, Marion?</i>

127
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,596
Hold it there.

128
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,309
In quite a hurry.

129
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,475
Yes. I didn't intend to sleep so long.

130
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,481
I almost had an accident last night
from sleepiness,

131
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,155
- so I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

132
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,985
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

133
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,739
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...

134
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,574
I mean, just to be safe.

135
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:23,504
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?

136
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,461
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

137
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,923
Is anything wrong?

138
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,723
Of course not.
Am I acting as if there's something wrong?

139
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,268
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

140
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,022
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

141
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,731
I've told you there's nothing wrong,

142
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,734
except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

143
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,863
Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.

144
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,530
May I see your licence?

145
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,410
- Why?
- Please.

146
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,997
Be with you in a second!

147
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,982
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

148
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,052
There's an old saying. "The first customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

149
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,692
But like I say, I'm in no mood for it,

150
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:25,075
so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square
that you won't have one human reason...

151
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,326
Can I trade my car in and take another?

152
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,535
Do anything you have a mind to.
Being a woman, you will. That yours?

153
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,916
Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.

154
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,498
- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.

155
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,778
Why don't you have a look around here

156
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,279
and see if there's something
that strikes your eyes.

157
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,365
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

158
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,408
- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.

159
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,799
I'm in a hurry
and I just wanna make a change.

160
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,350
One thing people never ought to be

161
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,456
when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.

162
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,394
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

163
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,873
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

164
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,083
- How much?
- Go ahead.

165
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,668
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

166
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,719
How much would it be with my car?

167
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,891
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

168
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,936
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?

169
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,978
Of course not. Please.

170
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,772
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman.

171
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,979
I figure roughly

172
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,693
your car plus $700.

173
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,323
- $700.
- You always got time to argue money, huh?

174
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,908
All right.

175
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,416
I take it you can prove that car is yours.

176
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,468
I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip...

177
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:07,343
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?

178
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,049
In the building.

179
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,736
Over there.

180
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,204
I think you better take it for a trial spin.

181
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,881
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

182
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,961
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and...

183
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,592
I might as well be perfectly
honest with you, ma'am.

184
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,390
- It's not that I don't trust you, but...
- But what?

185
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,308
Is there anything so terribly wrong

186
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,354
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

187
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,599
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

188
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,936
All right, let's go inside.

189
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,190
Hey!

190
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,695
Just put it in here, please.

191
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,074
Thank you.

192
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,318
<i>Heck, Officer,</i>

193
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,611
<i>that was the first time
I ever saw the customer</i>

194
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,843
<i>high-pressure the salesman.</i>

195
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,795
<i>Somebody chasing her?</i>

196
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,927
<i>I better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.</i>

197
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,179
<i>She look like
a wrong one to you?</i>

198
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,510
<i>Acted like one.</i>

199
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,556
<i>The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.</i>

200
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,411
<i>- Yes, Mr Lowery.
- Caroline, Marion still isn't in?</i>

201
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,956
<i>No, Mr Lowery, but then
she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.</i>

202
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,602
<i>Buzz me the minute
she comes in.</i>

203
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,963
<i>And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.</i>

204
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,416
<i>I called her sister,
Mr Lowery, where she works,</i>

205
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,502
<i>the Music Makers Music Store,
you know,</i>

206
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,212
<i>and she doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.</i>

207
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,533
<i>You better run out
to the house.</i>

208
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,095
<i>She may be, well,
unable to answer the phone.</i>

209
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,053
<i>Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.</i>

210
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,483
<i>No, I haven't
the faintest idea.</i>

211
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,482
<i>As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.</i>

212
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:54,111
<i>She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.</i>

213
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,194
<i>That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.</i>

214
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,121
<i>I did see her some time later,
driving...</i>

215
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,584
<i>I think you'd better come over here
to my office, quick.</i>

216
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,253
<i>Caroline, get Mr Cassidy
for me.</i>

217
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,551
<i>After all, Cassidy, I told you,
all that cash!</i>

218
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,216
<i>I'm not taking
the responsibility.</i>

219
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,842
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake.</i>

220
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,892
<i>A girl works for you for 10 years,
you trust her.</i>

221
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,935
<i>All right, yes,
you better come over.</i>

222
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,395
<i>Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $40,000!</i>

223
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,525
<i>I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!</i>

224
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,527
<i>- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.</i>

225
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:41,033
<i>I still can't believe...
It must be some kind of a mystery. I can't...</i>

226
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,332
<i>You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?</i>

227
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:48,412
<i>You still trusting? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!</i>

228
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,966
<i>Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!</i>

229
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,114
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain.

230
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,987
Go ahead in, please.

231
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,120
- Dirty night.
- You have a vacancy?

232
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,124
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.

233
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,130
They... They moved away the highway.

234
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,793
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.

235
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,046
I knew you must have.

236
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,678
Nobody ever stops here any more
unless they've done that.

237
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,054
But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.

238
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:56,312
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

239
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,315
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

240
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,036
Los Angeles.

241
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,918
Cabin One.
It's closer in case you want anything.

242
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,214
Right next to the office.

243
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,259
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

244
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:27,089
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

245
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,347
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

246
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,534
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

247
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,796
Well, the mattress is soft

248
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,502
and there's hangers in the closet and
stationery with Bates Motel printed on it

249
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,963
in case you wanna make
your friends back home feel envious.

250
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,548
And the...

251
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,311
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

252
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,930
Yeah.

253
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:22,023
Well, if you want anything,
just tap on the wall.

254
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,399
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.

255
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,071
Norman Bates.

256
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,988
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

257
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,322
No.

258
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,329
Well, then would you do me a favour?
Would you have dinner with me?

259
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,876
I was just about to myself.

260
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,295
You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.

261
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,045
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

262
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,925
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

263
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,423
- I'd like to.
- All right.

264
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,180
You get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes,

265
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,011
and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.

266
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,312
Okay.

267
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,681
With my... With my trusty umbrella.

268
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,441
No! I tell you no!

269
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,816
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper!

270
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,239
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion

271
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,658
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

272
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,360
Mother, please.

273
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,614
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

274
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,997
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

275
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:48,457
"Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire strangers. As if...

276
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,760
I refuse to speak of
disgusting things, because they disgust me!

277
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,137
You understand, boy? Go on.

278
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,383
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing
her ugly appetite

279
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,890
with my food or my son!

280
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,306
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

281
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,983
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

282
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,941
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No.

283
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,444
Mother... My mother...

284
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,950
What is the phrase?

285
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,113
She isn't quite herself today.

286
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,747
You shouldn't have bothered.
I really don't have that much of an appetite.

287
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,291
Oh, I'm sorry.

288
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,919
I wish you could apologise for other people.

289
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,262
Don't worry about it.

290
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,932
But as long as you've fixed a supper,
we may as well eat it.

291
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,982
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.

292
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,126
Well, it stopped raining.

293
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,754
Eating in an office is just too officious.

294
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,720
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.

295
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,860
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

296
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,034
You're very kind.

297
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,365
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

298
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,211
You... You eat like a bird.

299
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,798
And you'd know, of course.

300
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,091
No, not really.

301
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,550
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

302
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:49,729
is really a false... Falsity.

303
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,517
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.

304
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,697
But I don't really know
anything about birds.

305
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,615
My hobby is stuffing things.

306
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,533
You know, taxidermy.

307
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,580
And I guess
I'd just rather stuff birds because

308
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,825
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

309
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,876
You know, foxes and chimps.

310
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,876
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

311
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,880
I think only birds look
well stuffed because...

312
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,428
Well, because they're
kind of passive to begin with.

313
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,887
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

314
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,345
- Uncommon, too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

315
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,439
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.

316
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,064
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

317
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,896
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

318
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,072
A man should have a hobby.

319
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,653
Well, it's... It's more than a hobby.

320
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:52,041
A hobby's supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.

321
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,748
Is your time so empty?

322
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,954
No.

323
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,916
Well, I run the office

324
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,422
and tend the cabins and grounds

325
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,220
and do little errands for my mother.

326
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,640
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

327
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,344
Do you go out with friends?

328
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,228
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

329
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:23,443
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

330
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,657
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

331
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,536
I didn't mean to pry.

332
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,039
I'm looking for a private island.

333
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,789
What are you running away from?

334
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,380
- Why do you ask that?
- I don't know.

335
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,964
People never run away from anything.

336
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,305
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

337
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,106
I think that

338
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,812
we're all in our private traps,

339
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,865
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

340
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,453
We scratch and claw,

341
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,082
but only at the air, only at each other.

342
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,544
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.

343
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,924
Sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps.

344
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,346
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it any more.

345
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,095
Oh, but you should. You should mind it.

346
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,393
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

347
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:41,567
You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way I heard,

348
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,399
the way she spoke to you...

349
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,195
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,

350
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:54,247
I feel I'd like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever.

351
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,748
Or at least defy her.

352
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,163
But I know I can't.

353
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,250
She's ill.

354
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,593
She sounded strong.

355
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,429
No, I mean ill.

356
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,349
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

357
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,022
I was only five and it must've been
quite a strain for her.

358
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,567
I mean, she didn't have to go to work
or anything like that.

359
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,770
He left her a little money.

360
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,108
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

361
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,945
And he talked her into building this motel.

362
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,371
He could have talked her into anything.

363
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,701
And when he died, too,
it was just too great a shock for her.

364
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,042
And the way he died...

365
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,711
I guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.

366
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,266
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

367
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,435
Except you.

368
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,982
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

369
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,809
Why don't you go away?

370
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,650
To a private island, like you?

371
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,653
No, not like me.

372
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,824
I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?

373
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,460
She'd be alone up there.

374
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,251
Her fire would go out.

375
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,500
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.

376
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,836
If you love someone,

377
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,174
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

378
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,723
You understand, I don't hate her.

379
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,643
I hate what she's become.

380
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,438
I hate the illness.

381
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,570
Wouldn't it be better if you put her

382
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,865
someplace...

383
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,247
You mean an institution? A madhouse?

384
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,872
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

385
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,049
Put her in someplace.

386
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,590
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.

387
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,928
What do you know about caring?

388
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,135
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

389
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,471
The laughing and the tears

390
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,020
and the cruel eyes studying you.

391
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,817
My mother there?

392
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,896
But she's harmless.

393
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,744
She's as harmless
as one of those stuffed birds.

394
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,246
I am sorry.

395
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:46,043
I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.

396
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,673
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

397
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,213
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads

398
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,920
and suggest, oh, so very delicately.

399
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,938
Of course, I've suggested it myself.

400
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,067
But I hate to even think about it.

401
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,312
She needs me.

402
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,697
It's not as if she were

403
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,575
a maniac, a raving thing.

404
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,039
She just goes a little mad sometimes.

405
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,503
We all go a little mad sometimes.

406
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,631
Haven't you?

407
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,847
Yes.

408
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,852
Sometimes just one time can be enough.

409
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,979
Thank you.

410
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,142
Thank you, Norman.

411
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,476
Norman.

412
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,615
Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?

413
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,574
I'm very tired.

414
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,495
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

415
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,159
Really?

416
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,997
I stepped into a private trap back there

417
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,456
and I'd like to go back
and try to pull myself out of it

418
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,750
before it's too late for me, too.

419
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,632
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay just a little while longer?

420
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,634
Just for talk?

421
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,932
Oh, I'd like to, but...

422
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,259
All right.

423
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,972
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

424
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,853
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

425
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,900
All right, Miss...

426
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,273
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

427
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,821
Good night.

428
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,687
No!

429
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,364
No!

430
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,607
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

431
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,567
Blood! Blood!

432
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,200
I've tried many brands.

433
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,868
So far, of those I've used,
I haven't had much luck with any of them.

434
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,295
Let's see what they say about this one.

435
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,668
They tell you what its ingredients are

436
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:40,843
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

437
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,971
but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

438
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,767
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

439
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:53,728
I suppose, this one seems to claim more
and better qualities than lots of the others.

440
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,739
Sam?

441
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,738
Sam! Lady wants to see you.

442
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,501
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

443
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,629
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

444
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,823
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you.

445
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,588
Something wrong?

446
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,597
She left home on Friday.

447
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,351
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

448
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,307
Not even a phone call.

449
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,089
Look, if you two are in this thing together,
I don't care, it's none of my business,

450
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,233
but I want to talk to Marion
and I want her to tell me

451
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,926
it's none of my business and then I'll go...

452
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,239
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will you?

453
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:51,289
- That's okay, Sam. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

454
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:59,000
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

455
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,336
Sorry about the tears.

456
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,795
Well, is Marion in trouble? What is it?

457
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,965
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?

458
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,602
Who are you, friend?

459
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,896
My name is Arbogast, friend.

460
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,099
I'm a private investigator.

461
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:22,020
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

462
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:26,403
Why, I know you don't, because if you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

463
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,701
What's your interest in this?

464
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,738
Well, $40,000.

465
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,412
- $40,000?
- That's right.

466
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,609
Well, one of you'd better tell me
what's going on, and tell me fast.

467
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,903
- I can take just so much of this...
- Now, take it easy, friend.

468
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:48,513
Take it easy. It's just that
your girlfriend stole $40,000.

469
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,965
What are you talking about? What is this?

470
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,224
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss and she didn't.

471
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,939
- And no one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

472
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:02,063
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.

473
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,896
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

474
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,949
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

475
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,696
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

476
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,529
Did you come up here on just a hunch
and nothing more?

477
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,830
Not even a hunch. Just hope.

478
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:18,500
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

479
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,370
I don't care if you believe me or not.

480
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,798
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

481
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,343
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

482
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,296
No, she was seen leaving town
in her own car,

483
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,677
by her employer, I might add.

484
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,388
I can't believe it. Can you?

485
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,597
Well, you know,
we're always quickest to doubt people

486
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,149
who have a reputation for being honest.

487
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,522
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

488
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,774
Where there's a boyfriend...

489
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,135
Well, she's not back there
with the nuts and bolts,

490
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,902
but she's here, in this town somewhere.

491
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,862
I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.

492
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,943
- Evening.
- Evening.

493
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,778
I almost drove right past.

494
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,910
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on,
but we do have a vacancy.

495
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,993
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. Candy?

496
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,623
No, thanks.

497
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,751
Last two days, I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

498
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,380
but, you know, this is the first place
that looks like it's hiding from the world.

499
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,390
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.

500
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,674
Just doesn't seem
like any use any more, you know.

501
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,553
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

502
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,957
Well, wanna come in and register?

503
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,501
No, no, sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

504
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:06,734
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No, that's no trouble. Today's linen day.

505
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,465
I always change the beds here once a week
whether they've been used or not.

506
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,902
Hate the smell of dampness, don't you?
It's such a...

507
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,734
I don't know, creepy smell. Come on.

508
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,994
You out to buy a motel?

509
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:20,827
No.

510
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,895
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many

511
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,083
in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you...

512
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,789
What... What was it you wanted to ask?

513
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,671
Well, you see,
I'm looking for a missing person.

514
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:35,004
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

515
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,930
I've been trying to trace a girl

516
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:40,760
that's been missing for, oh,
about a week now from Phoenix.

517
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,392
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

518
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,598
She's not in any trouble.

519
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,907
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

520
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,062
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

521
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:53,050
We have reason to believe
that she came along this way.

522
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,532
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?

523
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,201
Well, no one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

524
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,683
Would you mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

525
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:01,948
Commit myself?

526
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,910
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

527
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:07,624
Mmm-mmm.

528
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,421
- Sure?
- Yeah.

529
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,628
Well, she may have used an alias.

530
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,176
Marion Crane's her real name,

531
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:17,505
but she could've registered
under a different one.

532
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:22,097
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

533
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:24,850
You know, one by one,
you drop the formalities.

534
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,306
I shouldn't even bother
changing the sheets,

535
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,642
but old habits die hard.

536
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,526
Which reminds me...

537
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,398
- What's that?
- It's the light. The sign.

538
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,655
We had a couple last week,
said if the thing hadn't been on,

539
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,828
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

540
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,201
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.

541
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,227
You said that nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

542
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,039
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

543
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,129
Yeah.

544
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,497
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.

545
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,504
It's possible, this girl could've registered
under another name.

546
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,210
Do you mind if I look at your book?

547
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,261
- No.
- Thank you.

548
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,512
All right.

549
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,844
I'll get the date somewhere.

550
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,930
See, there's nobody.

551
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,768
Let's see now, I have a sample of her
handwriting here.

552
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:14,899
Oh, yes.

553
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,234
Here we are.

554
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,534
Marie Samuels. That's an interesting alias.

555
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,992
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

556
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,074
Marie, Marion.

557
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,830
Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

558
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,920
Mmm-hmm.

559
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,830
Was she in disguise, by any chance?

560
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,752
- Wanna check the picture again?
- Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr...

561
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,882
Oh, I know that. I know you wouldn't lie.

562
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,909
You know, it's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

563
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,674
Oh, I know, I know.

564
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,059
Oh, yeah.

565
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,307
Well, it was raining

566
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,348
and her hair was all wet.

567
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,150
I tell you, it's not really
a very good picture of her either.

568
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,853
No, I guess not.

569
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,438
Tell me all about her.

570
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,818
Well,

571
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:03,528
she arrived rather late one night,
and she went straight to sleep

572
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,238
and left early the next morning.

573
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:09,450
- How early?
- Oh, very early.

574
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:12,753
Mmm-hmm. Which morning was that?

575
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,080
The...

576
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,502
- The next morning. Sunday.
- I see.

577
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,508
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

578
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,512
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

579
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,094
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

580
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,519
Locally?

581
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,853
Did you spend the night with her?

582
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,350
No.

583
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:38,233
Well then, how would you know
that she didn't make any phone calls?

584
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,908
Well, she was very tired and...

585
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:47,284
See, now I'm starting to remember.

586
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,018
I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

587
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,978
You know, if you make a mental
picturisation of something...

588
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,619
That's right. That's right. Take your time.

589
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,046
She was... She was sitting back there...

590
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,045
No, no, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand

591
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,797
and she said she had to go to sleep early

592
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:05,882
because she had a long drive ahead of her.

593
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,474
- Back where?
- Back where she came from.

594
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,415
No, you said before that she was
sitting back there... Standing back there...

595
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,897
Yes, back in my parlour there.

596
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,100
She was very hungry
and I made her a sandwich

597
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:21,610
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed.

598
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,861
I see. How did she pay you?

599
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,283
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.

600
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,702
Cash, huh?

601
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:31,453
- And after she left, she didn't come back?
- Well, why should she?

602
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,542
Yeah.

603
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,257
Well, Mr Arbogast, I guess that's about it.

604
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,593
I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.

605
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,672
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind.

606
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:49,884
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic,
and this ain't jelling.

607
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,061
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

608
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,982
Well, I don't know
what you could expect me to know.

609
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,525
People just come and go, you know.

610
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,230
- That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
- No.

611
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,242
If I wanted to check the cabins,
all 12 of them,

612
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,569
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

613
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:11,600
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

614
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,207
- Okay?
- No, thanks.

615
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,640
Change your mind?

616
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,984
You know, I... I think I must have one
of those faces you just can't help believing.

617
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,857
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

618
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,234
Oh? There's somebody
sitting up in the window.

619
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,691
- No, no, there isn't.
- Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

620
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,742
Oh, that must be my mother.

621
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,287
She's an invalid.

622
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,365
It's practically like living alone.

623
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,950
Oh, I see.

624
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:01,585
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

625
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,007
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

626
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,174
No.

627
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:10,931
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument,
that she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

628
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,883
You'd know that you were being used.

629
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,329
You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?

630
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,935
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...

631
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:19,060
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

632
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,628
- Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

633
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:25,521
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

634
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,593
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

635
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,280
No. As I told you, she's confined.

636
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,680
Yes, but just for a few minutes. That's all.

637
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,787
There might be some hint
that you missed out on.

638
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:36,206
You know, sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

639
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,956
- Mr Arbogast... I think I've...
- Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.

640
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,880
- I think I've talked to you all I want to.
- Yes, but just for...

641
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,252
I think it'd be much better if you left now.
Thanks.

642
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,085
Well, all right.

643
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:52,135
You sure would save me a lot of leg work
if you'd let me talk to her.

644
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,702
- Would I need a warrant for that, too?
- Sure.

645
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,726
Uh-huh.

646
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,894
All right. Thanks anyway.

647
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:55,160
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?

648
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,700
Okay. Let me talk to her, please.

649
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,498
Hello, Lila.

650
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,956
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.

651
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,672
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

652
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,545
It's right out here on the old highway.

653
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:13,094
I even know what cabin she was in.
It was number one.

654
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:17,888
Well, this young fella that runs the place
said that she just spent the night,

655
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,469
left the next day and that was it.

656
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,644
No, not exactly.

657
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:30,233
Well, I did question him, believe me,
but I think I got all there was to get.

658
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:33,487
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

659
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,535
Well, I tell you,
I don't feel entirely satisfied...

660
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,955
See, this boy had a sick old mother.

661
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,954
I think she saw Marion and talked to her.

662
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:46,287
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

663
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:50,503
Well, I was,
but I think I'll go back to the motel first.

664
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,049
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

665
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,222
All right, fine. Listen, I...

666
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,766
You'll be happy to know what I think.

667
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,846
I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

668
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,730
Yeah. All right.
See you in about an hour or less.

669
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:09,855
All right, bye-bye.

670
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:07,751
Bates?

671
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,157
Sometimes Saturday night
has a lonely sound.

672
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,326
Ever notice that, Lila?

673
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,033
Sam, he said an hour or less.

674
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:51,910
Yeah.

675
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:57,204
- It's been three.
- Well, are we just going to sit here and wait?

676
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,880
He'll be back.

677
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,750
Let's sit still and hang on, okay?

678
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:10,513
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

679
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,164
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady...
- Yes.

680
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,850
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

681
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:17,353
- That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
- Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam.

682
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,129
- I'm going out there.
- Look, Arbogast said...

683
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:21,065
An hour, or less.

684
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:28,948
- Well, I'm going.
- You'll never find it.

685
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:35,204
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?

686
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:39,083
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

687
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,335
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

688
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:43,257
Yeah. Stay here.

689
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,275
Arbogast?

690
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:07,991
Arbogast!

691
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,745
Arbogast!

692
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:45,274
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

693
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:48,903
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

694
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:51,952
Sick old lady unable to answer the door,
or unwilling.

695
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,949
Where could he have gone?

696
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,239
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on.

697
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,575
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.

698
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:01,707
Sam, he called when he had nothing.
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

699
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:05,507
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

700
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,127
Yes, I think he would've.

701
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,337
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

702
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:14,141
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- All right. Let me get my coat.

703
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:23,649
Good evening.

704
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:28,192
Well, I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

705
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:29,398
Yes.

706
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:33,402
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

707
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:38,456
She's been here searching for her sister.
There's this private detective helping and...

708
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,579
Well, we got a call from this detective

709
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,106
saying that he'd traced her to that motel
out on the old highway.

710
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,087
That must be the Bates Motel.

711
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:48,153
He traced her there and called us to say
he was going to question Mrs Bates.

712
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,759
Norman took a wife?

713
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,179
No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

714
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,745
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

715
01:20:56,769 --> 01:21:00,262
Now, your sister's missing how long?

716
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:03,520
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

717
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:07,102
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

718
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,358
They thought she'd be coming to me.

719
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,781
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

720
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,450
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

721
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,778
- That's right.
- From what?

722
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,330
- She stole some money.
- A lot?

723
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,712
$40,000.

724
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,880
And the police haven't been able to...

725
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:31,801
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

726
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,345
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

727
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:38,345
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

728
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,893
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

729
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:44,768
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

730
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,565
With the $40,000?

731
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,394
Well, he didn't say anything
about the money.

732
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,901
It isn't important what
he said on the phone, is it?

733
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,635
He was supposed to come back here
and talk to us

734
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,742
after he talked to the mother,
and he didn't.

735
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,036
That's what I want you
to do something about.

736
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,613
Like what?

737
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,115
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

738
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:05,919
It's just that I'm sure there's something
wrong out there and I have to know what.

739
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,463
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, miss, but not the same thing.

740
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,714
I think what's wrong is
your private detective.

741
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:16,763
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

742
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,932
probably from Norman Bates,

743
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:23,227
and called you to keep you still
while he took off after her and the money.

744
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:27,148
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

745
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,634
Why don't you call Norman
and let him say just what happened?

746
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,061
At this hour?

747
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:33,363
Well, he was out
when I was there just a while ago.

748
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,486
If he's back,
he probably isn't even in bed yet.

749
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,112
He wasn't out when you were there,

750
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,536
he just wasn't answering the door
in the dead of night, like some people do.

751
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,864
This fellow lives like a hermit.

752
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,076
You must remember that bad business
out there about 10 years ago.

753
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,786
Please. Call.

754
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:58,217
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.

755
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,896
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

756
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,308
I've been just fine, thanks.

757
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,564
Listen, we got worries here.

758
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:16,569
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

759
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,030
Well, this one wouldn't be
a customer, anyway.

760
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,079
- He's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

761
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,747
Arbogast.

762
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,252
And after he left?

763
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,127
No, that's okay, Norman.

764
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:39,838
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

765
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,800
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

766
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,803
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

767
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,139
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back

768
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:53,102
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

769
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,311
Yes.

770
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,735
Norman Bates' mother has
been dead and buried

771
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,908
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past 10 years.

772
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:06,122
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

773
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,888
It ain't only local history, Sam.

774
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,749
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on Fairvale ledgers.

775
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:16,299
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with

776
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,627
when she found out he was married.

777
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,804
Then took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

778
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,803
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

779
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,053
Norman found them dead together.

780
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,353
In bed.

781
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:34,045
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in
the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?

782
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:38,109
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

783
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,656
Yes! In the house behind the motel!

784
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:43,029
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

785
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,863
You want to tell me
you saw Norman Bates' mother?

786
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,165
But it had to be
because Arbogast said so, too!

787
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:52,911
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

788
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,873
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates,

789
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,506
who's that woman buried out
in Green Lawn Cemetery?

790
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:47,257
Now, Mother,
I'm gonna bring something up...

791
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:50,176
I am sorry, boy,

792
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:53,934
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

793
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,640
Please, Mother.

794
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:58,647
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

795
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:02,189
You think I'm fruity, huh?

796
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,365
I'm staying right here.

797
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:07,285
This is my room
and no one will drag me out of it,

798
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:10,496
least of all my big, bold son.

799
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,726
They'll come now, Mother.

800
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,664
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

801
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,495
Mother, please, it's just for a few days.

802
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,002
Just for a few days so they won't find you.

803
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,879
Just for a few days?

804
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,629
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!

805
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,632
You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again, not ever again!

806
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,262
Now get out!

807
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:36,272
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

808
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:39,563
Norman,
what do you think you're doing?

809
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:42,942
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!

810
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:51,576
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

811
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,172
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

812
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,715
Good morning.

813
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:05,154
We thought if you didn't mind,
we'd drive out to that motel with you.

814
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:07,465
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

815
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,048
- Did you two have breakfast?
- You didn't find anything?

816
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:13,101
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.

817
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,304
Well, what did he say about my sister?

818
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:19,562
Just what he told your detective,
she used a fake name.

819
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,892
Saw the register myself.

820
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,899
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.

821
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,982
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

822
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,943
I know you're not the seeing-illusions type,

823
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,528
but no woman was there
and I don't believe in ghosts,

824
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,517
- so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...

825
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:38,160
Can see you do.
I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better.

826
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,022
You want to come around
to my office this afternoon

827
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:43,130
and report a missing person and a theft,
that's what you want to do.

828
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,253
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

829
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:49,178
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up.

830
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,846
How about that?

831
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:53,804
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

832
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:57,123
Come on over to the house
and do your reporting around dinnertime.

833
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:58,934
It'll make it nicer.

834
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,857
- You too, Sam.
- Thank you.

835
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:08,072
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

836
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,012
Well, you want me to drop you
at the hotel or...

837
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,072
Sam.

838
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,496
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

839
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,791
Neither will I. Come on.

840
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:24,255
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

841
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:26,628
We're going to register as man and wife.

842
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:29,301
We're going to get shown to a cabin,

843
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:33,719
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

844
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:59,464
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

845
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,993
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

846
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:03,373
Come on.

847
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:08,624
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

848
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:09,718
Uh-huh.

849
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:11,260
Suppose you want a room.

850
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,157
We were gonna try to make it
straight to San Francisco,

851
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,298
but we don't like the look of that sky.

852
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:18,556
- Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?
- Okay.

853
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:27,940
- I'll take you to Cabin 10.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

854
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,895
No. That's not necessary.

855
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:34,030
My boss is paying for this trip
and, well, it's 90% business.

856
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,862
He wants practically notarised receipts.

857
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:39,572
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.

858
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,675
Thank you.

859
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:04,980
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

860
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:10,649
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

861
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,758
You check in any other place
in this country without bags

862
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:14,819
and you have to pay in advance.

863
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,151
$10.

864
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,204
That receipt.

865
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,883
I'll go on ahead.

866
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,600
All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.

867
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:44,394
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

868
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,852
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

869
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:08,369
no matter what we're afraid of finding
or how much it may hurt.

870
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,704
I know.

871
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:12,068
Do you think if something happened,
it happened there?

872
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,583
I don't know.

873
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:16,419
But if you had a useless
business like this motel,

874
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:17,740
what would you need to get out?

875
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,801
To get a new business somewhere else?

876
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,257
$40,000?

877
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,096
How could we prove that...

878
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,772
Well, if he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

879
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:31,350
There must be some proof that exists now,

880
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,983
something that proves he got that money
away from Marion somehow.

881
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:39,238
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

882
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:43,237
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

883
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:46,039
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

884
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,458
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

885
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,252
or done anything without telling us,
unless he was stopped.

886
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:54,173
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.

887
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:58,548
We'll start with Cabin One.

888
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,925
If he sees us, we're just taking the air.

889
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,132
Bates.

890
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,806
- No shower curtain.
- Sam!

891
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:31,012
- Look!
- What is it?

892
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,439
It's figuring.
It didn't get washed down. Look.

893
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:37,360
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

894
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,652
That proves Marion was here.

895
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:42,027
- It'd be too wild a coincidence...
- Bates never denied she was here.

896
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:45,179
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out
about the money?

897
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:46,910
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

898
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:47,996
No.

899
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:51,574
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

900
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:54,331
I want her to tell us the same thing.

901
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:57,459
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

902
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:59,461
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

903
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,312
One of us can keep him occupied
while the other gets to the old woman.

904
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:05,383
You'll never be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held.

905
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:10,389
- I don't like you going into that house alone.
- I can handle a sick old woman.

906
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:14,062
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

907
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,143
Wait a minute.

908
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:19,351
If you get anything out of the mother,

909
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,233
can you find your way back to town?

910
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:23,905
Yes, of course.

911
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,868
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

912
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,973
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

913
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:55,679
Wife's taking a nap

914
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:59,687
and I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I just thought I'd look you up and talk.

915
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:03,145
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

916
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:20,438
I've been doing all the talking so far,
haven't I?

917
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,670
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time

918
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,936
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

919
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:27,191
Here you are doing all the listening.

920
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,615
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

921
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,283
Drive me crazy.

922
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:35,328
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

923
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:36,951
Just an expression.

924
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,534
What I meant was
I'd do just about anything to get away.

925
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,369
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

926
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:49,919
Mrs Bates?

927
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:09,290
I'm not saying
you shouldn't be contented here,

928
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:11,250
I'm just doubting that you are.

929
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:15,008
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under, you'd unload this place.

930
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:18,432
This place?
This place happens to be my only world.

931
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,845
I grew up in that house up there.
I had a very happy childhood.

932
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:24,555
My mother and I were more than happy.

933
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:28,984
You look frightened.
Have I been saying something frightening?

934
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:30,537
I don't know what you've been saying.

935
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:34,090
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

936
01:39:34,177 --> 01:39:36,260
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

937
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:39,258
Buy a new one in a new town
where you won't have to hide your mother.

938
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:42,091
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here, okay?

939
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:44,142
Where will you get
the money to do that, Bates?

940
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:46,140
Or do you already have it socked away?

941
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,064
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. $40,000.

942
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:56,321
I bet your mother knows where
the money is and what you did to get it.

943
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,399
I think she'll tell us.

944
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,737
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

945
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:10,228
Mrs Bates...

946
01:41:30,376 --> 01:41:32,083
I'm Norma Bates!

947
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:06,531
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

948
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:09,284
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

949
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:11,660
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

950
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:14,534
Did he talk to you?

951
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:16,540
No.

952
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:23,673
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.

953
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,381
Norman Bates no longer exists.

954
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:31,014
He only half-existed to begin with.

955
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:34,016
And now the other half has taken over,

956
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,607
probably for all time.

957
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:41,524
Did he kill my sister?

958
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:44,652
Yes. And no.

959
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:48,319
Well, now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork

960
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:50,654
for some sort of plea,
this fellow would like to cop...

961
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:53,616
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.

962
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:56,042
He merely tries to explain it.

963
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:58,871
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

964
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,800
Yes, I'm sorry.

965
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:06,594
The private investigator, too.

966
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:11,221
If you drag that swamp somewhere
in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

967
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:17,856
Have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books?

968
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,559
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

969
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,609
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said, the mother.

970
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,862
Now, to understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the mother,

971
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,698
that is, from the mother half
of Norman's mind,

972
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,705
you have to go back 10 years

973
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,538
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

974
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:46,502
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.

975
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:51,174
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

976
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:57,396
and for years the two of them lived
as if there was no one else in the world.

977
01:43:57,815 --> 01:43:59,602
Then she met a man,

978
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:03,944
and it seemed to Norman
that she threw him over for this man.

979
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:08,407
Now, that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

980
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:12,737
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

981
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:17,165
most unbearable to the son who commits it.

982
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:22,960
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

983
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,797
He stole her corpse.

984
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:32,680
A weighted coffin was buried.

985
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:36,017
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

986
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,347
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

987
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,648
And that still wasn't enough.

988
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:46,062
She was there, but she was a corpse.

989
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:51,404
So he began to think and speak for her,

990
01:44:51,494 --> 01:44:54,032
give her half his life, so to speak.

991
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:58,703
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

992
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:03,287
At other times,
the mother half took over completely.

993
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:08,547
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

994
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:13,338
and because he was
so pathologically jealous of her,

995
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:16,266
he assumed that she was as jealous of him.

996
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:20,892
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

997
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,642
the mother side of him would go wild.

998
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:29,984
When he met your sister,

999
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:33,654
he was touched by her, aroused by her.

1000
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:35,235
He wanted her.

1001
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:41,533
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

1002
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:46,797
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,

1003
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:51,297
and, like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime

1004
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:54,004
he was convinced
his mother had committed!

1005
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,431
Why was he dressed like that?

1006
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:58,758
He's a transvestite.

1007
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,261
Not exactly.

1008
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:05,311
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

1009
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:07,859
or satisfaction is a transvestite.

1010
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:12,440
But in Norman's case,
he was simply doing everything possible

1011
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:16,026
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

1012
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,867
And when reality came too close,

1013
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:23,496
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

1014
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:28,956
he'd dress up,
even to a cheap wig he bought.

1015
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:33,168
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

1016
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:35,470
He tried to be his mother.

1017
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,054
And now he is.

1018
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:45,222
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the mother.

1019
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:48,559
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

1020
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:51,816
there's always a conflict, a battle.

1021
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:55,569
In Norman's case, the battle is over,

1022
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,823
and the dominant personality has won.

1023
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:01,701
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1024
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:06,539
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.

1025
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:12,507
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

1026
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:14,550
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

1027
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,307
Thank you.

1028
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:39,193
<i>It's sad when a mother
has to speak the words</i>

1029
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,278
<i>that condemn her own son,</i>

1030
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:45,207
<i>but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.</i>

1031
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:49,127
<i>They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.</i>

1032
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,963
<i>He was always bad,</i>

1033
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:57,090
<i>and in the end he intended to tell them
I killed those girls and that man,</i>

1034
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:00,889
<i>as if I could do anything
except just sit and stare,</i>

1035
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:03,388
<i>like one of his stuffed birds.</i>

1036
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:07,637
<i>They know I can't even move a finger,
and I won't.</i>

1037
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:13,352
<i>I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.</i>

1038
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:19,608
<i>They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.</i>

1039
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:23,036
<i>Let them see what kind
of a person I am.</i>

1040
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,661
<i>I'm not even gonna swat
that fly.</i>

1041
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,493
<i>I hope they are watching.
They'll see.</i>

1042
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:31,666
<i>They'll see
and they'll know,</i>

1043
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:36,250
<i>and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."</i>
