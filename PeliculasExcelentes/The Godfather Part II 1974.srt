1
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:04,894
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,524
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,277
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,622
My son...

5
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,336
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,677
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,513
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,767
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:30,563
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,066
He never speaks.

11
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,860
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:41,032
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,535
But when he grows,
he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,581
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:59,592
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:05,556
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,309
He's all I have left.

18
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:13,731
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,075
Vito, run!

20
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,243
Move and I'll kill him!

21
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,705
Run, Vito!

22
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,753
Kill him!

23
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:49,642
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

24
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,187
You understand?

25
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:07,452
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

26
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,022
Vito, we're praying for you!

27
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:44,989
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

28
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,867
...turn him over to us.

29
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,370
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

30
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,708
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

31
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,391
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

32
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:47,570
Nurse.

33
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,805
Money?

34
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,601
Interpreter!

35
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,360
Where are you from?

36
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,779
- What is your name?
- Maria.

37
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,369
What is your name?

38
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,872
Come on, son. What is your name?

39
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,921
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

40
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,341
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

41
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,469
Okay, over there.

42
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,596
Next.

43
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:09,360
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

44
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,663
Vito Corleone!

45
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,749
Vito Corleone!

46
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,962
Here he is. This is him.

47
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,695
Did you bring the car keys?

48
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,367
Laurie! Laurie!

49
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,931
Mama!

50
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,684
Mama!

51
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,397
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

52
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,733
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

53
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,487
Mama!

54
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:03,659
- Here I am.
- After one week?

55
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:07,788
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

56
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:13,836
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. And this is for my mama!

57
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,005
- What is this?
- You remember Merle?

58
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,967
- Hello, Mama.
- Yeah, hello. How are you? Thank you.

59
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:25,639
Where's Michael? I gotta talk to him and get a 
few things straight, and I can't wait on line.

60
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,058
You go see your children first...

61
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:33,814
and then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

62
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,113
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Frankie, wake up.

63
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,451
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

64
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,454
Would you please welcome Senator
Pat Geary of the state of Nevada.

65
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,500
And there's Mrs Geary.

66
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,929
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

67
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:11,810
And this is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife, Mrs. Geary.


68
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,564
We see Nevada far too seldom.

69
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:20,611
but particularly today when we can join 
with old friends, we can make new friends...

70
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:24,573
and we help celebrate
a young man's first communion...

71
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:32,331
and also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the state.

72
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:38,212
I have here in my hand a check made out
to the university...

73
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:42,174
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of

74
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:47,304
Anthony Vito Corleone.

75
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:51,475
And the check is signed by
that young man's parents

76
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,395
whom I think we should recognize now.

77
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:58,899
Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!

78
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:01,026
Folks, I want you to join me

79
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,907
in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr and Mrs Michael Corleone!

80
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:18,127
We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir

81
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:24,633
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement

82
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:28,721
to honour their host,
Mr Michael Corleone.

83
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,389
Boys.

84
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,033
The plaque.

85
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,744
Okay, fellas, I got that one.

86
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,747
Okay, this is yours.

87
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,959
Senator, just you and Mrs Corleone.

88
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:23,442
- Excuse me.
- This is my lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary. 

89
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,779
He's the one who arranged this whole
thing through your man Turnbull.

90
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,032
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

91
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,664
I was under the impression
that you and I would talk alone.

92
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:43,921
I trust these men with my life, Senator. If I were
to ask them to leave, it would be an insult.

93
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,965
It's perfectly all right with me,

94
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:51,720
but I should tell you I am a blunt man and I 
intend to speak very frankly to you.

95
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,806
Maybe more frankly

96
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,226
than anyone in my position's
ever talked to you before.

97
00:16:57,393 --> 00:17:00,396
The Corleone family
has done very well here in Nevada.

98
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:05,693
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas...

99
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:10,280
one in Reno.
The licences were grandfathered in

100
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:13,784
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

101
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,789
Now my sources tell me

102
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,960
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

103
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:28,132
They tell me that within a week,
you're gonna move Klingman out.

104
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:33,637
That's quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with one little technical problem.

105
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,601
The licence will still be
in Klingman's name.

106
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:45,149
- Turnbull is a good man.
- Yeah, well, let's, let's cut out the bullshit.

107
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,485
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.

108
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,988
You can have the licence.

109
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,907
The price is 250,000 dollars...

110
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,660
plus a monthly payment of five 
percent of the gross...

111
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,954
of all four hotels, Mr.

112
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,165
Corleone.

113
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:09,840
Now, the price for the license
is less than $20,000. Am I right?

114
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,259
That's right.

115
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:17,931
- Now, why would I ever consider paying more than that?
- Because I intend to squeeze you.

116
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,684
I don't like your kind of people.

117
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:26,273
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in your oily hair

118
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,692
dressed up in those silk suits

119
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,738
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

120
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:38,535
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

121
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:44,041
the dishonest way you pose yourself. Yourself
and your whole fucking family.

122
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,383
Senator,

123
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,721
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

124
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,559
But never think it applies to my family.

125
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,729
All right, all right.

126
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:11,693
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

127
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,908
So let's just say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest to pay me.

128
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,996
But I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. And one more thing.

129
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,667
Don't you contact me again, ever.

130
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,587
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

131
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,925
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

132
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,389
My offer is this...

133
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,099
Nothing.

134
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:49,439
Not even the fee for the gaming licence, which
I would appreciate if you would put up personally.

135
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,364
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

136
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,619
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

137
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,747
- We have to go. We're late.
- Really? I'm sorry.

138
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:09,251
- It's been a delightful party. Thank you for inviting us.
- It's been our pleasure.

139
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,045
It was wonderful talking to you.

140
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:01,762
Fredo! Fredo, you son of a bitch! You look great!

141
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,764
Frank Pentangeli!

142
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,017
I thought you was never coming 
out west, you big bum!

143
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,771
I gotta check on my boys, huh?

144
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,899
- What's with the food around here?
- What's the matter?

145
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:19,863
Kid comes up to me in a white jacket, gives me a Ritz
cracker and a chopped liver, he says, "canapés".

146
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:25,243
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

147
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,667
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

148
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,587
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

149
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:42,302
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

150
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,016
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

151
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,186
No, there was no heart attack.

152
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,524
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

153
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,652
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

154
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:04,157
I mean, what do I gotta do? Do I have to get
a letter of introduction to get a sit-down?

155
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:08,870
- You can't get in to see Mike?
- He's got me waiting in a lobby!

156
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,627
- Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

157
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:26,513
- Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen? Johnny Ola.
- Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.

158
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,181
Rocco.

159
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:32,185
- What's this?
- It's an orange from Miami.

160
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,355
Why don't you take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

161
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,481
Johnny.

162
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:43,697
Tom isn't gonna sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles
specific areas of the family business. Tom?

163
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,658
Sure, Mike.

164
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:54,207
- What are you drinking, Johnny?
- Anisette.

165
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,631
If you need anything, Mike, I'll be outside, all right?

166
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,551
Just tell Rocco
we're waiting, Tom.

167
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:13,894
- I just left Mr Roth in Miami.
- How's his health?

168
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,896
It's not good.

169
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,608
Is there anything I can do,
anything I can send?

170
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:24,571
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

171
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,573
That casino you're interested in,
the registered owners are...

172
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:31,328
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay, both
Beverly Hills attorneys.

173
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,290
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group from Cleveland...

174
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,626
and our friend in Miami.

175
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:43,799
Meyer Klingman runs the store. He owns a piece of it too, 
and he does all right. But I've been instructed to tell you

176
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:47,969
that if you move Klingman out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

177
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:54,935
That's very kind of him.
You tell him that's greatly appreciated.

178
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:59,981
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

179
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:05,112
One by one, our old friends are gone.

180
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,949
Death, natural or not,

181
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,785
prison, deported...

182
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:18,542
Hyman Roth is the only one left because 
he always made money for his partners.

183
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,924
I can't believe out of 30 professional musicians
there isn't one Italian in the group here!

184
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,677
Come on, let's have a tarantella!

185
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,393
You, up! Come on! Up, up, up!

186
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,320
<i>Questa mano!</i>

187
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,740
<i>Questa mano!</i>

188
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,499
What the hell have we here?

189
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:16,183
- I'll see my sister alone.
- It concerns me too. Is it okay if I stay?

190
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:20,437
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

191
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,690
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink or something?

192
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,572
Al, would you please get him a drink?

193
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:36,703
We're going to Europe next week. I'd like to book
passage on <i>The Queen.</i>

194
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,664
So what do you come to me for?
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

195
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,709
We're getting married first.

196
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:54,596
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

197
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,434
You see your children on weekends.

198
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,522
You know your oldest boy was picked up in Reno for
some petty theft you don't even know about.

199
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,943
You fly around the world with men who don't care for 
you, who use you like a whore!

200
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,570
- You're not my father!
- Then what do you come to me for?

201
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,072
'Cause I need money.

202
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,255
Connie, Connie, Connie...

203
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,430
I wanna be reasonable with you.

204
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:41,268
Now, why don't you stay here
with us, with the family?

205
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,105
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

206
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:48,817
You won't be deprived of anything.
You can have everything you want.

207
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,743
Now, I don't know this Merle. I don't know 
what he does. I don't know what he lives on.

208
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:05,292
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him any more.

209
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,585
He'll understand, believe me.

210
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,679
Connie.

211
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:23,810
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,

212
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,525
you'll disappoint me.

213
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:06,269
<i>- Famiglia!</i>
<i>- Cent' anni!</i>

214
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,064
What's "Chen dannay"?

215
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:12,150
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.

216
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:16,529
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

217
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,700
- It'd be true if my father were alive.
- Connie.

218
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,369
Hey...

219
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,247
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.

220
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,999
- Fredo's wife.
- A pleasure, Merle.

221
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:42,555
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

222
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:44,808
I know, I know.

223
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:20,260
- What's the matter? I just want to dance!
- Dancing is one thing. You're falling all over the floor.

224
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,180
I know what's the matter. You're
jealous 'cause he's a real man.

225
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:29,060
- I swear to God, I'm gonna belt you right in the teeth.
- You couldn't belt your mama!

226
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,106
You know something? These dagos are
crazy when it comes to their wives.

227
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:38,111
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

228
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,114
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop!

229
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:44,784
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop.

230
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,744
Stop that!

231
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:53,084
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

232
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,377
Fredo!

233
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:59,299
- I can't control her, Mikey.
- You're my brother, Fredo. You don't have to apologize to me.

234
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:07,307
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers
three territories in the Bronx after he died.

235
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,850
You took over, and you didn't give it to them.

236
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,226
- I welched?
- You welched. 

237
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,772
Clemenza promised them <i>lu cazzo.</i>
Clemenza promised them nothing.

238
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:20,487
- He hated those son of a bitches more than I do.
- Frankie, they feel cheated.

239
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:25,575
Michael, you're sitting high up in the Sierra Mountains
and you're drinking...

240
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,994
- What's he drinking, Cicci?
- Champagne.

241
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:33,208
Champagne cocktails, and you're passing
judgement on how I run my family.

242
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,170
Your family's still called Corleone.

243
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,424
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

244
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,512
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

245
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,680
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

246
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,849
...with Hyman Roth!

247
00:30:56,189 --> 00:31:00,735
You're a good old man. I like you.

248
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,238
And you were loyal to my father for years.

249
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:08,868
The Rosato brothers, they're taking hostages.

250
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,959
And Mike, they spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

251
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,920
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.

252
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:22,882
- You don't want 'em touched.
- No, I want you to be fair with them.

253
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,385
You want me to be fair with them?

254
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,971
How can you be fair to animals?

255
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:34,310
Tom, for Christ's sakes, listen. They recruit
spics, they recruit niggers.

256
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:38,189
And they do violence in their grandmothers' 
neighbourhoods!

257
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:44,737
And I tell ya, everything with them is whores!
Whores and junk, dope!

258
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,490
And they leave the gambling to last.

259
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:52,787
Now, I wanna run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

260
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,707
- No.
<i>- Morte.</i>

261
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:06,217
Now, I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

262
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:12,432
Then you'll give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood?

263
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:19,564
Come on. You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

264
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:24,319
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, your father respected Hyman Roth,

265
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:27,572
but your father never trusted Hyman Roth

266
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:31,117
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.

267
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:36,706
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm tired, and I'm a little drunk!

268
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,252
And I want everybody here to know,

269
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,088
there's not gonna be no trouble
from me!

270
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,341
Don Corleone.

271
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,468
Cicci, the door...

272
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,936
You want him to leave now?

273
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:05,985
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

274
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,656
The old man had too much wine.

275
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,162
It's late.

276
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,009
How's the baby?

277
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:34,514
- Sleeping inside me.
- Does it feel like a boy?

278
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:37,725
Yes, it does, Michael.

279
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,604
Kay?

280
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:46,275
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

281
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,695
It couldn't be helped, though.

282
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,031
It made me think
of what you once told me.

283
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:58,121
"In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate."

284
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:01,082
That was seven years ago.

285
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,380
I know. I'm trying, darling.

286
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,945
Did you see this?

287
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,197
Mmm-hmm.

288
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:29,796
Why are the drapes open?

289
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,408
- Kay, you all right?
- Yeah.

290
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:02,161
- Are you hit?
- No.

291
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,249
It's over. It's over.

292
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,586
Now! Shut it off!

293
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,339
Hold it!

294
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:28,646
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

295
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,857
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

296
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,483
Rocco! Alive!

297
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,695
Stay by the door.

298
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:57,109
Yeah, come in.

299
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,036
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

300
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,168
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

301
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:19,298
Now, I know that's upset you in the past.

302
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:24,595
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

303
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:30,726
But it's because I admire you
and I love you

304
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,604
that I kept things secret from you.

305
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:38,234
That's why at this moment you're
the only one I can completely trust.

306
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,947
Fredo?

307
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,616
Well, he's got a good heart.

308
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,287
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

309
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:54,333
Tom, you're my brother.

310
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,177
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

311
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:09,890
I know that.

312
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,024
You're gonna take over.

313
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,318
You're gonna be the Don.

314
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:29,744
If what I think has happened
has happened, I'm gonna leave here tonight.

315
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:36,667
I give you complete power over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

316
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:42,048
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife

317
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,176
and my children,
the future of this family.

318
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:53,517
- When we catch these guys do you think we'll be able to
find out who's back of all this? 
- We're not gonna catch 'em.

319
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:59,023
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

320
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,778
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

321
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:08,491
Inside. Very, very frightened
they botched it.

322
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:13,162
Yeah, but your people, Rocco and Neri. You don't think that 
they had something to do with this?

323
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:21,045
See, all our people are businessmen.

324
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,716
Their loyalty's based on that.

325
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:30,554
One thing I learned from Pop

326
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:35,559
was to try to think
as people around you think.

327
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,356
Now, on that basis, anything's possible.

328
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:46,070
I seen them!
Right out my window!

329
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,406
- I wanna get out of here! They're lying there dead!
- Get her inside!

330
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,254
Over here! There's two of 'em.

331
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,591
Looks like they were hired
out of New York. I don't recognize 'em.

332
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:11,262
We won't get anything out of them now.

333
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:13,472
Fish 'em out.

334
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:40,166
All right, get rid of the bodies.

335
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,294
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

336
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,579
Anthony, everything's gonna be all right. 
Try to sleep.

337
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:39,266
- Did you like your party?
- I got lots of presents.

338
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:42,770
I know. Did you like 'em?

339
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:46,232
I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

340
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,568
Well, they were friends.

341
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:55,824
- Did you see my present for you?
- It was on my pillow.

342
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:01,497
Anthony, I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

343
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:06,669
- Will you take me?
- No, I can't, Anthony.

344
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:11,674
- Why do you have to go?
- 'Cause I have to do business.

345
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:15,469
I could help you.

346
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:20,975
Someday you will.

347
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:24,353
Get some sleep.

348
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:43,891
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

349
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:08,791
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

350
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:22,096
I left Naples. I left Mama.

351
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,224
For a no-good tramp!

352
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:31,563
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

353
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:37,027
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

354
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:40,989
Without news from home.

355
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:52,209
Finally, a letter from Naples!

356
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:58,132
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

357
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:01,009
She's very beautiful.

358
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:06,515
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

359
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:09,059
Our dear mother -

360
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:13,439
...is dead!

361
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:12,956
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

362
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,379
Sit down, you bum!

363
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,138
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

364
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,315
We'll go see her backstage.

365
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:42,861
Who was that?

366
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,447
The Black Hand.

367
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,399
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

368
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,859
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

369
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:27,072
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

370
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:29,741
You'll pay me today!

371
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,753
Let's go.

372
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,175
Not my daughter! Let her go!

373
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:50,762
Here, take all my money!

374
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:01,356
Vito, come on.

375
00:49:07,821 --> 00:49:11,116
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

376
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,120
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighbourhood pays him.

377
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,539
Even my father, in the grocery store.

378
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,041
If he's Italian...

379
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,545
...why does he bother other Italians?

380
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,048
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

381
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,342
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

382
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:30,302
If you're happy, I'm happy.

383
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:20,394
Don't you feel well?

384
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:26,274
Is your boss treating you all right?

385
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,070
Forget it.

386
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,961
Hey, you speak Italian?

387
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,051
Hide this for me!

388
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:55,721
Next week I'll come and get it!

389
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,679
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

390
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:44,686
How's business?

391
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,944
It's good, it's good.

392
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:02,996
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighbourhood's getting sloppy.

393
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:07,167
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

394
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,628
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

395
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,719
So Fanucci's changing?

396
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,555
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

397
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:23,725
Even from my father.

398
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:27,854
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

399
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,222
I've got some bad news.

400
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:09,020
I feel rotten about telling you this...

401
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,777
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

402
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:25,453
And you have to give him my job.

403
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:29,708
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

404
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,044
You looked after me like a father.

405
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:34,921
I thank you.

406
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:38,466
And I won't forget it.

407
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,815
Vito!

408
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,821
Oh, no!

409
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:03,283
Take this to your family.

410
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:07,913
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

411
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:45,075
What a nice pear!

412
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:11,101
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

413
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:16,231
Did you look inside?

414
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:20,610
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

415
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:34,165
A friend of mine has a nice rug.

416
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:36,251
Maybe your wife would like it.

417
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:46,803
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

418
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:52,392
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favour.

419
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,527
Yeah, sure.

420
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,612
My wife would like it.

421
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,598
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

422
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,479
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

423
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,277
Well, he won't mind.

424
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,956
Come on in.

425
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:00,085
Hey, Vito, come on in!

426
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:25,110
This is your friend's place?

427
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:29,781
This is a real palace.

428
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,950
One of the best.

429
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,625
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

430
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:40,078
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

431
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,311
Come on in.

432
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:15,483
It's all right. Come on. Hyman's in there.

433
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:20,405
- I was just making some lunch. Would you like a tuna sandwich?
- Uh, no, thank you.

434
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:30,456
<i>...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...</i>

435
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:35,294
- Mr Roth?
- Come in, Michael.

436
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:39,841
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

437
01:02:41,676 --> 01:02:43,761
It's almost over.

438
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:50,351
- You follow the football game?
- Not for a while I haven't.

439
01:02:50,852 --> 01:02:54,021
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

440
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:59,193
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

441
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:05,032
I've loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

442
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:13,499
I heard you had some trouble.

443
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,045
Stupid.

444
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:22,133
People behaving like that with guns.

445
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:26,971
The important thing is you're all right.

446
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:30,224
Good health, the most important thing.

447
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:34,061
More than success, more than money.

448
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,315
More than power.

449
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:55,416
I came here because there's
gonna be more bloodshed.

450
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:59,587
I want you to know about it before it happens so
that there's no danger of starting another war.

451
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,799
Nobody wants another war.

452
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:09,680
Frank Pentangeli came to my home and he asked
my permission to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

453
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:13,601
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

454
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,686
I'll visit him soon.

455
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:20,608
The important thing is that nothing
interfere with our plans for the future.

456
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:24,153
- Yours and mine.
- Nothing is more important.

457
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:31,118
- You're a wise and considerate young man.
- And you're a great man, Mr Roth.

458
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:37,083
- There's much I can learn from you.
- Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

459
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:42,004
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Come in.

460
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:46,509
- Thank you, my dear.
- Hyman, you're gonna break my ear drums.

461
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:50,471
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

462
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:58,813
You're young, I'm old and sick.

463
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:03,859
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history, Michael.

464
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:08,030
History. It's never been done before.

465
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:12,827
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

466
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:19,375
And Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

467
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:23,796
He's small potatoes.

468
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:35,891
What's up?

469
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:40,688
We got company?

470
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:56,287
What's going on?

471
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,997
Michael Corleone is here.

472
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,375
Where is he?

473
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,336
He's in your den. You better hurry.

474
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:06,047
He's been waiting a half hour.

475
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,389
Is something wrong?

476
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:23,314
Don Corleone, I wish you would've
let me know you were comin'.

477
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:27,360
- I could've prepared something for you.
- I didn't want you to know I was coming.

478
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:39,205
- You heard what happened in my home?
- Mike, I almost died myself. We were all so relieved...

479
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,415
In my home!

480
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:47,380
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

481
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:52,426
Where my children come and play with their toys.

482
01:06:53,886 --> 01:06:55,930
In my home.

483
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:16,117
I want you to help me take my revenge.

484
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:19,829
Michael, anything. What can I do?

485
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:26,168
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

486
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:28,921
Mike, I don't understand. I don't...

487
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:33,968
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

488
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:38,806
That Hyman Roth in Miami. That--
He's backing up those son-of-a-bitches.

489
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:43,686
- I know he is.
- Then why? Why do you ask me to lay down to him, Mike?

490
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:52,945
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

491
01:07:54,655 --> 01:07:57,199
I know it was him.

492
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,369
Jesus Christ, Mike.

493
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:05,291
Jesus Christ, look, let's get 'em all.
Let's hit 'em all now, while we got the muscle.

494
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:13,174
This used to be my father's old study.

495
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,677
It's changed.

496
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:21,849
I remember there used to be a...a big desk was here.

497
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:30,191
I remember when I was a kid, Frankie,
we had to be very quiet when we played near here.

498
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:41,535
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

499
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,874
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

500
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:53,214
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

501
01:08:57,259 --> 01:09:03,390
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

502
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:09,605
Now, if Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in
this thing in the Rosato brothers' favor...

503
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:13,150
he's gonna think his relationship
with me is still good.

504
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:18,405
That's what I want him to think.

505
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:23,244
I want him completely relaxed and 
confident in our friendship.

506
01:09:23,911 --> 01:09:27,915
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

507
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,863
- Yeah?
<i>- Fredo, this is Johnny.</i>

508
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:03,450
<i>- Johnny Ola. We need some more help.</i>
- Johnny?

509
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:07,162
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

510
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:08,289
Who is that, honey?

511
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,624
<i>Listen good, Fredo.</i>

512
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:13,711
What are you callin' me here for?
I don't want to talk to you.

513
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:17,172
<i>Pentangeli's set up a meeting with the Rosato brothers.
He says he's gonna go for their deal.</i>

514
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:19,466
- Oh, God.
<i>- Will he come alone?</i>

515
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:22,803
- I don't know anything. You got me in deep enough already.
- Just go along.

516
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:28,142
<i>Everything will be all right, Fredo. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.</i>

517
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:32,688
<i>All we wanna know is if he's on
the level, or if he's gonna bring his boys.</i>

518
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:35,983
You guys lied to me. I don't want you
to call me any more.

519
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:41,071
<i>- Your brother's not gonna find out we talked.</i>
- I don't know what you're talking about.

520
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:55,502
- Who was that?
- Uh, wrong number.

521
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:06,847
- Frank, I got nobody here.
- Wait in the car, Cicc'.

522
01:11:06,931 --> 01:11:09,683
- Frankie.
- It's okay, Cicc'.

523
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,945
- What's this, Rosato?
- A lucky C note for our new deal.

524
01:11:23,614 --> 01:11:26,450
Ritchie. Give us a taste, huh?

525
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:34,667
Yeah, we're all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

526
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:39,046
- You're not gonna regret it.
- I don't like this "C" note, Rosato.

527
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,715
I take that as an insult.

528
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:43,926
Michael Corleone says hello!

529
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:04,405
Get him in! Close the door!

530
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,532
Your friend the cop.
What the--

531
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:11,203
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

532
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:15,082
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

533
01:12:17,459 --> 01:12:19,545
What's the matter?

534
01:12:19,628 --> 01:12:22,715
- Is that something on the floor?
- Carmine, not here!

535
01:12:22,798 --> 01:12:24,299
Anthony!

536
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:30,431
You open your fuckin' mouth,
I'll blow your head off!

537
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:19,396
Freddie. Good to see ya.

538
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:26,653
- Where is he?
- He's okay. He's in the back.

539
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:32,826
Come on, girls.
Take a hike, huh?

540
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:37,998
In this room here.

541
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:44,338
- I want to talk to him alone first.
- Come on, huh?

542
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:55,849
I thought I could help you, Senator.

543
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,522
Hagen?

544
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:06,860
- Listen, Hagen, I did not...
- No. It's all right.

545
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:11,740
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. You're very lucky.

546
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:17,204
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

547
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:22,376
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

548
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:28,632
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

549
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:33,971
- And I don't know how it happened.
- You can't remember?

550
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:39,393
I passed out.

551
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:58,579
Just a game. Jesus.

552
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:11,633
Jesus, Jesus!

553
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:18,348
Jesus God!

554
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:20,017
Oh God!

555
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,648
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

556
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:29,943
You don't have to remember.
Just do as I say.

557
01:15:30,027 --> 01:15:35,574
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

558
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:41,330
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

559
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:46,001
- As his guest.
- I do remember that she was laughing.

560
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:53,759
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

561
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:58,680
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

562
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:01,767
It'll be as though she never existed.

563
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:07,105
All that's left is our friendship.

564
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,332
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone. We're not to let you through.

565
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:30,712
- I'm just going to the market.
- Well, if you'll just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.

566
01:16:30,796 --> 01:16:33,924
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. He's coming over now.

567
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:36,468
All right, well, I'm just gonna
have to speak to Mr. Hagen.

568
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:45,811
I wanted to explain this,
but I had business in Carson City.

569
01:16:45,978 --> 01:16:50,357
Now this is Michael's request for your safety.
Now we can send out for anything that you need.

570
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:55,737
- I see. I'm supposed to stay in my house?
- No, within the compound will be fine.

571
01:16:55,821 --> 01:16:58,991
- Tom, I was going to take the children to New England next week.
- That's off now.

572
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:02,744
- Am I a prisoner, is that it?
- That's not the way we look at it, Kay.

573
01:17:03,704 --> 01:17:06,957
All right. Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

574
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:10,335
Joe.

575
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,883
Cuba, Cuba!

576
01:18:38,924 --> 01:18:40,384
Most respected gentlemen...

577
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:44,221
allow me to welcome you to the city of Havana.

578
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:51,019
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists

579
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:55,148
for continuing to work with Cuba

580
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:59,194
toward the greatest period of prosperity

581
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,531
in her entire history.

582
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,243
Mr William Shaw,

583
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:08,203
representing
the General Fruit Company.

584
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:12,124
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,

585
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:15,001
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

586
01:19:17,295 --> 01:19:18,797
Mr Petty,

587
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,008
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

588
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:26,888
Mr Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

589
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:31,226
Mr Michael Corleone of Nevada,

590
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:36,481
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

591
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:40,569
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,

592
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:45,073
Mr Hyman Roth.

593
01:19:45,323 --> 01:19:50,537
I would like to take this opportunity to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their lovely Christmas gift.

594
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,961
A solid gold telephone.

595
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:02,340
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to take a look at it.

596
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,595
- Mr President?
- Yes?

597
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:12,309
Perhaps you would discuss the status of rebel activity
and what this can mean to our businesses?

598
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,019
- Of course.
- Heavy stuff.

599
01:20:14,102 --> 01:20:19,774
I want to assure you that although the rebels have
mounted an impressive campaign in Las Villas...

600
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:32,245
my staff indicates, with assurance, that we'll
drive them out of the city of Santa Clara

601
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:33,538
before the New Year.

602
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,542
I want to put you all at ease.

603
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:42,380
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

604
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:03,735
He said that they're making an arrest,

605
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:06,571
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

606
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:07,739
Johnny...

607
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:08,865
It's nothing.

608
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:12,327
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

609
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:16,831
<i>Viva Fidel!</i>

610
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:37,561
Well, I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

611
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:42,566
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

612
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,196
I'm very pleased

613
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:52,909
you were all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

614
01:21:54,452 --> 01:21:57,289
When a man comes
to this point in his life,

615
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:02,127
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

616
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:07,299
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had

617
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:13,847
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

618
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:16,641
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear!

619
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:20,854
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

620
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:27,152
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana

621
01:22:27,235 --> 01:22:30,280
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

622
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:35,160
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.

623
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:39,289
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier

624
01:22:39,372 --> 01:22:41,750
than any of the rough joints we put in Vegas.

625
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:45,337
And we can thank our friends
in the Cuban government

626
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:50,175
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis,

627
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:53,094
has relaxed restrictions on imports.

628
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:57,599
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...

629
01:22:57,682 --> 01:23:00,518
Real partnership with a government.

630
01:23:00,602 --> 01:23:02,520
Smaller piece.

631
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:08,234
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

632
01:23:08,318 --> 01:23:12,030
At the time of my retirement, or death,

633
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:18,036
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

634
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:21,956
But, all of you will share.

635
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,919
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

636
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:29,339
the Capri to the Corleone family,

637
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:31,841
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

638
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:35,553
but Eddie Levine of Newport will bring in the
Pennino brothers,

639
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:37,889
Dino and Eddie, for a piece

640
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:40,725
and also to handle the actual casino operations.

641
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:44,270
And we've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

642
01:23:44,354 --> 01:23:48,066
to make sure that things go smooth
back home.

643
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:55,198
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

644
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:57,742
- Happy birthday!
<i>- L'chaim!</i>

645
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:01,705
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

646
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:06,167
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

647
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:10,714
And rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had hidden in his jacket.

648
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:14,426
He killed himself and he took a captain
of the command with him. Right, Johnny?

649
01:24:14,509 --> 01:24:18,304
- Those rebels, you know they're lunatics.
- Maybe so.

650
01:24:19,973 --> 01:24:24,936
But it occurred to me, the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

651
01:24:25,019 --> 01:24:28,773
- What does that tell you?
- They could win.

652
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:34,863
This country has had rebels
for the last 50 years. It's in their blood.

653
01:24:34,946 --> 01:24:38,700
Believe me I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

654
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:42,579
We were running molasses out of 
Havana when you were a baby.

655
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:45,248
The trucks owned by your father.

656
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:47,959
Michael.

657
01:24:55,049 --> 01:24:59,220
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

658
01:25:00,847 --> 01:25:03,933
The two million never got to the island.

659
01:25:09,564 --> 01:25:12,734
I wouldn't want it to get around
that you held back the money...

660
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:15,278
because you had second thoughts
about the rebels.

661
01:25:22,076 --> 01:25:25,371
Ah, sit down, Michael. Sit down.

662
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:36,674
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

663
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:43,556
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

664
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:49,687
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

665
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:53,483
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

666
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:57,737
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

667
01:25:58,905 --> 01:26:02,367
90 miles. It's nothing.

668
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:09,290
Just one small step, looking for a man that wants
to be President of the United States

669
01:26:09,374 --> 01:26:12,293
and having the cash
to make it possible.

670
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:14,212
Michael,

671
01:26:16,089 --> 01:26:18,508
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

672
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:48,246
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

673
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:54,252
- Hi! Freddy Corleone.
<i>- Mio frati.</i>

674
01:26:55,545 --> 01:26:57,547
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

675
01:26:58,047 --> 01:27:01,259
The whole time I'm thinkin' what if somebody knows
what I've got in here.

676
01:27:01,718 --> 01:27:06,222
Can you imagine that, huh? Two million
dollars in the seat next to me on that plane.

677
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:12,228
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

678
01:27:14,272 --> 01:27:16,065
You want to count it?

679
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:24,115
Mikey, what the hell's goin' on anyway?
I'm totally in the dark.

680
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,995
The family is making an investment in Havana.
This is a little gift for the President.

681
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:33,499
Well, that's great. Havana's great.

682
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:37,170
It's my kind of town.

683
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:43,217
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

684
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:48,765
No. I've never met them.

685
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:56,439
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

686
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:01,736
Kind of nervous from the trip.

687
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:04,864
Can I get a drink or something?

688
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:08,159
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

689
01:28:08,952 --> 01:28:12,413
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.

690
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:19,045
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

691
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:22,966
Have kids. Have a family.

692
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:29,055
For once in my life, be more like

693
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:31,599
Pop.

694
01:28:33,935 --> 01:28:38,481
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

695
01:28:38,648 --> 01:28:41,818
Mama used to tease me. She'd say,
"You don't belong to me."

696
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:45,446
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

697
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,657
Sometimes I think it's true.

698
01:28:48,533 --> 01:28:50,702
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

699
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:55,873
Mikey, I--I was mad at you.

700
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:07,176
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

701
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:09,887
You want a drink, right? Waiter!

702
01:29:14,058 --> 01:29:16,185
<i>Por favor...</i>

703
01:29:17,562 --> 01:29:20,440
- How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
- Banana Daiquiri.

704
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:22,900
- That's it?
- That's it.

705
01:29:22,984 --> 01:29:25,069
<i>Uno</i> Banana Daiquiri

706
01:29:25,695 --> 01:29:28,364
and a club soda.

707
01:29:36,164 --> 01:29:38,916
Senator Geary's flying in from
Washington tomorrow night...

708
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,502
with some people, some government people.

709
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:45,256
I want you to show 'em
a good time in Havana.

710
01:29:47,133 --> 01:29:51,262
- It's my speciality, right?
- Can I trust you with something?

711
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:54,432
Of course, Mike.

712
01:29:56,601 --> 01:30:00,438
Later on in the evening, we're all invited
to the presidential palace...

713
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:02,231
a reception to bring in the new year.

714
01:30:02,732 --> 01:30:08,446
After it's over, they're gonna take me home
in a military car, alone...

715
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:10,281
for my protection.

716
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:14,869
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

717
01:30:32,929 --> 01:30:35,807
- Who?
- Roth.

718
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:44,565
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

719
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:48,820
It was Roth all along.

720
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:52,824
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

721
01:30:53,908 --> 01:30:57,078
But he thinks he's gonna live forever
and he wants me out.

722
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:06,546
- How can I help?
- Just go along, as though you know nothing.

723
01:31:06,671 --> 01:31:09,382
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

724
01:31:10,675 --> 01:31:13,052
Hyman Roth will never see the New Year.

725
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:34,490
He says you have to take it easy and he's gonna 
give you a prescription. He'll be back tomorrow.

726
01:31:34,574 --> 01:31:36,909
I want my own doctor.
Fly him in from Miami.

727
01:31:36,993 --> 01:31:39,495
I don't trust a doctor
can't speak English.

728
01:31:40,997 --> 01:31:43,875
<i>- Gracias, señor.</i>
<i>- Buenas noches.</i>

729
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:49,380
- Honey, go down to the casino.
- If you're sure you're feeling better.

730
01:31:49,547 --> 01:31:51,215
Feel fine.

731
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:57,221
- Play the bingo game.
- Okay. Nice to see you, Mr Paul.

732
01:31:59,724 --> 01:32:04,729
My sixth sense tells me your brother Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

733
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:13,779
- You're pulling out?
- Just wanna... Just wanna wait.

734
01:32:17,408 --> 01:32:20,912
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

735
01:32:21,078 --> 01:32:24,624
I'd give four million just to be able to take a piss
without it hurting.

736
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:30,963
- Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
- The Rosato brothers.

737
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:34,300
I know. But who gave the go-ahead?

738
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:36,886
I know I didn't.

739
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:49,899
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

740
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:56,572
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

741
01:32:56,656 --> 01:33:00,451
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good. We made the most of it.

742
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:06,290
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

743
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:09,502
Made a fortune. Your father, too.

744
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:17,176
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

745
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:25,851
Later on he had an idea to build a city

746
01:33:25,935 --> 01:33:29,689
out of a desert stop-over
for G.I.s on their way to the West Coast.

747
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:35,278
That kid's name was Moe Greene

748
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:39,031
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

749
01:33:40,491 --> 01:33:42,952
This was a great man.

750
01:33:43,035 --> 01:33:45,413
A man of vision and guts.

751
01:33:45,538 --> 01:33:51,836
And there isn't even a plaque
or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.

752
01:33:53,838 --> 01:33:57,466
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

753
01:33:58,676 --> 01:34:01,012
No one knows who gave the order.

754
01:34:02,013 --> 01:34:05,266
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

755
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:11,314
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

756
01:34:11,397 --> 01:34:16,235
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

757
01:34:17,987 --> 01:34:19,739
And I said to myself,

758
01:34:21,324 --> 01:34:25,244
"This is the business we've chosen."

759
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:27,580
I didn't ask

760
01:34:28,164 --> 01:34:33,377
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

761
01:34:41,886 --> 01:34:46,390
That two million in a bag in your room...

762
01:34:48,601 --> 01:34:52,271
I'm going in to take a nap.

763
01:34:52,938 --> 01:34:58,277
When I wake, if the money's on the table
I'll know I have a partner.

764
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:01,947
If it isn't, I'll know I don't.

765
01:35:56,961 --> 01:36:01,173
All right, does everybody know everybody here, huh?
This is Senator Geary, you know him.

766
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,468
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we could spend this time together.

767
01:36:04,552 --> 01:36:07,513
- This is Senator Payton from Florida.
- How you doing, Mike?


768
01:36:07,847 --> 01:36:09,432
- And Judge DeMalco from New York.
- How do you do, sir?

769
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:14,019
- Fine, thank you.
- Senator Ream from Maryland.

770
01:36:14,145 --> 01:36:16,605
- I've been looking forward to this.
- This is Fred Corngold from U.T.T.

771
01:36:16,689 --> 01:36:20,651
- I know Fred. How are you?
- Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha so watch out later on.

772
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:23,028
- Oh, he does, huh?
- All right gentlemen, it's refill time here.

773
01:36:23,154 --> 01:36:27,616
You might try some of them local drinks, you know--
uh, cuba libre, pina colada.

774
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:31,579
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.

775
01:36:31,704 --> 01:36:34,540
- That you got! <i>Con gusto...</i>
- Johnny!

776
01:36:35,708 --> 01:36:39,253
You don't know my brother Fredo, do you, Johnny?
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

777
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:43,048
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

778
01:36:44,258 --> 01:36:46,719
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

779
01:36:46,886 --> 01:36:48,554
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

780
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:51,599
<i>- Feliz Año Nuevo!</i>
- Happy New Year.

781
01:37:03,277 --> 01:37:05,613
Hey, Freddy,
why are we standing?

782
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:07,406
Everybody stands.

783
01:37:07,573 --> 01:37:12,203
- But it's worth it. You watch. You're not gonna believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

784
01:37:12,286 --> 01:37:15,414
- That's right. Fifty dollars.
- You got a bet, mister.

785
01:37:23,589 --> 01:37:25,090
That's him. That's Superman.

786
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:01,335
- Jesus Christ!
- Did I tell ya, or did I tell ya?

787
01:38:03,087 --> 01:38:05,631
- I don't believe it.
- That thing's gotta be a fake.

788
01:38:05,798 --> 01:38:09,134
That ain't no fake. That's real.
That's why they call him Superman.

789
01:38:09,635 --> 01:38:13,681
Hey, Freddie. Freddie.
Where did you find this place?

790
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:18,185
Johnny Ola told me about this place. He brought me here.
I didn't believe it, but seein' is believin', huh?

791
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:21,730
- I see it, and I still don't believe it!
- 50 bucks, Pat.

792
01:38:21,814 --> 01:38:25,401
Old man Roth'd never come here, but ol' Johnny knows these
places like the back of his hand.

793
01:38:26,318 --> 01:38:28,571
Now watch him. He's gonna break the cracker with it.

794
01:38:28,654 --> 01:38:31,323
I wanna see him break a brick!

795
01:39:53,238 --> 01:39:56,617
Relax, Senor Roth. We're taking you to the hospital.

796
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:48,168
And in my judgment you'll continue to get those...

797
01:40:48,335 --> 01:40:52,756
because I don't believe that President
Eisenhower will ever pull out of Cuba.

798
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:56,510
Not as long as we have over one billion
dollars invested in this country.

799
01:41:00,013 --> 01:41:03,308
Now, the American public
believes in nonintervention.

800
01:41:03,392 --> 01:41:06,311
Fredo! Where are you going?

801
01:41:06,395 --> 01:41:10,065
I'm gonna get me a real drink,
'cause I can't--

802
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:09,208
What kept Mr Roth?
I understood he was coming.

803
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:12,795
Hey Ream, what's the protocol? How long
should we stay around here?

804
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:16,048
Oh, I don't know. I think
a half hour oughta do it.

805
01:42:16,131 --> 01:42:19,134
Just long enough
to bring in the New Year.

806
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:37,903
It's New Year's Eve.
Come on, just for a minute.

807
01:43:52,853 --> 01:43:57,024
There's a plane waiting for us
to take us to Miami in an hour.

808
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,818
Don't make a big thing about it.

809
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:07,034
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

810
01:44:08,535 --> 01:44:10,329
You broke my heart!

811
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:52,621
Due to serious setbacks to our

812
01:44:52,704 --> 01:44:55,082
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

813
01:44:55,999 --> 01:44:58,335
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

814
01:45:00,712 --> 01:45:04,883
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

815
01:45:05,634 --> 01:45:08,804
And I shall leave the city immediately.

816
01:45:13,016 --> 01:45:16,019
I wish all of you good luck.

817
01:45:23,402 --> 01:45:26,446
<i>Salud!</i>

818
01:45:27,656 --> 01:45:31,076
<i>Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!</i>

819
01:45:52,889 --> 01:45:54,433
Fredo!

820
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:59,062
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

821
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:01,606
Roth is dead. Fredo!

822
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,611
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother. Fredo!

823
01:46:07,738 --> 01:46:09,239
Fredo!

824
01:46:33,847 --> 01:46:36,683
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

825
01:47:06,338 --> 01:47:09,674
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

826
01:47:50,006 --> 01:47:53,552
Al. Get me a wet towel.

827
01:48:00,016 --> 01:48:02,894
Kay know I'm back?

828
01:48:06,982 --> 01:48:10,068
What about my boy? Did you get
him something for Christmas?

829
01:48:10,152 --> 01:48:13,572
- I took care of it.
- What was it, so I'll know.

830
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:18,743
It was a little car with an electric
motor that he could ride in. It's nice.

831
01:48:21,329 --> 01:48:23,415
Thank you, Al.

832
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:28,044
Fellas, could you step outside
for a minute, please?

833
01:48:45,103 --> 01:48:46,855
Where's my brother?

834
01:48:47,772 --> 01:48:50,942
Uh, Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

835
01:48:51,067 --> 01:48:55,780
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard's dead.

836
01:48:55,906 --> 01:48:57,741
I asked about Fredo.

837
01:48:58,742 --> 01:49:02,120
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

838
01:49:05,123 --> 01:49:06,541
All right.

839
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,629
I want you to get in touch with him.

840
01:49:10,712 --> 01:49:13,506
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

841
01:49:13,632 --> 01:49:18,970
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they were gonna try to kill me.

842
01:49:19,888 --> 01:49:24,142
- They can come in now.
- There was something else.

843
01:49:25,143 --> 01:49:26,645
What?

844
01:49:33,652 --> 01:49:35,445
What? Come on. What?

845
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:39,741
Kay had a miscarriage. She lost the baby.

846
01:49:52,671 --> 01:49:55,090
- Was it a boy?
- Mikey, at three and a half months...

847
01:49:55,173 --> 01:49:59,386
Now can't you give me
a straight answer anymore? Was it a boy?

848
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:04,766
I really don't know.

849
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:22,993
Poor little Fredo,
he's got pneumonia.

850
01:51:08,371 --> 01:51:12,125
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

851
01:51:12,459 --> 01:51:16,212
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

852
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:18,840
You know I've got three daughters.

853
01:51:19,341 --> 01:51:21,009
This is my neighbourhood.

854
01:51:21,843 --> 01:51:25,221
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

855
01:51:26,348 --> 01:51:30,101
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

856
01:51:32,437 --> 01:51:36,066
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

857
01:51:36,775 --> 01:51:41,237
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

858
01:51:41,654 --> 01:51:46,701
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

859
01:51:49,037 --> 01:51:51,456
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

860
01:51:51,873 --> 01:51:54,417
And your family will be ruined.

861
01:51:55,627 --> 01:52:00,924
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

862
01:52:01,591 --> 01:52:05,595
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

863
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:07,806
Now don't refuse me.

864
01:52:09,724 --> 01:52:11,476
Understand, paisan?

865
01:52:17,982 --> 01:52:19,401
I understand.

866
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:26,491
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

867
01:52:27,867 --> 01:52:32,205
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

868
01:52:36,459 --> 01:52:38,711
Don't be afraid to tell them!

869
01:52:41,131 --> 01:52:42,882
600 bucks...

870
01:52:43,174 --> 01:52:45,468
Suppose we don't pay?

871
01:52:46,636 --> 01:52:50,056
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

872
01:52:50,849 --> 01:52:54,227
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighbourhood.

873
01:52:55,145 --> 01:52:58,648
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We <i>have</i> to pay him.

874
01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:01,276
$200 each... everybody agreed?

875
01:53:05,822 --> 01:53:07,323
Why do we have to pay him?

876
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:10,201
Vito, leave this to us.

877
01:53:11,828 --> 01:53:14,289
He's one person, we're three.

878
01:53:14,581 --> 01:53:17,250
He's got guns, we've got guns.

879
01:53:17,792 --> 01:53:21,129
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

880
01:53:21,379 --> 01:53:23,590
This is <i>his</i> neighbourhood!

881
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:29,846
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

882
01:53:30,346 --> 01:53:31,890
Who?

883
01:53:32,223 --> 01:53:36,227
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.

884
01:53:36,311 --> 01:53:37,812
They don't pay Fanucci.

885
01:53:39,606 --> 01:53:44,527
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody <i>else</i> collects for Maranzalla!

886
01:53:45,695 --> 01:53:49,699
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

887
01:54:05,256 --> 01:54:08,051
Now what I say stays in this room.

888
01:54:08,259 --> 01:54:13,097
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

889
01:54:16,267 --> 01:54:19,604
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

890
01:54:22,232 --> 01:54:24,526
If Fanucci says $200...

891
01:54:24,609 --> 01:54:26,069
...he <i>means</i> it, Vito!

892
01:54:26,528 --> 01:54:29,447
I'll reason with him.

893
01:54:31,616 --> 01:54:33,618
Leave everything to me.

894
01:54:34,285 --> 01:54:36,287
I'll take care of everything.

895
01:54:37,956 --> 01:54:40,583
I never lie to my friends.

896
01:54:41,417 --> 01:54:44,295
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

897
01:54:44,629 --> 01:54:46,464
He'll ask for the money.

898
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:53,388
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

899
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:56,599
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

900
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:01,563
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

901
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:04,941
How can you get him to take less?

902
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:07,485
That's my business.

903
01:55:08,152 --> 01:55:11,489
Just remember that I did you a favour.

904
01:55:15,326 --> 01:55:16,828
Is it a deal?

905
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:19,664
Yes.

906
01:56:07,503 --> 01:56:09,881
His family's out of the house.

907
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:12,550
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

908
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:21,142
Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
<i>Buona fortuna.</i>

909
01:56:32,195 --> 01:56:34,739
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

910
01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:42,538
I'll make an offer
he don't refuse. Don't worry.

911
01:57:15,571 --> 01:57:20,243
It looks like there's -
$100 under my hat.

912
01:57:32,088 --> 01:57:34,298
I was right.

913
01:57:35,758 --> 01:57:37,510
Only $100...

914
01:57:40,888 --> 01:57:43,141
I'm short of money right now.

915
01:57:45,017 --> 01:57:49,605
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

916
01:57:50,481 --> 01:57:52,692
You understand, don't you?

917
01:58:00,908 --> 01:58:03,536
You've got balls, young man!

918
01:58:05,538 --> 01:58:08,583
How come I never heard
of you before?

919
01:58:15,131 --> 01:58:17,508
You've got a lot of guts.

920
01:58:21,471 --> 01:58:24,432
I'll find you some work
for good money.

921
01:58:35,818 --> 01:58:40,072
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

922
01:58:42,867 --> 01:58:45,286
You've done well for yourself.

923
01:58:49,207 --> 01:58:51,334
Enjoy the festa!

924
02:01:00,588 --> 02:01:02,924
Oh, this is too violent for me!

925
02:03:24,982 --> 02:03:26,484
What've you got there?

926
02:06:05,142 --> 02:06:09,021
Michael, your father
loves you very much.

927
02:09:34,184 --> 02:09:37,771
<i>Mr Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,</i>

928
02:09:37,855 --> 02:09:41,358
<i>you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?</i>

929
02:09:41,817 --> 02:09:43,444
<i>That's right.</i>

930
02:09:44,361 --> 02:09:48,532
<i>But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization.</i>

931
02:09:51,493 --> 02:09:55,372
<i>No, we called it the Corleone family, Senator. We called
it the family.</i>

932
02:09:55,706 --> 02:09:58,208
<i>What was your position?</i>

933
02:09:59,126 --> 02:10:02,379
<i>At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.</i>

934
02:10:02,504 --> 02:10:05,382
<i>- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator. Come on.</i>

935
02:10:05,507 --> 02:10:07,885
<i>No, I don't know. Tell me.</i>

936
02:10:09,386 --> 02:10:15,058
<i>When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?</i>

937
02:10:15,142 --> 02:10:16,477
<i>Mr Questadt.</i>

938
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:19,229
<i>- You mean you kill people?
- What?</i>

939
02:10:19,313 --> 02:10:24,401
<i>You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.</i>

940
02:10:28,197 --> 02:10:29,740
<i>Yeah, that's right, counselor.</i>

941
02:10:29,823 --> 02:10:35,078
<i>And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?</i>

942
02:10:35,204 --> 02:10:38,290
<i>Yeah, counselor. Michael Corleone, right.</i>

943
02:10:38,415 --> 02:10:42,252
<i>Did you ever get such
an order directly from Michael Corleone?</i>

944
02:10:43,086 --> 02:10:45,088
<i>No, I never talked to him.</i>

945
02:10:45,214 --> 02:10:49,176
<i>Mr Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit, please?</i>

946
02:10:49,259 --> 02:10:52,596
<i>- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?</i>

947
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:58,477
<i>I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?</i>

948
02:10:58,602 --> 02:11:03,106
<i>Someone in between you
and your possible superiors who gave the actual orders.</i>

949
02:11:03,232 --> 02:11:06,777
<i>Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!</i>

950
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:11,198
<i>Mr. Cicci, you may find this very amusing,</i>

951
02:11:11,281 --> 02:11:13,700
<i>but I promise you the members
of this committee do not.</i>

952
02:11:41,937 --> 02:11:44,147
Tell me something, Ma.

953
02:11:48,235 --> 02:11:51,905
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

954
02:11:58,495 --> 02:12:00,330
He was being strong...

955
02:12:06,837 --> 02:12:08,463
Strong for his family.

956
02:12:18,265 --> 02:12:20,934
But by being strong for his family...

957
02:12:22,436 --> 02:12:24,271
...could he...

958
02:12:26,189 --> 02:12:27,524
...lose it?

959
02:12:29,443 --> 02:12:34,823
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

960
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:39,953
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

961
02:12:41,663 --> 02:12:45,375
No, I meant... lose his <i>family.</i>

962
02:12:47,836 --> 02:12:51,340
But you can never lose your family.

963
02:13:00,849 --> 02:13:02,684
Times are changing.

964
02:13:25,248 --> 02:13:27,709
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

965
02:13:28,502 --> 02:13:30,212
Take it as a gift.

966
02:13:33,507 --> 02:13:36,593
If there's something
I can do for you, you come, we talk.

967
02:13:53,944 --> 02:13:56,780
Signora Colombo,
why did you come to see me?

968
02:13:59,783 --> 02:14:03,286
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

969
02:14:05,956 --> 02:14:07,958
She's in bad trouble.

970
02:14:08,625 --> 02:14:12,629
Her neighbours complained to the
landlord about her dog.

971
02:14:14,089 --> 02:14:16,299
He told her to get rid of the animal.

972
02:14:17,968 --> 02:14:22,139
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

973
02:14:22,764 --> 02:14:26,560
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

974
02:14:29,438 --> 02:14:32,274
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

975
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:34,609
I'm so ashamed!

976
02:14:34,985 --> 02:14:39,448
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

977
02:14:42,284 --> 02:14:43,827
I'm sorry, but...

978
02:14:45,829 --> 02:14:49,332
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

979
02:14:50,167 --> 02:14:51,626
I can't move!

980
02:14:53,003 --> 02:14:54,921
I want you to talk to him!

981
02:14:55,505 --> 02:14:58,175
Tell him I want to stay here!

982
02:15:05,974 --> 02:15:07,517
What's your landlord's name?

983
02:15:08,018 --> 02:15:10,020
His name is Signor Roberto.

984
02:15:10,645 --> 02:15:13,023
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

985
02:15:13,690 --> 02:15:16,610
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

986
02:15:17,694 --> 02:15:18,945
A real pig-sty, eh?

987
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:42,302
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

988
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:46,515
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

989
02:15:47,057 --> 02:15:51,311
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

990
02:15:51,561 --> 02:15:55,565
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighbourhood.

991
02:15:55,982 --> 02:15:59,569
I already rented the place
to another family.

992
02:16:05,158 --> 02:16:09,746
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

993
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:14,918
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

994
02:16:15,418 --> 02:16:17,420
So let her stay.

995
02:16:17,504 --> 02:16:19,089
Impossible.

996
02:16:19,923 --> 02:16:21,258
Are you Sicilian?

997
02:16:21,716 --> 02:16:23,385
No, I'm Calabrese.

998
02:16:24,052 --> 02:16:27,347
We're practically <i>paisan,</i>
do me this favour.

999
02:16:27,931 --> 02:16:30,600
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

1000
02:16:31,601 --> 02:16:33,895
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

1001
02:16:34,437 --> 02:16:36,857
How much more a month?

1002
02:16:37,941 --> 02:16:39,067
Five bucks.

1003
02:16:43,947 --> 02:16:46,950
Here's six months increase in advance.

1004
02:16:47,868 --> 02:16:50,954
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

1005
02:16:51,413 --> 02:16:53,623
Come see me in another six months.

1006
02:16:55,458 --> 02:16:58,461
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

1007
02:16:59,629 --> 02:17:00,797
The dog stays.

1008
02:17:04,968 --> 02:17:08,305
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

1009
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:12,726
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

1010
02:17:15,145 --> 02:17:16,938
Do me this favour.

1011
02:17:17,814 --> 02:17:19,900
I won't forget it.

1012
02:17:20,734 --> 02:17:23,987
Ask your friends in the
neighbourhood about me.

1013
02:17:25,155 --> 02:17:27,824
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favour.

1014
02:17:34,664 --> 02:17:36,583
What a character!

1015
02:17:44,507 --> 02:17:47,344
That landlord is here... Roberto,

1016
02:17:47,469 --> 02:17:49,471
the one who owns those ratholes.

1017
02:17:57,020 --> 02:18:00,357
He's been asking all around
the neighbourhood about you.

1018
02:18:08,365 --> 02:18:11,201
I hope I'm not disturbing you, Don Vito.

1019
02:18:12,327 --> 02:18:14,537
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1020
02:18:16,498 --> 02:18:18,541
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1021
02:18:19,876 --> 02:18:22,712
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1022
02:18:29,010 --> 02:18:31,888
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1023
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:39,396
<i>Un, due,</i> three, four, five, six, <i>tutt'!</i>

1024
02:18:40,230 --> 02:18:45,026
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1025
02:18:53,618 --> 02:18:55,370
Can I sit down?

1026
02:18:58,373 --> 02:19:01,376
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1027
02:19:02,419 --> 02:19:05,422
The rent stays like before!

1028
02:19:15,015 --> 02:19:16,474
I'll even lower it.

1029
02:19:19,310 --> 02:19:20,603
I'll lower it $5.

1030
02:19:24,941 --> 02:19:26,484
I'll lower it $10!

1031
02:19:32,949 --> 02:19:35,035
Can I offer you some coffee?

1032
02:19:37,454 --> 02:19:42,083
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1033
02:19:47,422 --> 02:19:49,924
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1034
02:19:55,305 --> 02:19:57,474
I wish I could stay longer!

1035
02:20:03,396 --> 02:20:05,774
Just call me and I'll be here!

1036
02:20:16,826 --> 02:20:19,788
He won't be back.
He'll hide out in the Bronx!

1037
02:20:35,303 --> 02:20:40,016
- Vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

1038
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:48,066
<i>New York City.</i>

1039
02:20:48,149 --> 02:20:50,193
<i>Would you mind speaking up, please?</i>

1040
02:20:51,027 --> 02:20:52,695
<i>New York City.</i>

1041
02:20:52,779 --> 02:20:56,407
<i>- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.</i>

1042
02:20:56,491 --> 02:21:00,161
<i>- And where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.</i>

1043
02:21:00,328 --> 02:21:06,251
<i>Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?</i>

1044
02:21:07,043 --> 02:21:13,216
<i>Godfather is a term that was used by his friends.
One of affection and one of respect.</i>

1045
02:21:14,050 --> 02:21:18,513
<i>Mr Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness's statement.</i>

1046
02:21:18,596 --> 02:21:23,685
<i>For years now, a growing number of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.</i>

1047
02:21:24,018 --> 02:21:26,479
<i>And I've come to know them well.</i>

1048
02:21:26,604 --> 02:21:30,817
<i>They have honored me
with their support and with their friendship.</i>

1049
02:21:30,942 --> 02:21:36,114
<i>Indeed, I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are Italian-Americans.</i>

1050
02:21:37,365 --> 02:21:42,370
<i>However, Mr Chairman,at this time and unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings</i>

1051
02:21:42,537 --> 02:21:46,749
<i>in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.</i>

1052
02:21:47,876 --> 02:21:50,879
<i>But before I leave, I do want to say this,</i>

1053
02:21:50,962 --> 02:21:55,258
<i>that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever</i>

1054
02:21:55,341 --> 02:21:58,011
<i>a slur upon the great Italian people.</i>

1055
02:21:58,094 --> 02:22:01,222
<i>Because I can state from my own knowledge
and experience</i>

1056
02:22:01,306 --> 02:22:06,477
<i>that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,</i>

1057
02:22:06,561 --> 02:22:10,064
<i>patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.</i>

1058
02:22:11,149 --> 02:22:16,154
<i>It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples</i>

1059
02:22:16,237 --> 02:22:18,489
<i>to give a bad name to the whole barrel.</i>

1060
02:22:18,573 --> 02:22:24,204
<i>Because from the time of the great Christopher
Columbus up through the time of Enrico Fermi</i>

1061
02:22:24,287 --> 02:22:26,372
<i>right up until the present day,</i>

1062
02:22:26,539 --> 02:22:30,793
<i>Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our great nation.</i>

1063
02:22:31,252 --> 02:22:35,757
<i>They are the salt of the earth, and they're
one of the backbones of this country.</i>

1064
02:22:42,555 --> 02:22:46,392
<i>I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.</i>

1065
02:22:46,476 --> 02:22:50,772
<i>Mr Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.</i>

1066
02:22:50,855 --> 02:22:56,277
<i>We have testimony from a witness,
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.</i>

1067
02:22:57,278 --> 02:23:01,741
<i>He has stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in this country.</i>

1068
02:23:01,824 --> 02:23:04,118
<i>- Are you?
- No, I'm not.</i>

1069
02:23:04,202 --> 02:23:07,455
<i>The witness has testified that you are
personally responsible</i>

1070
02:23:07,538 --> 02:23:11,542
<i>for the murder of a New York City
police captain in 1947</i>

1071
02:23:11,626 --> 02:23:15,213
<i>and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.</i>

1072
02:23:15,380 --> 02:23:17,882
<i>- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.</i>

1073
02:23:18,049 --> 02:23:21,135
<i>Is it true that in the year 1950</i>

1074
02:23:21,219 --> 02:23:26,599
<i>you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five Families" in New York</i>

1075
02:23:26,683 --> 02:23:30,270
<i>to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?</i>

1076
02:23:30,353 --> 02:23:33,731
<i>- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr Questadt.</i>

1077
02:23:33,856 --> 02:23:38,528
<i>Is it true that you have a controlling interest
in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?</i>

1078
02:23:39,612 --> 02:23:44,826
<i>No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.</i>

1079
02:23:47,453 --> 02:23:51,708
<i>I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.</i>

1080
02:23:52,792 --> 02:23:59,048
<i>Do you have any interests or control over gambling
and narcotics in the state of New York?</i>

1081
02:23:59,132 --> 02:24:00,675
<i>No, I do not.</i>

1082
02:24:00,758 --> 02:24:04,345
<i>Senator, my client would like to read
a statement for this committee.</i>

1083
02:24:04,429 --> 02:24:09,976
<i>Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.</i>

1084
02:24:10,143 --> 02:24:15,982
<i>Sir, my client has answered every question asked by
this committee with the utmost sincerity.</i>

1085
02:24:16,149 --> 02:24:22,071
<i>He has not taken the Fifth Amendment, as it was his right to do, so in all fairness I think this statement should be heard!</i>

1086
02:24:24,032 --> 02:24:29,037
<i>No, no I'm going to allow Mr Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.</i>

1087
02:24:30,830 --> 02:24:34,000
<i>In the hopes of clearing
my family name</i>

1088
02:24:34,083 --> 02:24:37,962
<i>and the sincere desire to give my children their fair share
of the American way of life</i>

1089
02:24:38,046 --> 02:24:41,090
<i>without a blemish on their name
and background,</i>

1090
02:24:41,215 --> 02:24:46,429
<i>I have appeared before this committee and
given it all the cooperation in my power.</i>

1091
02:24:47,764 --> 02:24:53,311
<i>I consider it a great dishonor to me personally
to have to deny that I am a criminal.</i>

1092
02:24:54,312 --> 02:24:57,690
<i>I wish to have the following noted
for the record...</i>

1093
02:24:57,857 --> 02:25:01,903
<i>That I served my country faithfully and honorably
in World War Two</i>

1094
02:25:01,986 --> 02:25:07,158
<i>and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defense of my country.</i>

1095
02:25:08,034 --> 02:25:12,372
<i>That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime whatsoever.</i>

1096
02:25:12,538 --> 02:25:16,501
<i>That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy</i>

1097
02:25:16,626 --> 02:25:21,464
<i>whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra
or whatever other name you wish to give</i>

1098
02:25:21,547 --> 02:25:23,883
<i>has ever been made public.</i>

1099
02:25:24,050 --> 02:25:26,052
<i>I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,</i>

1100
02:25:26,135 --> 02:25:29,222
<i>although it's my right to do so.</i>

1101
02:25:32,058 --> 02:25:37,688
<i>I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me</i>

1102
02:25:37,814 --> 02:25:43,736
<i>and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name</i>

1103
02:25:43,820 --> 02:25:47,490
<i>with the same publicity with which
they now have besmirched it.</i>

1104
02:25:48,825 --> 02:25:54,372
<i>I'm sure we're all quite impressed, Mr. Corleone.
Particularly with your love for our country.</i>

1105
02:25:54,539 --> 02:25:57,333
<i>Committee will stand in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday morning</i>

1106
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:02,213
<i>at which time the committee will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges which were made against you today.</i>

1107
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:07,385
<i>And at which time, Mr Corleone, you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.</i>

1108
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:11,931
<i>I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Mr. Corleone. Adjourned!</i>

1109
02:26:17,061 --> 02:26:18,771
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1110
02:26:18,855 --> 02:26:23,609
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I lose!

1111
02:26:23,693 --> 02:26:28,364
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1112
02:26:29,407 --> 02:26:32,952
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah, a good night's sleep.

1113
02:26:33,035 --> 02:26:35,204
You got a big day tomorrow.

1114
02:26:35,288 --> 02:26:38,916
I got you a new suit,
a new shirt, new tie.

1115
02:26:39,584 --> 02:26:42,879
I'm gonna shave you myself in the morning.

1116
02:26:43,045 --> 02:26:47,133
You're gonna look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1117
02:26:47,216 --> 02:26:52,388
Tomorrow...my life, my life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1118
02:26:53,389 --> 02:26:57,059
Come on! I saw this, I saw this 19 times.

1119
02:26:58,102 --> 02:27:01,898
You got a great home here, Frankie.
For the rest of your life.

1120
02:27:02,064 --> 02:27:03,733
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1121
02:27:05,401 --> 02:27:10,281
Well that's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1122
02:27:10,406 --> 02:27:13,201
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1123
02:27:13,284 --> 02:27:16,078
You'll live better in here than
most people on the outside.

1124
02:27:16,245 --> 02:27:17,455
Some deal!

1125
02:27:21,125 --> 02:27:25,004
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1126
02:27:26,756 --> 02:27:32,094
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1127
02:27:32,929 --> 02:27:35,306
Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers 

1128
02:27:35,431 --> 02:27:37,433
and they tried to kill him.

1129
02:27:37,517 --> 02:27:39,769
He thought you double-crossed him.

1130
02:27:40,811 --> 02:27:44,148
Our people with the New York detectives
said he was half dead, scared stiff

1131
02:27:44,273 --> 02:27:46,943
and calling out loud that you'd turned on him.

1132
02:27:47,276 --> 02:27:51,447
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and a lot more.

1133
02:27:53,282 --> 02:27:58,955
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.

1134
02:27:59,121 --> 02:28:04,043
No way we can get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1135
02:28:06,504 --> 02:28:09,507
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1136
02:28:09,632 --> 02:28:13,219
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1137
02:28:13,386 --> 02:28:17,682
Roth, he played this one beautifully.

1138
02:28:25,022 --> 02:28:27,817
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1139
02:29:07,064 --> 02:29:09,734
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1140
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:13,863
We have time.

1141
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:17,116
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1142
02:29:18,451 --> 02:29:20,578
I didn't know all that much.

1143
02:29:21,537 --> 02:29:26,375
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1144
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:29,211
Anything you can tell me now?

1145
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:33,799
They got Pentangeli, that's all I can tell you.

1146
02:29:48,481 --> 02:29:52,234
I didn't know it was
gonna be a hit, Mike.

1147
02:29:52,401 --> 02:29:54,654
I swear to God I didn't know it was gonna be a hit.

1148
02:29:57,448 --> 02:30:01,786
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1149
02:30:03,621 --> 02:30:06,666
He said that he wanted to talk.

1150
02:30:08,250 --> 02:30:14,423
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1151
02:30:16,967 --> 02:30:21,305
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1152
02:30:21,430 --> 02:30:25,309
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations

1153
02:30:25,434 --> 02:30:29,772
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,

1154
02:30:31,315 --> 02:30:33,859
it would be good for the family.

1155
02:30:35,444 --> 02:30:39,949
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1156
02:30:40,116 --> 02:30:44,161
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1157
02:30:44,286 --> 02:30:48,374
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?

1158
02:30:49,709 --> 02:30:52,503
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1159
02:30:53,504 --> 02:30:57,633
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1160
02:30:58,676 --> 02:31:02,847
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1161
02:31:03,514 --> 02:31:08,018
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

1162
02:31:08,144 --> 02:31:11,188
"Send Fredo to pick somebody up
at the airport!"

1163
02:31:11,313 --> 02:31:14,358
I'm your older brother, Mike, and
I was stepped over!

1164
02:31:14,525 --> 02:31:18,320
- That's the way Pop wanted it.
- It ain't the way I wanted it!

1165
02:31:19,071 --> 02:31:23,993
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1166
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:28,038
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1167
02:31:35,713 --> 02:31:40,885
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1168
02:31:48,893 --> 02:31:54,940
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.

1169
02:32:04,617 --> 02:32:06,410
Fredo,

1170
02:32:08,871 --> 02:32:11,540
you're nothing to me now.

1171
02:32:13,292 --> 02:32:15,753
You're not a brother,
you're not a friend.

1172
02:32:17,546 --> 02:32:20,591
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1173
02:32:21,717 --> 02:32:24,720
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1174
02:32:24,804 --> 02:32:27,389
I don't want you near my house.

1175
02:32:29,308 --> 02:32:33,979
When you see our mother, I wanna know
a day in advance, so I won't be there.

1176
02:32:35,564 --> 02:32:37,233
You understand?

1177
02:32:46,992 --> 02:32:48,953
Mikey.

1178
02:32:55,584 --> 02:32:59,421
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1179
02:33:49,305 --> 02:33:52,808
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1180
02:33:52,975 --> 02:33:57,146
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

1181
02:34:16,498 --> 02:34:19,084
<i>This committee will come to order!</i>

1182
02:34:21,837 --> 02:34:24,673
<i>- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.</i>

1183
02:34:24,757 --> 02:34:28,510
<i>- And where were you born?
- Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.</i>

1184
02:34:28,677 --> 02:34:30,679
<i>And where do you live now?</i>

1185
02:34:30,846 --> 02:34:34,892
<i>I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.</i>

1186
02:34:37,102 --> 02:34:41,565
<i>We have here finally a witness
that will further testify</i>

1187
02:34:41,690 --> 02:34:48,072
<i>to Michael Corleone's rule over a criminal empire that controls all of the gambling in this country. And perhaps in other countries.</i>

1188
02:34:48,364 --> 02:34:53,243
<i>This witness has had no buffer
between himself and Michael Corleone.</i>

1189
02:34:53,369 --> 02:34:56,538
<i>He can corroborate our charges on enough counts</i>

1190
02:34:56,622 --> 02:35:01,293
<i>for this committee to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.</i>

1191
02:35:01,460 --> 02:35:03,420
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

1192
02:35:04,797 --> 02:35:06,382
<i>Mr Pentangeli.</i>

1193
02:35:07,549 --> 02:35:13,222
<i>Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?</i>

1194
02:35:13,389 --> 02:35:18,435
<i>Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,</i>

1195
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:23,065
<i>under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?</i>

1196
02:35:28,779 --> 02:35:31,407
<i>I never knew no Godfather.</i>

1197
02:35:33,951 --> 02:35:36,078
<i>I have my own family, Senator.</i>

1198
02:35:39,498 --> 02:35:42,084
<i>Mr Pentangeli, you...</i>

1199
02:35:42,251 --> 02:35:46,588
<i>you are contradicting a sworn statement you've
previously made to me and signed.</i>

1200
02:35:46,755 --> 02:35:50,467
<i>I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...</i>

1201
02:35:50,592 --> 02:35:54,805
<i>were you at any time a member of
a crime organization</i>

1202
02:35:54,930 --> 02:35:56,765
<i>headed by Michael Corleone?</i>

1203
02:35:56,849 --> 02:35:59,852
I don't know nothing about that!

1204
02:36:02,855 --> 02:36:06,859
I was in the olive oil business
with his father

1205
02:36:06,942 --> 02:36:09,611
but that was a long time ago, that's all.

1206
02:36:10,612 --> 02:36:13,699
<i>We have a sworn affidavit. We have it.</i>

1207
02:36:15,367 --> 02:36:20,080
<i>Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.</i>

1208
02:36:20,205 --> 02:36:24,710
<i>Do you deny this confession? And do you realize what
will happen as a result of your denial?
</i>

1209
02:36:24,793 --> 02:36:27,963
<i>Look, the FBI guys, they promised me a deal.</i>

1210
02:36:28,130 --> 02:36:33,802
<i>So I made up a lot of stuff about Michael Corleone, 
'cause that's what they wanted.</i>

1211
02:36:33,969 --> 02:36:37,973
<i>But it was all lies. Everything!</i>

1212
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,893
<i>They kept saying,</i>

1213
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:46,148
<i>"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that ".</i>

1214
02:36:47,483 --> 02:36:51,487
<i>So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"</i>

1215
02:36:51,653 --> 02:36:57,826
<i>Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify for the committee
the gentleman sitting to your left?</i>

1216
02:36:57,910 --> 02:37:00,162
I can answer that.

1217
02:37:00,329 --> 02:37:02,664
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1218
02:37:03,665 --> 02:37:08,003
<i>- Is he related to the witness?</i>
- He is, I believe, his brother.

1219
02:37:08,337 --> 02:37:13,008
<i>- Will he come forward and be sworn, sir?
- Sir, this man does not understand English.</i>

1220
02:37:13,175 --> 02:37:16,178
He came at his own expense to aid his brother 
in this time of trouble.

1221
02:37:17,012 --> 02:37:20,724
He's not under subpoena and his reputation in
his own country is impeccable.

1222
02:37:20,849 --> 02:37:22,518
<i>Are you saying he knows nothing
about these matters?</i>

1223
02:37:22,601 --> 02:37:24,645
To my knowledge, nothing.

1224
02:37:24,728 --> 02:37:29,566
<i>I'm going to find out what the hell happened here!
All right, this committee is now adjourned.</i>

1225
02:37:29,691 --> 02:37:31,735
<i>- The witness is excused.</i>
- Senator!

1226
02:37:32,861 --> 02:37:36,532
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1227
02:37:37,032 --> 02:37:41,036
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1228
02:38:08,647 --> 02:38:12,651
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

1229
02:38:13,068 --> 02:38:16,530
The children are outside. We're going.

1230
02:38:17,865 --> 02:38:20,534
What do you mean you're going?
We're all gonna leave tomorrow.

1231
02:38:21,368 --> 02:38:23,829
Rocco?

1232
02:38:24,872 --> 02:38:27,457
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1233
02:38:30,210 --> 02:38:33,297
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1234
02:38:33,380 --> 02:38:36,842
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1235
02:38:39,887 --> 02:38:42,472
I want you to know I'm very happy for you.

1236
02:38:42,639 --> 02:38:47,144
I suppose I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them ever beat you.

1237
02:38:48,562 --> 02:38:53,192
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, no I'm not going to stay long. I can't.

1238
02:38:53,358 --> 02:38:57,070
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1239
02:38:57,237 --> 02:39:02,284
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1240
02:39:02,451 --> 02:39:05,537
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1241
02:39:06,705 --> 02:39:11,418
- I promised myself l wasn't going to say anything--
- What do you mean, "too late"?

1242
02:39:16,757 --> 02:39:19,426
What really happened with Pentangeli, Michael?

1243
02:39:25,265 --> 02:39:30,437
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

1244
02:39:30,604 --> 02:39:32,439
Where is he now?

1245
02:39:33,774 --> 02:39:36,443
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1246
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:39,613
All he had to do was show his face.

1247
02:39:41,281 --> 02:39:46,119
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1248
02:39:54,378 --> 02:39:57,923
Nobody is going!
Not you, not the kids. No.

1249
02:39:58,966 --> 02:40:02,970
You're my wife, they're my children.
I love you and I won't allow it.

1250
02:40:04,263 --> 02:40:08,100
Michael, you say you love me, and then
you talk about allowing me to leave!

1251
02:40:08,267 --> 02:40:11,979
There are things that have been going on for years between
men and women that will not change, and that's it.

1252
02:40:12,145 --> 02:40:16,066
You've become blind, Michael!
Look, look what's happened to us.

1253
02:40:16,233 --> 02:40:18,610
My god, look what's happened to our son, Michael!

1254
02:40:19,861 --> 02:40:21,405
- Don't tell me nothing's happened to him! 
- Anthony's fine!

1255
02:40:21,571 --> 02:40:24,783
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

1256
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:28,870
- Anthony's friends are--
- I don't want to hear about it!

1257
02:40:30,163 --> 02:40:32,249
Over!

1258
02:40:44,261 --> 02:40:47,848
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1259
02:40:48,974 --> 02:40:53,979
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1260
02:41:08,327 --> 02:41:10,412
Kay...

1261
02:41:13,248 --> 02:41:15,417
We're leaving tomorrow.

1262
02:41:16,126 --> 02:41:19,296
Kay, why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1263
02:41:19,379 --> 02:41:25,177
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

1264
02:41:25,469 --> 02:41:31,850
Do you expect me to let you go? Do you expect me
to let you take my children from me?

1265
02:41:32,642 --> 02:41:38,231
Don't you know me? Don't you know that that's an impossibility?
That that could never happen?

1266
02:41:38,315 --> 02:41:42,194
That I'd use all my power to keep something like 
that from happening?

1267
02:41:43,028 --> 02:41:45,405
Don't you know that?

1268
02:41:47,074 --> 02:41:48,992
Kay...

1269
02:41:51,870 --> 02:41:56,500
Now in time, you'll feel differently.

1270
02:41:58,043 --> 02:42:01,004
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1271
02:42:02,881 --> 02:42:04,883
I know that.

1272
02:42:06,885 --> 02:42:10,347
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1273
02:42:12,182 --> 02:42:13,225
Yes.

1274
02:42:14,518 --> 02:42:17,229
I know what that meant to you.

1275
02:42:19,272 --> 02:42:21,400
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1276
02:42:22,275 --> 02:42:25,153
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1277
02:42:26,405 --> 02:42:28,365
I'm gonna change.

1278
02:42:29,783 --> 02:42:33,995
I'll change. I've learnt that I have
the strength to change.

1279
02:42:36,164 --> 02:42:39,126
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage

1280
02:42:40,001 --> 02:42:44,881
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1281
02:42:46,216 --> 02:42:47,259
We'll go on.

1282
02:42:48,969 --> 02:42:50,387
Oh, Michael!

1283
02:42:51,513 --> 02:42:53,849
Michael, you are blind.

1284
02:42:55,684 --> 02:42:58,019
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1285
02:43:00,105 --> 02:43:01,606
It was an abortion.

1286
02:43:03,483 --> 02:43:08,697
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1287
02:43:09,614 --> 02:43:13,034
Something that's unholy and evil!

1288
02:43:14,661 --> 02:43:16,997
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1289
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:21,710
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1290
02:43:23,628 --> 02:43:26,047
It was an abortion, Michael.

1291
02:43:26,173 --> 02:43:31,845
It was a son, a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1292
02:43:33,388 --> 02:43:37,517
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1293
02:43:38,894 --> 02:43:44,232
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1294
02:43:44,357 --> 02:43:49,070
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1295
02:43:56,912 --> 02:43:59,831
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1296
02:43:59,915 --> 02:44:01,833
You won't
take my children!

1297
02:44:01,917 --> 02:44:04,252
They're my children too.

1298
02:45:34,092 --> 02:45:37,679
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1299
02:47:52,439 --> 02:47:54,482
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1300
02:47:58,319 --> 02:48:01,406
Allow me the honour of
introducing someone.

1301
02:48:01,740 --> 02:48:04,576
My partner in America, in New York.

1302
02:48:05,243 --> 02:48:07,078
His name is Vito Corleone.

1303
02:48:07,787 --> 02:48:10,331
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1304
02:48:11,166 --> 02:48:12,584
To his company in America.

1305
02:48:17,338 --> 02:48:20,675
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1306
02:48:30,351 --> 02:48:36,024
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1307
02:48:37,108 --> 02:48:40,028
Where is this young man
from New York?

1308
02:48:43,364 --> 02:48:46,493
Have him come closer.

1309
02:48:47,494 --> 02:48:50,371
I can't see him so good.

1310
02:48:57,378 --> 02:49:01,049
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1311
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:05,220
Bless you!

1312
02:49:07,055 --> 02:49:08,681
What's your name?

1313
02:49:14,062 --> 02:49:17,232
You took the name of this town!

1314
02:49:17,816 --> 02:49:19,567
And what's your father's name?

1315
02:49:19,692 --> 02:49:23,363
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

1316
02:49:23,738 --> 02:49:27,408
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1317
02:49:30,829 --> 02:49:34,082
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1318
02:49:34,374 --> 02:49:37,085
...and this is for you!

1319
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,628
Michael, say goodbye.

1320
02:52:04,857 --> 02:52:06,234
Hi, Al.

1321
02:52:18,371 --> 02:52:21,374
Tom. Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1322
02:52:29,257 --> 02:52:30,967
Tom, where's Mike?

1323
02:52:32,218 --> 02:52:34,262
Waiting for you to leave.

1324
02:52:36,889 --> 02:52:41,394
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1325
02:52:41,978 --> 02:52:45,273
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1326
02:52:58,411 --> 02:53:00,788
Michael, it's Connie.

1327
02:53:22,018 --> 02:53:23,603
Michael...

1328
02:53:26,647 --> 02:53:30,109
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1329
02:53:38,659 --> 02:53:40,870
Is Kay coming?

1330
02:53:43,331 --> 02:53:44,999
No.

1331
02:53:53,132 --> 02:53:55,968
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1332
02:53:56,052 --> 02:54:00,014
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1333
02:54:03,643 --> 02:54:05,520
That's right.

1334
02:54:08,356 --> 02:54:11,692
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1335
02:54:15,238 --> 02:54:17,657
Michael, please, I want to talk to you.

1336
02:54:29,210 --> 02:54:33,214
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1337
02:54:33,673 --> 02:54:39,011
I think that I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know

1338
02:54:42,223 --> 02:54:44,350
that I could hurt you.

1339
02:54:50,439 --> 02:54:54,777
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1340
02:54:55,403 --> 02:54:57,280
And I forgive you.

1341
02:55:01,951 --> 02:55:03,911
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1342
02:55:04,954 --> 02:55:09,584
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1343
02:55:15,923 --> 02:55:19,760
You need me, Michael.
I want to take care of you now.

1344
02:55:29,604 --> 02:55:31,147
Connie.

1345
02:57:13,374 --> 02:57:15,960
Tom, sit down.

1346
02:57:27,722 --> 02:57:31,434
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1347
02:57:32,810 --> 02:57:36,230
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in Israel.

1348
02:57:36,397 --> 02:57:37,398
Mmm-hmm.

1349
02:57:38,065 --> 02:57:42,611
The High Court in Israel turned down his request
to live there as a returned Jew.

1350
02:57:42,778 --> 02:57:46,407
His passport's been invalidated, except for
return to the United States.

1351
02:57:46,490 --> 02:57:49,243
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1352
02:57:49,577 --> 02:57:53,414
He offered the gift of a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1353
02:57:54,415 --> 02:57:58,419
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

1354
02:57:58,502 --> 02:58:03,174
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1355
02:58:03,591 --> 02:58:08,262
His medical condition is reported as terminal. 
He's only gonna live another six months anyway.

1356
02:58:08,429 --> 02:58:11,432
He's been dying of the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1357
02:58:11,599 --> 02:58:13,309
That plane goes to Miami.

1358
02:58:13,434 --> 02:58:15,770
All right.
That's where I want it met.

1359
02:58:16,937 --> 02:58:22,276
Mike, that's impossible. They'll turn him over directly to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and half the FBI.

1360
02:58:22,443 --> 02:58:25,696
It's not impossible.
Nothing is impossible.

1361
02:58:25,780 --> 02:58:27,239
It would be like trying to kill the President.

1362
02:58:27,323 --> 02:58:31,786
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you know, you surprise me.

1363
02:58:34,622 --> 02:58:38,250
If anything in this life is certain,

1364
02:58:38,334 --> 02:58:41,545
if history has taught us anything,

1365
02:58:41,629 --> 02:58:44,215
it's that you can kill anyone.

1366
02:58:49,553 --> 02:58:54,475
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

1367
02:58:54,809 --> 02:58:56,519
Good.

1368
02:58:58,979 --> 02:59:02,650
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1369
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:09,657
I thought you were
going to tell me that

1370
02:59:09,740 --> 02:59:12,159
you were moving your family to Vegas

1371
02:59:13,536 --> 02:59:17,415
and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1372
02:59:19,542 --> 02:59:24,380
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- I turned them down. I mean, do I have to tell you about every offer that I turn down?

1373
02:59:28,592 --> 02:59:31,387
- Let's do business.
- All right.

1374
02:59:33,264 --> 02:59:36,350
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1375
02:59:37,518 --> 02:59:39,687
Now Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

1376
02:59:39,770 --> 02:59:42,356
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?

1377
02:59:42,773 --> 02:59:47,695
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you wanna wipe everybody out?

1378
02:59:47,778 --> 02:59:53,075
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1379
03:00:00,791 --> 03:00:03,544
You gonna come along with me in these things
I have to do, or what?

1380
03:00:05,588 --> 03:00:11,051
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress

1381
03:00:11,218 --> 03:00:14,388
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1382
03:00:17,433 --> 03:00:22,480
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always
been loyal to you. I mean, what is this?

1383
03:00:27,067 --> 03:00:28,736
So... you're staying?

1384
03:00:30,779 --> 03:00:33,115
Yes, I'm staying.

1385
03:00:35,701 --> 03:00:37,828
What is it that you want me to do?

1386
03:00:38,329 --> 03:00:40,372
Hey, Anthony.

1387
03:00:40,873 --> 03:00:45,544
Anthony, how would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1388
03:00:45,628 --> 03:00:48,088
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1389
03:00:48,255 --> 03:00:50,883
You know, when I was your age,

1390
03:00:51,383 --> 03:00:58,265
I went out to fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1391
03:00:59,433 --> 03:01:02,937
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1392
03:01:03,771 --> 03:01:07,983
Nobody else could catch one except me.
Do you know how I did it?

1393
03:01:09,610 --> 03:01:13,364
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1394
03:01:13,531 --> 03:01:17,159
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1395
03:01:19,620 --> 03:01:23,791
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1396
03:01:25,834 --> 03:01:29,672
- Do you want to try it when we go out on the lake?
- Okay.

1397
03:01:31,465 --> 03:01:32,633
What else you got?

1398
03:01:59,326 --> 03:02:01,787
Everything will be okay, Frankie, don't worry.

1399
03:02:02,079 --> 03:02:06,000
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

1400
03:02:06,166 --> 03:02:11,088
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1401
03:02:12,131 --> 03:02:15,467
He didn't want to go out to dinner,
he just wanted to go straight home.

1402
03:02:15,551 --> 03:02:20,556
That's my brother! Hey listen, nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1403
03:02:20,723 --> 03:02:24,560
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1404
03:02:29,815 --> 03:02:31,734
Tom,

1405
03:02:32,443 --> 03:02:35,029
what do I do now?

1406
03:02:35,738 --> 03:02:37,740
Frankie.

1407
03:02:42,286 --> 03:02:46,332
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1408
03:02:47,791 --> 03:02:51,253
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1409
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:55,049
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1410
03:02:57,593 --> 03:03:03,349
You were around the old-timers, who dreamed of how the 
family's should be organized,

1411
03:03:03,474 --> 03:03:08,896
based on the old Roman legions
and called them regimes--the Capos and the soldiers.

1412
03:03:10,147 --> 03:03:14,193
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

1413
03:03:14,943 --> 03:03:18,447
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1414
03:03:18,614 --> 03:03:21,784
We was like the Roman Empire.

1415
03:03:21,867 --> 03:03:25,329
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1416
03:03:27,706 --> 03:03:29,667
Yeah,

1417
03:03:29,833 --> 03:03:32,211
it was once.

1418
03:03:36,632 --> 03:03:38,175
Frankie.

1419
03:03:48,644 --> 03:03:52,189
When a plot
against the Emperor failed

1420
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:56,902
the plotters were always
given a chance

1421
03:03:58,862 --> 03:04:02,449
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1422
03:04:02,533 --> 03:04:04,702
Yeah, but only the rich guys, Tom

1423
03:04:04,785 --> 03:04:09,748
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1424
03:04:09,915 --> 03:04:15,129
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1425
03:04:16,296 --> 03:04:20,592
And their families, their families were taken care of, Tom.

1426
03:04:22,219 --> 03:04:25,597
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1427
03:04:26,265 --> 03:04:27,766
Yeah.

1428
03:04:28,642 --> 03:04:30,769
They went home

1429
03:04:31,937 --> 03:04:34,940
and sat in a hot bath

1430
03:04:35,107 --> 03:04:37,609
opened up their veins

1431
03:04:37,776 --> 03:04:40,487
and bled to death.

1432
03:04:41,655 --> 03:04:45,826
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1433
03:04:50,998 --> 03:04:54,793
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1434
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:58,297
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1435
03:05:16,732 --> 03:05:19,860
- See you, Tom.
<i>- Addio,</i> Frankie.

1436
03:05:30,829 --> 03:05:33,916
Kay. You have to go.

1437
03:05:35,709 --> 03:05:39,046
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1438
03:05:47,888 --> 03:05:51,725
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.

1439
03:05:54,269 --> 03:05:57,064
Anthony, will you kiss your mother goodbye!

1440
03:05:57,231 --> 03:06:02,319
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

1441
03:06:03,445 --> 03:06:05,906
Kay, please.

1442
03:06:08,742 --> 03:06:10,744
All right.

1443
03:06:23,966 --> 03:06:26,343
Mary, come here.

1444
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:35,102
Anthony.

1445
03:06:35,185 --> 03:06:38,188
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1446
03:08:17,371 --> 03:08:19,456
Easy.

1447
03:08:25,128 --> 03:08:28,215
Anthony! Anthony!

1448
03:08:28,382 --> 03:08:31,385
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

1449
03:08:31,551 --> 03:08:34,888
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1450
03:08:34,972 --> 03:08:36,974
Shit!

1451
03:08:38,225 --> 03:08:41,645
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1452
03:08:42,604 --> 03:08:46,566
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1453
03:08:50,237 --> 03:08:51,780
Hey, Anthony.

1454
03:08:51,905 --> 03:08:56,243
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1455
03:09:00,247 --> 03:09:01,623
Okay, Al, let's go.

1456
03:09:40,787 --> 03:09:44,958
- Mr Roth, you understand I have to take you into custody.
- Yes, I understand.

1457
03:09:45,125 --> 03:09:48,295
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1458
03:09:48,462 --> 03:09:51,214
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1459
03:09:51,381 --> 03:09:56,303
I went to Israel because I wished to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1460
03:10:02,642 --> 03:10:06,229
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1461
03:10:14,404 --> 03:10:16,156
Frankie!

1462
03:10:32,005 --> 03:10:34,883
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1463
03:10:35,050 --> 03:10:38,678
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1464
03:10:38,845 --> 03:10:42,390
I came home to vote
in the presidential election

1465
03:10:42,557 --> 03:10:44,851
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1466
03:10:58,365 --> 03:11:00,742
Jesus Christ.

1467
03:11:01,785 --> 03:11:06,414
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1468
03:11:07,916 --> 03:11:10,544
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1469
03:11:11,294 --> 03:11:14,422
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1470
03:11:15,632 --> 03:11:19,886
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1471
03:12:01,761 --> 03:12:06,933
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1472
03:12:07,767 --> 03:12:10,437
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

1473
03:12:10,604 --> 03:12:15,400
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1474
03:12:15,483 --> 03:12:18,778
This cute little thing over here, this is my sister Connie. I was telling you about her.

1475
03:12:18,862 --> 03:12:21,740
Come on, say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?

1476
03:12:21,823 --> 03:12:23,366
Yes.

1477
03:12:23,533 --> 03:12:27,621
Oh, that droopy thing over there, that's my brother, Mike.
We call him Joe College, you know what I mean?

1478
03:12:28,121 --> 03:12:31,958
Go on, sit down. Talk to each other.

1479
03:12:32,125 --> 03:12:34,336
Hey, Mr Einstein...

1480
03:12:37,672 --> 03:12:40,175
- Here's the cake.
- Hey, Sally, get in here!

1481
03:12:40,342 --> 03:12:42,469
- I was scared.
- Come on.

1482
03:12:43,136 --> 03:12:46,473
- Where's your father?
- Took him on a wild goose chase. Christmas shopping.

1483
03:12:46,640 --> 03:12:49,017
Let's see that thing.

1484
03:12:50,727 --> 03:12:52,646
- Oh, honey, that's nice.
- That's beautiful.

1485
03:12:52,729 --> 03:12:56,650
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Go on. You help her, Carlo, all right?

1486
03:12:57,692 --> 03:13:00,820
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

1487
03:13:05,825 --> 03:13:09,162
Sonny, come on, don't touch
the antipasto till Pop sees it.

1488
03:13:09,329 --> 03:13:11,998
He's not ugly...

1489
03:13:17,504 --> 03:13:23,677
What do you think, the nerve of them Japs, them slanty-eyed bastards? Dropping bombs on our own backyard. On Pop's birthday, you know?


1490
03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:27,222
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1491
03:13:27,347 --> 03:13:30,016
Well, we should've expected it
after the oil embargo.


1492
03:13:30,183 --> 03:13:34,688
What do you mean, expected it? Expected or not, they got no right dropping bombs.
What are you a Jap-lover or something? You on their side?

1493
03:13:34,854 --> 03:13:38,441
- I understand 30,000 men enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

1494
03:13:38,608 --> 03:13:42,112
- Why are they saps?
- Sonny, come on, do we even have to talk about the war?


1495
03:13:43,238 --> 03:13:45,073
You talk to Carlo, all right?

1496
03:13:47,033 --> 03:13:50,620
They're saps because they risk their lives for strangers.

1497
03:13:50,745 --> 03:13:54,165
- That's Pop talking.
- You're goddamn right that's Pop talking.

1498
03:13:54,291 --> 03:13:58,128
- They risk their lives for their country.
- Your country ain't your blood. You remember that.

1499
03:13:58,211 --> 03:14:04,134
- I don't feel that way.
- "I don't feel that way." Well, if you don't feel like that, then why don't you just quit college and go to join the army!

1500
03:14:04,217 --> 03:14:05,719
I did.

1501
03:14:06,636 --> 03:14:09,597
I enlisted in the Marines.

1502
03:14:11,891 --> 03:14:15,103
- Mike, why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1503
03:14:15,228 --> 03:14:19,399
- Pop had to pull a lot of strings to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

1504
03:14:20,150 --> 03:14:22,235
I didn't ask for a deferment. I didn't want it.

1505
03:14:23,403 --> 03:14:25,905
Come on! Come on, knock it off, come on!

1506
03:14:26,072 --> 03:14:29,743
- Punk!
- Sonny, Sonny, sit down.

1507
03:14:32,746 --> 03:14:35,707
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1508
03:14:39,336 --> 03:14:42,088
Go show Carlo the tree.

1509
03:14:52,432 --> 03:14:54,017
Nice.

1510
03:14:55,852 --> 03:14:57,437
Nice.

1511
03:14:57,979 --> 03:15:00,690
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1512
03:15:01,775 --> 03:15:04,569
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1513
03:15:04,652 --> 03:15:06,780
That's right, encourage him.

1514
03:15:06,863 --> 03:15:09,616
Go on, get me a drink. Go on!

1515
03:15:13,453 --> 03:15:16,956
You gotta understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1516
03:15:17,123 --> 03:15:21,294
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1517
03:15:23,129 --> 03:15:26,966
You talked to my father about my future?

1518
03:15:28,176 --> 03:15:32,514
- My future.
- Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1519
03:15:32,639 --> 03:15:38,144
- Well, I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid? You're really stupid.

1520
03:15:38,228 --> 03:15:40,146
He's here! Come on!

1521
03:15:42,065 --> 03:15:44,025
Come on.

1522
03:15:46,319 --> 03:15:48,238
Stupid!

1523
03:16:05,588 --> 03:16:07,924
Surprise!

1524
03:16:10,969 --> 03:16:13,221
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1525
03:16:13,304 --> 03:16:16,641
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1526
03:16:16,724 --> 03:16:20,520
<i>That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...</i>
