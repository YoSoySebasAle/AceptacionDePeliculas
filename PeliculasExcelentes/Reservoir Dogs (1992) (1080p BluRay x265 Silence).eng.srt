1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,052
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

2
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,430
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,682
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,142
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,395
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,774
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,110
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,404
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:34,076
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,787
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

11
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,707
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,211
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,089
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,591
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

15
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,094
Personally, I can do without her.

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,221
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,224
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,185
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,354
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

20
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,774
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,443
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:13,031
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,201
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

24
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,453
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy-—

25
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,831
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

26
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,458
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

27
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,836
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

28
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,839
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

29
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,300
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

30
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,219
click, click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click!

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,471
- How many “aids“ Is that?

32
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,850
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

33
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,478
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

34
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,107
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious click action.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,612
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

36
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,363
Chew? Toby Chew?

37
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,699
It hurts. It hurts her.

38
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,243
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,954
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

40
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,124
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

41
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,877
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,046
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

43
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,923
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

44
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,635
Wong.

45
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,889
- Give me that fuckin' thing.
- What in hell do you think you're doin'?

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,059
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

47
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,645
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,690
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

49
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,568
"Toby. Toby?

50
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,945
Toby? Toby Wong.

51
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,198
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

52
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,201
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

53
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,703
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

54
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,707
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

55
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,335
Give me that book.

56
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,337
Are you gonna put it away?

57
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,965
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

58
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,468
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

59
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,471
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

60
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,472
Shit.

61
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,601
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,692
You guys been Iistenin' to K-BILLY'S
"Super Sounds of the '705" weekend?

63
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,610
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

64
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,488
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

65
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,491
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

66
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,119
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,872
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

68
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,834
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

69
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,129
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,131
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

71
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,008
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

72
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,636
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,640
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

74
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,144
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

75
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,648
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

76
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,485
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

77
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,904
You guys can get the tip.

78
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,365
Should be about a buck apiece.

79
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,660
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

80
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,121
Sorry. It's my book now.

81
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:10,250
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

82
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,340
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

83
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,390
Come on, throw in a buck.

84
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,142
I don't tip.

85
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,895
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

86
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,147
You don't believe in tipping?

87
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,484
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

88
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,236
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

89
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,032
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

90
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,868
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

91
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,662
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

92
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,125
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

93
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,795
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

94
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,548
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

95
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,509
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

96
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,886
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

97
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,555
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

98
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,186
I'd go over 12% for that.

99
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,065
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

100
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,192
I want it filled six times.

101
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,445
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

102
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,698
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

103
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,409
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

104
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,911
another cup of coffee.

105
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:32,332
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

106
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,543
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

107
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,462
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

108
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,673
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

109
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,094
You know what this is?

110
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,930
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

111
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,433
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

112
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,854
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

113
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,232
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

114
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,860
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

115
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,738
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

116
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,991
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

117
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,743
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

118
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,747
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

119
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,833
The reason is
because of their tips.

120
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,502
Fuck all that.

121
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,008
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

122
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,343
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

123
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,512
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

124
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,848
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

125
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,476
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

126
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,146
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

127
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:40,150
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

128
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,612
If you're expectin' me to help outwith
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

129
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,614
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

130
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,034
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

131
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,663
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

132
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,416
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

133
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,252
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

134
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,922
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

135
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,924
He don't tip?

136
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,926
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

137
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,304
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

138
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:14,059
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

139
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:18,063
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

140
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,442
Never mind what you
normally would do.

141
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,947
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

142
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,203
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

143
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,330
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

144
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,583
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

145
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,295
as K-BILLY'S
"Super Sounds of the '705" weekend...

146
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,423
just keeps on truckin'.

147
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,445
I'm gonna die.

148
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,448
I'm gonna die!

149
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,367
Just hold on, buddy boy!

150
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,119
I'm gonna die!

151
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,500
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

152
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,879
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

153
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,509
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

154
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:56,513
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

155
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,897
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

156
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,399
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

157
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,528
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

158
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,782
Are you a doctor?

159
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,742
Are you a doctor?

160
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,245
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

161
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,999
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

162
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,128
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

163
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,757
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

164
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,261
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

165
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,056
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

166
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,392
you're gonna be okay.

167
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,812
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

168
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,313
Say it!

169
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,275
You're gonna be okay!

170
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,444
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

171
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,946
Oh, God!

172
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,073
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

173
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,783
Say it!

174
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,035
Okay, Larry.

175
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,955
Correct! Correct!

176
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,668
I'm okay.

177
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:21,723
Look where we are.

178
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,602
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

179
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,604
We're in a warehouse.

180
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,983
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

181
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,862
Come on, who's a tough guy?

182
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,823
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

183
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,825
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

184
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,000
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,377
We made it. We made it.

186
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,756
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

187
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,886
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

188
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,264
Look where we are.

189
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,101
Hold on. Hold on.

190
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,897
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

191
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,399
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

192
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,237
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

193
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,490
I can't do anything for you.

194
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,034
But when Joe gets here...

195
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,036
which should be any time now...

196
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,289
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

197
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,792
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

198
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,297
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

199
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,806
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

200
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,561
Would you please hold me?

201
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,438
Yeah, sure.

202
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,050
You go ahead and be scared.

203
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,553
You've been brave enough
for one day.

204
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,935
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

205
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,354
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

206
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,858
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

207
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,112
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

208
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,199
It's not good, no.

209
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,701
Hey, Larry...

210
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,830
bless your heart
for what you're twin' to do.

211
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,751
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

212
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,963
But I got my senses back now.

213
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,133
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

214
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,345
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

215
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,393
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

216
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:17,106
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

217
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,902
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

218
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,658
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

219
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,411
I swear to fucking God, man.

220
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,666
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

221
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:41,422
I won't tell them anything.

222
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,508
You'll be safe, man.

223
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,930
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

224
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,141
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

225
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,561
Along with the kneecap...

226
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,189
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

227
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,440
No shit!

228
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,276
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

229
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,779
I'm talkin' clays.

230
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,033
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

231
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,827
Time is on your side.

232
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,204
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

233
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,791
Shit. Orange got tagged?

234
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,585
Gut shot.

235
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,963
Fuck. Where's Brown?

236
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,339
Dead.

237
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,926
How did he die?

238
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,221
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

239
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,348
This is bad.

240
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,185
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

241
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,937
As opposed to good?

242
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,232
Man, this is fucked up.

243
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,568
This is so fucked up.

244
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,612
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

245
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,244
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

246
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,748
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

247
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,251
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

248
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,629
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

249
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,215
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

250
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,885
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

251
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,512
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

252
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,599
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

253
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,019
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

254
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,023
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

255
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,734
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

256
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,236
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

257
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,780
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

258
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,617
I haven't had a chance to think.

259
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,912
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

260
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,123
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

261
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,542
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

262
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,420
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

263
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,131
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

264
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,927
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

265
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,934
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

266
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,561
Larry, don't leave me.

267
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,611
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

268
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

269
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,868
I'm right over there.

270
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,997
Larry...

271
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,291
I'm gonna fucking die.

272
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,168
Larry.

273
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,631
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

274
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,800
I felt funny about
this job right off.

275
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,554
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

276
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,931
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

277
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,684
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

278
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,687
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

279
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,148
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

280
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,318
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

281
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,196
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

282
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,199
Are you cool?

283
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,952
I'm cool.

284
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,039
Splash some water on your face.

285
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,670
Take a breather.

286
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,229
Relax. Have a cigarette.

287
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,231
I quit.

288
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,067
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

289
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,479
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

290
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,106
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

291
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,275
Then the alarm gets tripped.

292
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,780
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

293
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,243
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

294
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,665
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

295
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,751
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

296
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,546
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

297
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,175
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

298
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,428
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

299
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,307
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

300
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,310
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

301
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,314
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

302
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,317
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

303
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,779
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

304
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:00,533
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

305
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,202
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

306
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,835
You're right.
This is bad.

307
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,677
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

308
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,221
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

309
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,229
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

310
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,858
Get the fuck outta the way!

311
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,236
Move it!
Get outta the way!

312
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,995
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

313
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,331
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

314
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,374
Move!

315
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,008
Jesus!

316
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,510
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

317
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,763
Move it!
Move outta the way!

318
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,419
I tagged a couple of cops.

319
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,546
Did you kill anybody?

320
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,800
- A few cops.
- No real people?

321
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,802
Just cops.

322
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,190
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

323
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,694
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

324
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,447
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

325
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,074
I don't want to kill anybody.

326
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,827
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

327
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,329
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

328
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,706
That's the way I look at it.

329
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,417
The choice between
doin' ten years...

330
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,295
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

331
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,423
ain't no choice at all.

332
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,176
But I ain't no madman, either.

333
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,847
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

334
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,811
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

335
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,857
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

336
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,985
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

337
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,696
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

338
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,491
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

339
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:51,453
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

340
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,708
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

341
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,878
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

342
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:03,132
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

343
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,761
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

344
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,389
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

345
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:16,729
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

346
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,106
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

347
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,736
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

348
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,490
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

349
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,743
After that,
I don't know what went down.

350
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,786
It was every man for himself.

351
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,789
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

352
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,042
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

353
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,169
What do you think?

354
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,505
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

355
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,927
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

356
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,387
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

357
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,183
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

358
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,645
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

359
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,065
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

360
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,069
I got the diamonds.

361
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,954
That's my boy.

362
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,790
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

363
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:22,086
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

364
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,714
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

365
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,925
That was the plan.
We meet here.

366
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,927
Then where the fuck is everybody?

367
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,097
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

368
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,225
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

369
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,686
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

370
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,689
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

371
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,359
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

372
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,079
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

373
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,081
What?

374
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,877
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

375
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,380
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

376
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,009
No shit?

377
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,637
Thank God we discovered in time.

378
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,849
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

379
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,102
So who's the rat this time?

380
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,146
Mr. Blue?

381
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,981
Mr. Brown?

382
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:28,152
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

383
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,780
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe 90 back a long time.

384
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,159
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

385
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:39,872
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

386
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,042
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

387
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,545
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

388
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,756
For all I know, you're the rat.

389
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,175
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

390
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,635
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

391
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,180
For all we know, he's the rat.

392
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,516
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

393
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,685
so don't you be calling him a rat!

394
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,146
Look, I'm right, okay?

395
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,690
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

396
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,073
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

397
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,828
Go down the hall, make a left,
90 up the stairs...

398
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,830
and make a right.

399
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,217
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

400
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,929
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

401
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,473
But I thought you two
were a team.

402
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,476
We were for a little while.

403
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:46,188
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

404
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,815
Why?

405
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,738
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

406
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,949
What's she doin' now?

407
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,494
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

408
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,746
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

409
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,129
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

410
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,464
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

411
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,509
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

412
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,761
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

413
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,140
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

414
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,725
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

415
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,020
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

416
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,522
Bad luck.

417
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,482
I guess you can say that again.

418
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,277
What's the exposure like?

419
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,280
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

420
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,783
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

421
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,286
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

422
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,289
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

423
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,124
Security pretty lax.

424
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,543
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

425
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,671
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

426
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:57,426
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from Israel.

427
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,761
They're like a way station,
you know?

428
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,182
- They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
- No, they're not.

429
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,645
What's the cut, poppa?

430
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,316
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

431
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,571
Look, man, you do what you want.

432
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,449
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

433
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,577
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

434
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,205
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

435
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,542
Huh? Is he dead or what?

436
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,963
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

437
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,716
I think he's just passed out.

438
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,845
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

439
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,723
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

440
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,810
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

441
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:54,358
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

442
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,194
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

443
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:01,073
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

444
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,952
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goof ll. We gotta book up.

445
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,621
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

446
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,875
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

447
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,336
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

448
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,381
You got an idea, spit it out.

449
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,258
Joe could help.

450
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:24,137
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

451
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,224
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

452
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,395
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

453
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:35,399
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

454
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:39,278
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

455
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,905
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

456
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,367
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

457
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,161
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

458
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:52,916
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

459
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,423
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

460
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,302
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

461
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,390
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

462
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,184
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

463
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:14,062
He begged me to do it.

464
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:18,066
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

465
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,319
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

466
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,071
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

467
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,823
He knows a little about me.

468
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,204
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

469
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,416
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

470
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,917
Why?

471
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,088
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

472
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,841
It was just
a natural conversation.

473
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,969
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

474
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,596
He asked.

475
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,684
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

476
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,188
It was my fault he got shot.

477
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,690
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

478
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,193
He's screamin'.

479
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,446
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

480
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:08,450
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

481
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:12,120
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

482
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,498
And he asked me
what my name was.

483
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:20,879
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

484
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:27,135
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

485
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,263
It's against the rules?

486
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,266
I don't trust you enough?

487
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,520
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

488
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,106
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

489
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,401
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

490
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,903
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

491
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,280
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

492
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,242
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

493
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:54,621
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

494
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,916
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

495
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,628
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

496
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,298
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

497
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,301
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

498
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,053
If we don't, he's gonna die.

499
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,181
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

500
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,934
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

501
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,400
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

502
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,569
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

503
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,780
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

504
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,576
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

505
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,454
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

506
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,581
and that can't happen!

507
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,333
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

508
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,919
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

509
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,589
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

510
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,924
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

511
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,428
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

512
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,431
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

513
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,350
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

514
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,060
Mr. Blonde.

515
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,440
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

516
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,073
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

517
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,371
Hey, you okay?

518
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,000
Did you see what happened to Blue?

519
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,712
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

520
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,509
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

521
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,886
Enough'. Enough'.!

522
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:36,014
You better start talkin', asshole.

523
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,975
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

524
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,769
We're already freaked out.

525
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,272
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

526
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,025
Okay, let's talk.

527
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,528
We think we got
a rat in the house.

528
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,655
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

529
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,532
What makes you say that?

530
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,534
Is that supposed to be funny?

531
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,411
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

532
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,248
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

533
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,542
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

534
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,170
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

535
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,423
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

536
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,218
Fuck you, maniac!

537
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,056
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

538
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,684
What's this guy's problem?

539
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,687
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

540
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,565
I got a big fuckin' problem...

541
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,609
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

542
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,198
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

543
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,618
In the store! Remember?

544
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,498
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

545
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,584
You almost killed me!

546
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,961
Asshole!

547
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,384
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

548
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,472
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

549
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,516
or are you gonna bite?

550
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,643
What was that?

551
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,150
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

552
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,987
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

553
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,032
or are you gonna bite?

554
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,118
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

555
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,788
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

556
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,166
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

557
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,544
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

558
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,546
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

559
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,174
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

560
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,927
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

561
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,805
- He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
- You takin' his side?

562
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,933
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

563
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:47,937
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

564
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,817
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

565
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,821
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

566
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,659
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

567
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,829
Wow.

568
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,040
That was really exciting.

569
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,836
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

570
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,217
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

571
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:23,598
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

572
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:28,561
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

573
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,480
Follow you? Where?

574
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,108
To my car.

575
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,736
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

576
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,573
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

577
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,617
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

578
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,620
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

579
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,882
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

580
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,385
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

581
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,847
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

582
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:08,393
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

583
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,855
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

584
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,150
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

585
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,027
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

586
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:21,281
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

587
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,867
So in the meantime...

588
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,619
I'll show you guys somethin'.

589
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,792
Jesus Christ.

590
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,879
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

591
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,299
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

592
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,302
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

593
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,429
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

594
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,058
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

595
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,436
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

596
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,022
I know you'll pay me back.

597
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,817
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

598
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:02,030
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

599
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:06,951
I don't care if it's JP. Morgan
or Irving the tailor. You ride it out.

600
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,662
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

601
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,790
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

602
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,584
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

603
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,170
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

604
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,839
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

605
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,846
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

606
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,225
How does freedom feel, huh?

607
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,478
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

608
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,481
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

609
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,483
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

610
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,611
How about a little Remy Martin?

611
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,613
Sure.

612
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,740
Who's your parole officer?

613
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,118
Seymour Scagnetti.

614
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,746
How is he?

615
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,748
He's a fuckin' asshole.

616
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,834
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

617
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,503
It never ceases to amaze me.

618
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,757
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

619
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,635
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

620
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,389
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

621
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,894
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

622
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,896
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

623
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,898
Forget about you?

624
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,901
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

625
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,530
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

626
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,616
Thanks a lot, Joe.

627
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,118
Ah, Vic.

628
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,290
Toothpick Vic.

629
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:41,004
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

630
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,549
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

631
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,051
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

632
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,059
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

633
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,770
I was- My fuckin'-
This week's been crazy.

634
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,064
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

635
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,276
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

636
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,278
That I should've picked you up?

637
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,072
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

638
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,410
I walk In the door, he's like,

639
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,164
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

640
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,833
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

641
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,920
He's ruining the business.

642
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,840
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

643
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,093
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

644
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,971
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

645
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,850
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

646
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,853
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

647
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,188
That's very true.

648
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,987
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

649
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,323
Come on, this ain't a playground!

650
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:59,374
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

651
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,251
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

652
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,462
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

653
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,131
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

654
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,634
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

655
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,012
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

656
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,348
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

657
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,517
I don't think of you that way.

658
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,771
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

659
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:28,277
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

660
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,781
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

661
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,244
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

662
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,664
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

663
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,374
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

664
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,669
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

665
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,755
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

666
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,299
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

667
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,261
and it's comin' out your mouth!

668
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:57,181
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

669
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,143
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

670
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,395
Now both of you, sit down.

671
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,694
Now, Eddie...

672
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,780
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

673
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,908
Vic here's got a parole problem.

674
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,911
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

675
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,581
Scagnetti. Fuck.

676
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,710
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

677
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,963
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

678
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,424
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

679
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,846
Well, I wanna.

680
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,807
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

681
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,311
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

682
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,481
before I can move out on my own.

683
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,942
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

684
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,361
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

685
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,363
every fuckin' night.

686
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,867
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

687
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,869
This ain't all that bad.

688
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,997
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

689
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,958
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

690
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,337
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

691
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,882
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

692
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,010
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

693
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,972
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

694
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,893
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

695
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:28,648
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

696
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,359
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

697
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,653
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

698
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:37,281
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

699
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:41,661
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

700
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,914
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

701
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,624
You just missed him.

702
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,169
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

703
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,005
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

704
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,676
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

705
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,303
We got places all over the place.

706
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,681
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

707
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,685
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

708
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,689
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

709
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,068
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

710
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,904
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

711
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,198
you know, do some real work.

712
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,659
Well, it's hard to say.

713
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,579
It's kind of a strange time now.

714
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,081
Things are kind of--

715
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,209
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

716
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,337
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

717
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,967
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

718
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,345
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

719
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,599
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

720
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,852
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

721
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,061
Huh?

722
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,732
Dad, I got an idea.

723
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,610
Just hear me out.

724
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,197
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

725
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:03,743
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

726
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,746
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

727
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,249
I'd like to have him in.

728
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,003
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

729
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,715
All right, Vic...

730
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:21,886
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

731
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,599
I'd feel great about it.

732
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:35,107
K-BILLY'S "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

733
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,276
If you're the 12th caller...

734
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,780
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

735
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,116
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

736
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:49,163
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

737
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:54,168
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

738
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,802
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

739
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,389
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

740
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:18,651
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

741
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:21,195
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

742
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,197
Get up! Get up!

743
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,577
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

744
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,038
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

745
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,712
I don't know who did what!

746
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,923
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

747
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:44,844
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

748
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,571
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

749
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,616
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

750
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,997
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

751
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,751
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

752
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,836
Huh? Fuck you!

753
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,380
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

754
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,007
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

755
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,096
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

756
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,515
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

757
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,518
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

758
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,146
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

759
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,732
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

760
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,902
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

761
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,155
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

762
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:50,117
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

763
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,620
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

764
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,039
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

765
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,749
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

766
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,501
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

767
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,921
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

768
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,299
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

769
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,677
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

770
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,764
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

771
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,558
I don't know, but somebody did.

772
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,438
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

773
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:22,525
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

774
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,652
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

775
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,154
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

776
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,074
Where's Joseph?

777
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,410
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

778
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,914
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

779
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:39,458
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

780
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,960
What'd Joe say?

781
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,962
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

782
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,965
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

783
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,094
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

784
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,679
You ain't dying. He is.

785
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,224
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

786
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,101
Who?

787
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,604
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

788
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:04,567
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

789
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,861
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

790
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,863
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

791
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,867
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

792
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,244
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

793
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,496
Either he's alive or he's dead...

794
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,624
or the cops got him
or they don't.

795
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:26,088
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

796
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,090
Why are you beatin' on him?

797
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,509
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

798
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,763
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

799
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,641
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

800
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,977
Come on, man, think!

801
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,481
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

802
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:48,027
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

803
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,653
I got a bag.

804
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:53,782
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

805
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,118
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

806
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,414
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

807
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,540
Okay.

808
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:05,503
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

809
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,297
White and Pink,
take a car each.

810
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,926
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

811
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,137
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

812
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,139
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

813
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,684
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

814
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,063
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

815
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,024
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

816
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,276
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

817
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,948
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

818
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:39,036
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

819
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:42,081
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

820
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:46,043
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

821
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,295
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

822
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:51,715
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

823
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,426
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

824
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,303
Tell him!

825
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,931
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

826
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:03,936
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

827
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,730
bam, bam.

828
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,108
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

829
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,319
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

830
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:16,949
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

831
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,744
My fuckin' hero.

832
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,456
Thanks.

833
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,251
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

834
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,461
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

835
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,342
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

836
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,469
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

837
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,597
I haven't been looking at you guys.

838
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,141
Shut the fuck up, man!

839
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,019
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

840
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:49,148
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

841
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,983
Now here's the news!

842
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:54,153
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

843
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,488
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

844
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,741
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

845
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,785
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

846
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,996
Fine. Let's go.

847
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,685
Alone at last.

848
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,459
Guess what.

849
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,212
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

850
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,178
Now, where were we?

851
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,974
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

852
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,478
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

853
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,855
They don't tell me anything.

854
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,360
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

855
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,737
Torture you?
That's a good--

856
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,949
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

857
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,620
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

858
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,250
- My what?
- Your boss.

859
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,253
Excuse me, pal.

860
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:38,382
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

861
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,510
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

862
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,138
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

863
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,266
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

864
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,479
Get that fuckin' shit off.

865
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,782
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

866
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:08,495
I don't really give a good fuck
What you know or don't know...

867
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,416
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

868
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,003
regardless.

869
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,380
Not to get information.

870
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,925
It's amusing to me...

871
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,428
to torture a cop.

872
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,681
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

873
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,518
All you can do is...

874
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,771
pray for a quick death...

875
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,942
which...

876
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,195
you ain't gonna get.

877
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,212
Oh, God.

878
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,474
You ever listen to K-BILLY'S
"Super Sounds of the '705"?

879
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,230
It's my personal favorite.

880
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:27,074
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

881
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:31,245
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

882
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,456
from April of 1974.

883
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,458
That reached up to number five...

884
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,878
as K-BILLY'S "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

885
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,054
Hold still.

886
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,265
Hold still, you fuck.

887
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,079
Was that good for you too?

888
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,707
Hey, what's goin' on?

889
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,208
You hear that?

890
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,096
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

891
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,786
Don't! Stop! Stop!

892
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,082
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

893
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,294
That burn a little bit?

894
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,796
Don't! Stop!

895
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,468
Please stop.

896
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,720
Just stop. Stop.

897
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,722
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

898
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,474
Don't burn me, please.

899
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,314
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

900
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,316
I'm not gonna say anything.

901
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,694
No! Please, no.

902
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,237
- You all through?
- Stop!

903
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,447
You all through?

904
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,992
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

905
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:40,827
You all done?

906
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,829
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

907
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,895
Oh, shit.

908
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,399
Hey,you.

909
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,571
What's your name?

910
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,033
Marvin.

911
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,287
Marvin What?

912
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,084
Marvin Nash.

913
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,551
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

914
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,223
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

915
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,852
Yeah, I know.

916
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,981
You do?

917
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,444
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

918
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,113
Newendyke.

919
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,325
Freddy Newendyke.

920
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,331
Frankie Ferchetti...

921
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:53,251
introduced us
about five months ago.

922
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,632
I don't remember that at all.

923
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,762
I do.

924
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:09,226
Freddy.

925
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,361
How do I look?

926
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,531
What?

927
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,042
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

928
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,297
That fuck.

929
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,261
That sick fuck!

930
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,264
That fuckin' bastard!

931
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,560
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

932
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,563
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

933
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,776
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

934
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:03,071
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

935
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,573
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

936
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,909
I'm fuckin' deformed!

937
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:09,536
Fuck you!

938
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,914
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

939
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,083
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

940
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:27,554
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

941
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,432
I was sent in to get him.

942
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,058
All right?

943
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,103
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

944
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,605
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

945
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,818
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

946
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,322
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

947
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,261
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

948
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,222
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

949
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,767
This better not be a joke.

950
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,520
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

951
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:28,031
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

952
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:32,035
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

953
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,498
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

954
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,542
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

955
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,295
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

956
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,880
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

957
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,507
We get there...

958
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,551
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

959
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,553
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

960
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,431
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

961
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,559
Okay, Mr. Orange.

962
01:04:56,684 --> 01:05:00,313
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

963
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,065
Yes. Mr. White.

964
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:07,695
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

965
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,948
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

966
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,034
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

967
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,203
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

968
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,288
Mr. White.

969
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,915
- A little.
- About what?

970
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,083
The Brewers.

971
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,543
Milwaukee Brewers?

972
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,712
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

973
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:29,592
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

974
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:32,470
And I'll bet you everything...

975
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,598
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

976
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:39,978
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

977
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,481
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

978
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,109
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

979
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,863
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

980
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:54,117
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

981
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,120
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

982
01:05:57,245 --> 01:06:00,123
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

983
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,584
and that I was ready to move.

984
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,336
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

985
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,757
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

986
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,135
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

987
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,137
He's selling out his friends.

988
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,015
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

989
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,017
I'll take care of his ass...

990
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,979
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

991
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:24,647
Gone.

992
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,363
Use the commode story?

993
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,909
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

994
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:41,164
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

995
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:44,501
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

996
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,295
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

997
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:52,300
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

998
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,760
What is this?

999
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,763
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1000
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:03,144
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

1001
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:06,564
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

1002
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,317
Think about it like it's a joke.

1003
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:12,529
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

1004
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,531
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

1005
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,575
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

1006
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,577
and tell a joke, all right?

1007
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,455
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

1008
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,541
The details sell your story.

1009
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,669
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

1010
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,338
You gotta know
all the details--

1011
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,300
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

1012
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:38,054
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

1013
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,182
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

1014
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,226
they used in high school.

1015
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,229
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

1016
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:49,607
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

1017
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,110
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1018
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:55,613
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1019
01:07:55,697 --> 01:08:00,577
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

1020
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:04,497
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

1021
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,834
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

1022
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,836
The only way to do that...

1023
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,839
is keep sayin' it...

1024
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,341
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1025
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:23,600
This is during
the LA. marijuana drought, 1986.

1026
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:27,103
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

1027
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,355
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

1028
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:34,819
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1029
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,821
and all my friends knew it.

1030
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,574
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy-—"

1031
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,369
I say, "Hey, dude.

1032
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,624
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

1033
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:52,462
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

1034
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,963
It got to be--

1035
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:04,015
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1036
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:08,645
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1037
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:12,148
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

1038
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,150
I was doing all the work.

1039
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:18,529
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

1040
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:22,283
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

1041
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,494
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

1042
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,996
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

1043
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:28,998
When I get some,
I'll call you."

1044
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,502
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

1045
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,046
They're my friends and everything,
but still-

1046
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:38,508
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1047
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,928
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1048
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,556
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1049
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,809
This was a very weird situation.

1050
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,270
Remember back in '86...

1051
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,690
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

1052
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,191
Nobody had anything.

1053
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:58,569
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1054
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:02,573
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1055
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,576
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

1056
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,539
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

1057
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,166
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

1058
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,168
ten percent
and free pot for me...

1059
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,170
if I helped her
that weekend.

1060
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,549
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1061
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:23,094
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1062
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,220
What for?

1063
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,180
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

1064
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,059
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

1065
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:33,062
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1066
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,858
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1067
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,943
She keeps asking me, asking me.

1068
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,946
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1069
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:44,240
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

1070
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:47,368
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

1071
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:49,620
The guy needed it right away.

1072
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,998
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

1073
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,000
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1074
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,711
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

1075
01:10:56,753 --> 01:11:01,466
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1076
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,723
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

1077
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,770
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1078
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:19,484
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

1079
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,528
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

1080
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,031
and they looked at me.

1081
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,909
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1082
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,620
German shepherd starts barking.

1083
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,915
He's barkin' at me.

1084
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,542
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

1085
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:42,298
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

1086
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:46,302
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

1087
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,930
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

1088
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,431
Bam! Right in the face.

1089
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:55,436
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

1090
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,940
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1091
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,942
They can smell it on me.

1092
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,444
Shut up.

1093
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,949
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

1094
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,952
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

1095
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,454
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

1096
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,457
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

1097
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,334
"I know, I know."

1098
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,838
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

1099
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:26,801
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1100
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,970
Put your hands on the dash."

1101
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,056
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

1102
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,475
"I know, buddy, I know."

1103
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:38,229
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

1104
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,981
And I said...

1105
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,943
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

1106
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,737
if you don't put your hands up."

1107
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:52,326
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1108
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,621
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

1109
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:59,000
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1110
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,254
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

1111
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,755
What was he goin' for?

1112
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,091
His fucking registration.

1113
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,011
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

1114
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:13,639
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

1115
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,224
That close, man.

1116
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,760
You knew how to handle
that situation.

1117
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,763
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

1118
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:58,309
Tell me more about Cabot.

1119
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,269
I don't know.

1120
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,313
He's a cool guy.

1121
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,692
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

1122
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,654
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

1123
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,657
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

1124
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,659
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

1125
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,078
Thing.

1126
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,038
Motherfucker...

1127
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,082
looks just like the Thing.

1128
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,922
Hey! Showtime!

1129
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,841
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

1130
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,802
I'll be right down.

1131
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,554
He'll be right down.

1132
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,678
Don't pussy out on me now.

1133
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,680
They don't know.

1134
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,932
They don't know shit.

1135
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:05,186
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

1136
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:08,689
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

1137
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,531
There goes our boy.

1138
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,701
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

1139
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,203
to work undercover.

1140
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,206
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

1141
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,224
I know what I'm talking about.

1142
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,976
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

1143
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,478
There's a slight difference.

1144
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,314
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

1145
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,859
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1146
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,737
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

1147
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,365
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

1148
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,243
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

1149
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:06,747
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1150
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:10,251
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

1151
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:13,254
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

1152
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,465
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

1153
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,592
Tell you guys a story.

1154
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:23,472
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

1155
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,516
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

1156
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,145
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

1157
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,147
Where was she from?
Compton?

1158
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,733
She's from Ladora Heights.

1159
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:37,236
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

1160
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:40,614
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

1161
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,242
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1162
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,161
Anyway...

1163
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:49,623
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1164
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:54,503
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

1165
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,548
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

1166
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,508
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

1167
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,927
about the black female cop?

1168
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,889
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar!"

1169
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,894
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

1170
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,897
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

1171
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,899
Pam Grier did the film.

1172
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:19,570
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1173
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,907
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

1174
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,909
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

1175
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,204
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

1176
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,705
Anne Francis.

1177
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,458
No. That was Honey West.

1178
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,335
Anne Francis is white.

1179
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:38,672
I'm tryin' to tell a stow here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

1180
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,300
We come into the club
one night...

1181
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:43,302
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

1182
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,555
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

1183
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:49,225
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

1184
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,353
Apparently Lady E...

1185
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:55,731
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

1186
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,983
He used to do things to her.

1187
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,069
Like what?
What would he do?

1188
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,862
Beat her up?

1189
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,740
I don't know.
He just did things.

1190
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:08,494
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1191
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,955
She waits for him to get drunk.

1192
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,958
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

1193
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:18,337
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

1194
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,589
and glues his click
to his belly.

1195
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,467
Jesus Christ!

1196
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,345
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

1197
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:29,723
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

1198
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,977
Was he all pissed off?

1199
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,275
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1200
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:47,491
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

1201
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,494
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

1202
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,496
Well, let me tell a joke.

1203
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,250
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

1204
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,168
San Quentin...

1205
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:01,171
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

1206
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:04,550
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

1207
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,552
It's your fault, his fault--"

1208
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,429
All that bullshit.

1209
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:10,264
Finally somebody says...

1210
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,558
"Wait a minute.

1211
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,643
While we were
planning this caper...

1212
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,187
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1213
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,023
Got the message?

1214
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:23,193
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1215
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:27,823
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1216
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:31,327
we'll go down to Hawaiian Islands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

1217
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,454
Find me a different character
down there.

1218
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,831
Right now it's a matter
of business.

1219
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,460
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

1220
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,295
who you already know...

1221
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,214
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

1222
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:46,717
Under no Circumstances...

1223
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,970
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

1224
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,306
by your Christian names.

1225
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:56,727
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1226
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,731
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

1227
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,733
where you might've done time...

1228
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:06,612
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1229
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:10,616
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

1230
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,327
is what you're gonna do.

1231
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,579
That should do it.

1232
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,082
These are your names--

1233
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:21,085
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

1234
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,587
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

1235
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,839
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1236
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,510
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

1237
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,764
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1238
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,517
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

1239
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,020
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1240
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:43,524
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1241
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,901
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

1242
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:48,153
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

1243
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:51,615
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1244
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,617
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1245
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,536
How about Mr. Purple?

1246
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,621
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1247
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:00,124
You're not Mr. Purple.

1248
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:04,420
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1249
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:06,296
Who cares what your name is?

1250
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:10,008
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1251
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,804
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

1252
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,640
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1253
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,810
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

1254
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,647
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1255
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,275
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

1256
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,569
my way or the highway.

1257
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,696
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1258
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:34,450
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

1259
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,161
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1260
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,164
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

1261
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:43,167
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

1262
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:48,797
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

1263
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,217
Let's go to work.

1264
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,179
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1265
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,807
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

1266
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,727
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

1267
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,314
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

1268
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:07,608
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1269
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:11,320
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

1270
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:14,573
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my click.

1271
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,994
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1272
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,248
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

1273
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,459
We're there
for those stones, period.

1274
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:29,004
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1275
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:33,217
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1276
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,387
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1277
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:41,892
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

1278
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,895
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1279
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,774
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1280
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,235
smash their nose with your gun.

1281
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,779
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

1282
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,782
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

1283
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,785
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1284
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,413
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

1285
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:07,417
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1286
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,255
If it's the manager,
that's different.

1287
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,549
The managers know not
to fuck around...

1288
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,926
so if he's giving you static...

1289
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:20,264
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1290
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:24,268
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

1291
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,563
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1292
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:30,566
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

1293
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,572
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

1294
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,088
Fuck.

1295
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,358
Jesus.

1296
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,694
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

1297
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:18,196
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

1298
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,711
Is he dead?

1299
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,006
Did he die or not?

1300
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:38,634
Let's go.

1301
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,629
Hold it! Get out!

1302
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,174
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1303
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,900
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

1304
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,903
I can't believe she killed me.

1305
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:41,530
Who'd have fucking thought that?

1306
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:44,199
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

1307
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,202
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1308
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,079
But you ain't dying.

1309
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,291
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1310
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,545
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

1311
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,081
What the fuck happened?

1312
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,127
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1313
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:40,630
What? I didn't hear you.

1314
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,132
I said...

1315
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,510
Blonde went crazy.

1316
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:50,891
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1317
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,225
This cop?

1318
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,357
He went crazy?
Something like that?

1319
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:01,526
Worse or better?

1320
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,780
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

1321
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,033
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1322
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:11,995
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

1323
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:13,747
What'd I tell ya?

1324
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:17,375
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1325
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,670
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

1326
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:24,382
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1327
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,677
I don't buy it.

1328
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:29,179
Doesn't make sense.

1329
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:35,936
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

1330
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:39,564
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1331
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,817
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

1332
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:46,071
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

1333
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,949
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1334
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,200
was gonna kill you...

1335
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:53,453
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

1336
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,455
take the diamonds and scram.

1337
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:58,708
I'm right about that, right?
That's your stow?

1338
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,336
I swear on my mother's soul...

1339
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,046
that's what happened.

1340
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,967
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

1341
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,178
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1342
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,848
He could've fuckin' walked.

1343
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:17,102
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1344
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:20,313
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

1345
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,607
He did four years for us.

1346
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:25,110
So, Mr. Orange...

1347
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:28,238
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

1348
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:31,116
who did four years
for my father...

1349
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:36,121
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

1350
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:39,249
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

1351
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:42,252
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

1352
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:46,965
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

1353
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:48,967
to rip us off?

1354
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:54,014
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1355
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:55,765
What the hell for?

1356
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,768
It'd just be more bullshit.

1357
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:02,898
This man set us up.

1358
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:07,235
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

1359
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:11,031
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

1360
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:14,784
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

1361
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:19,497
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

1362
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:20,999
what you're talking about.

1363
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:24,628
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1364
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,504
Like hell I am.

1365
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,674
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1366
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,426
He's a good kid.

1367
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:34,054
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1368
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,931
We're all real emotional.

1369
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:40,185
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

1370
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:41,811
You don't know jack shit!

1371
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,063
I do.

1372
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,065
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

1373
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,317
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

1374
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,320
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

1375
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,447
How do you know all this?

1376
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,951
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

1377
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:59,287
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1378
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:03,083
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

1379
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,543
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1380
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:10,215
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1381
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:13,093
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

1382
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:16,096
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1383
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:18,098
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1384
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,850
Larry, look...

1385
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,852
it's been quite a long time.

1386
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,354
A lot of jobs.

1387
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:27,482
There's no need for this, man.

1388
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,985
Let's just put our guns down...

1389
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,862
and let's settle this...

1390
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,572
with a fucking conversation.

1391
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:38,118
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

1392
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:40,370
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

1393
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:43,748
Larry, we have been friends.

1394
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:46,001
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

1395
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:48,003
but I'll put bullets
in you.

1396
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:50,338
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

1397
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,383
Goddamn you, Joe...

1398
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:54,884
don't make me do this.

1399
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,637
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

1400
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:46,371
I'm sorry, kid.

1401
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,708
Looks like we're gonna...

1402
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:54,003
do a little time.

1403
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:02,387
I'm a cop.

1404
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:06,141
Larry...

1405
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,394
I'm sorry.

1406
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,355
I'm...

1407
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:14,524
so sorry.

1408
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:19,863
I'm a cop.

1409
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,381
I'm sorry.

1410
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:51,561
I'm sorry.

1411
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:54,814
I'm...

1412
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:56,149
Sorr--

1413
01:34:58,902 --> 01:34:59,944
Freeze!

1414
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,071
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1415
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:04,073
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1416
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:06,951
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1417
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:10,288
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
