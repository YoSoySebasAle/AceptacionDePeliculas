1
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:58,608
Good to see you.

2
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:09,817
Please...

3
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,618
THE TWINS

4
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,904
Will of Mrs Nawal Marwan.

5
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:43,022
Opening of the will
before her two children,

6
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,900
Simon Marwan
and Jeanne Marwan.

7
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:54,161
In conformance with the instructions
and rights of Mrs Nawal Marwan,

8
00:04:55,246 --> 00:05:00,076
Notary Jean Lebel is named
executor of the will.

9
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,264
That was your mother's decision.

10
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,183
I was against it, but she insisted.

11
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,259
You know...

12
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:17,228
your mother was more
than an employee.

13
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,401
My late wife and I
considered you our family.

14
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,901
So...I couldn't refuse.

15
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:31,701
All my assets are divided between
the twins Jeanne and Simon.

16
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,664
My money will be halved,

17
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,874
and my belongings
divided as they see fit.

18
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:40,168
Burial.

19
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,460
To Notary Jean Lebel:

20
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:48,546
bury me with no casket,
no prayers, naked,

21
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:51,974
face down,
away from the world.

22
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,770
Stone and epitaph.

23
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:01,765
I want no gravestone,
nor my name engraved anywhere.

24
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:05,476
No epitaph for those
who don't keep their promises.

25
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:09,278
To Jeanne and Simon:

26
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,743
childhood is a knife
stuck in your throat.

27
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:15,025
It can't be easily removed.

28
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,080
Jeanne, Mr Lebel will give you
an envelope.

29
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:26,996
The envelope is for your father.

30
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:31,257
Find him and give it to him.

31
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:38,223
Simon, the notary will give you
an envelope...

32
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,389
I've heard enough.

33
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,233
I haven't finished.

34
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,726
Go on.

35
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:53,074
Simon, the notary will give you
an envelope.

36
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:55,907
The envelope is for your brother.

37
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,948
Find him and give him
the envelope.

38
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:05,043
TO THE SON

39
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,878
When the envelopes
have been delivered,

40
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,924
you will be given a letter.

41
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,259
The silence will be broken,

42
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:16,585
a promise kept,

43
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,390
and you can place a stone
on my grave and on it engrave

44
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:22,516
my name in the sun.

45
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,865
I admit, it's unusual.

46
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,630
- Anything to sign?
- No, not today.

47
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,461
OK.

48
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,130
Thanks, Jean.

49
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,128
- Let's go.
- Wait.

50
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,596
You know about our father.

51
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,773
And that we have no brother.

52
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:07,234
Why did you let her write that?

53
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,980
I understand your reaction.
It's very surprising.

54
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,860
Don't pretend you buy this.
You knew her. It can't be.

55
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:20,529
One doesn't invent such things,
not in a will.

56
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:24,077
There's this, too.

57
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:43,135
Look, your mother has left us
something rather...

58
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,023
We'll sleep on it and...

59
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:48,981
We'll be in touch.

60
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:51,314
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.

61
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,150
Sit down, Simon.

62
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,533
Look, Jean...

63
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:59,822
Your secretary liked working for you.

64
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,659
At least she did that right. Bravo.

65
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:06,291
But your secretary was my mother.

66
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,498
And that job,
a whole other matter...

67
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,665
Simon...

68
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:13,423
Bury your secretary how you want.

69
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,755
But I'll bury my mother normally.

70
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:19,471
For once in her life
she'll have acted normally.

71
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,509
End of discussion.

72
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:41,034
Take your time.
Come back when Simon's calmer.

73
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:48,286
I know it's very unusual, but...

74
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,377
...your mother wasn't crazy,
Jeanne.

75
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:15,146
We're a big family suddenly.

76
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:22,073
She ever mention a dog?

77
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:24,737
Big families always have a dog.

78
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,487
Do we have to find it now too?

79
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:29,619
She's fucking crazy.

80
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,421
I'll talk to Jean.

81
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,206
About what?

82
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,380
Having a normal funeral.

83
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:47,136
We'll take care of her, then you.

84
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:02,572
Where you going?

85
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,866
- Bury her any way you want.
- Cut it out.

86
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,662
You weren't there when she died,

87
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,918
you were there when
she had her accident...

88
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,381
You feel guilty about everything!

89
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,964
I don't feel guilty.

90
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,298
Do you realize what we just heard?

91
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:24,513
She's gone, Christ!
It's over. Peace at last!

92
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,965
I feel so fucking peaceful!

93
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,860
I'm at peace.

94
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:43,652
I can see that.

95
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:50,242
The mathematics
you've studied until now

96
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:54,539
have sought to provide
clear and definitive answers

97
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:57,995
to clear and definitive problems.

98
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:01,047
Now you are embarking
on a new adventure.

99
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:03,631
You will face insoluble problems

100
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,927
that will lead to other,
equally insoluble problems.

101
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:14,056
Friends will insist that the object
of your toil is futile.

102
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:17,524
You'll have no way
of defending yourself,

103
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:21,516
for the problems will be
of mind-boggling complexity.

104
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:27,701
Welcome to pure mathematics
and the realm of solitude.

105
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:32,743
Let me introduce my assistant,
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

106
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:35,249
Hello.

107
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,422
We'll start with
the Collatz conjecture.

108
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,921
What does your intuition tell you?

109
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,556
Your intuition is always right.

110
00:12:56,685 --> 00:13:00,605
That's why you have the makings
of a true mathematician.

111
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:03,651
But for this,
you're going to need help.

112
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,816
Do you have family there?

113
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,820
- Any contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

114
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:14,329
You just learned that
a) your father is alive,

115
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:17,373
and b) you have another brother.

116
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:21,538
What's ridiculous is
to challenge the inevitable.

117
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:26,458
You have to know,
or your mind will never be at peace.

118
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,639
And without peace of mind,
no pure mathematics.

119
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,176
You need a starting point.

120
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:46,776
My father died during the war,
in Daresh.

121
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:49,032
That's the unknown variable.

122
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:51,534
You never start
with the unknown variable.

123
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,201
My mother's from Der Om,
a village in the Fouad.

124
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:02,581
She studied French
at Daresh University.

125
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,419
If she studied, there's hope.

126
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:09,012
Saïd Haidar.

127
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,755
You'll pay a visit to Saïd Haidar.

128
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:17,006
An old friend who teaches in Daresh.
You can trust him.

129
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,934
Mum?

130
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,889
Are you alright?

131
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,935
What are you doing?

132
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,148
Mum?

133
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,199
Are you OK?

134
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:24,332
Madame, you're on my towel.

135
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:54,766
Mum?

136
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,613
What happened?

137
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,069
Where's Jeanne?

138
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,039
Mum?

139
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,303
- Does she get migraines?
- No.

140
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:25,047
- Memory lapses?
- No.

141
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
- Incidences of falling?
- No.

142
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,558
Moments of confusion?

143
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:32,725
She's usually confused.

144
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:34,734
No, she's never confused.

145
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,893
Wahab, come.

146
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:11,578
Let go of my sister.

147
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,920
Where are you going,
son of a refugee?

148
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:24,673
Nicolas, stop!

149
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,589
Go back home!

150
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,927
Wahab!

151
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:32,014
We'll seek you in your camps
and slaughter you!

152
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,427
Give it!

153
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,309
- I want to.
- It's my duty.

154
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:41,323
You stained our family's honour.

155
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,651
That's enough!
Come home now!

156
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,359
Come home!

157
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,294
Get away!

158
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,091
What have you done?

159
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:08,465
You've humiliated us,
ruined the family name!

160
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:13,853
Why, my God, have you
cast us into darkness?

161
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,640
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do this to me?

162
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,810
What am I to do with you?
Should I kill you?

163
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:25,728
I'm pregnant, Grandma.

164
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,530
My God, blackness everywhere!
Why?

165
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:35,657
Why did you do this to us?
Am I supposed to kill you?

166
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,457
What am I going to do with you?

167
00:22:57,994 --> 00:22:59,414
Eat.

168
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:04,174
Eat if you want your child
to be strong.

169
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,173
Listen to me carefully.

170
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,299
There's nothing here for you now.

171
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,386
I'll help you after the birth.

172
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:21,976
I want you to leave here.

173
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:27,821
You'll stay with your Uncle Charbel
in town.

174
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,441
You'll go to school there.

175
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:36,028
You'll learn to read, to think.
To escape this misery.

176
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,240
Promise me and I'll help you.

177
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:46,254
Promise me that you'll go to school.

178
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,841
I promise you, Grandma.

179
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,643
I promise you.

180
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:44,142
Take a good look at your mother.
So you'll recognize her.

181
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:52,691
I'll find you again one day.
I promise you, my love.

182
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,781
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

183
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,531
Come, it's time you left.

184
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:47,028
I see terrible times ahead.

185
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,429
One day I'll find you, my son.

186
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,360
I received the message
from my friend Niv Cohen,

187
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:51,567
but I can't help you,
because, back then,

188
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:55,789
I was teaching the history
of mathematics at Paris XI.

189
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:58,461
More precisely,

190
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:03,671
the period when
Leonhard Euler succeeded,

191
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:08,804
although blind, in first providing
a formal mathematical resolution

192
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:12,505
to the problem of
the Seven Bridges of Königsberg.

193
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:16,387
Yes, he defied Diderot
at the Court

194
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,676
by declaring,

195
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:25,109
"Sir,
e (exponent) pi + 1 = 0.

196
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,070
"Therefore, God exists!"

197
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:32,568
Niv, Niv, Niv...

198
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:49,591
Hello. Do you speak French?

199
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,585
Of course. Can I help you?

200
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:55,047
I'm looking for someone
who might know this woman.

201
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:59,558
She studied here
about 35 years ago.

202
00:31:00,768 --> 00:31:04,348
You're kidding, right?
I wasn't born. I can't help...

203
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,280
No, I'm not kidding.
You must know someone who can help.

204
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:12,821
I've travelled too far. Please.
Her name is Nawal Marwan.

205
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:24,617
You're kind.

206
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,090
No, I want to get rid of you.

207
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:29,461
Najat, it's me.

208
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,459
Got any time to waste?

209
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,262
She looks familiar.

210
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:39,506
Perhaps she worked
on the student newspaper.

211
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:42,888
That was long ago.

212
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:48,614
The people who left
changed their identity.

213
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:54,454
But it's striking.

214
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,880
The photograph of your mother
was taken in Kfar Ryat.

215
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:11,797
Look here.

216
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:14,722
It's the sign for Kfar Ryat.

217
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:18,598
It's a prison in the South.

218
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:26,481
- You don't know of Kfar Ryat?
- No.

219
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:29,774
Then you're definitely not from here.

220
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,780
You don't know the South.

221
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:12,821
If the international community
does not intervene immediately,

222
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,990
the refugees...

223
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:22,124
...crammed into camps
along the border...

224
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:26,374
She's here.

225
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,041
We students oppose
the Nationalist Party

226
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:33,588
and expelling the refugees
in the South.

227
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:36,593
The Nationalists support
the Christian right,

228
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:38,756
who openly threaten
the refugees.

229
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,594
The refugees are armed and...

230
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:47,269
...and have the support of most
of the Muslims in this country.

231
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:51,403
But you yourself are Christian.

232
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:55,022
We stand for peace.
This is not about religion.

233
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,825
Nawal! Nawal!

234
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:09,084
The radio!
They shut the university!

235
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:11,956
The Nationalists closed
down the campus!

236
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:32,769
Nawal, come back!
Stay here!

237
00:34:34,356 --> 00:34:37,276
Uncle Charbel,
they shut the campus!

238
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:41,361
There will be fighting!

239
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:44,029
I want you to stay with me!

240
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,301
There's gunfire.

241
00:35:06,347 --> 00:35:09,217
- Girls, come eat!
- Mum, they attacked the university!

242
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,100
That's no reason not to eat!

243
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:55,444
Christian villages in the South
were attacked.

244
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:57,313
God help us!

245
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,729
That's why they shut the university.

246
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:03,279
It won't be long
before it blows up here too.

247
00:36:04,947 --> 00:36:10,077
We'll go to the mountains
until things calm down.

248
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,122
For how long?

249
00:36:12,246 --> 00:36:14,036
We go tomorrow.

250
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,130
The rest of the family
is already there.

251
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:19,341
What about school?

252
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:24,421
The schools will close anyway.
God only knows until when.

253
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:27,965
- And the newspaper?
- Don't worry.

254
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,100
The paper can survive
without us for a while.

255
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:36,136
Ideas only survive
if we're there to defend them.

256
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,440
Exactly, Rafqa. Exactly.

257
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:56,292
There are two orphanages there.
I'll come later on foot.

258
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,536
You're not going there now.

259
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:04,463
- You promised Grandma...
- You heard your father.

260
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:09,215
If they attack the camps,
the country's lost.

261
00:37:09,345 --> 00:37:11,045
School's finished.

262
00:37:15,726 --> 00:37:17,886
I think of him every day.

263
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,150
He's my child.

264
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:22,272
I want to find him.

265
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:47,876
- I'm going to Shadia's for water.
- Make it quick, Nawal.

266
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,546
- Name?
- Nawal.

267
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:51,671
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

268
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:55,376
- Where are you going?
- The South.

269
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:58,551
- Why?
- To join my husband.

270
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:22,661
Wahab...

271
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,889
It's always been
a girls' orphanage?

272
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,860
The boys moved
to Kfar Khout 3 years ago.

273
00:42:57,276 --> 00:43:00,736
Come with us. Kfar Khout
was attacked yesterday.

274
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,160
I'm looking for the orphanage.
Do you know where it is?

275
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:36,329
There.

276
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:40,038
The children!
Where are the children?

277
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,010
Ask someone who was there.

278
00:44:43,131 --> 00:44:48,301
The Muslim villagers have fled
to the camp in Deressa.

279
00:44:48,428 --> 00:44:52,058
They fear the reprisals
that'll come.

280
00:44:52,182 --> 00:44:55,432
Maybe the children are with them.

281
00:44:56,728 --> 00:45:02,438
Chamseddine and his men killed all
the Christians to avenge the refugees.

282
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:09,155
Maybe the children are in Deressa.

283
00:46:32,324 --> 00:46:34,334
Are you going to Deressa?

284
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:40,284
I'm Christian! I'm Christian!

285
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:53,544
My daughter! My daughter!

286
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:17,693
THE SOUTH

287
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:34,431
Hi, Simon. It's me. I'm in mum's
village. I wish you were here.

288
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:36,005
Listen.

289
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:37,912
I told you never
to come back here!

290
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:42,792
Hello.

291
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,001
Souha?

292
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:50,839
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!

293
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:59,431
I told you to stop saying that!

294
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,975
Hello. Can I help you?

295
00:56:08,066 --> 00:56:10,066
Hello.

296
00:56:10,193 --> 00:56:14,363
Does anyone speak
French or English?

297
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,320
Where's Samia?

298
00:56:59,325 --> 00:57:00,735
Thank you.

299
00:57:16,217 --> 00:57:19,427
- You speak French?
- Yes. Hello.

300
00:57:19,554 --> 00:57:23,104
Hello. My name is Samia.

301
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,850
I'm Jeanne Marwan.
Thanks for helping.

302
00:57:27,979 --> 00:57:31,109
Marwan? There are lots
of Marwans here.

303
00:57:31,232 --> 00:57:32,822
Really?

304
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:36,318
I'm from Canada.

305
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,278
I'm looking for Souha.

306
00:57:40,032 --> 00:57:42,032
Souha? That's her.

307
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,410
She's my great-grandmother.

308
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:56,838
The grocer at the corner
gave me your name.

309
00:58:03,472 --> 00:58:06,472
I'm looking for my father.
His name is Wahab.

310
00:58:14,317 --> 00:58:16,477
My mother was Nawal Marwan.

311
00:58:18,404 --> 00:58:20,074
She was born here.

312
00:58:26,495 --> 00:58:28,035
We don't know her.

313
00:58:28,164 --> 00:58:30,424
Yes, we know her!

314
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:40,626
Her mother is a disgrace!

315
00:58:54,273 --> 00:58:58,033
The Marwan family
was struck by disgrace.

316
00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:00,649
The war came.

317
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:07,794
I'm looking for Wahab.

318
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,791
She doesn't know Wahab.

319
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:22,182
I can't help you.
I'm sorry, I'm tired.

320
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:35,689
If you are the daughter
of Nawal Marwan,

321
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:39,903
you are not welcome here.

322
00:59:40,027 --> 00:59:42,027
Go home.

323
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:47,873
You're looking for your father,

324
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:50,544
but you don't know
who your mother is.

325
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:27,777
I arrived after the massacre
at the Deressa camp.

326
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:31,405
Everything was smouldering.

327
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:35,827
I searched for my son
among pools of blood.

328
01:02:37,455 --> 01:02:40,955
I never want to forget
what I saw and heard.

329
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:45,001
You say you oppose our enemy.

330
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:48,719
That does not make you our friend.

331
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:52,338
Why should Chamseddine trust you?

332
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:56,137
My son's father was
a Deressa refugee.

333
01:02:56,265 --> 01:02:58,725
My son was swallowed
by the war.

334
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:01,853
I have nothing left to lose.

335
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,441
I have only hatred
for the Nationalists.

336
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:10,780
That's not what you wrote
in Charbel's newspaper.

337
01:03:11,864 --> 01:03:16,414
My uncle believed that his words
and books would promote peace.

338
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,945
I believed him.

339
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:24,421
Life taught me otherwise.

340
01:03:26,712 --> 01:03:28,512
What do you want now?

341
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:34,755
To teach the enemy
what life has taught me.

342
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:30,734
Very good.

343
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:33,609
Very good. You just forgot this.

344
01:04:38,951 --> 01:04:40,991
How's the French?

345
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,209
I am much gooder, Dad.

346
01:04:45,332 --> 01:04:48,632
The comparative of "good"
is "better," darling.

347
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:55,046
I want my son
to speak several languages.

348
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:58,045
So he can understand
without an intermediary.

349
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:26,832
- Nawal here.
- How are you, Nawal? This is Nouchine.

350
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:31,843
Good evening, Nouchine.
How is your mother?

351
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:35,592
My mother is very well.
Tomorrow at 10:00am.

352
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:39,643
Tomorrow it is.

353
01:06:55,796 --> 01:06:58,006
- Hey, lovely.
- Good morning.

354
01:06:58,924 --> 01:07:01,554
- Will you go out with us Thursday?
- No.

355
01:07:02,428 --> 01:07:04,468
- Friday?
- No.

356
01:07:04,596 --> 01:07:06,466
- Saturday?
- No.

357
01:07:08,642 --> 01:07:10,732
We're patient!

358
01:07:10,853 --> 01:07:12,603
So am I.

359
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:29,081
Don't forget.
"Always" always takes an S.

360
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:32,773
Goddamn whore!

361
01:10:15,329 --> 01:10:19,669
Amnesty International repeatedly
condemned the Kfar Ryat prison.

362
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:31,051
This is the women's section.

363
01:10:32,554 --> 01:10:34,394
The cells are bigger.

364
01:10:34,514 --> 01:10:36,974
Some prisoners were kept for 1 5 years.

365
01:10:47,194 --> 01:10:50,364
- When was it built?
- After the massacres.

366
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:52,619
Right after war started.

367
01:10:52,741 --> 01:10:55,161
They jailed 600 political prisoners.

368
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,500
You can go in. I'll take a picture.

369
01:11:13,053 --> 01:11:14,893
Do you know her?

370
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:19,271
It was taken here.

371
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:24,061
I don't know her.
That was a long time ago, so I...

372
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:26,609
Do you know anyone who worked here?

373
01:12:07,024 --> 01:12:16,914
Hello.

374
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,540
I'm looking for Fahim Harrsa.

375
01:12:26,835 --> 01:12:28,955
I'm the school janitor.

376
01:12:30,047 --> 01:12:31,627
Yes, but before?

377
01:12:31,757 --> 01:12:33,167
Before?

378
01:12:34,092 --> 01:12:37,052
That was before I was school janitor.

379
01:12:37,179 --> 01:12:40,469
I've been the school janitor a long time.

380
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:44,519
Do you know this woman?

381
01:12:44,644 --> 01:12:46,654
She was in Kfar Ryat.

382
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:51,899
I'm the school janitor. End of story.

383
01:12:55,614 --> 01:12:58,244
I need someone who knew her,

384
01:12:58,366 --> 01:13:00,366
who can tell me about her.

385
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,206
She's my mother.

386
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:09,751
She's the Woman who Sings.

387
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:11,548
Number 72.

388
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,430
She shot the leader
of the right-wing Christian militias.

389
01:13:19,096 --> 01:13:21,256
They made her pay a high price.

390
01:13:21,389 --> 01:13:23,599
Very high.

391
01:13:23,725 --> 01:13:25,345
15 years.

392
01:13:25,477 --> 01:13:28,227
"The Woman who Sings."

393
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:31,859
They called her
"The Woman who Sings."

394
01:13:31,983 --> 01:13:33,823
She sang all the time.

395
01:13:34,736 --> 01:13:36,486
You're sure it's her?

396
01:13:38,031 --> 01:13:40,571
I spent 1 3 years watching her.

397
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:46,786
Have you ever spent 1 3 years
watching someone?

398
01:13:50,127 --> 01:13:52,587
They did everything to break her.

399
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:58,014
At the end, she still stood tall

400
01:13:58,135 --> 01:14:00,335
and looked them in the eye.

401
01:14:02,931 --> 01:14:06,521
Never seen anyone like her.
She wouldn't break.

402
01:14:07,227 --> 01:14:09,187
They were enraged.

403
01:14:16,403 --> 01:14:18,613
So they sent Abou Tarek.

404
01:14:18,738 --> 01:14:20,278
Who's that?

405
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:31,501
Abou Tarek.

406
01:14:33,378 --> 01:14:38,508
You know, sometimes
it's better not to know.

407
01:14:39,718 --> 01:14:41,758
I live with it anyway.

408
01:14:42,554 --> 01:14:44,104
Go on.

409
01:14:45,807 --> 01:14:47,267
Abou Tarek...

410
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:51,308
Abou Tarek was a torture specialist.

411
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:54,479
He raped her again and again.

412
01:14:55,275 --> 01:15:00,275
To break her before her release.
So she'd stop singing.

413
01:15:03,825 --> 01:15:07,615
In the end,
she became pregnant.

414
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:12,084
It was like that. I'll never forget.

415
01:15:12,751 --> 01:15:16,551
72, made pregnant
by Abou Tarek.

416
01:15:18,798 --> 01:15:22,718
They waited until
she gave birth in prison.

417
01:15:23,511 --> 01:15:26,101
Then they let her go.

418
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:32,437
The baby?
Did you see the baby?

419
01:15:34,522 --> 01:15:38,532
There was a doctor
who sometimes came.

420
01:15:38,652 --> 01:15:41,282
I believe he went crazy.

421
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:44,374
Others say he has
a restaurant in Tel Aviv.

422
01:15:46,701 --> 01:15:50,701
That's bullshit.
He went crazy or else he died.

423
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:56,591
Now, the nurse... I know her.
She lives in Daresh.

424
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,166
In Daresh.

425
01:16:09,891 --> 01:16:14,021
Listen, Simon. I don't give a shit.
Just shut up!

426
01:16:14,145 --> 01:16:17,765
Mum was in prison.
Simon, mum...

427
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,435
Mum was raped.

428
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:24,279
She had our brother in jail.

429
01:16:25,907 --> 01:16:27,737
I need you.

430
01:16:44,884 --> 01:16:48,934
THE WOMAN WHO SINGS

431
01:19:26,921 --> 01:19:29,091
The contracts of Notary Amyott.

432
01:19:29,215 --> 01:19:31,965
From 1868-1892.

433
01:19:32,093 --> 01:19:35,803
His son, Edouard, took over until 1 925.
All handwritten.

434
01:19:36,931 --> 01:19:39,981
My grandfather, Charles.
My father, Henri.

435
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,100
And me.

436
01:19:42,228 --> 01:19:45,108
The end, because I'm the last
of the Lebels.

437
01:19:46,691 --> 01:19:49,321
I'll show you the will of a man...

438
01:19:51,946 --> 01:19:53,776
...who led parallel lives.

439
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:59,539
Turned out he had three wives.

440
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:04,042
Here, in Miami and in Honduras,
where he did business.

441
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:10,761
So now, it's not three children
involved, but eight.

442
01:20:10,882 --> 01:20:12,972
That was fun, believe you me!

443
01:20:14,385 --> 01:20:15,795
Look.

444
01:20:18,264 --> 01:20:20,774
Death is never the end of the story.

445
01:20:20,892 --> 01:20:23,022
It always leaves tracks.

446
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:29,270
To find your brother, you have
to retrace your mother's past.

447
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,950
Jean, I want to find my sister.
That's all.

448
01:20:33,071 --> 01:20:37,571
I'm on it. I have a few quick things
to wrap up.

449
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,120
Pack your stuff. We'll leave in...

450
01:20:40,995 --> 01:20:42,615
My passport!

451
01:20:42,747 --> 01:20:44,537
We?

452
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:46,666
Haven't you done enough?

453
01:20:46,793 --> 01:20:48,843
Exactly. I can't pull out now.

454
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:52,970
Grow up, Simon.

455
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,050
I know you need me.

456
01:20:58,137 --> 01:21:00,927
- We find her and come back.
- Promise.

457
01:21:01,683 --> 01:21:06,313
For a notary, Mr Marwan,
a promise is sacred.

458
01:24:01,487 --> 01:24:03,907
Now sing.

459
01:25:11,641 --> 01:25:14,021
That's it. That's it.

460
01:25:15,812 --> 01:25:19,272
The baby's coming.
I can see its head.

461
01:25:19,398 --> 01:25:20,568
Push.

462
01:25:21,484 --> 01:25:24,074
Go on, dear.

463
01:25:31,202 --> 01:25:33,202
The first one is out.

464
01:25:53,683 --> 01:25:56,983
Rest a bit now.

465
01:25:57,854 --> 01:25:59,694
I'm proud of you.

466
01:26:01,107 --> 01:26:03,317
Get ready for the second.

467
01:26:32,847 --> 01:26:35,347
Stop. Give.

468
01:26:36,726 --> 01:26:40,436
- What are you doing?
- You threw them in the river like always.

469
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:43,399
- It's dangerous.
- No.

470
01:26:43,524 --> 01:26:47,534
You did your duty.
You threw them in the river.

471
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:52,073
I'll look after them. They're the babies
of the Woman who Sings.

472
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:15,717
We are a battlefield for other countries.

473
01:27:15,848 --> 01:27:19,808
Imagine if there'd been notaries
back in Noah's day.

474
01:27:19,936 --> 01:27:22,936
We'd only have to look up
the property deeds.

475
01:27:23,064 --> 01:27:27,194
This is your land. This is your land.
The right of way...

476
01:27:27,318 --> 01:27:30,068
Done. Everyone's happy.

477
01:27:30,821 --> 01:27:34,741
- Notaries only began 1 000 years ago.
- That's the problem.

478
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:36,907
We should've been there
from day one.

479
01:27:38,412 --> 01:27:40,412
Thank you again for your help.

480
01:27:40,539 --> 01:27:42,459
It's my pleasure, dear colleague.

481
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:46,293
I have the information you requested by email.

482
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:49,460
Simon, my briefcase is right beside you.

483
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:52,010
Would you please hand it to Mr Lebel?

484
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:57,759
You're very kind, but with the jet lag,
we'll look at it later.

485
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:02,730
In brief, for the father it's complicated.
There's no death certificate.

486
01:28:02,853 --> 01:28:05,733
- For the brother...
- Excuse me, what's this about?

487
01:28:07,274 --> 01:28:09,154
I asked for help, Simon.

488
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:12,026
Mr Maddad agreed, to speed things up.

489
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,660
I told you, we're here to find Jeanne.

490
01:28:17,743 --> 01:28:21,083
Your sister's the easiest family member to find.

491
01:28:28,546 --> 01:28:30,756
I'm so happy you're here.

492
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:32,551
Me too.

493
01:28:40,224 --> 01:28:44,814
The nurse who helped mum deliver in jail...
We can go see her today.

494
01:28:46,355 --> 01:28:48,685
Jeanne, it's enough.

495
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:53,740
Just shut up and come with me.

496
01:28:53,863 --> 01:28:56,283
It's your job to find our brother.

497
01:28:56,407 --> 01:28:59,407
If not for her or yourself,
do it for me!

498
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:08,083
She's in hospital.

499
01:29:13,799 --> 01:29:17,799
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too, dear. Me too.

500
01:29:19,013 --> 01:29:21,433
If she's sleeping, you'll come back.

501
01:29:45,664 --> 01:29:47,294
Mrs Maïka?

502
01:30:19,406 --> 01:30:22,906
Hello, madame.
Thanks for seeing us.

503
01:30:23,035 --> 01:30:25,325
It's about someone you knew.

504
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:27,664
You know Nawal Marwan?

505
01:30:56,485 --> 01:30:59,195
You were a nurse at Kfar Ryat?

506
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:15,460
She says she knew your mother.

507
01:31:16,463 --> 01:31:19,093
You helped our mother give birth?

508
01:31:31,645 --> 01:31:35,315
Madame, we're looking
for the child she had in jail.

509
01:31:35,441 --> 01:31:37,781
Can you help us?

510
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:43,743
She worked in Kfar Ryat prison.

511
01:31:44,658 --> 01:31:46,908
She assisted her during delivery.

512
01:31:48,954 --> 01:31:51,004
She safeguarded the babies.

513
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:01,630
And returned them to
the Woman who Sings upon her release.

514
01:32:01,759 --> 01:32:05,429
- Sarwan! Janaan!
- Nawal Marwan had twins.

515
01:36:20,934 --> 01:36:23,064
You really knew the Woman Who Sings?

516
01:36:24,146 --> 01:36:26,226
You don't know what it means for me.

517
01:36:27,941 --> 01:36:32,281
Nawal Marwan worked 1 8 years for me.
As my secretary.

518
01:36:32,404 --> 01:36:35,954
My wife and I were fond of her
and her children.

519
01:36:36,074 --> 01:36:39,834
But I realize I didn't really
know her after all.

520
01:36:42,998 --> 01:36:44,868
- Ready?
- Ready.

521
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:03,020
At my request,
Mr Maddad did research.

522
01:37:03,143 --> 01:37:05,603
To find your brother and father.

523
01:37:11,818 --> 01:37:15,658
For the father, Abou Tarek,
there's no death certificate.

524
01:37:15,781 --> 01:37:18,621
Many in this country disappeared.

525
01:37:18,742 --> 01:37:23,082
He may have gone abroad.
That's what his kind often did.

526
01:37:23,205 --> 01:37:26,165
They're either dead or they left.

527
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:29,091
- Wait and see.
- Maybe this is best.

528
01:37:30,754 --> 01:37:32,674
For the brother...

529
01:37:32,798 --> 01:37:37,638
Your client, Mrs Nawal Marwan,
is from the village of Der Om.

530
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:42,060
She gave the child
to a midwife named Elham,

531
01:37:42,182 --> 01:37:45,392
who placed him
at the Kfar Khout orphanage

532
01:37:45,519 --> 01:37:48,399
in May 1 970.

533
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:52,281
It was hard to locate the registries.

534
01:37:52,401 --> 01:37:55,741
Many documents were destroyed
in the war.

535
01:37:55,862 --> 01:37:59,122
But I finally turned up the registries.

536
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:02,871
The Sisters of Charity
collected and donated them

537
01:38:02,995 --> 01:38:05,035
to the National Archives.

538
01:38:05,163 --> 01:38:08,003
In May 1 970,

539
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:10,875
the midwife of Der Om, Elham,

540
01:38:11,003 --> 01:38:13,503
gave up a male child for adoption.

541
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:17,300
The only boy placed
at the orphanage that month.

542
01:38:17,426 --> 01:38:21,636
Look, he was registered
under the first name of Nihad.

543
01:38:23,348 --> 01:38:24,768
The dates match.

544
01:38:25,851 --> 01:38:27,271
It's him.

545
01:38:28,895 --> 01:38:31,055
He's your brother. Nihad.

546
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:37,280
Kfar Khout orphanage.

547
01:38:37,404 --> 01:38:41,324
Nihad of May.
That was his name for the records.

548
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,330
Nihad of the month of May.

549
01:38:43,452 --> 01:38:46,452
The month of arrival
was a temporary surname.

550
01:38:47,289 --> 01:38:51,419
There were no adoptions at the time.
The war had started.

551
01:38:52,127 --> 01:38:54,337
In 1 974 the orphanage
was destroyed.

552
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:58,801
We must ask who destroyed
Kfar Khout

553
01:38:58,925 --> 01:39:02,005
to learn what happened
to the children.

554
01:39:03,722 --> 01:39:07,812
Between you and me,
given what occurred in the region,

555
01:39:07,934 --> 01:39:09,564
there's little hope.

556
01:39:11,438 --> 01:39:13,978
He's probably dead too.

557
01:39:14,107 --> 01:39:17,397
I didn't say dead.
I said we lost his trace.

558
01:39:19,404 --> 01:39:23,744
They're both dead.
We open the letters. Finished.

559
01:39:23,867 --> 01:39:27,497
I won't allow it.
This kind of thing is sacred.

560
01:39:28,955 --> 01:39:31,415
It would be like a rape.

561
01:39:31,541 --> 01:39:33,831
Great, it runs in the family.

562
01:39:36,755 --> 01:39:38,165
Sorry.

563
01:39:40,717 --> 01:39:45,427
There's one path left,
but it's somewhat radical.

564
01:39:46,515 --> 01:39:50,885
The warlord who razed
the orphanage is still alive.

565
01:39:51,019 --> 01:39:54,229
He may know what happened
to Nihad and the others.

566
01:39:54,356 --> 01:39:56,266
It's been an eternity.

567
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:01,450
You must understand,
those years saw a series of reprisals

568
01:40:01,571 --> 01:40:05,071
that set off each other
with merciless logic.

569
01:40:05,534 --> 01:40:07,164
Like an equation.

570
01:40:09,329 --> 01:40:13,289
A warlord is precisely
the kind of man with a long memory.

571
01:40:13,417 --> 01:40:15,627
He'll remember, believe me.

572
01:40:17,379 --> 01:40:20,549
Wallat Chamseddine.
That's his name.

573
01:40:24,886 --> 01:40:29,176
- Where do we find him?
- You don't find him, he finds you.

574
01:40:32,394 --> 01:40:34,404
We can try something.

575
01:40:36,565 --> 01:40:38,895
Do you like tea, Mr Marwan?

576
01:40:43,655 --> 01:40:45,315
It's your turn.

577
01:40:48,493 --> 01:40:52,043
You'll travel to
the Deressa refugee camp.

578
01:40:52,164 --> 01:40:53,794
You'll drink tea.

579
01:40:53,915 --> 01:40:57,415
With whomever invites you.

580
01:40:57,544 --> 01:41:00,254
You'll tell them you're the son
of the Woman who Sings,

581
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:02,970
and that you're looking
for Nihad of May.

582
01:41:03,091 --> 01:41:05,091
You can't go alone.

583
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:09,430
I'll find someone to accompany you.

584
01:41:31,787 --> 01:41:33,657
Welcome to Deressa.

585
01:42:42,691 --> 01:42:45,691
- Know where we're going?
- No idea.

586
01:43:12,178 --> 01:43:16,388
- How are you?
- Look, you're a grown man!

587
01:43:16,516 --> 01:43:20,226
I finished my engineering degree.

588
01:43:20,353 --> 01:43:24,153
I can't find work, so I drive a taxi.

589
01:43:24,274 --> 01:43:26,364
What brings you here?

590
01:43:26,484 --> 01:43:31,494
I'm with some foreign visitors
who asked me to bring them here.

591
01:43:33,366 --> 01:43:37,696
- Welcome. Come.
- No, thank you. We're short of time.

592
01:43:37,829 --> 01:43:39,579
Please, come.

593
01:43:44,669 --> 01:43:47,089
He's inviting us for tea.

594
01:43:47,213 --> 01:43:48,513
OK.

595
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,780
He asked me
why you came to Deressa.

596
01:44:13,114 --> 01:44:15,284
To find someone, Nihad of May.

597
01:44:25,293 --> 01:44:27,923
He doesn't know a Nihad of May.

598
01:44:28,046 --> 01:44:30,836
He asks what your name is.

599
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:41,350
My mother's from Der Om
in the South.

600
01:44:54,572 --> 01:44:56,622
My mother's the Woman who Sings.

601
01:45:21,975 --> 01:45:23,845
Yeah, it's done.

602
01:45:29,357 --> 01:45:30,977
Wait for what?

603
01:46:04,309 --> 01:46:06,389
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.

604
01:46:06,519 --> 01:46:09,149
We've come to offer our help.

605
01:46:09,272 --> 01:46:11,112
You'll be back in an hour.

606
01:46:12,525 --> 01:46:16,775
- Can I tell my sister?
- No, only an hour. That's a promise.

607
01:46:18,531 --> 01:46:20,701
I'll put on a shirt. One sec.

608
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:26,411
- He's calling.
- That's OK.

609
01:46:27,624 --> 01:46:30,544
Already? Don't worry,
you can go with them.

610
01:46:30,668 --> 01:46:34,958
In the South, one spark
sets everything off. Alright.

611
01:47:49,581 --> 01:47:52,961
You helped us.
Now it's our turn to help you.

612
01:47:54,335 --> 01:47:57,745
You'll leave the country.
It will be simpler.

613
01:47:57,881 --> 01:48:00,551
We'll find you a home and a job.

614
01:48:01,384 --> 01:48:04,434
I want you to have a better life.

615
01:48:06,181 --> 01:48:08,891
We have many contacts in America.

616
01:48:10,935 --> 01:48:13,095
You must go with your children.

617
01:48:13,229 --> 01:48:16,439
I know they're alive.
Take them with you.

618
01:48:19,527 --> 01:48:23,197
Your children will help you, you'll see.

619
01:48:29,787 --> 01:48:32,497
You can't ask that of me.

620
01:48:34,709 --> 01:48:37,249
Your children are our children.

621
01:48:37,378 --> 01:48:39,798
Your family is our family.

622
01:48:39,923 --> 01:48:41,473
Trust me.

623
01:48:42,467 --> 01:48:45,797
I will help you.

624
01:48:45,929 --> 01:48:49,179
I will always be there
for you and your children.

625
01:49:38,147 --> 01:49:39,817
Hello, Sarwan.

626
01:49:42,026 --> 01:49:45,896
Forgive the precautions,
but it's for your protection.

627
01:49:47,782 --> 01:49:50,742
I am called Wallat Chamseddine.

628
01:49:53,121 --> 01:49:57,251
Tell me, how can I help you,
Sarwan Marwan?

629
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:01,420
You knew my mother?

630
01:50:01,546 --> 01:50:03,836
Let's say she worked for me.

631
01:50:04,966 --> 01:50:06,966
How can I help you?

632
01:50:10,805 --> 01:50:13,805
I'm looking for a man
named Nihad of May.

633
01:50:15,143 --> 01:50:17,353
Why do you want Nihad of May?

634
01:50:19,314 --> 01:50:22,984
He's my brother.
My mother asked me to find him.

635
01:50:24,777 --> 01:50:29,317
How can you say that Nihad of May
is the son of Nawal Marwan?

636
01:50:32,493 --> 01:50:36,123
My brother was placed
at the Kfar Khout orphanage.

637
01:50:37,665 --> 01:50:40,075
We found the birth records.

638
01:50:41,544 --> 01:50:45,424
The dates, everything fits.
Nihad of May is my brother.

639
01:51:28,883 --> 01:51:32,973
My friends and I attacked
the Christians of Kfar Khout,

640
01:51:34,138 --> 01:51:38,268
to avenge the aggressions
against our brother refugees.

641
01:51:40,144 --> 01:51:43,234
There was an orphanage
in Kfar Khout.

642
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:47,859
I spared the children
and I took them with us.

643
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,566
Nihad was among them.

644
01:51:51,697 --> 01:51:56,327
We trained them, prepared them
to fight alongside us.

645
01:51:57,495 --> 01:52:01,455
Nihad had a gift.
He was special.

646
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:05,880
He quickly became
a formidable marksman.

647
01:52:07,171 --> 01:52:10,721
But...he wanted to find
his mother.

648
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:13,801
He searched for months.

649
01:52:15,513 --> 01:52:18,143
I don't know what he saw or heard.

650
01:52:19,392 --> 01:52:23,442
He became...crazed with war.

651
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:28,320
He came back to see me.
He wanted to be a martyr.

652
01:52:28,443 --> 01:52:32,703
His mother would see his photo
on every wall in the country.

653
01:52:34,282 --> 01:52:36,162
But I refused.

654
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:40,040
He went back to Daresh.

655
01:52:40,163 --> 01:52:44,583
He became the most dangerous
sniper in the region.

656
01:52:44,709 --> 01:52:48,169
A real machine.
He would shoot at anyone.

657
01:52:49,046 --> 01:52:52,876
And then,
there was the enemy invasion.

658
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:58,680
And one morning...
they captured Nihad.

659
01:52:58,806 --> 01:53:00,886
He'd killed seven soldiers.

660
01:53:02,768 --> 01:53:05,768
They didn't kill him,
they trained him,

661
01:53:05,897 --> 01:53:09,147
and they sent him
to the Kfar Ryat prison.

662
01:53:10,234 --> 01:53:13,244
- He was in prison?
- Yes.

663
01:53:15,948 --> 01:53:18,118
As a torturer.

664
01:53:19,076 --> 01:53:20,866
With my father?

665
01:53:20,995 --> 01:53:25,325
No. He didn't work
with Abou Tarek, your father.

666
01:53:54,654 --> 01:53:56,244
You OK?

667
01:54:00,743 --> 01:54:02,833
One plus one...

668
01:54:02,954 --> 01:54:04,544
makes two.

669
01:54:05,456 --> 01:54:06,866
What?

670
01:54:09,961 --> 01:54:12,591
One plus one makes two.

671
01:54:12,713 --> 01:54:14,513
It can't make one.

672
01:54:21,013 --> 01:54:22,853
You're feverish.

673
01:54:25,268 --> 01:54:26,688
Jeanne?

674
01:54:28,563 --> 01:54:31,313
One plus one...
Can it make one?

675
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:56,210
- There's a chair.
- Take it if you want.

676
01:56:25,012 --> 01:56:26,972
Can I help you, madame?

677
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:37,820
I'm sorry.

678
01:57:47,595 --> 01:57:50,135
When he became a torturer,

679
01:57:50,264 --> 01:57:52,564
your brother changed names.

680
01:57:52,683 --> 01:57:55,563
He became...Abou Tarek.

681
01:57:58,314 --> 01:58:01,614
Nihad of May is Abou Tarek.

682
01:58:05,613 --> 01:58:10,123
We know he's living in Canada
under a new identity.

683
01:58:10,242 --> 01:58:12,622
Nihad Harmanni.

684
01:58:51,784 --> 01:58:53,414
Mr Harmanni?

685
01:58:56,163 --> 01:58:57,583
Yes.

686
01:59:04,672 --> 01:59:06,512
This is for you.

687
01:59:36,871 --> 01:59:38,751
LETTER TO THE FATHER

688
01:59:51,927 --> 01:59:54,547
I'm shaking as I write.

689
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:56,810
I recognized you.

690
01:59:56,932 --> 01:59:58,732
You didn't recognize me.

691
01:59:58,851 --> 02:00:00,891
It's magnificent, a miracle.

692
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:03,350
I am your number 72.

693
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:07,280
Our children will deliver this.

694
02:00:08,193 --> 02:00:10,403
You won't recognize them,

695
02:00:10,529 --> 02:00:12,159
for they are beautiful.

696
02:00:12,281 --> 02:00:14,411
But they know who you are.

697
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,750
Through them, I want to tell you
that you are still alive.

698
02:00:27,755 --> 02:00:30,755
Soon you'll turn silent...
I know.

699
02:00:32,301 --> 02:00:35,051
For all are silent before the truth.

700
02:00:36,013 --> 02:00:38,973
Signed: Whore 72.

701
02:00:53,155 --> 02:00:55,485
I speak to the son,

702
02:00:55,616 --> 02:00:58,076
not to the torturer.

703
02:00:58,202 --> 02:01:01,832
Whatever happens,
I'll always love you.

704
02:01:01,956 --> 02:01:05,746
I promised you that
when you were born, my son.

705
02:01:05,876 --> 02:01:09,246
Whatever happens,
I'll always love you.

706
02:01:10,255 --> 02:01:12,835
I looked for you all my life.

707
02:01:12,967 --> 02:01:14,877
I found you.

708
02:01:15,552 --> 02:01:17,602
You couldn't recognize me.

709
02:01:19,139 --> 02:01:22,019
You've a tattoo on your right heel.

710
02:01:22,142 --> 02:01:25,022
I saw it. I recognized you.

711
02:01:26,063 --> 02:01:28,483
You are beautiful.

712
02:01:28,607 --> 02:01:31,527
I wrap you in tenderness, my love.

713
02:01:32,361 --> 02:01:34,571
Take solace,

714
02:01:34,697 --> 02:01:37,817
for nothing means more
than being together.

715
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:40,080
You were born of love.

716
02:01:40,202 --> 02:01:44,042
So your brother and sister
were born of love, too.

717
02:01:45,582 --> 02:01:48,082
Nothing means more
than being together.

718
02:01:49,086 --> 02:01:52,256
Your mother,
Nawal Marwan.

719
02:01:53,257 --> 02:01:55,427
Prisoner No 72.

720
02:02:04,143 --> 02:02:07,233
When the envelopes
have been delivered,

721
02:02:07,354 --> 02:02:10,364
you'll be given a letter,
the silence broken,

722
02:02:10,482 --> 02:02:12,322
a promise kept,

723
02:02:12,443 --> 02:02:15,193
and you can place a stone
on my grave,

724
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:17,950
and on it
engrave my name in the sun.

725
02:02:38,469 --> 02:02:40,139
My loves,

726
02:02:41,305 --> 02:02:44,215
where does your story begin?

727
02:02:44,349 --> 02:02:46,349
At your birth?

728
02:02:47,686 --> 02:02:49,686
If so, it begins in horror.

729
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:53,149
At the birth of your father?

730
02:02:54,151 --> 02:02:56,901
Then it begins in a great love story.

731
02:02:59,114 --> 02:03:02,744
But I say your story
begins with a promise,

732
02:03:02,868 --> 02:03:05,288
to break the chain of anger.

733
02:03:07,206 --> 02:03:10,166
Thanks to you,
today I have finally kept it.

734
02:03:10,292 --> 02:03:12,922
The chain is broken.

735
02:03:13,045 --> 02:03:16,545
Finally I can take the time
to cradle you,

736
02:03:16,673 --> 02:03:19,803
to gently sing a lullaby
to console you.

737
02:03:22,262 --> 02:03:24,562
Nothing means more
than being together.

738
02:03:25,849 --> 02:03:27,479
I love you.

739
02:03:28,727 --> 02:03:30,347
Your mother.

740
02:03:31,396 --> 02:03:32,806
Nawal.

741
02:10:12,714 --> 02:10:15,724
TO OUR GRANDMOTHERS
