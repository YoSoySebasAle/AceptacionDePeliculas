1
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,377
Have you got any biscuits over there?

2
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,546
Here's some cornbread.

3
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,925
I am cold.

4
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,845
- Still with us, Brett?
- Right.

5
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,058
<i>- Oh, I feel dead.
- Anybody ever tell you you look dead?</i>

6
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,148
Oh, yeah. Right!
I just forgot something, man.

7
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,319
Before we dock, I think
we ought to discuss the bonus situation.

8
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,656
Brett and I, we think we deserve full shares.

9
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:33,452
Mr. Parker and I feel the bonus situation
has never been on an equitable level.

10
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,998
You get what you're contracted for,
like everybody else.

11
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,457
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.

12
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,211
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.

13
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:46,507
Yeah, I saw it.
Yellow light's for my eyes only.

14
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,302
OK, get dressed, huh? Parker?

15
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,763
I haven't finished my coffee.
It's the only thing good on this ship.

16
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,856
Morning, Mother.

17
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,223
- Right?
- OK.

18
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,517
Plug us in.

19
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,728
Thank you.

20
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,485
- Where is Earth?
- You should know.

21
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,697
It's not our system.

22
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,574
Scan.

23
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,704
I can't believe this.

24
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,873
Contact traffic control.

25
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,377
<i>This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo,</i>

26
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,674
out of the Solomons,
registration number 180924609,

27
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,262
calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me? Over.

28
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,724
Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo,
out of the Solomons.

29
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,978
Registration number 180924609.

30
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,857
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.

31
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,070
Calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me, Antarctica? Over.

32
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,658
I've found it, just short of Zeta II Reticuli.

33
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,369
We haven't reached the outer rim yet.

34
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,747
That's hard to believe.

35
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,666
What the hell are we doing out here?

36
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,171
Don't know.
What the hell are you talking about?

37
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,381
That's not our system.

38
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,716
I know that.

39
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,803
Do you ever notice
how they never come down here?

40
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,889
This is where the work is, right?

41
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:46,562
Same reason we get a half share to their one.
Our time is their time. Same old shit, man.

42
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:51,859
I think I know why they don't come down.
It's because of you. You have no personality.

43
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:04,580
- You happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?
- Yes. Of course. Sorry.

44
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,421
What's happening now, baby?

45
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:19,178
Well, some of you may have figured out
we're not home yet. We're only halfway there.

46
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,891
- What?
- Mother's interrupted our journey course.

47
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,017
Why?

48
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:29,730
She's programmed to do that
should certain conditions arise. They have.

49
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:34,527
It seems she has intercepted
a transmission of unknown origin.

50
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,698
- She got us up to check it out.
- A transmission? Out here?

51
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,658
What kind of a transmission?

52
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,537
Acoustical beacon
that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.

53
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,414
- SOS?
- I don't know.

54
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,542
- Human?
- Unknown.

55
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,504
- So what?
- We are obligated under Section...

56
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:58,384
I hate to bring this up, but this is
a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.

57
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,929
- Right.
- It's not in my contract, this kind of duty.

58
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:06,726
And what about the money? If you wanna
give me some money, I'd be happy to oblige.

59
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,645
Let's go over the bonus situation.

60
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,356
I'm sorry, can I say something?

61
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,444
There is a clause which states
"Any systematized transmission

62
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,989
indicating intelligent origin
must be investigated...

63
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,366
I wanna go home and party.

64
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,785
Parker, will you just listen to the man?

65
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,708
...on penalty of total forfeiture of shares."

66
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,293
No money.

67
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,173
- Well, yeah!
- We're going in.

68
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,092
Yeah. We're going in.

69
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,228
Can we all hear that, Lambert?

70
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,170
- Good God.
- Doesn't sound like any radio signal I know.

71
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:21,384
- Maybe it's a voice.
- We'll soon know. Can you home in on that?

72
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,220
What was the position?

73
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,808
6550-99.

74
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,732
All right, it found the quadrant.

75
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:44,323
Ascension: Six minutes, 20 seconds.
Declination: 39 degrees, two seconds.

76
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,243
OK. Put that on the screen for me.

77
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,291
All right. Well, that's it.

78
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,295
It's a planetoid. 1200 kilometers.

79
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,089
- It's tiny.
- Any rotation?

80
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,636
- About two hours.
- What about gravity?

81
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,891
0.86.

82
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,644
You can walk on it.

83
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,908
Approaching orbital apogee. Mark.

84
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,913
Equatorial orbit nailed.

85
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,794
5, 4,

86
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,088
3, 2,

87
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,257
1.

88
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,096
DOR's in line.

89
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,975
- Status on the lifters?
- Give me an AC pressure reading.

90
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,151
48 seconds and counting.

91
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,448
Prepare to disengage from platform.

92
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,659
20 seconds.

93
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,370
18, 17...

94
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,624
12, 11, 10,

95
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,961
9, 8, 7,

96
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,672
6, 5, 4,

97
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,174
3, 2,

98
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,759
1, lock.

99
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,719
Disengage.

100
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,976
Clear.

101
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,651
Money's safe.
Let's take her down.

102
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,204
- Roll 92 degrees, port yaw.
- Prime the port.

103
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm not getting anything.

104
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,995
Turbulence.

105
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,256
Locked and floating.
You can drop us any time now.

106
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:52,220
Initial damping's going off. Hold on, people,
there's going to be a little bump.

107
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,062
What the hell was that?

108
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,689
Pressure drop. Must have lost a shield.

109
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,441
Let's go with it.

110
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,111
I'm still not getting anything.

111
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,368
Yeah. Dropping off now.

112
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,747
Still dropping.

113
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,376
There we are, we've got it.

114
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,586
Take her down.

115
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,345
Navigation lights on.

116
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,631
9, 8,

117
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,134
7, 6,

118
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,636
5, 4,

119
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,307
3, 2, 1.

120
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,475
Kill drive engines.

121
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,706
What the hell happened?

122
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,877
- Somebody give me an answer!
- Is the hull breached?

123
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,005
I don't see anything. We still have pressure.

124
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,759
- Push the screen.
- Why?

125
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,688
Secondary load-sharing unit is out.

126
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,691
Three of the four cells are gone.

127
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,447
- Is that it?
- No, hold on.

128
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:21,953
We can't fix it out here anyway and
we need to reroute a couple of these ducts.

129
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,412
Dry-dock time.

130
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,706
Dry-dock. Tell him to dry-dock!

131
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:30,002
We couldn't fix it out here anyway.
We've gotta reroute all these ducts.

132
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,505
In order to do that, we've got to dry-dock.

133
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,674
What else?

134
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,262
Some fragments caked up.
We've got to clean it out and repressurize it.

135
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,973
How long before we're functional?

136
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,434
- Look...
- 17 hours, tell her.

137
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,272
At least 25 hours.

138
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,774
Get started. I'll be right down.

139
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:57,822
- What the hell's she coming down here for?
- She better stay the fuck out of my way.

140
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,668
Any response yet?

141
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:15,965
No, absolutely nothing, except
the same transmission every 12 seconds.

142
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,801
All the other channels are dead.

143
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,892
Kick on the floods.

144
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,992
We can't go anywhere in this.

145
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,829
Mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes.

146
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:53,002
- How far to the source of transmission?
- Northeast. Just under 2,000 meters.

147
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,421
Walking distance?

148
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,260
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.

149
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,685
It's almost primordial.

150
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:15,316
There's inert nitrogen, high concentration
of carbon dioxide crystals, methane...

151
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,444
- I'm working on the trace elements.
- Anything else?

152
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,532
Yes. There's rock, lava base.

153
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,829
Deep cold, well below the line.

154
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,999
I'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out.

155
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,836
Yeah, that figures.

156
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,090
- You, too, Lambert.
- Swell.

157
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,969
You'd better break out the weapons.

158
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:01,881
- I can't see a goddamn thing!
- Ash, are you receiving?

159
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,096
Good contact on my board.

160
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,225
Clear and free. Keep the line open.

161
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,351
Let's go.

162
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,660
Hey, Ripley.

163
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,413
Hey, Ripley, I want to ask you a question.

164
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,750
If they find what they're looking for,
do we get full shares?

165
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:42,129
Don't worry, Parker,
you'll get whatever's coming to you.

166
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:46,300
I'm not gonna do any more work
until we get this straightened out.

167
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,805
Brett, you're guaranteed by law to get a share.

168
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,808
- What?
- Why don't you just fuck off?

169
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,353
- What?
- What did you say, Rip?

170
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,941
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.

171
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,069
Hey, Ripley, come back here!

172
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,744
- Son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

173
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,173
Can't see a goddamn thing.

174
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,383
Quit griping.

175
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,178
- I like griping.
- Come on, knock it off.

176
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:59,141
- Ash, can you see this?
- Yes, I can.

177
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,064
I've never seen anything like it.

178
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,199
It's very bizarre.

179
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,038
You said it.

180
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,674
All right.

181
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,886
Moving on to second... position.

182
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,096
What is it?

183
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,350
Let's get outta here.

184
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:46,063
We've got this far.
We must go on. We have to go on.

185
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,694
Will you say that again?

186
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,737
Shit!

187
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:58,242
Ash, as you can see, it's hard to describe.

188
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,870
I'm going back to the console.

189
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,794
Dallas!

190
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,683
Come on down here.
There's something different here.

191
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:51,814
I don't know what it is, but if we can
get up that wall, we can find out.

192
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:04,178
Alien life form.

193
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,306
It looks like it's been dead a long time.

194
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,107
Fossilized.

195
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,145
Looks like it's grown out of the chair.

196
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,783
Bones are bent outward.

197
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,369
Like he exploded from inside.

198
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:35,668
I wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.

199
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,090
Let's get the hell outta here.

200
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,271
Dallas! Lambert! Come on over here!

201
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,984
Come on.

202
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:08,951
- What have you got?
- See what you make of this.

203
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:21,464
It doesn't look like an SOS.

204
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:27,011
Well, I... It looks like a warning.

205
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:31,182
- I'm gonna go out after them.
- What's the point?

206
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:39,607
I mean, by the time it takes to get there,
they'll know if it's a warning or not. Yes?

207
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,135
Are you OK down there?

208
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,600
- Can you see anything?
- I don't know... A cave.

209
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,859
I don't know,
but it's like the goddamn tropics in here.

210
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,698
What the hell is this?

211
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,854
The pit is completely enclosed.

212
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:05,276
And it's full of leathery objects,
like eggs or something.

213
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:29,467
There's a layer of mist covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.

214
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,682
Kane? Are you all right?

215
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,851
Yeah, I'm OK. All right.

216
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,773
I'm OK, I just slipped.

217
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,213
It appears to be completely sealed.

218
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:45,168
Wait a minute, there's movement.

219
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,963
It seems to have life. Organic life.

220
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:56,531
- Are you there, Ripley?
- I'm right here.

221
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:06,123
- OK, Ripley. I'm at the inner lock hatch.
- Right.

222
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,719
Are you there, Ripley?
We're clean, let us in.

223
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:22,473
- What happened to Kane?
- Something attached itself to him.

224
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,184
What kind of thing?

225
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,478
An organism. Open the hatch!

226
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,983
If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure.

227
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:35,820
- 24 hours for decontamination.
- He could die. Open the hatch.

228
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:38,739
Listen to me.
We break quarantine, we could all die.

229
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:43,244
Could you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside!

230
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:48,749
No. I can't, and if you were
in my position you'd do the same.

231
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:52,003
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch, do you hear me?

232
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:55,423
- Yes.
- Ripley, this is an order! Do you hear me?

233
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,134
Yes. I read you. The answer is negative.

234
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,305
Inner hatch open.

235
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:33,377
My God.

236
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,181
What the hell is that?

237
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:49,977
Jesus Christ.

238
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,606
What is that, man?

239
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:59,862
- Hey, how the hell's he breathing?
- He still alive or what?

240
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:03,407
And why don't you guys freeze him?

241
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:07,161
How come they don't freeze him?
What's going on in there?

242
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,455
- What the fuck is going on?
- You bitch!

243
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,874
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey! Hey!

244
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:15,002
- You were gonna leave us out there!
- Hey, break it up.

245
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:19,173
When I give an order,
I expect to be obeyed!

246
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:22,844
- Even if it's against the law?
- You're goddamn right!

247
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,847
She has a point.
Who the hell knows what that is?

248
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,891
How are we gonna get that off of him?

249
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:33,688
- How are we gonna get it off?
- Just a minute! I'll get some instruments.

250
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:44,532
Right. Now, if I make an incision here

251
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:47,952
to try and remove
one of the digits from his face...

252
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:50,037
You're gonna do what?

253
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:53,166
Finger. I'll try and get this finger off.

254
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,085
Get this cleating on there...

255
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:01,090
- It's tearing his scalp!
- I know!

256
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:06,095
It's not coming off
without tearing his face off with it.

257
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,599
We'll have to take a look at him inside.

258
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,729
How come they don't freeze him?

259
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:17,732
How come you guys don't freeze him?

260
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,666
You can take your mask off.

261
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:59,774
- What's it got down his throat?
- I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen.

262
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:04,779
Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma,
then keeps him alive.

263
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:07,782
What the hell is that?

264
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:11,536
- We've got to get it off him.
- Just a minute.

265
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,247
Let's not be too hasty.

266
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:16,541
We don't know anything about...

267
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,334
it.

268
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:24,799
We're assuming it's feeding him oxygen.
If we remove it, it could kill him.

269
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,012
I'll take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.

270
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:33,641
- You take responsibility?
- Yes, yes. Get him out of there.

271
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,728
Where do you want to do this?

272
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:40,857
We'll make an incision
just below the knuckle there.

273
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,025
- Right here?
- Stand by.

274
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,410
Good God!

275
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:00,126
That crap's gonna eat through the hull.

276
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:05,339
I think it's going to eat through
the goddamn hull. Come on!

277
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,133
What's going on?

278
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:09,218
This way.

279
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:19,312
Next deck.

280
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,706
There it is.

281
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:42,376
Don't get under it!

282
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:50,301
Looks like it's stopping.

283
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:55,097
Take a look at this, man.

284
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:58,643
Brett, give me your pen.
Give it to me, quick.

285
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:00,853
Come on, come on!

286
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:08,653
Don't get any on your arm.

287
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:17,203
It's stopped.

288
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:21,374
I haven't seen anything like that,
except molecular acid.

289
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,710
It must be using it for blood.

290
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:28,798
It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.
You don't dare kill it.

291
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,967
What about Kane?

292
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,137
Here's your pen back.

293
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:39,642
- What do we do now?
- Leave Kane to Ash. You get back to work.

294
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,688
Oh... What...?

295
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:54,949
OK.

296
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:56,826
Try it.

297
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:05,918
- Damn it. I felt sure that was it.
- Try it again.

298
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:11,340
Feel like I've been in this place a month.

299
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:15,511
We shouldn't have landed here
in the first place.

300
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:19,891
We shouldn't have landed
on this damn ball, I know that.

301
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:24,478
The sooner we patch this thing up and
get outta here, the sooner we can go home.

302
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:26,355
This place gives me the creeps.

303
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:32,255
It's amazing. What is it?

304
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:36,092
I'd say it's, um...

305
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:39,428
I don't know yet.

306
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:47,144
- Do you want something?
- Yes, I, uh...

307
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:52,275
A little talk. How's Kane?

308
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:54,861
He's holding. No changes.

309
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:57,572
And, uh, our guest?

310
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:06,122
Well, as I said, I'm still collating, actually.

311
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:11,794
But I have confirmed that he's got
an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.

312
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:18,467
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells
and replacing them with polarized silicone,

313
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:24,599
which gives him a prolonged resistance
to adverse environmental conditions.

314
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:26,684
Is that enough?

315
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:29,103
That's plenty. What does it mean?

316
00:45:29,187 --> 00:45:33,691
- Please don't do that. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

317
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:40,156
It's an interesting combination of elements,
making him a... tough little son of a bitch.

318
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,658
And you let him in.

319
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:45,161
I was obeying a direct order, remember?

320
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:51,501
<i>Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.</i>

321
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:53,711
Oh, yes. I forgot.

322
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:58,716
You also forgot the Science Division's
basic quarantine law.

323
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:03,095
- No, that I didn't forget.
- Oh, I see. You just broke it.

324
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,641
What would you have
done with Kane? Hm?

325
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:10,061
You knew his only chance of survival
was to get him in here.

326
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:14,565
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine,
you risk everybody's life.

327
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:17,068
Maybe I should have left him outside.

328
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:21,656
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

329
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:25,701
It's a pretty big risk for a science officer.

330
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:29,455
It's not exactly out of the manual, is it?

331
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:34,252
I do take my responsibilities
as seriously as you.

332
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:39,423
You do your job
and let me do mine. Yes?

333
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:01,863
- Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.

334
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,584
- Why?
- Something's happened.

335
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:17,378
- Serious?
- Interesting.

336
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:26,345
Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.

337
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:32,393
- Where is it?
- Well, I don't know!

338
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:37,106
- We have to try and find it.
- Let's check it.

339
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:04,634
Dallas, please be careful.

340
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:47,593
Sorry.

341
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:23,045
No, not in the corner!

342
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:26,591
Have one of these. Just in case.

343
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:41,314
Kane?

344
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:48,821
Are you OK?

345
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:53,201
- I didn't see it. Was it in the overhead?
- It was up there somewhere.

346
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:57,580
- My God.
- Cover the damn thing, will you?

347
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:59,749
It's alive.

348
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:05,087
We've got to have a look at this.

349
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:20,728
Excuse me.

350
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:31,030
- It seems dead enough.
- Good. Let's get rid of it.

351
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:36,994
Ripley, for God's sake, this is the first time
we've encountered a species like this.

352
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:39,997
It has to go back.
All sorts of tests have to be made.

353
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:44,919
Ash, are you kidding? This thing bled acid.
Who knows what it will do when it's dead?

354
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:48,130
I think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie.

355
00:50:48,256 --> 00:50:51,050
Dallas, it has to go back.

356
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:56,389
I'd soon as not burn it at the stake,
but you're the science officer.

357
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:58,891
- It's your decision, Ash.
- Dallas!

358
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:03,271
- You won't make me change my mind...
- I'm not trying to change your mind.

359
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:05,982
I just want you to listen...
Will you listen?

360
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:12,238
- How can you leave that decision to him?
- I just run the ship.

361
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:15,241
Anything scientific, Ash has the final word.

362
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:18,578
- How does that happen?
- That's what the company wants.

363
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:24,125
- Since when is that standard procedure?
- Standard procedure is to do what they say.

364
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:27,962
- What's happening with the repairs?
- They're pretty much finished.

365
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:29,839
- Why didn't you tell me?
- There's still some things to do.

366
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,844
We're blind on B and C decks,
the reserve power system's blown...

367
00:51:37,054 --> 00:51:39,640
That's horseshit. We can take off without that.

368
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:44,145
- We can. You think that's a good idea?
- Look, I just wanna get the hell outta here.

369
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:11,047
Dust in the intakes.
Number two's overheating.

370
00:52:11,172 --> 00:52:13,466
Spit on it for two minutes, for Christ sake!

371
00:52:14,383 --> 00:52:18,346
We're hot and we're getting hotter.

372
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:22,850
Engine room, red clip status.

373
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:27,730
- One kilometer on ascension.
- Engage artificial gravity.

374
00:52:27,855 --> 00:52:31,400
- Engaged.
- I'm altering the vector... now.

375
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,865
Inhibit CNG.

376
00:52:40,868 --> 00:52:44,747
- Struts retract.
- Struts retracted.

377
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:08,604
Walk in the park!

378
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:11,941
When we fix something, it stays fixed.
Don't we, Brett, baby?

379
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,109
Right!

380
00:53:28,624 --> 00:53:32,503
We should freeze him. If he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it there?

381
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:36,132
- We can get to a doctor back home.
- Right.

382
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:40,428
<i>Whenever he says anything,
you say "Right", Brett, you know?</i>

383
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:42,305
Right.

384
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:46,684
Parker, your staff just follows you around
and says "Right"! Just like a parrot.

385
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:50,313
- Shape up! What are you, a parrot?
- Right.

386
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:52,732
Come on, knock it off!

387
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:56,777
- Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine.
- Yes, and so are we.

388
00:53:56,903 --> 00:54:01,491
- How about something to lower your spirits?
- Thrill me, will you, please?

389
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:05,620
According to my calculations,
based on time spent...

390
00:54:05,703 --> 00:54:08,831
- Give me the short version. How far to Earth?
- Ten months.

391
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:11,042
Oh, God.

392
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:13,211
Yes?

393
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:16,881
- Dallas, I think you should see Kane.
- Has his condition changed?

394
00:54:16,964 --> 00:54:20,635
- It's simpler if you come.
- We're on our way.

395
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:24,055
Right.

396
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:29,602
How are you feelin'?

397
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:36,692
- How are you doing?
- Terrific! Next silly question?

398
00:54:40,238 --> 00:54:42,323
Oh, thank you.

399
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:48,037
Do you remember anything about the planet?

400
00:54:49,705 --> 00:54:53,042
What's the last thing you do remember?

401
00:54:59,298 --> 00:55:04,011
I remember some horrible dream
about smothering and...

402
00:55:06,597 --> 00:55:08,391
Anyway, where are we?

403
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:10,893
- Right here!
- We're on our way home.

404
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:13,062
Back to the old freezerinos!

405
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:19,318
- I've got to have something to eat first.
- I need something to eat myself.

406
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:22,989
One more meal before bedtime. I'm buying.

407
00:55:23,072 --> 00:55:26,117
Hey, that's a break!

408
00:55:46,053 --> 00:55:50,516
The first thing I'm going to do
when I get back is to get some decent food.

409
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:56,147
I can dig it. I've eaten worse food than this,
but then I've tasted better.

410
00:55:56,272 --> 00:55:59,275
You pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.

411
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,988
I'd rather be eating something else,
but right now, I'm thinking food.

412
00:56:04,071 --> 00:56:06,782
You should know,
you know what it's made of.

413
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,913
I don't wanna talk about what it's made of.
I'm eating this!

414
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:17,543
What's the matter, man?
The food ain't that bad, baby!

415
00:56:18,669 --> 00:56:20,755
What's wrong?

416
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:25,468
What? What?

417
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:27,637
- This is serious.
- Kane!

418
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,689
Get the spoon!

419
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:45,071
- Get it into his mouth!
- I'm trying!

420
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,435
Oh, God!

421
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:48,050
- Dallas?
- Yeah.

422
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:51,888
- Anything?
- No. You?

423
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:54,098
Nothing.

424
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:56,475
- Did you see anything?
- No.

425
00:58:18,706 --> 00:58:20,875
Inner hatch sealed.

426
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:26,506
Anybody want to say anything?

427
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:06,379
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.

428
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:11,259
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated from here to here.

429
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:15,346
Just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it.

430
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:22,228
It shouldn't damage the bastard
unless its skin is thinner than ours.

431
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:26,274
But it will give him a little incentive.

432
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:28,568
Now we just have to find him.

433
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:32,321
I've taken care of that.
I've designed this tracking device.

434
00:59:32,446 --> 00:59:35,449
You just set it to search for a moving object.

435
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:41,622
Hasn't got much of a range, but within
a certain distance, it gives off a signal.

436
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:44,750
What does it key on?

437
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:48,713
Micro changes in air density.

438
00:59:48,796 --> 00:59:50,882
Gimme a demo.

439
00:59:53,384 --> 00:59:56,429
See? And again...

440
00:59:56,512 --> 00:59:58,806
Gotcha.

441
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:04,562
Two teams. Ash, Lambert and I.
Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.

442
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:16,866
Catch it, put it in the airlock, get rid of it.

443
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:19,243
The channels are open on all decks.

444
01:00:19,368 --> 01:00:23,414
I want you to communicate,
keep in touch at all times.

445
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:25,625
Let's go.

446
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:32,381
I thought you fixed 12 module.

447
01:00:32,507 --> 01:00:34,592
We did.

448
01:00:34,675 --> 01:00:36,761
I don't understand it.

449
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:41,682
The circuits must have burned out.

450
01:00:53,444 --> 01:00:56,906
- What have we got here?
- Damn it, hold your light over here.

451
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:59,075
Yeah, that's it.

452
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,328
I don't know if this is going to work.

453
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:07,124
- Put this in there.
- Right.

454
01:01:11,587 --> 01:01:14,006
Check the insulation.

455
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,175
Shit...

456
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:41,159
According to this, it's within five meters.

457
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:49,292
Micro changes in air density, my ass.

458
01:01:54,505 --> 01:01:56,799
It's within five meters.

459
01:01:56,924 --> 01:01:59,010
Be careful.

460
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:14,442
- Hey, don't creep up on me with that thing.
- You guys stick together.

461
01:02:30,082 --> 01:02:33,211
- Whoa, whoa now...
- What?

462
01:02:33,294 --> 01:02:35,630
Parker, Brett, it's in this locker.

463
01:02:35,713 --> 01:02:37,381
In where?

464
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,592
Here, take it.

465
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:43,846
I got it, I got it.

466
01:02:46,557 --> 01:02:47,934
Wait.

467
01:02:49,185 --> 01:02:51,354
All right, Parker? When I say.

468
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:57,527
- All right. Now.
- Easy.

469
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:06,702
- Don't let him go!
- What the hell are you doing, man?!

470
01:03:06,786 --> 01:03:08,871
It's the cat.

471
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:19,715
Hey, look, now. We had to bag it.
Now we might pick it up on the tracker again.

472
01:03:21,717 --> 01:03:24,720
- I'II... I'II...
- Go and get it, man.

473
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:26,931
You get him, we'll go on.

474
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:40,153
Here, kitty!

475
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,780
Here, kitty, kitty.

476
01:03:43,906 --> 01:03:46,617
Kitty crap. Jones!

477
01:03:49,745 --> 01:03:51,831
Jonesy?

478
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:54,041
Here, Jonesy!

479
01:04:01,549 --> 01:04:03,843
Jonesy?

480
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:11,017
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

481
01:04:17,607 --> 01:04:19,567
Here, Jonesy!

482
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:33,748
Jonesy?

483
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:47,094
Here, kitty, kitty.

484
01:06:14,515 --> 01:06:16,601
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

485
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:20,563
Jonesy.

486
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,445
Kitty, kitty.

487
01:07:01,729 --> 01:07:04,023
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

488
01:07:07,276 --> 01:07:09,362
Jonesy?

489
01:07:16,118 --> 01:07:18,830
Hey. Hey, come on, Jonesy.

490
01:07:18,955 --> 01:07:21,457
Come on, baby. That's a kitty.

491
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:23,543
Come on, baby.

492
01:07:24,877 --> 01:07:26,671
That's a kitty.

493
01:07:28,422 --> 01:07:31,676
Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

494
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,126
Brett!

495
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:07,336
Brett!

496
01:08:15,052 --> 01:08:17,138
Brett!

497
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,857
Whatever it was, it was big.

498
01:08:36,407 --> 01:08:40,578
No question. It's...
It's using the air ducts to move around.

499
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:45,708
Could he want Brett alive?

500
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:49,128
- What?
- Could Brett be alive?

501
01:08:49,253 --> 01:08:52,465
No. I mean, I... I don't think so.

502
01:08:52,548 --> 01:08:55,968
Now, this air shaft
may work to our advantage.

503
01:08:56,093 --> 01:09:01,098
It leads up to and comes out
in the main airlock.

504
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:03,476
There's only one big opening along the way.

505
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:09,649
We can cover that up and then we drive it
into the airlock and zap it into outer space.

506
01:09:09,732 --> 01:09:12,026
<i>The son of a bitch is huge!</i>

507
01:09:12,151 --> 01:09:14,529
I mean, it's like a man. It's big!

508
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:16,531
Kane's son.

509
01:09:17,865 --> 01:09:22,578
Come on, Ash. The science department
should be able to help. How can we drive it?

510
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:26,749
It's adapted well to our atmosphere,
considering its nutritional needs.

511
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,918
But we don't know about temperature.

512
01:09:29,043 --> 01:09:36,050
- OK, temperature. What if we change it?
- Let's try it. Most animals retreat from fire.

513
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:40,012
Fire, yeah. Parker, can you rig
three or four incinerator units?

514
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:48,020
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.

515
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:49,897
No.

516
01:09:50,022 --> 01:09:54,485
You and Ash,
take the main airlock.

517
01:09:54,610 --> 01:10:00,324
Parker, Lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening, please.

518
01:10:29,937 --> 01:10:33,691
- I'm at the first junction.
- Dallas, I'm right here.

519
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:35,985
- Parker?
- Yeah.

520
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:39,947
- Lambert?
- In position. I'm trying to get a reading.

521
01:10:40,072 --> 01:10:42,783
- The airlock is open.
- OK, Ripley.

522
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:44,535
Ready.

523
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:57,673
All right, I've got a reading on you now.

524
01:11:13,731 --> 01:11:16,359
Open the hatch to the third junction.

525
01:11:33,459 --> 01:11:35,127
OK, I'm through.

526
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:42,093
I'm moving on.

527
01:11:56,691 --> 01:11:59,527
Dallas, hold on. I think I got it.

528
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:02,864
- Yes, I've got it.
- Where?

529
01:12:04,323 --> 01:12:07,326
It's somewhere around the third junction.

530
01:12:07,451 --> 01:12:09,537
OK. Moving on.

531
01:12:29,223 --> 01:12:34,979
It is right around there.
Dallas, you're gonna have to be careful.

532
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:50,703
All right. I've reached the third junction
and I'm going down.

533
01:13:09,305 --> 01:13:12,433
What the hell's the matter with that box?

534
01:13:13,142 --> 01:13:16,687
Dallas, hold your position for a minute. I...

535
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:20,441
- I've lost the signal!
- What?

536
01:13:20,566 --> 01:13:21,818
You sure?

537
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:27,031
Are you sure it's not there?
It's got to be around there.

538
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,996
Check that out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.

539
01:13:34,121 --> 01:13:39,126
Dallas, are you sure
there's no sign of it? It is there!

540
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:41,629
It's gotta be around there!

541
01:13:42,463 --> 01:13:44,131
Dallas?

542
01:13:48,386 --> 01:13:50,388
All right.

543
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:58,938
Am I clear?
I wanna get the hell outta here.

544
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:03,734
Oh, God! It's moving right towards you.

545
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:13,536
Move! Get out of there!

546
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:15,830
Move!

547
01:14:15,913 --> 01:14:17,915
Dallas! Move, Dallas!

548
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:21,043
Move, Dallas. Get out!

549
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:24,881
No! Not that way! The other way!

550
01:14:26,757 --> 01:14:28,551
Dallas?

551
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:30,428
- No.
- Take it easy.

552
01:14:30,511 --> 01:14:32,597
Dallas!

553
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,730
We found this laying there.

554
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:43,566
No blood.

555
01:14:44,192 --> 01:14:46,277
No Dallas.

556
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,405
Nothing.

557
01:14:53,784 --> 01:14:58,372
- I don't hear anybody sayin' nothing.
- I'm thinking.

558
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:06,506
Unless somebody has got a better idea,
we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.

559
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:12,345
What?! And end up like the others?
Oh, no. You're out of your mind!

560
01:15:12,428 --> 01:15:16,808
- You got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon the ship.

561
01:15:16,933 --> 01:15:22,438
We get the shuttle and get the hell out of here,
and hope somebody picks us up.

562
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:23,898
Lambert, shh.

563
01:15:24,023 --> 01:15:28,277
- The shuttle won't take four.
- Then why don't we draw straws?

564
01:15:28,402 --> 01:15:31,405
I'm not drawing any straws.
I'm for killing it now!

565
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:36,953
OK. Let's talk about killing it.
It's in the air shafts...

566
01:15:37,036 --> 01:15:39,872
Will you listen to me, Parker? Shut up!

567
01:15:39,956 --> 01:15:43,501
Let's hear it. Let's hear it.

568
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:47,171
- It's using the air shafts.
- We don't know that...

569
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:51,425
That's the only way!
We'll move in pairs.

570
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:55,179
We'll go step by step
and cut off every bulkhead and vent

571
01:15:55,304 --> 01:15:59,475
until we have it cornered,
then we'll blow it the fuck out into space.

572
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:01,644
Is that acceptable to you?

573
01:16:01,769 --> 01:16:03,855
If it means killing it, yeah.

574
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:09,068
But we have to stick together.

575
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:13,239
- How are our weapons?
- The weapons are fine.

576
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:15,324
This one needs refueling.

577
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:17,702
Will you get it, please?

578
01:16:17,785 --> 01:16:21,539
- Ash, go with him.
- No, I can manage, Ash.

579
01:16:21,622 --> 01:16:23,624
Don't follow me.

580
01:16:27,044 --> 01:16:29,172
Ash!

581
01:16:30,506 --> 01:16:33,634
Any suggestions from you or Mother?

582
01:16:34,886 --> 01:16:37,305
No. We're still collating.

583
01:16:38,556 --> 01:16:42,727
You're what? You're still collating?

584
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:47,106
I find that hard to believe.

585
01:16:48,566 --> 01:16:53,362
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you've been doing, Ash. Nothing.

586
01:16:53,446 --> 01:16:59,285
I've got access to Mother now,
and I'll get my own answers, thank you.

587
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:02,538
All right.

588
01:18:40,845 --> 01:18:44,807
There is an explanation for this, you know.

589
01:18:44,932 --> 01:18:48,561
I don't wanna hear
your goddamn explanation!

590
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:08,164
Parker. Lambert?

591
01:19:30,061 --> 01:19:32,146
Ash!

592
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:37,485
Will you open the door?

593
01:19:41,948 --> 01:19:44,242
Let me by, Ash.

594
01:21:05,072 --> 01:21:06,866
What the hell are you doing?

595
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:27,720
Get her up! Get her up, get her up!

596
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:42,944
It's an android!

597
01:21:57,834 --> 01:21:59,836
Jesus...

598
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:06,175
It's a robot!
Ash is a goddamn robot.

599
01:22:07,844 --> 01:22:09,929
God!

600
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:18,479
Holy shit!

601
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:21,941
Help me get this fucking thing off!

602
01:22:29,532 --> 01:22:31,742
God... Oh, Jesus...

603
01:22:31,826 --> 01:22:34,036
Oh, God. Oh, God.

604
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:40,710
How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?

605
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:44,755
They must have wanted the alien
for the weapons division.

606
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:47,383
He's been protecting it right along.

607
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:51,971
- Parker, will you plug it in?
- Um... I don't know...

608
01:22:52,054 --> 01:22:55,600
Because he may know how to kill it.

609
01:23:19,999 --> 01:23:22,418
Ash, can you hear me?

610
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:37,433
Yes, I can hear you.

611
01:23:41,729 --> 01:23:44,232
What was your special order?

612
01:23:44,273 --> 01:23:47,401
You read it. I thought it was clear.

613
01:23:47,527 --> 01:23:53,241
- What was it?
- Bring back life form, priority one.

614
01:23:53,366 --> 01:23:56,285
All other priorities rescinded.

615
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,793
The damn company!
What about our lives, you son of a bitch?!

616
01:24:03,876 --> 01:24:07,755
I repeat, all other priorities are rescinded.

617
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:12,426
How do we kill it, Ash?
There's gotta be a way of killing it.

618
01:24:12,552 --> 01:24:15,680
- How do we do it?
- You can't.

619
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:18,391
That's bullshit!

620
01:24:18,474 --> 01:24:23,688
You still don't understand
what you're dealing with, do you?

621
01:24:23,813 --> 01:24:26,399
The perfect organism.

622
01:24:29,026 --> 01:24:33,823
Its structural perfection
is matched only by its hostility.

623
01:24:33,906 --> 01:24:35,992
You admire it.

624
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,831
I admire its purity.

625
01:24:45,084 --> 01:24:47,378
A survivor,

626
01:24:49,338 --> 01:24:51,841
unclouded

627
01:24:51,966 --> 01:24:55,303
by conscience, remorse,

628
01:24:55,386 --> 01:24:57,680
or delusions of morality.

629
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:02,268
Look, I've heard enough of this
and I'm asking you to pull the plug.

630
01:25:04,687 --> 01:25:06,647
Last word.

631
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:13,863
I can't lie to you about your chances, but...

632
01:25:16,782 --> 01:25:19,785
you have my sympathies.

633
01:25:21,787 --> 01:25:24,999
We're gonna blow up the ship.

634
01:25:25,124 --> 01:25:27,835
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.

635
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:30,546
- Blow up the ship.
- Good.

636
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,715
Come on.

637
01:25:59,116 --> 01:26:01,702
When we throw the switches,
how long do we have?

638
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:03,788
- Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.

639
01:26:03,913 --> 01:26:08,793
Or else we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

640
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:12,964
We'll need coolant for the air support system.

641
01:26:17,677 --> 01:26:22,473
You two go down and get all the coolant
you can carry. I'll get the shuttle ready.

642
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:25,810
I'll give you about...
about seven minutes.

643
01:26:25,893 --> 01:26:32,275
Come back up here, I'll shut the switches off
and we'll blow this fucker off into space.

644
01:26:32,358 --> 01:26:34,152
- Ready?
- Take care of yourself.

645
01:26:34,235 --> 01:26:36,529
Seven minutes.

646
01:26:58,759 --> 01:27:00,845
Take it easy.

647
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:07,101
Jones?

648
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:54,774
Jones?

649
01:28:24,595 --> 01:28:25,096
OK, check the bottles.

650
01:28:40,027 --> 01:28:42,113
Jones?

651
01:28:46,576 --> 01:28:48,870
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

652
01:28:51,581 --> 01:28:53,666
OK, go ahead.

653
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:57,336
Jones?

654
01:29:02,758 --> 01:29:04,844
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

655
01:29:04,927 --> 01:29:06,929
Come here, Jones, come here.

656
01:29:07,013 --> 01:29:09,098
Jones.

657
01:29:13,478 --> 01:29:18,691
Come here, boy. Come here. Nice kitty.

658
01:29:20,067 --> 01:29:21,944
Jones?

659
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:24,864
Jones?

660
01:29:28,826 --> 01:29:31,746
Come here. Come here, sweetheart.

661
01:29:32,872 --> 01:29:34,957
Jones.

662
01:29:41,839 --> 01:29:44,884
Jones. Jones.

663
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:48,930
Jones.

664
01:29:54,143 --> 01:29:56,145
Jones! Goddamn it.

665
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:02,819
Now I've got you.

666
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:11,452
Come on, sweetheart. Nice kitty.

667
01:30:33,391 --> 01:30:36,185
Oh, my God...

668
01:30:37,019 --> 01:30:40,273
- Get out of the way!
- I can't.

669
01:30:40,356 --> 01:30:43,192
Get out of the way! It's gonna kill us!

670
01:30:43,276 --> 01:30:45,153
I can't!

671
01:30:45,278 --> 01:30:48,614
- For Christ sake, get out of the way!
- Parker... Lambert...

672
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,419
Get out of the way, Lambert!

673
01:31:04,547 --> 01:31:07,800
Lambert! Lambert... Parker...

674
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:39,457
Get ready to roll!

675
01:32:17,203 --> 01:32:19,372
Parker?

676
01:33:52,423 --> 01:33:53,966
Danger.

677
01:33:54,091 --> 01:33:58,971
The emergency destruct system
is now activated.

678
01:33:59,096 --> 01:34:05,144
The ship will detonate
in T minus ten minutes.

679
01:34:05,228 --> 01:34:13,486
The option to override automatic detonation
expires in T minus five minutes.

680
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:27,727
Dallas?

681
01:35:34,066 --> 01:35:36,068
Brett.

682
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:47,622
Kill me.

683
01:35:48,789 --> 01:35:52,335
Kill me...

684
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:09,996
The option to override automatic detonation
