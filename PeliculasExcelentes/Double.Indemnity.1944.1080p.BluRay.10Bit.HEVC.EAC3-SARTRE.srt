1
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,737
Why, hello there, Mr. Neff.

2
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:49,170
- Working pretty late, aren't you, Mr.Neff?
- Late enough. Let's ride.

3
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,426
- You look kind of all in, at that.
- I'm fine.

4
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,930
- How is the insurance business, Mr.Neff?
- Okay.

5
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,599
They wouldn't ever sell me any.

6
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,393
They said I have something loose in my heart.

7
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,979
- I say it's rheumatism.
- Yeah?

8
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,107
Twelve.

9
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,557
Office memorandum.

10
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,561
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes, Claims Manager.

11
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,065
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

12
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,485
Dear Keyes...

13
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,073
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

14
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,492
Well, I don't like the word confession.

15
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,702
I just want to set you right about
something you couldn't see...

16
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,496
because it was smack up against your nose.

17
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,749
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

18
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,043
such a wolf on a phony claim.

19
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:39,048
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

20
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,426
Accident and double indemnity.

21
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,472
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

22
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,392
You said it wasn't an accident. Check.

23
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,228
You said it wasn't suicide. Check.

24
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:56,232
You said it was murder. Check.

25
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,862
You thought you had it cold, didn't you?

26
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:04,156
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

27
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,783
It was perfect.

28
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,370
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

29
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,330
just one little mistake.

30
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:16,377
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

31
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:20,047
You want to know who killed Dietrichson?

32
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,759
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

33
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,721
I killed Dietrichson.

34
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,682
Me, Walter Neff, insurance salesman.

35
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:32,894
35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars...

36
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,148
until a while ago, that is.

37
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,318
Yes, I killed him.

38
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,030
I killed him for money...

39
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,698
and for a woman.

40
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,662
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

41
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,499
Pretty, isn't it?

42
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,223
It all began last May.

43
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,684
Around the end of May, it was.

44
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,982
<i>I'd been out to Glendale to deliver
a policy on some dairy trucks.</i>

45
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,569
<i>On the way back I remembered this auto
renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.</i>

46
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,571
<i>So I drove over there.</i>

47
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,615
<i>It was one of those
California Spanish houses...</i>

48
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,576
<i>everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago.</i>

49
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,080
<i>This one must've cost somebody about $30,000.</i>

50
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,624
<i>That is, if he ever finished paying for it.</i>

51
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:40,962
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

52
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,589
- Who wants to see him?
- My name is Neff. Walter Neff.

53
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,884
- If you're selling something--
- Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

54
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,094
and it's not magazine subscriptions.

55
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,596
- Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in.
- How soon do you expect him?

56
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,848
He'll be home when he gets here,
if that's any help to you.

57
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,642
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

58
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,519
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

59
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,729
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?

60
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,815
How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson?

61
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,817
I'm Walter Neff, Pacific All Risk.

62
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,070
- Pacific all what?
- The Pacific All Risk Insurance Company.

63
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,155
It's about some renewals on the automobiles.

64
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,783
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

65
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,995
but he's never in his office.
ls there anything I can do?

66
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,579
The insurance ran out on the 15th.

67
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,790
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

68
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,500
or something while you're not...

69
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,835
fully covered.

70
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,296
Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff.

71
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,217
- I've just been taking a sunbath.
- No pigeons around, I hope.

72
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,346
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

73
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,723
Oh, that's all right.

74
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,308
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

75
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:39,270
Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.

76
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,274
Where would the living room be?

77
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,776
In there, but they keep the liquor locked up.

78
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,863
It's all right. I always carry my own keys.

79
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,872
<i>The living room was still stuffy...</i>

80
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,623
<i>from last night's cigars.</i>

81
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,667
<i>The windows were closed...</i>

82
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,753
<i>and the sunshine coming in
through the venetian blinds...</i>

83
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,088
<i>showed up the dust in the air.</i>

84
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:11,052
<i>On the piano, in a couple of fancy
frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

85
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,345
<i>his daughter by his first wife.</i>

86
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,849
<i>They had a bowl of those
little red goldfish...</i>

87
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,310
<i>on the table behind the big davenport.</i>

88
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,728
<i>But to tell you the truth, Keyes.</i> ..

89
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,856
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.</i>

90
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,902
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.</i>

91
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,864
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,
and the way she had looked at me...</i>

92
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,617
<i>and I wanted to see her again, close...</i>

93
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,453
<i>without that silly staircase between us.</i>

94
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,127
- I wasn't long, was I?
- Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

95
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:48,714
- Hope I've got my face on straight.
- It's perfect, for my money.

96
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,216
- Neff is the name, isn't it?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,593
With two "F's," like in Philadelphia,
if you know the story.

98
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,221
- What story?
<i>- The Philadelphia Story.</i>

99
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,431
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

100
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,017
My husband never tells me anything.

101
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:03,479
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

102
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,942
We've been handling this insurance for Mr.
Dietrichson for three years...

103
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,528
and we'd hate to see the policies lapse.

104
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,740
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

105
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,451
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

106
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,329
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

107
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,915
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

108
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,167
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

109
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,169
I suppose so. But he's never
home much before 8:00.

110
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:28,587
That's fine with me.

111
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,673
You're not connected with the
Automobile Club, are you?

112
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,134
No, the All Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

113
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,178
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

114
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:39,098
- Do they have a better rate?
- If your husband's a member.

115
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,224
No, he isn't.

116
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,477
Well, then he'd have to join the club and
pay the membership fee to start with.

117
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,230
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,276
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

119
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,528
I have a very attractive policy here.

120
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,281
It wouldn't take me two minutes to
put it in front of your husband.

121
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,908
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50 % retention feature...

122
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,035
in the collision coverage.

123
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,997
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

124
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,624
- Well, I've been at it 11 years.
- Doing pretty well?

125
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,084
It's a living.

126
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:11,338
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

127
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,842
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

128
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,386
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

129
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,762
Accident insurance?

130
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,098
Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:26,228
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

132
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,190
- Just my name.
- As, for instance?

133
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,484
- Phyllis.
- Phyllis, huh?

134
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,946
- I think I like that.
- But you're not sure?

135
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,200
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

136
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,994
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by
tomorrow evening around 8:30?

137
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,913
- He'll be in then.
- Who?

138
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:47,208
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

139
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,211
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

140
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,629
if you know what I mean.

141
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,132
There's a speed limit in this state, Mr.
Neff. 45 miles an hour.

142
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:58,469
- How fast was I going, officer?
- I'd say around 90.

143
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,180
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

144
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,474
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

145
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,267
Suppose it doesn't take.

146
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,728
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

147
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,689
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

148
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,901
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

149
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,486
That tears it.

150
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:23,118
- 8:30 tomorrow evening then.
- That's what I suggested.

151
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,871
- Will you be here, too?
- I guess so, I usually am.

152
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,249
Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?

153
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,376
I wonder if I know what you mean.

154
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,295
I wonder if you wonder.

155
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,343
<i>It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

156
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,346
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

157
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,642
<i>How could I have known that murder can
sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

158
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:47,935
<i>Maybe you would have known, Keyes...</i>

159
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,605
<i>the minute she mentioned accident
insurance, but I didn't.</i>

160
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,565
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

161
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,528
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

162
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,906
<i>It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

163
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,283
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

164
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,743
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you.

165
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,704
He's been yelling for you all afternoon.

166
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,747
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

167
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,874
Park this for me, will you, sweetheart?

168
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,381
- Hello, Walter.
- Hi, George.

169
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,592
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

170
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,511
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

171
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,638
- You're in a jam and you know it.
- Says you.

172
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,974
- All I want is my money.
- Says you.

173
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,685
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

174
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,896
- This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood.
- Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

175
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,899
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

176
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:40,237
- I ain't so good. My truck burned down.
- Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

177
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,490
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

178
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,826
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

179
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,912
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

180
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,042
- What little man?
- The little man in here.

181
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,337
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

182
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,838
I can't eat.

183
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,133
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

184
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,718
So what did I do?

185
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,387
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

186
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,348
<i>and they 'yanked up that
burned-out truck of yours.</i>

187
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,932
And what did they find?

188
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:12,311
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

189
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,937
What shavings?

190
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,608
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

191
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,364
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor guy.
Maybe I made a mistake.

192
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,699
That's one way of putting it.

193
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:28,035
I ain't feeling so good, Mr. Keyes.

194
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,329
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

195
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,290
- Sign what?
- It's a waiver on your claim. Right here.

196
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,876
- Here?
- Here.

197
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,633
Now you're an honest man again.
Goodbye, Garlopis.

198
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,635
But I ain't got no more truck.

199
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,096
$2,600 is lot of dough where I live.

200
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,681
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

201
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:53,060
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

202
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,896
Now pull it toward you.

203
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,651
- That's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

204
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,281
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?

205
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,076
Are we an insurance company, or just
a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

206
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,411
to write a policy on a mug like that?

207
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,079
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

208
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,747
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

209
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:14,790
to have him thoroughly investigated...

210
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,583
- before we accepted the risk.
- I know you did, Walter.

211
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,336
I'm not beefing at you. It's the company.
It's the way they do things.

212
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,504
The way they don't do things!

213
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,298
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

214
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,884
And I'm the guy that has to sit here
up to my neck in phony claims...

215
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,887
so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

216
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,764
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

217
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,184
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick up
after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

218
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,936
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

219
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,896
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

220
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,566
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting--

221
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,609
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

222
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:46,488
You love it, only you worry about it too
darn much, you and your little man.

223
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,907
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

224
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,702
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

225
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,371
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

226
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,831
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

227
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,709
and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.

228
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,960
Now, that's enough from you, Walter.

229
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,297
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

230
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,343
I love you, too.

231
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,311
<i>I really did, too, you old crab...</i>

232
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,689
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

233
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,526
<i>But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

234
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,070
<i>I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

235
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,573
<i>you had a heart as big as a house.</i>

236
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,784
<i>Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

237
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,578
<i>about the renewals.</i>

238
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,873
<i>She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening.</i>

239
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,627
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

240
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,422
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

241
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,466
<i>including a trip down to Santa Monica...</i>

242
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,303
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

243
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,473
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

244
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,768
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers out into her leg.</i>

245
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,194
Hello, Mr. Neff. Aren't you coming in?

246
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,821
I'm considering it.

247
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,992
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

248
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,037
- Last night wasn't so convenient.
- That's all right.

249
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,206
I was working on my stamp collection anyway.

250
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,458
I was just fixing some iced tea.
Would you like a glass?

251
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,794
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

252
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,463
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

253
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,756
Nettie.

254
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:35,305
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

255
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,141
- Oh, you did?
- Yes. He'll renew with you, he told me so.

256
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,769
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

257
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,020
- But he's not?
- No.

258
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,815
That's terrible.

259
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,442
Nettie!

260
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,821
Oh, I forgot, today's the maids day off.

261
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,741
Never mind the beer. Iced tea will be fine.

262
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,160
- Lemon? Sugar?
- Fix it your way.

263
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,416
As long as it's the maid's day off, maybe
there's something I can do for you.

264
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,669
- Like running the vacuum cleaner.
- Fresh.

265
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,505
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.

266
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,507
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

267
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,303
I didn't think you'd learned it
from a correspondence course.

268
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,056
Where'd you pick up this tea drinking?

269
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,309
- You're not English, are you?
- No. Californian.

270
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,436
Born right here in Los Angeles.

271
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,647
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

272
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,234
- Mr. Neff, I--
- Make it Walter, huh?

273
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,194
- Walter.
- That's right.

274
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,949
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

275
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,618
Twenty percent. Why?

276
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,245
I thought perhaps I could throw a
little more business your way.

277
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,956
- I can always use it.
- I was thinking about my husband.

278
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,459
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

279
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,794
- It's very dangerous.
- Not for an executive, is it?

280
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,296
He doesn't just sit behind a desk.

281
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,632
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

282
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,966
It's got me worried sick.

283
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,344
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

284
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,888
- Please don't talk like that.
- But that's the idea.

285
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,932
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

286
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,810
- He's in the hospital with a broken back.
- That's bad.

287
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,396
It's got me jittery just thinking about it.

288
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,690
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

289
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,484
- It could.
- Well...

290
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,155
- don't you think he ought to have accident insurance?
- Mmm-hmm.

291
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,492
What kind of insurance could he have?

292
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,827
Enough to cover doctors and hospital bills.

293
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,954
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

294
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,415
And he'd rate around $50,000 capital sum.

295
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,752
- Capital sum? What's that?
- In case he gets killed.

296
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,963
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

297
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,383
I suppose you have to think of
everything in your business.

298
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,842
Well, your husband would understand.

299
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm sure I could sell him on the idea
of some accident protection.

300
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,347
Why don't I talk to him about it?

301
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,599
You could try, but he's pretty tough-going.

302
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,768
They're all tough at first.

303
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,812
He has a lot on his mind.

304
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,605
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

305
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,525
except maybe a baseball game on the radio.

306
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,779
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

307
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,533
- Sounds pretty dull.
- So, I just sit and knit.

308
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,202
Is that what you married him for?

309
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,455
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

310
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,208
Anytime his thumbs get tired...

311
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,627
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

312
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,796
- Wouldn't I?
- You bet your life, you wouldn't.

313
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,302
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

314
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,932
I want to ask you something, Walter.

315
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,730
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

316
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:30,856
How's that, again?

317
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,900
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

318
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,485
I have a little allowance of my own.

319
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,780
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

320
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,409
Why shouldn't he know?

321
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,870
Because he doesn't want accident insurance.

322
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,874
- He's superstitious about it.
- A lot of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

323
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:53,128
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

324
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,132
- See what I mean, Walter?
- Sure. I got good eyesight.

325
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,926
You mean you want him to have the
policy without him knowing it.

326
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,013
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

327
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,932
- That's the setup, isn't it?
- Is there anything wrong with it?

328
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,309
No, I think it's lovely.

329
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,811
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him--

330
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:10,937
What crown block?

331
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,107
Only sometimes it can't quite make it on
its own, it has to have a little help.

332
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,525
I don't know what you're talking about.

333
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,027
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

334
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,197
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

335
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,365
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

336
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,701
Are you crazy? Not that crazy.

337
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,497
- Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
- What's the matter?

338
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,460
Look, baby, you can't get away with it.

339
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,922
You want to knock him off, don't you?

340
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,465
That's a horrible thing to say.

341
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,800
What'd you think I was, anyway?

342
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,260
A guy that walks into a good looking
dame's front parlor and says:

343
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,304
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

344
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,639
"You got one that's been around too long?

345
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,349
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

346
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,309
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect."

347
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:53,063
- Boy, what a dope you must think I am.
- I think you're rotten.

348
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,315
I think you're swell, so long
as I'm not your husband.

349
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,318
- Get out of here.
- You bet I'll get out of here, baby.

350
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,612
I'll get out of here, but quick.

351
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,999
<i>So I let her have it
straight between the eyes.</i>

352
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,627
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

353
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,337
<i>I knew I had hold of a red-hot poker...</i>

354
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,131
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

355
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:24,761
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...</i>

356
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,682
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

357
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,684
<i>and everything that went with it.</i>

358
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,937
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

359
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,523
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

360
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,734
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

361
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:44,781
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when I
left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

362
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:48,285
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

363
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,497
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

364
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,624
<i>and didn't even turn on the light.</i>

365
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,501
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

366
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,378
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

367
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,298
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

368
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:05,468
<i>And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

369
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,971
<i>That the hook was too strong...</i>

370
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,640
<i>that this wasn't the end between her and me.</i>

371
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,350
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

372
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:17,856
<i>So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd know
who it was without even having to think.</i>

373
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,859
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

374
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,574
Hello. You forgot your hat this afternoon.

375
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,994
- Did I?
- Don't you want me to bring it in?

376
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:32,829
Sure.

377
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,333
Put it on the chair.

378
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,510
- How'd you know where I live?
- It's in the phone book.

379
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,138
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

380
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,058
Peel off your coat and sit down.

381
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,228
Your husband out?

382
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,272
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

383
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,524
He phoned he'd be late. About 9:30.

384
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,903
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

385
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,404
I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.

386
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,449
- Like what?
- Like it was this afternoon.

387
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,827
I must have said something that gave
you a terribly wrong impression.

388
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,789
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

389
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,123
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

390
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,043
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?

391
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,754
I want you to be nice to me.

392
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,049
Like the first time you came to the house.

393
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,343
It can't be like the first time.

394
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:31,221
- Something's happened.
- I know it has.

395
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,807
It's happened to us.

396
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:40,355
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

397
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,651
He keeps me on a leash so
tight I can't breathe.

398
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,237
He's in Long Beach, isn't he? Relax.

399
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,656
Maybe I oughtn't to have come.

400
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:52,409
- Maybe you oughtn't.
- You want me to go?

401
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,786
- If you want to.
- Right now?

402
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,162
Sure, right now.

403
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,682
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you, Walter.

404
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,476
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

405
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,521
I don't know. I bought it in Ensenada.

406
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,774
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

407
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,777
The kind that bubbles. All I got is bourbon.

408
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,780
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

409
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,706
Get a couple of glasses, will you?

410
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,299
- Club soda?
- Plain water, please.

411
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:54,137
You know, about six months ago a guy slipped
on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

412
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,556
and knocked himself cold and was drowned.

413
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,975
Only he had accident insurance.

414
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,561
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

415
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,772
- Who didn't?
- His wife.

416
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,318
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

417
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:11,654
His wife said he was cleaning a gun
and his stomach got in the way.

418
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:15,325
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

419
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,203
Perhaps it was worth it to her.

420
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:23,041
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

421
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,006
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

422
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,634
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

423
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,804
- Cook your own breakfast?
- Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.

424
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,807
- Get the rest down at the corner drugstore.
- Sounds wonderful.

425
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,642
Just strangers beside you.

426
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,394
You don't know them and you don't hate them.

427
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,105
You don't have to sit across the table...

428
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:48,358
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

429
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,694
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

430
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,780
Lola. She lives with us.

431
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,407
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

432
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,202
- You ever think of a divorce?
- He wouldn't give me a divorce.

433
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,703
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

434
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,331
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

435
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,208
But he had when you married him?

436
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:09,796
Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. Why not?

437
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:14,259
But that's not the only reason.
I was his wife's nurse.

438
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:17,929
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

439
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,474
- I pitied him so.
- And now you hate him.

440
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,435
Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.

441
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,480
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

442
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,274
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

443
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,067
He's always been mean to me.

444
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,029
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

445
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,241
- That Lola.
- Nothing for you at all?

446
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,743
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

447
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,206
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

448
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,251
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

449
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,671
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

450
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,552
- Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
- Perhaps I do.

451
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,389
Then you wish it was an accident, and
you had that policy for $50,000.

452
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,975
- Is that it?
- Perhaps that, too.

453
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,272
The other night we drove home from a party.
He was drunk again.

454
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:13,151
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

455
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,944
and the motor still running.

456
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:19,032
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

457
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,452
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

458
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,703
I'll tell you what it'd be like.

459
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,372
If you had that accident policy and
tried to pull a monoxide job...

460
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,541
We've got a guy in our office named Keyes.

461
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,628
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

462
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,504
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

463
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,673
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

464
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,884
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

465
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,802
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

466
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,138
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

467
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,307
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

468
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,893
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

469
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,021
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

470
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,398
And I don't want you to hang, baby.

471
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,362
Stop thinking about it, will you?

472
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,617
<i>So we just sat there.</i>

473
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:07,038
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

474
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,124
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

475
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,417
I couldn't.

476
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,921
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

477
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,715
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

478
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,677
Because you know how it is, Keyes.

479
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,345
In this business you can't sleep...

480
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,265
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

481
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,766
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

482
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,186
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

483
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,898
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

484
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,483
And do it smart.

485
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,652
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

486
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,862
You know every notch in it by heart.

487
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,657
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

488
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,784
A shill to put down the bet.

489
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:46,953
And suddenly the doorbell rings...

490
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,455
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

491
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,379
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

492
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,842
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

493
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:06,139
The stakes were $50,000, but they
were the life of a man, too.

494
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,517
A man who'd never done me any dirt, except...

495
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,812
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

496
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,565
<i>And I did.</i>

497
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:30,747
Will you phone me? Walter?

498
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:36,419
I hate him. I loathe going back to him.

499
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,422
- You believe me, don't you, Walter?
- Sure I believe you.

500
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:45,386
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

501
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,805
They're not going to hang you, baby.

502
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,432
It's better than going on this way.

503
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,683
They're not gonna hang you because...

504
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,518
you're gonna do it and I'm gonna help you.

505
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,313
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Sure, I know what I'm saying.

506
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,898
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

507
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,068
- And I'm the guy that knows how.
- Walter, you're hurting me.

508
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:03,154
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

509
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:04,655
It's got to be perfect.

510
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:20,046
Call me tomorrow. But not from your house.
From a booth.

511
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,964
And watch your step every single minute.

512
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,176
This has got to be perfect, you understand?
Straight down the line.

513
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,429
Straight down the line.

514
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,640
<i>That was it, Keyes.</i>

515
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,768
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

516
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,939
The first thing we had to do was fix
him up with that accident policy.

517
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:24,152
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

518
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:27,697
Sol had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

519
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:32,785
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

520
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,288
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

521
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,457
because I wanted all the answers ready...

522
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,044
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

523
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:44,589
A couple of nights later I went to the house.

524
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:49,427
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

525
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,013
It was Dietrichson's daughter, Lola.

526
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,558
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

527
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,728
to have her sitting right there in the
room, playing Chinese checkers...

528
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,439
<i>as if nothing were going to happen.</i>

529
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,942
I suppose you realize, Mr.
Dietrichson...

530
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,319
that, not being an employee...

531
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,654
you are not covered by the State
Compensation Insurance Act.

532
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:12,033
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

533
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,284
Yeah, I know all about that.

534
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,827
The next thing you'll tell me I need...

535
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:18,414
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

536
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,208
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

537
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,084
we'd stay broke paying for
it, wouldn't we, honey?

538
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:26,005
What keeps us broke is you going out
and buying five hats at a crack.

539
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,798
Who needs a hat in California?

540
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,550
Dollar for dollar, Mr. Dietrichson...

541
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,053
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

542
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:35,014
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

543
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,182
Just as you say.

544
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:39,060
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

545
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,353
Sure.

546
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,981
All we'll need on that is for you to
sign the application for renewal.

547
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,942
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

548
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,361
- It bores me stiff.
- Got something better to do?

549
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,737
Yes, I have.

550
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,782
Father, is it all right if I run along now?

551
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:56,035
- Run along where? Who with?
- Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.

552
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,870
- Anne who?
- Anne Matthews.

553
00:33:57,954 --> 00:33:59,872
It's not that Nino Zachetti again, is it?

554
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:01,374
It better not be that Zachetti guy.

555
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,667
If I ever catch you with that--

556
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,085
It's Anne Matthews, I told you.

557
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,254
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

558
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:09,423
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

559
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,968
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

560
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,637
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

561
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,056
- Good night, Phyllis.
- Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

562
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,100
- I'm sorry. Good night, Mr...
- Neff.

563
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,851
Good night, Mr. Neff.

564
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,856
A great little fighter for her weight.

565
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,360
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

566
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,821
- Sign what?
- The applications for the auto renewals.

567
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,864
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

568
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,616
- When will that be?
- About a week.

569
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,618
Just so I'm covered when I drive up north.

570
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,537
- San Francisco?
- Palo Alto.

571
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,330
He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff.

572
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,833
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

573
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,461
What's wrong with that? Can't I have
a little fun, even once a year?

574
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,171
Great football school, Stanford.

575
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:51,257
- Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
- Left guard.

576
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,967
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

577
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,385
The bottom line.

578
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,058
- Both copies, please.
- Sign twice, huh?

579
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,393
Yes. One is the agent's copy.

580
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:06,480
- I need it for my files.
- Files.Duplicates. Triplicates.

581
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,654
Thank you, Mr. Dietrichson.

582
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:16,574
Don't worry about the check, I can pick
it up at your office some morning.

583
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,868
- How much you taking me for?
- $147.50.

584
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,621
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

585
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:22,913
Plenty.

586
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,462
Bring me some soda when you come up, Phyllis.
Good night, Mr. Neff.

587
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,588
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

588
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,257
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

589
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,566
Good night, Mr. Neff.

590
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,445
- All right, Walter?
- Fine.

591
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,405
- He signed it, didn't he?
- Sure he signed it. You saw him.

592
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,407
Now, listen. That trip to Palo Alto.
When does he leave?

593
00:35:58,491 --> 00:35:59,492
End of the month.

594
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:00,534
- He drives, huh?
- He always drives.

595
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:02,244
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

596
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,871
- Why?
- Because it's all worked out for a train.

597
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,332
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

598
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,250
a little thing called double indemnity.

599
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:11,212
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

600
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,464
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

601
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,174
The kind that almost never happen.

602
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,718
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

603
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:20,221
they pay $100,000 instead of $50,000.

604
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,723
- I see.
- We're hitting it for the limit, baby.

605
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,351
That's why it's got to be the train.

606
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:29,480
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

607
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,440
Straight down the line.

608
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,461
Hello, Mr. Neff.

609
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,089
It's me.

610
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,175
- Is anything wrong?
- I've been waiting for you.

611
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,343
For me? Why?

612
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:02,722
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

613
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:11,313
- Which way would that be?
- Down the hill. Down Vermont.

614
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:14,400
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

615
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,818
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

616
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,199
Going roller-skating, huh?

617
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:25,703
- You like roller-skating?
- I can take it or leave it.

618
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,790
- Only tonight you're leaving it?
- Yes, lam.

619
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,794
I'm having a very tough time at home.

620
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:37,256
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

621
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:41,218
- Sounds tough, all right.
- That's why I have to lie sometimes.

622
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:42,678
You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin?

623
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,680
It's Vermont and Franklin all right.

624
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:47,892
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

625
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,978
You won't tell on me, will you?

626
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,814
- I'd have to think it over.
- Nino's not what my father says at all.

627
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,984
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

628
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:00,029
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

629
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,782
Got behind in his credits, flunked out.

630
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:06,869
Then he lost his job for talking back.
He's so hot-headed.

631
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,371
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

632
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,957
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

633
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,251
except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil.

634
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:18,088
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

635
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:21,675
It'll all straighten out, Miss Dietrichson.

636
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:25,930
I suppose it will sometime. This is
the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

637
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,143
Nino? Over here, Nino.

638
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,404
- This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
- Hello, Nino.

639
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:44,073
The name is Zachetti.

640
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,826
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

641
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:47,993
I told him all about us.

642
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,411
Why does he have to get told about us?

643
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,497
We don't have to worry about Mr. Neff, Nino.

644
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,123
I'm not doing any worrying.

645
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:54,500
Just don't you broadcast so much.

646
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,293
Well, what's the matter with you, Nino?

647
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,838
- Why, he's a friend.
- I don't have any friends.

648
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:01,173
If I did, I like to pick them myself.
Come on.

649
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,592
Look, sonny, she needed a ride,
so I brought her along.

650
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:05,845
Is that anything to get tough about?

651
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,347
All right, Lola, make up your mind.
Are you coming or aren't you?

652
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,266
Of course I'm coming.

653
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:16,063
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

654
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,482
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

655
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,614
<i>She was a nice kid.</i>

656
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:28,826
<i>Maybe he was a little better than he sounded.</i>

657
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:32,329
<i>But right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all...</i>

658
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:36,083
<i>with that briefcase right behind my head
that had her father's signature in it...</i>

659
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,294
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

660
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,629
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

661
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,717
<i>It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.</i>

662
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,553
<i>You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

663
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,849
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.</i>

664
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,018
<i>I already had most of the plan in my head...</i>

665
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,395
<i>but a lot of details had to be worked out.</i>

666
00:39:56,478 --> 00:40:00,024
<i>And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.</i>

667
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:03,068
<i>We had to be very careful from now on.</i>

668
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,821
<i>We couldn't let anybody see us together.</i>

669
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,782
<i>We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.</i>

670
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:11,744
<i>Not from her house or at my office, anyway.</i>

671
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:16,749
<i>So she was to be in the market every
morning about 11:00, buying stuff.</i>

672
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:20,419
<i>And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.</i>

673
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,838
<i>Sort of accidentally on purpose.</i>

674
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:26,175
- Walter, I wanted to--
- Not so loud.

675
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,303
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

676
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,513
Let me talk first. It's all set.

677
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:34,099
The accident policy came through.
I've got it in my pocket.

678
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:37,102
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

679
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,271
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

680
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,232
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

681
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:45,110
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

682
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:48,238
It'll be all right that way, because
one of the cars is in your name.

683
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,074
Open your bag. Quick.

684
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,622
Can you get in the safe-deposit box?

685
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,707
- Yes. We both have keys.
- Fine.

686
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,085
But don't put the policy in there yet.
I'll tell you when.

687
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,837
Remember, you never saw it, you never
even touched it, you understand?

688
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,548
- I'm not a fool.
- Okay. When is he leaving on the train?

689
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,092
- That's just it. He isn't going.
- What?

690
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,052
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
The trip is off.

691
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,720
What happened?

692
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:16,308
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

693
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,060
That one up there?

694
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:23,816
I don't know why they always put
what I want on the top shelf.

695
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:26,777
Go ahead. I'm listening.

696
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,196
He had a fall-down at the well. Broke his leg.
It's in a cast.

697
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,032
- Broke his leg?
- What do we do now, Walter?

698
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:34,702
- Nothing. We just wait.
- Wait for what?

699
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:36,245
Until he can take the train.

700
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,538
I told you it's got to be the train.

701
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,956
But we can't wait. I can't go on like this.

702
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,959
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

703
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,837
- There are other ways.
- We're not gonna do it other ways.

704
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,005
But we can't leave it like this.

705
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:49,008
What do you suppose would happen if he
found out about the accident policy?

706
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,176
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

707
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,013
- Don't ever talk like that.
- Don't let's start losing our heads, that's all.

708
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,306
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

709
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,562
Excuse me.

710
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:06,233
We're gonna do it right. That's all I said.

711
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,818
It's the waiting that's getting me.

712
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,361
It's getting me just as bad, baby.

713
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:12,448
- But we've got to wait.
- Maybe we have, Walter, only...

714
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,993
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

715
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:21,123
I better go, baby. I'm
thinking of you every minute.

716
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:30,716
<i>After that, a full week
went by and I didn't see her once.</i>

717
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,303
<i>I tried to keep my mind off
her and off the whole idea.</i>

718
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,222
<i>I kept telling myself that maybe those
Fates they say watch over you...</i>

719
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:41,060
<i>had gotten together and broken
his leg to give me a way out.</i>

720
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:45,147
<i>Then it was the 15th of June. You
may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

721
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:49,860
<i>You came into my office
around 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

722
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:51,820
Hello, Keyes.

723
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:53,113
I just came from Norton's office.

724
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:54,698
The semiannual sales records are out.

725
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:57,659
You're high man, Walter. That's twice in a row.
Congratulations.

726
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,412
Thanks. How would you like a cheap drink?

727
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,956
How would you like a $50 cut in salary?

728
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:05,334
- Do I laugh now or wait till it gets funny?
- No, I'm serious.

729
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:08,712
I've just been talking to Norton. Too
much stuff piling up on my desk.

730
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:10,089
Too much pressure on my nerves.

731
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,216
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

732
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,176
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

733
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,636
Me? Why pick on me?

734
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,263
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

735
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:19,723
That's crazy, all right. I'm a salesman.

736
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:23,018
Yeah. A peddler, a gladhander, a backslapper.

737
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,853
You're too good to be a salesman.

738
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,022
- Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
- Phooey!

739
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:30,609
All you guys do is just ring doorbells and
dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

740
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,820
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

741
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:34,446
- Well, that'd trouble anybody.
- Now look, Walter.

742
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,449
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

743
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,451
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

744
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:40,619
It's the hottest job in the business.

745
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:41,954
Yeah, but it's still a desk job.

746
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,123
- I don't want to be nailed to a desk.
- Deskjob?

747
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:45,791
Is that all you can see in it?

748
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,836
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

749
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:51,630
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

750
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:56,093
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

751
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:58,178
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

752
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:02,349
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

753
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,269
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

754
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:09,148
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

755
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:12,359
They're alive. They're packed with drama...

756
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,736
with twisted hopes and crooked dreams.

757
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,031
A claims man, Walter, is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a--

758
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,661
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

759
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,039
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

760
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,833
and a father confessor, all in one.

761
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,459
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

762
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:30,669
You don't want to work with your brains?

763
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,838
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

764
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:36,425
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

765
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:39,011
- Walter Neff speaking.
- I had to call you, Walter.

766
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:40,470
It's very urgent. Are you with somebody?

767
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:45,100
Yes, I am. Can't I call you back, Margie?

768
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:49,021
No, you can't. I've only got a minute.
It can't wait.

769
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:52,357
Listen. He's going tonight. On the train.
Are you listening?

770
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:55,068
Walter? Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

771
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,280
- Only, make it snappy, will you?
- He's on crutches.

772
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,700
The doctor says he can go if he's careful.
The change will do him good.

773
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:04,536
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

774
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,164
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

775
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:09,666
Yeah. Yeah, that's 100 % better.

776
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:12,586
Hold the line a minute, will you?

777
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:15,380
- Keyes, suppose I join you in your office?
- That's all right. I'll wait.

778
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,883
Only tell her not to take all day.

779
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:20,802
Go ahead.

780
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:24,181
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

781
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,058
It's still the same dark street, isn't it?

782
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:29,436
And the signal is three honks on the horn.
Okay. Anything else?

783
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,230
No.

784
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,481
Oh, uh...

785
00:45:33,065 --> 00:45:34,650
what color did you pick?

786
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:37,653
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

787
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:39,571
Mmm-hmm.

788
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,615
Yeah, that suits me fine.

789
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,951
This is it, Walter. I'm shaking like a leaf.

790
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:47,079
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

791
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,289
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

792
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,252
- Sorry, Keyes.
- What's the matter?

793
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:56,046
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

794
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,006
If I told you it was a customer--

795
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,217
Margie. I bet she drinks from the bottle.

796
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,094
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

797
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:06,265
- Why don't you, for instance?
- I almost did, once. Long time ago.

798
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,100
Now look, Keyes, I've got
to call on a prospect.

799
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:10,727
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

800
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:13,021
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

801
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:15,941
I was on my way to the jewelry
store to buy the ring.

802
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:18,610
And then suddenly that little man
in here started working on me.

803
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:20,195
So you went back and had her investigated?

804
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:22,698
Yeah. And the stuff that came out...

805
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:26,034
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

806
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:28,620
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

807
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,330
She already had one husband.

808
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:32,499
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

809
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,626
- And as for her brother--
- I get the general idea.

810
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,338
- She was a tramp from a long line of tramps.
- Yeah. All right, all right.

811
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:41,133
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for'?

812
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,801
I don't think I want it, Keyes.

813
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,387
- Thanks just the same.
- Fair enough.

814
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,515
Only get this, I picked you for the job...

815
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,767
not because I think you're so darn smart...

816
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:54,187
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

817
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:04,364
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

818
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:06,742
You're just a little taller.

819
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,004
<i>Yes, Keyes.</i>

820
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,674
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

821
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:26,094
<i>Now they had thrown the switch.
The gears had meshed.</i>

822
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,847
<i>The time for thinking had all run out.</i>

823
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:33,310
<i>I wanted my movements accounted for
up to the last possible moment.</i>

824
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:37,522
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

825
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:39,608
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

826
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:43,779
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

827
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,322
<i>move by move.</i>

828
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,826
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

829
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,829
<i>This was another item to establish my alibi.</i>

830
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:56,500
- Hi, Mr. Neff.
- Hello, Charlie.

831
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,377
How about giving the heap a wash job?

832
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,628
How soon you gonna want it?

833
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,088
I got a couple cars ahead of you.

834
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:02,714
Any time you get to it, Charlie.

835
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:05,008
- I'm staying in tonight.
- Okay.

836
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,052
<i>Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

837
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,429
<i>one of the salesmen that shared my office.</i>

838
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:12,891
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.</i>

839
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,268
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my rate
book and needed some dope...</i>

840
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:18,313
<i>on the public liability bond I was figuring.</i>

841
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:22,192
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

842
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,362
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

843
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,864
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

844
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:31,910
<i>so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

845
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,037
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

846
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:36,915
<i>so that it would fall down if the bell rang.</i>

847
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:40,502
<i>That way I'd know if anybody had
called me while I was away.</i>

848
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:44,798
<i>Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.</i>

849
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:48,927
<i>I left the apartment by the service stairs.
Nobody saw me.</i>

850
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:53,181
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

851
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:54,599
<i>I didn't want to take the bus...</i>

852
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:58,353
<i>because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

853
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:00,439
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

854
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:03,442
<i>I could smell that honeysuckle again.</i>

855
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,695
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

856
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:14,327
<i>I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.</i>

857
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:17,706
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.</i>

858
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,291
<i>I'd figured it was safer that way...</i>

859
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:22,419
<i>in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.</i>

860
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:24,796
<i>I got into the back of the car.</i>

861
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,299
<i>I lay there on the floor and waited.</i>

862
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:30,469
<i>All the time I was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station...</i>

863
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,345
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

864
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:35,182
<i>and the three honks on the horn
that were to be the signal.</i>

865
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:37,642
<i>About 10 minutes later they came down.</i>

866
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:39,478
- All right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

867
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,980
I'll have the car out in a second.

868
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:22,103
- Take it easy, honey.
- We've got lots of time. Yeah.

869
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,542
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

870
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,335
you might end up with a shorter leg.

871
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:49,214
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

872
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:52,050
It makes you feel pretty good to
get away from me, doesn't it?

873
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:55,845
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

874
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,240
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

875
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,329
What are you doing that for?

876
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,791
What are you honking the horn for?

877
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,895
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

878
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,314
- Don't worry.
- Keep away from me as much as you can.

879
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,858
- Tell them I don't want to be helped.
- I said, don't worry, Walter.

880
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,152
You start as soon as the train leaves.

881
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,905
When you get to the refinery, turn
off the highway onto the dirt road.

882
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,531
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

883
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:40,033
to the dump beside the tracks. Remember.

884
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:42,661
- I remember everything.
- No speeding.

885
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,665
You don't want any oops stopping
you with him in the back.

886
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:49,125
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

887
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:51,461
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

888
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,672
I'll be back on the observation platform.

889
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:56,383
I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can.

890
00:52:56,466 --> 00:52:59,552
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

891
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:05,016
- San Francisco train, lady?
- Car 9, section 11. Just my husband.

892
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,602
Car 9, section 11? This way please.

893
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,570
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

894
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,531
Car number 8. Up there.

895
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:28,456
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

896
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,420
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

897
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:34,879
Yeah. You take it easy driving home.

898
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:38,383
- I'll miss you, honey.
- Section 11, sir.

899
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,137
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

900
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:44,389
- Goodbye, honey.
- All aboard!

901
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:51,813
Good luck, honey.

902
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,031
Porter, will you make up my berth right away?

903
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:03,158
Yes, sir.

904
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,909
I'm going back to the
observation oar for a smoke.

905
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:06,703
Right this way, sir.

906
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:40,028
Like a chair?

907
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:45,158
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

908
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:49,954
- You going far?
- Palo Alto.

909
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,873
My name's Jackson.

910
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:55,168
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

911
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:57,545
I had a broken arm once.

912
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:01,382
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

913
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,760
I thought I'd go crazy with mine.

914
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:07,889
Palo Alto's a nice little town.
You a Stanford man?

915
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:12,894
- I used to be.
- I'll bet you left something behind.

916
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,063
I always do.

917
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:18,608
My cigar case. I guess I left it in
my overcoat back in the section.

918
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,986
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister--

919
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,071
Dietrichson.

920
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:26,074
No thanks, I really prefer a cigar.

921
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:29,994
- Maybe the porter could--
- Well, I could get your cigars for you.

922
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:33,373
- Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
- If it's not too much trouble.

923
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:37,293
- Car 9, section 11.
- Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.

924
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,131
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

925
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:26,718
Here, take his hat. Pick up the
crutches back on the tracks.

926
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,832
Okay, baby. That's it.

927
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,934
All right. Let's go.

928
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:09,654
<i>On the way back,
we went over once more...</i>

929
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,155
<i>what she was to do at the inquest...</i>

930
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:14,951
<i>if they had one, and about the
insurance, when that came up.</i>

931
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:18,162
<i>I was afraid she might go to pieces
a little, now that we had done it.</i>

932
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:22,834
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves. Not a
tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

933
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:26,921
<i>She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.</i>

934
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:31,175
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

935
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:38,725
It's straight down the line, isn't it?

936
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:46,941
- I love you, Walter.
- I love you, baby.

937
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,833
<i>It was two minutes past 11:00, as I
went up the service stairs again.</i>

938
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:07,879
<i>Nobody saw me this time either. In
the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

939
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,965
<i>The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.</i>

940
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:16,471
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.</i>

941
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:21,434
<i>I had to go down to the garage. I
wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

942
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,985
You gonna use your oar, after all?
I'm not quite through.

943
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,904
Well, that's all right, Charlie.

944
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:35,073
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

945
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:38,117
Been working upstairs all night. My
stomach's getting a little sore at me.

946
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:39,827
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

947
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,748
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

948
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:46,459
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

949
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,920
<i>There was nothing to give us away.</i>

950
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:52,632
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore...</i>

951
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:56,135
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

952
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:59,430
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

953
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:02,016
<i>I couldn't hear my own footsteps.</i>

954
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:07,396
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

955
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:17,865
That was the longest night
lever lived through, Keyes...

956
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:21,786
and the next day was worse, when the
story had broke in the papers...

957
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,788
and they started talking
about it at the office...

958
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:27,083
and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

959
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:31,087
I kept my hands in my pockets because
I thought they were shaking.

960
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,381
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

961
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:37,426
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

962
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,221
I tried to hold myself together, but...

963
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:43,558
<i>I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.</i>

964
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:49,105
- Oh, Walter?
- Hello, Keyes.

965
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:51,524
Come along. The big boss wants to see us.

966
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,901
- The Dietrichson case?
- Must be.

967
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,028
- Anything wrong?
- Well, the guy is dead.

968
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:59,991
We had him insured and it's gonna cost us dough.
That's always wrong.

969
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:02,326
- What have they got so far?
- Autopsy report.

970
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:06,038
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no
predisposing medical cause of any kind.

971
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:07,999
Died of a broken neck.

972
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:10,168
- When's the inquest?
- Had it this morning.

973
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,295
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

974
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:15,173
The train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through...

975
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:16,507
to the observation car.

976
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:20,136
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

977
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,181
What do the police figure?

978
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,933
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

979
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:27,643
They're satisfied.

980
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:30,354
It's not their dough. Come on, Walter.

981
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,691
All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

982
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:35,985
I believe the legal position is now clear.

983
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:38,362
Please stand by. I may need you later.

984
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:41,324
Come in, Mr. Keyes. You, too, Mr. Neff.

985
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:47,955
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

986
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:51,042
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

987
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,460
Sit down, gentlemen. Thank you.

988
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:53,544
Any new developments?

989
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:56,255
I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

990
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:57,381
Who's Jackson?

991
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:58,966
He's the last man who saw Dietrichson alive.

992
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,594
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

993
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:03,721
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

994
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,473
to get Dietrichson's cigar case for him.

995
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,892
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

996
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,852
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

997
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,896
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

998
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:14,690
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

999
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:17,235
Very interesting about the cigar case.

1000
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:19,320
- Anything else?
- No, not much.

1001
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:22,406
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1002
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,826
There's a daughter, but all she remembers
is Neff talking to her father...

1003
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,120
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1004
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:29,580
I couldn't sell him at first.

1005
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:32,583
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1006
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,836
Later I saw him in the oil
fields and closed him.

1007
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,922
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1008
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,424
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1009
01:02:40,508 --> 01:02:42,093
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1010
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,136
He's got the best sales record in the office.

1011
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,473
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

1012
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:51,352
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1013
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:54,021
- I don't get it.
- You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1014
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:55,606
Then what do you think of this case?

1015
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,441
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1016
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:59,610
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1017
01:02:59,694 --> 01:03:01,445
Just what is your opinion?

1018
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:03,281
- No opinion at all.
- Not even a hunch?

1019
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:05,700
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1020
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,118
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1021
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,871
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1022
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:14,625
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

1023
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:18,045
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.

1024
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:24,010
- What do you say to that?
- Me?

1025
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:27,763
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1026
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:31,392
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office--

1027
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:37,189
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1028
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:39,275
There's a widespread feeling that...

1029
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,653
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1030
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:44,655
I'm having a visitor, if you don't mind.

1031
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:47,658
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1032
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:49,410
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1033
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:56,000
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1034
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,836
I assure you I appreciate it.
This is Mr. Keyes.

1035
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,379
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1036
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:02,465
- And Mr. Neff.
- I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1037
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:05,092
- Mrs. Dietrichson.
- Won't you sit down?

1038
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:09,555
May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1039
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,141
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

1040
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:15,853
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1041
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:17,521
You know why we asked you to come, don't you?

1042
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:20,191
No. All I know is that your secretary
made it sound very urgent.

1043
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:22,360
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1044
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,153
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1045
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:26,947
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

1046
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:30,326
Your husband took the policy out a
few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1047
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,870
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1048
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,705
His safe-deposit box hasn't been opened yet.

1049
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:36,791
It seems a tax examiner has to be present.

1050
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:38,542
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1051
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,044
you're being subjected to any questioning...

1052
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:41,754
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1053
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:42,880
What sort of things?

1054
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,424
We have the report of the coroner's inquest.

1055
01:04:45,508 --> 01:04:48,552
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1056
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:51,263
In fact, we are not satisfied at all.

1057
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,810
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect...

1058
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:58,396
a suicide.

1059
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:05,152
- I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water?
- Please.

1060
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:11,283
Thank you.

1061
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:20,793
Had your husband been depressed or
moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1062
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:23,629
Did he have financial worries, for instance?

1063
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:27,049
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

1064
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:29,260
Let us examine this so-called accident.

1065
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:33,472
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1066
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:36,517
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1067
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,270
- Do what?
- Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone.

1068
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:42,940
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1069
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:46,694
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1070
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:49,947
Once there, he finds he is not alone.
There is a man there.

1071
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:53,826
- What was his name, Keyes?
- His name was Jackson. Probably still is.

1072
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:57,997
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1073
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,375
- And then he is alone. And then he does it.
- Does what?

1074
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:05,171
He jumps. Suicide. In which case,
the company is not liable.

1075
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:08,382
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court--

1076
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:12,261
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1077
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,764
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1078
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:18,726
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1079
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,270
A settlement for a certain sum,
a part of the policy value.

1080
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:25,024
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1081
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:27,151
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1082
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:29,653
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1083
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:32,031
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1084
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:35,493
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1085
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:39,288
In fact, I don't like you, Mr.
Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1086
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:47,338
Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1087
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,797
Only you fumbled on the goal line.

1088
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:52,051
Then you heaved an illegal forward pass
and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1089
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:55,054
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1090
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:58,182
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1091
01:06:58,265 --> 01:06:59,725
Oh, can we?

1092
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:03,646
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

1093
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:07,441
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1094
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:11,070
You know, you ought to take a look at
the statistics on suicide sometime.

1095
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:13,614
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1096
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,824
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1097
01:07:15,908 --> 01:07:17,660
Yeah, in the front office.

1098
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:20,871
Come now, you've never read an actuarial
table in your life, have you?

1099
01:07:20,955 --> 01:07:23,207
Why, they've got 10 volumes on suicide alone.

1100
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,084
Suicide by race, by color, by occupation...

1101
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,169
by sex, by seasons of the
year, by time of day.

1102
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:30,589
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1103
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:33,342
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1104
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,053
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1105
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,555
alkaloid, protein, and so forth.

1106
01:07:37,638 --> 01:07:40,349
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1107
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,560
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1108
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:45,896
under the feet of horses, from steamboats.
But, Mr. Norton...

1109
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:49,650
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1110
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,068
from the rear end of a moving train.

1111
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,903
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1112
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:55,948
at the point where the body was found?
15 miles an hour.

1113
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,200
Now how can anybody jump off a
slow moving train like that...

1114
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:01,120
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1115
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,913
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1116
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,083
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1117
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,751
May I have this?

1118
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:12,673
Come on, Walter.

1119
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:18,012
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1120
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:36,905
<i>I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1121
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:38,532
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1122
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:41,327
<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

1123
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:44,121
<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

1124
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:47,374
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1125
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,460
<i>I could feel the ground under my feet again.</i>

1126
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:52,338
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1127
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:54,673
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1128
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:57,426
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1129
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:08,228
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1130
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:10,648
You were wonderful in Norton's office.

1131
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:13,942
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1132
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:16,528
How do you think I felt, baby? Where are you?

1133
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:19,239
At the drugstore. Just a block away.

1134
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:21,533
- Can I come up?
- Okay. But be careful.

1135
01:09:21,617 --> 01:09:23,410
Don't let anybody see you.

1136
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:51,146
Hello, Keyes.

1137
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:59,446
- What's on your mind?
- That broken leg.

1138
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:03,075
- The guy had a broken leg.
- What are you talking about?

1139
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:06,704
Talking about Dietrichson. He had
accident insurance, didn't he?

1140
01:10:06,954 --> 01:10:09,039
- Yeah.
- Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1141
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:10,999
- So what?
- And he didn't put in a claim.

1142
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:14,878
- Why didn't he put in a claim? Why?
- What are you driving at?

1143
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:19,842
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1144
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,593
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1145
01:10:21,677 --> 01:10:24,012
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1146
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:27,891
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1147
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:30,978
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1148
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:34,648
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1149
01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:36,900
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1150
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:38,026
- Yeah.
- You got his check?

1151
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,278
Sure I did.

1152
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:42,990
- Got any bicarbonate of soda?
- No, I haven't.

1153
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:47,411
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1154
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:50,581
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1155
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:53,083
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1156
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:54,752
No. Not suicide.

1157
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:58,422
- But not an accident, either.
- What else?

1158
01:10:58,964 --> 01:11:00,174
Now look, Walter.

1159
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:03,218
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000..

1160
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:04,344
If he's killed on a train.

1161
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:06,305
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1162
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:10,392
And not in a train accident, mind you, but
falling off some silly observation oar.

1163
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:13,103
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1164
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:16,106
One out of I don't know how many billions.

1165
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:21,528
And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

1166
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:26,116
- Something has been worked on us.
- Such as what?

1167
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:35,334
Murder?

1168
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:37,628
Don't you have any peppermint or something?

1169
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:40,547
- Sorry. Want a little soda water?
- No, no, no.

1170
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:42,925
Who do you suspect?

1171
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:44,927
Maybe I like to make
things easy for myself.

1172
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,012
But I always tend to suspect the beneficiary.

1173
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,180
- You mean the wife?
- Yeah.

1174
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,808
That wide-eyed dame that just didn't
know anything about anything.

1175
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:52,935
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1176
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:54,269
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1177
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:56,563
I don't claim to know how it was
worked, or who worked it...

1178
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:59,066
but all I know is that it was worked.

1179
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:00,859
I've got to get to a drugstore.

1180
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:03,904
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1181
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,698
- Good night, Walter.
- Good night, Keyes.

1182
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,952
- See you at the office in the morning.
- Yeah.

1183
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:13,580
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1184
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:17,835
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1185
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:20,546
I'd have the police after her so
fast it'd make her head spin.

1186
01:12:20,629 --> 01:12:22,172
They'd put her through the wringer...

1187
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:25,092
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1188
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,177
Only you haven't got a single
thing to go on, Keyes.

1189
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:29,555
Not too much. Just 26 years experience...

1190
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:33,892
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk cf concrete in my stomach.

1191
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:38,313
Can I have one of those things?

1192
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:51,660
- Good night, Keyes.
- So long, Walter.

1193
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:08,302
- How much does he know?
- He doesn't know anything.

1194
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:11,054
It's those stinking hunches of his.

1195
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:12,472
And he can't prove anything, can he?

1196
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:16,560
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1197
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:21,106
- How long a while?
- Until this dies down.

1198
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:22,190
You don't know Keyes.

1199
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:24,318
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1200
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:26,069
He'll investigate you, have you shadowed.

1201
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:28,947
He'll watch you every minute from now on.

1202
01:13:29,031 --> 01:13:31,533
- You afraid, baby?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

1203
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:36,580
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us.
We're not the same anymore.

1204
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:39,833
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1205
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,668
- Isn't it, Walter?
- What are you talking about?

1206
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:45,464
And you don't really care whether
we see each other or not.

1207
01:13:46,924 --> 01:13:48,425
Shut up, baby.

1208
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,057
<i>Pacific All Risk. Good afternoon.</i>

1209
01:13:57,351 --> 01:13:58,977
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1210
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,022
- Hello.
- Lola Dietrichson.

1211
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:05,317
- Don't you remember me?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

1212
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:07,611
Could I talk with you just a few minutes?

1213
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:10,155
Somewhere where we could be alone?

1214
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:12,574
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1215
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:21,083
Is it something about what happened?

1216
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:24,753
Yes, Mr. Neff. It's about my father's death.

1217
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:27,422
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.

1218
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:33,762
Lou, do you mind if I use the
office alone for a few minutes?

1219
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,722
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1220
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,272
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1221
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:47,818
I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical.
I'm not even crying.

1222
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:52,364
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1223
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:56,451
and I had that same feeling once
before, when my mother died.

1224
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:57,536
When your mother died?

1225
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,997
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1226
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,081
We had a cabin there.

1227
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:05,502
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1228
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:07,546
She had a nurse with her.

1229
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:10,632
There were just the three of us in the cabin.

1230
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:13,427
One night I got up and went
into my mother's room.

1231
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,345
She was delirious with fever.

1232
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:19,141
All the bed covers were on the floor
and the windows were wide open.

1233
01:15:19,266 --> 01:15:20,392
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1234
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:22,686
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1235
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:25,480
Just then I heard a door open behind me.

1236
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:27,983
The nurse stood there.

1237
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:32,154
She didn't say a word, but there
was a look in her eyes...

1238
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,989
I'll never forget.

1239
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:39,161
Two days later, my mother was dead.

1240
01:15:42,456 --> 01:15:44,791
Do you know who that nurse was?

1241
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,668
- No. Who?
- Phyllis.

1242
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:49,504
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1243
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:52,716
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1244
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:57,220
and I kind of talked myself out of the idea
she could have done anything like that.

1245
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:01,725
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1246
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:05,645
You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson.
Your father fell off a train.

1247
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:08,732
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1248
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:11,318
She was in her room in front of a
mirror, with a black hat on...

1249
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:12,736
pinning a black veil to it.

1250
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:16,198
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1251
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:18,325
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1252
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,035
Aren't you just imagining these things?

1253
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,578
I caught her eyes in the mirror.

1254
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:24,664
They had that look in them they
had before my mother died.

1255
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:26,249
That same look.

1256
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,710
You don't like your stepmother, do you?

1257
01:16:28,794 --> 01:16:30,587
Isn't it just because she is your stepmother?

1258
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,090
I loathe her because she did it.
She did it for the money.

1259
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:35,509
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1260
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:38,720
She's not going to get away with it this
time, because I'm going to speak up.

1261
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:40,305
I'm going to tell everything I know.

1262
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:44,684
- You'd better be careful, saying things like--
- I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1263
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:54,361
I'm sorry.

1264
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,033
I didn't mean to act like this.

1265
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:04,329
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

1266
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:05,622
No one.

1267
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:08,250
- How about your stepmother?
- Of course not.

1268
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:10,752
I've moved out.

1269
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:13,964
I'm not living at home anymore.

1270
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:16,633
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1271
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:19,594
I'm not seeing him anymore. We had a fight.

1272
01:17:21,221 --> 01:17:23,014
Where are you living now?

1273
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:26,101
I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood.

1274
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:29,354
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

1275
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,731
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1276
01:17:34,568 --> 01:17:36,069
<i>So that evening
I took her to dinner...</i>

1277
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:39,823
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1278
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:41,908
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1279
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:45,704
<i>The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1280
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:48,498
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

1281
01:17:48,582 --> 01:17:52,169
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1282
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:55,172
<i>It was dynamite, whether it was true or not.</i>

1283
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,174
<i>And I had no chance to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1284
01:17:57,257 --> 01:17:59,467
<i>You were watching her like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1285
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:03,972
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1286
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:08,059
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1287
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:11,104
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

1288
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:12,647
<i>It was worse.</i>

1289
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:17,194
<i>Outside your door was the last guy
in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1290
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:28,330
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1291
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:32,751
- Hello, Keyes.
- I want to ask you something.

1292
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:35,045
After all the years we've known each other...

1293
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,047
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1294
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,715
- About what?
- About me.

1295
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,968
- Walter, I'm a very great man.
- Yeah?

1296
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:44,804
This Dietrichson business, it's murder...

1297
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,890
and murders don't come any neater.

1298
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:49,809
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1299
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:52,145
smart, tricky, almost perfect, but...

1300
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:55,523
I think Papa has it all figured out.

1301
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:59,402
Figured out and wrapped up in tissue
paper with pink ribbons on it.

1302
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:02,239
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You know what?

1303
01:19:02,614 --> 01:19:05,533
That guy Dietrichson was never on the train.

1304
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:08,745
- He wasn't?
- No, he wasn't.

1305
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:12,582
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1306
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,794
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1307
01:19:15,877 --> 01:19:18,338
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1308
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:20,340
and then throw his body on the tracks.

1309
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:22,592
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1310
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:26,429
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1311
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:27,681
and put him on the tracks.

1312
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:31,017
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1313
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:33,812
You're way ahead of me, Keyes.

1314
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:35,689
Well, look, Walter, it was like this.

1315
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:39,609
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1316
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:43,280
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1317
01:19:43,363 --> 01:19:45,115
then the somebody else jumped off...

1318
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:47,742
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1319
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:50,495
An impersonation, see? A cinch to work.

1320
01:19:51,288 --> 01:19:53,415
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1321
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,000
they have the crutches to stare at...

1322
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,544
they never really looked at the man at all.

1323
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:59,796
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1324
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:03,216
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1325
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,802
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1326
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,763
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

1327
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:10,974
is sitting right outside my office.

1328
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:14,477
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1329
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:19,065
Come here, Mr. Jackson. Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1330
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:20,817
These are fine cigars you smoke.

1331
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,610
- Two for a quarter.
- That's what I said.

1332
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:24,237
Well, did you study those photographs?

1333
01:20:24,321 --> 01:20:26,323
Yes, indeed. I studied them thoroughly.

1334
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:28,241
- Very thoroughly.
- Have you made up your mind?

1335
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,327
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1336
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,537
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1337
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:35,665
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1338
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:37,959
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1339
01:20:38,043 --> 01:20:39,044
Yes.

1340
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:41,755
- Then my answer is no.
- What do you mean, no?

1341
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,007
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1342
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,300
Will you swear to that?

1343
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:47,344
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1344
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:49,804
If I say it, I mean it. If I mean
it, of course I'll swear it.

1345
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:51,514
There you are, Walter. There's your proof.

1346
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:53,224
This is Mr. Neff, one of our salesmen.

1347
01:20:53,308 --> 01:20:55,310
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1348
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:56,728
- How are you?
- Very fine, thank you.

1349
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:59,189
- Never was better.
- Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1350
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:02,609
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1351
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:05,445
Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger man...

1352
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:08,490
about 10 or 15 years younger than
the man in these photographs.

1353
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:10,575
Dietrichson was about 50, wasn't he, Walter?

1354
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,036
Fifty-one, according to the policy.

1355
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:15,997
The man I saw was nothing like 51 years old.

1356
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:18,708
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1357
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:21,002
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1358
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:23,755
- But I'm positive just the same.
- Thank you, Jackson.

1359
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,257
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1360
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:29,427
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1361
01:21:29,511 --> 01:21:32,263
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1362
01:21:32,347 --> 01:21:35,642
- Expenses paid, of course.
- Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1363
01:21:37,227 --> 01:21:39,854
Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.

1364
01:21:40,522 --> 01:21:42,565
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1365
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:46,736
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1366
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:49,614
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1367
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:51,491
the Dietrichson claim.

1368
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:54,661
Well, take care of his hotel bill, will you?

1369
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:55,829
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1370
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:56,913
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1371
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,540
No. Never been up there.

1372
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:01,292
Wait a minute. You go trout fishing?

1373
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:05,088
- Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way.
- Nope. I don't fish.

1374
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:08,675
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1375
01:22:09,217 --> 01:22:11,803
- There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis.
- No relation.

1376
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:14,222
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1377
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:16,683
- A very reputable man, too, I'm told.
- All right, Mr. Jackson.

1378
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:18,268
Suppose you go down to the cashier's office.

1379
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:19,811
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1380
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:23,189
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1381
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:24,274
Tonight?

1382
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:27,610
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1383
01:22:27,694 --> 01:22:30,488
- I'd like to see before I leave.
- Osteopath?

1384
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:34,075
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1385
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:36,494
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1386
01:22:36,578 --> 01:22:38,872
- It's been a pleasure.
- Goodbye.

1387
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:45,128
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1388
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,922
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1389
01:22:48,006 --> 01:22:50,467
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1390
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:53,428
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1391
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,513
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1392
01:22:55,597 --> 01:22:58,475
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1393
01:22:58,558 --> 01:22:59,809
Their emotions are all kicked up.

1394
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:03,313
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1395
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:05,857
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1396
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,317
But it isn't twice as safe.

1397
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,570
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1398
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:12,780
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1399
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:14,616
where they can get off at different stops.

1400
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:16,951
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1401
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:18,495
all the way to the end of the line.

1402
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:20,872
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1403
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:22,749
She put in her claim.

1404
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:26,002
I'm gonna throw it right back at her.

1405
01:23:31,591 --> 01:23:33,343
Let her sue us if she dares.

1406
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:36,179
I'll be ready for her and that somebody else.

1407
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:38,806
They'll be digging their own graves.

1408
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:49,901
Mrs. Dietrichson? This is Jerry's Market.

1409
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:52,987
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1410
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:56,616
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1411
01:24:23,685 --> 01:24:26,312
- Hello, Walter.
- Come over here.

1412
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:32,986
What's the matter? Everything's the matter.

1413
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:36,322
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1414
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:38,992
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

1415
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:40,868
He wants you to sue, but you're not going to.

1416
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:43,830
- What's he got to stop me?
- He's got plenty.

1417
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,084
He's figured out how it was worked.

1418
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,919
He knows it was somebody else on the train...

1419
01:24:50,003 --> 01:24:51,838
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1420
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:54,257
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1421
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:57,844
Yeah? And then you're in court and a lot
of other things are going to come up.

1422
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:01,764
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1423
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:03,766
What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1424
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:04,851
The way she died.

1425
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:07,937
And about that black hat you were trying
on before you needed a black hat.

1426
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:09,731
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1427
01:25:09,856 --> 01:25:12,191
- She's been seeing you.
- I've been seeing her, if you want to know.

1428
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:13,943
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1429
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:16,779
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying--

1430
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:19,157
Keep her out of this. All I'm telling
you is we're not going to sue.

1431
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,450
Because you don't want the money anymore...

1432
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:21,701
even if you could have it, because she's...

1433
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:22,952
made you feel like a heel all of a sudden?

1434
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:26,289
It isn't the money anymore. It's our necks.
We're pulling out, do you understand?

1435
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:29,292
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1436
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,628
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1437
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:34,589
You're afraid she might find out someday
and you can't take it, can you?

1438
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:36,591
I said, leave her out of this.

1439
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:42,805
It's me I'm talking about.

1440
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:45,058
- I don't want to be left out of it.
- Stop saying that.

1441
01:25:45,141 --> 01:25:46,517
It's just that it hasn't worked as we wanted.

1442
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,228
- We can't go through with it, that's all.
- We have gone through with it.

1443
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:50,396
The tough part is all behind us.

1444
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:52,982
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1445
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:55,777
stick close together the way we started out.

1446
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,111
Watch it.

1447
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:17,507
I loved you, Walter, and I hated him.

1448
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:21,052
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1449
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:24,764
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1450
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:28,017
And I'm the one that fixed it so he was dead.

1451
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:31,771
- Is that what you're telling me?
- And nobody's pulling out.

1452
01:26:31,938 --> 01:26:34,524
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

1453
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:38,319
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1454
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:46,703
<i>Yes, I remembered.</i>

1455
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:51,332
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1456
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,876
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1457
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,337
<i>and how there was no getting off
till the end of the line...</i>

1458
01:26:57,964 --> 01:26:59,882
...where the cemetery was.

1459
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,595
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1460
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:07,473
They're to put dead people in.

1461
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:12,895
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1462
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:14,480
Dead, I mean.

1463
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:18,276
And how it would be if she were dead.

1464
01:27:19,569 --> 01:27:22,363
<i>I saw Lola three or four times that week.</i>

1465
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:26,868
<i>One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1466
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:29,912
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...</i>

1467
01:27:29,996 --> 01:27:32,415
<i>I could relax and let go a little.</i>

1468
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,322
Why are you crying?

1469
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:08,451
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1470
01:28:08,618 --> 01:28:12,538
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1471
01:28:13,748 --> 01:28:16,667
- It's about Nino.
- Zachetti? What about him?

1472
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,670
They killed my father together.
He and Phyllis.

1473
01:28:19,754 --> 01:28:22,256
He helped her do it. I know he did.

1474
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:25,051
What makes you say that?

1475
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:28,721
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1476
01:28:28,805 --> 01:28:31,224
It was Phyllis and him all along.

1477
01:28:31,474 --> 01:28:35,520
Maybe he was just going with me as a blind.
And the night of the murder--

1478
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:37,688
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1479
01:28:37,772 --> 01:28:41,317
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1480
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,278
But he never showed up. He said he was sick.

1481
01:28:45,071 --> 01:28:46,155
Sick!

1482
01:28:48,241 --> 01:28:52,662
He couldn't show up, because the train
was leaving with my father on it.

1483
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:01,587
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1484
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,632
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1485
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:08,803
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1486
01:29:15,184 --> 01:29:18,604
<i>Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1487
01:29:20,273 --> 01:29:24,360
<i>What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1488
01:29:25,987 --> 01:29:29,115
<i>I tried to make sense out
of it and got nowhere.</i>

1489
01:29:29,615 --> 01:29:32,618
<i>But the real braintwister came the next day.</i>

1490
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:37,164
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes, after
office hours, when you caught me...</i>

1491
01:29:37,248 --> 01:29:39,125
<i>down in the lobby of the building.</i>

1492
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,460
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1493
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:49,093
- Hello, Keyes.
- Just hang on to your hat, Walter.

1494
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:51,137
- What for?
- Oh, nothing much.

1495
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:54,307
That Dietrichson case just busted wide open.

1496
01:29:54,557 --> 01:29:57,602
- How do you mean?
- The guy showed. That's how.

1497
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:01,022
- What guy?
- The guy who helped her do it.

1498
01:30:01,105 --> 01:30:02,815
The somebody else?

1499
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:06,402
- No kidding?
- Yeah. She just filed suit against us.

1500
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:07,737
It's okay by me.

1501
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,865
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1502
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:13,200
- Come on. I'll buy you a martini, Walter.
- No thanks, Keyes.

1503
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:14,243
With two olives.

1504
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:16,621
No, I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine.
I've got a date.

1505
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:19,832
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1506
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,126
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1507
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:23,502
All you have to do is ask for them.

1508
01:30:23,586 --> 01:30:27,715
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1509
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:34,096
<i>I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1510
01:30:34,388 --> 01:30:37,224
<i>Maybe you were playing
cat- and-mouse with me.</i>

1511
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:40,478
<i>Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.</i>

1512
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:45,066
<i>I had to find out, and I knew where to look.
In your office.</i>

1513
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,141
<i>Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

1514
01:31:19,225 --> 01:31:20,893
<i>Confidential. Dietrichson file.</i>

1515
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:24,438
<i>With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

1516
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:26,190
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1517
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,651
<i>I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1518
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:32,571
<i>and he's definitely placed in his
apartment from 7:15 p.m. on.</i>

1519
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:36,575
<i>In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1520
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:39,954
<i>and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.</i>

1521
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,587
<i>Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...</i>

1522
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:51,007
<i>between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1523
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:54,885
<i>whereas I am now able to report that such
a connection has been established...</i>

1524
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:57,096
<i>between her and another man.</i>

1525
01:31:57,263 --> 01:32:00,141
<i>This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

1526
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:03,602
<i>on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

1527
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:08,065
<i>We have succeeded in identifying
him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

1528
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:10,651
<i>former medical student, age of 28...</i>

1529
01:32:10,735 --> 01:32:12,987
<i>residing at Lilac Court Apartments...</i>

1530
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:15,948
<i>1228 1/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

1531
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:19,952
<i>We have checked Zachetti's movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1532
01:32:20,036 --> 01:32:22,830
<i>and have found that
they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1533
01:32:23,289 --> 01:32:26,500
<i>I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration.</i>

1534
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:30,254
<i>It is my belief that we already have
sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

1535
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:33,424
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson
to justify police action.</i>

1536
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:36,677
<i>I strongly urge that this whole matter
be turned over to the office...</i>

1537
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:38,679
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

1538
01:32:38,763 --> 01:32:40,848
<i>Respectfully, Barton Keyes.</i>

1539
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:20,763
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

1540
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:24,225
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1541
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,227
How's 11:00?

1542
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:29,188
Don't worry about Keyes.

1543
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:32,233
Just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out.

1544
01:33:32,316 --> 01:33:35,236
No, nobody's watching the house. Not anymore.

1545
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:39,824
It's just for the neighbors. I
told you not to worry about Keyes.

1546
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:43,786
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1547
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:47,081
Goodbye, baby.

1548
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:52,753
<i>I guess I don't have to tell you...</i>

1549
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:55,464
<i>what I intended to do at 11:00, Keyes.</i>

1550
01:33:55,548 --> 01:33:59,135
<i>For the first time, I saw a way to get
clear of the whole mess I was in...</i>

1551
01:33:59,218 --> 01:34:02,054
<i>and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time.</i>

1552
01:34:02,388 --> 01:34:04,515
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1553
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:08,519
<i>What I didn't know was that
she had plans of her own.</i>

1554
01:35:07,995 --> 01:35:09,622
In here, Walter.

1555
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,846
Hello, baby.

1556
01:35:28,098 --> 01:35:30,809
- Anybody else in the house?
- Nobody. Why?

1557
01:35:32,311 --> 01:35:35,231
- What's that music?
- A radio up the street.

1558
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:46,659
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1559
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:49,578
We were talking about automobile insurance.

1560
01:35:49,954 --> 01:35:52,498
Only you were thinking about murder.

1561
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,417
I was thinking about that anklet.

1562
01:35:55,501 --> 01:35:57,378
And what are you thinking about now?

1563
01:35:57,461 --> 01:35:59,755
I'm all through thinking, baby.

1564
01:35:59,964 --> 01:36:02,216
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

1565
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:06,470
- Where are you going?
- You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.

1566
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,306
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

1567
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:11,892
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1568
01:36:11,976 --> 01:36:15,396
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

1569
01:36:15,813 --> 01:36:18,774
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1570
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,443
on a trolley oar together. One
can't get off without the other.

1571
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:23,821
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1572
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:26,198
riding together clear to the end of the line.

1573
01:36:26,282 --> 01:36:28,575
And the last stop is the cemetery.

1574
01:36:28,659 --> 01:36:31,829
- Maybe he's got something there.
- You bet he has.

1575
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:34,623
Two people are gonna ride to the
end of the line, all right.

1576
01:36:34,707 --> 01:36:39,128
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1577
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:42,673
- Just who are you talking about?
- An acquaintance of yours.

1578
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:44,091
A Mr. Zachetti.

1579
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:45,968
Come on, baby, I just got into this thing...

1580
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:48,637
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1581
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:49,763
I was a sucker.

1582
01:36:49,847 --> 01:36:52,599
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1583
01:36:52,683 --> 01:36:55,352
- Nobody wanted to brush you off.
- Save it. I'm telling this.

1584
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:57,813
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1585
01:36:57,896 --> 01:36:59,481
That's not true.

1586
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:02,735
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1587
01:37:03,986 --> 01:37:07,489
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1588
01:37:07,573 --> 01:37:10,576
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1589
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:14,079
- What's happening to me all this time?
- Don't be silly, baby.

1590
01:37:19,335 --> 01:37:23,505
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1591
01:37:23,589 --> 01:37:24,840
That's what Keyes thinks.

1592
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:27,176
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1593
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:31,597
Maybe it's not good enough for me, Walter.
Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1594
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,557
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1595
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:38,187
Sometimes people are where they can't talk.
Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1596
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,524
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1597
01:37:42,608 --> 01:37:46,320
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1598
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:49,239
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1599
01:37:49,323 --> 01:37:52,785
With the cops right behind him.
It's all taken care of.

1600
01:37:53,911 --> 01:37:56,163
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1601
01:37:56,246 --> 01:38:00,125
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1602
01:38:00,209 --> 01:38:01,668
and Lola gets a chance to sound off...

1603
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:04,963
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1604
01:38:05,047 --> 01:38:07,383
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1605
01:38:07,466 --> 01:38:08,884
so we can get the money and be together.

1606
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:12,388
- That's cute. Say it again.
- He came here first to ask where Lola was.

1607
01:38:12,471 --> 01:38:14,556
I made him come back. I was working on him.

1608
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,600
He's a crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered.

1609
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:18,894
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1610
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:23,357
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1611
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,110
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1612
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:30,280
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1613
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:32,825
We're both rotten.

1614
01:38:32,908 --> 01:38:34,576
Only you're a little more rotten.

1615
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,745
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1616
01:38:36,829 --> 01:38:40,332
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1617
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:43,460
Then somebody else would have come along
to take care of Zachetti for you.

1618
01:38:43,544 --> 01:38:46,255
- That's the way you operate, isn't it, baby?
- Suppose it is.

1619
01:38:46,338 --> 01:38:49,633
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1620
01:38:50,467 --> 01:38:54,179
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1621
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:17,369
You can do better than that, can't you, baby?

1622
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,371
Better try it again.

1623
01:39:22,166 --> 01:39:24,501
Maybe if I came a little closer?

1624
01:39:35,012 --> 01:39:37,514
How's this? Think you can do it now?

1625
01:39:46,523 --> 01:39:48,901
Why didn't you shoot again, baby?

1626
01:39:54,615 --> 01:39:58,577
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

1627
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:02,122
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1628
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:05,584
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1629
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:08,086
That's all you ever meant to me...

1630
01:40:09,254 --> 01:40:11,006
until a minute ago...

1631
01:40:12,132 --> 01:40:14,760
when I couldn't fire that second shot.

1632
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:19,097
I never thought that could happen to me.

1633
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:22,684
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.

1634
01:40:22,768 --> 01:40:24,478
Just hold me close.

1635
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:32,444
Goodbye, baby.

1636
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,333
<i>Zach em.</i>

1637
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:31,837
Come here.

1638
01:41:37,676 --> 01:41:39,344
I said, come here.

1639
01:41:42,097 --> 01:41:45,100
- My name is Neff.
- Yeah, and I still don't like it.

1640
01:41:45,183 --> 01:41:46,810
What do you want?

1641
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:48,186
Look, kid.

1642
01:41:49,354 --> 01:41:52,649
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1643
01:41:52,816 --> 01:41:54,860
- What's the gag?
- Suppose you go on back down the hill...

1644
01:41:54,943 --> 01:41:56,528
to the drugstore and make a phone call.

1645
01:41:56,612 --> 01:41:58,697
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1646
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,532
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1647
01:42:00,616 --> 01:42:03,160
Ask for Miss Dietrichson. First name is Lola.

1648
01:42:03,243 --> 01:42:04,328
She isn't worth a nickel.

1649
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:06,913
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1650
01:42:06,997 --> 01:42:07,998
Tough, aren't you?

1651
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:10,125
Here, take the nickel and call her.
She wants you to.

1652
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:11,960
She doesn't want any part of me.

1653
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:14,796
I know who told you that. It's not true.

1654
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,382
Lola's in love with you. She always has been.

1655
01:42:17,466 --> 01:42:19,676
Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess.

1656
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:23,055
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1657
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:25,307
Go on. That way.

1658
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,736
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1659
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:40,155
It's cold.

1660
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,827
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house.

1661
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:48,038
Or if they've found her by now.

1662
01:42:49,706 --> 01:42:53,001
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1663
01:42:57,255 --> 01:43:00,258
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1664
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:06,098
I want you to be the one to tell Lola, kind
of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1665
01:43:07,766 --> 01:43:11,436
And I want you to take care of
her and that guy Zachetti...

1666
01:43:16,066 --> 01:43:18,860
so he doesn't get pushed around too much.

1667
01:43:20,821 --> 01:43:22,280
Hello, Keyes.

1668
01:43:32,249 --> 01:43:34,376
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1669
01:43:35,794 --> 01:43:39,131
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1670
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:43,051
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1671
01:43:43,135 --> 01:43:44,720
The janitor did.

1672
01:43:45,554 --> 01:43:48,181
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1673
01:43:48,265 --> 01:43:49,349
Yeah.

1674
01:43:49,808 --> 01:43:51,685
Wouldn't be surprised.

1675
01:43:53,145 --> 01:43:56,690
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1676
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:58,483
So I gather.

1677
01:44:00,152 --> 01:44:03,488
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

1678
01:44:03,572 --> 01:44:06,575
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1679
01:44:07,492 --> 01:44:09,453
One you didn't quite figure out.

1680
01:44:09,536 --> 01:44:11,997
You can't figure them all, Walter.

1681
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:15,333
That's right. I guess you can't at that.

1682
01:44:16,626 --> 01:44:19,212
Now I suppose I get the big speech...

1683
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:23,175
the one with all the two-dollar words in it.

1684
01:44:24,384 --> 01:44:26,178
Let's have it, Keyes.

1685
01:44:27,554 --> 01:44:30,766
Walter, you're all washed up.

1686
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,896
Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.

1687
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:39,357
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1688
01:44:41,568 --> 01:44:44,196
What for? So they can patch me up?

1689
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,949
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1690
01:44:48,033 --> 01:44:51,411
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

1691
01:44:51,495 --> 01:44:53,079
Is that it, Keyes?

1692
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:54,831
Something like that.

1693
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:58,084
- I've got a different idea.
- Yeah?

1694
01:44:58,168 --> 01:44:59,544
Look, Keyes.

1695
01:44:59,878 --> 01:45:02,297
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1696
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:04,716
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1697
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,385
After that you can play it any way you like.

1698
01:45:07,469 --> 01:45:10,055
Would you do that much for me, Keyes?

1699
01:45:10,347 --> 01:45:14,226
- Give me one good reason.
- I need four hours to get where I'm going.

1700
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:17,562
- You're not going anywhere, Walter.
- You bet I am.

1701
01:45:18,438 --> 01:45:21,316
- I'm going across the border.
- You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1702
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:22,984
Good enough to try for.

1703
01:45:23,068 --> 01:45:26,488
- You'll never make the border.
- That's what you think.

1704
01:45:27,197 --> 01:45:28,698
Just watch me.

1705
01:45:29,115 --> 01:45:31,284
You'll never even make the elevator.

1706
01:45:31,535 --> 01:45:32,536
So long, Keyes.

1707
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:03,441
Hello...

1708
01:46:03,525 --> 01:46:06,152
send an ambulance to the Pacific
Building on Olive Street.

1709
01:46:08,363 --> 01:46:10,323
Yeah. It's a police job.

1710
01:46:30,135 --> 01:46:32,721
How you doing, Walter? Fine.

1711
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:38,476
Only somebody moved the elevator
a couple of miles away.

1712
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,812
They're on the way.

1713
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:47,736
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1714
01:46:47,819 --> 01:46:49,321
I'll tell you.

1715
01:46:49,863 --> 01:46:53,116
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1716
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,827
He was right across the desk from you.

1717
01:46:56,036 --> 01:46:58,038
Closer than that, Walter.

1718
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:03,710
I love you, too.
