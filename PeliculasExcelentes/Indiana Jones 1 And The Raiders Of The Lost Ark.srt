fresh, three days.

They're following us.

would've killed us already.

contents of the barrow.

one of the great dangers
of archaeology...

In this case, local tradition held

that there was golden
coffin buried at the site,

63
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:47,073
and this accounts for the
holes dug all over the barrow

64

condition of the find.

Obtainer of rare antiquities.

113
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,334
That's one way of saying it.

114
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,335
Why don't you sit down?

115
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:40,336
You'll be more comfortable.

116
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:41,337
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

117
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:44,673
Yes, you're a man of many talents.

118

We were friends, but...

126
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,993
had a bit of a falling
out, I'm afraid.

127
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:09,231
Dr Jones, now, you must understand

128
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,334
that this is all
strictly confidential?

129
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,469

137
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:35,774
He's crazy.

138

He's obsessed with the occult.

139
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,778
And, right now, apparently,

Now, we've got some
information here,

Just what does that
mean to you, Tanis?

149
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:06,989
Well, it...

150
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,357
The city of Tanis is
one of the possible

151
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:09,691
resting places of the Lost Ark.

152
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,410
The Lost Ark?

153
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:12,527
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

used to carry

00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:15,233
around the Ten Commandments.

156
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:16,665
What do you mean, "commandments"?

157
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,133
You talking about the
Ten Commandments?

00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,735
Yes, the actual Ten Commandments.

160
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,772
that Moses brought down out
of Mount Horeb and smashed,

161
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,608
if you believe in
that sort of thing.

162
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:28,727
Any of you guys ever
go to Sunday school?

163
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:29,728
Well, I...

164
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:30,812
Oh, look.

165
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:33,715
The Hebrews took the broken
pieces and put them in the Ark.

166
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:36,618
When they settled in Canaan, they
put the Ark in a place called

167
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:37,686
the Temple of Solomon.

168
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:38,721
In Jerusalem.

169
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,388
Where it stayed for many years.

170
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:42,791
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

171
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:43,859
Where?

172
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,761
Well, nobody knows where or when.

173
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,696
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

174
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:49,098
- Shishak.
- Yes.

175
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,633
Invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

176
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:54,669
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

177
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:58,440
and hidden it in a secret chamber
called the Well of Souls.

178
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,674
Secret chamber?

179
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:04,079
However, about a year after the
pharaoh would return to Egypt,

180
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,082
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

181
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,185
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

182
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,854
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

183
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,224
Huh.

184
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:18,427
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

185
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:21,263
Now you seem to know, all
about this Tanis, then.

186
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,014
No, no, not really.

187
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,684
Ravenwood is the real expert.

188
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,218
Abner did the first
serious work on Tanis.

189
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,788
Collected some of its relics.

190
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,557
It was his obsession, really.

191
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,259
But he never found the city.

192
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,612
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr Ravenwood.

193
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,450
An American being mentioned so

194
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,635
prominently in a
secret Nazi cable.

195
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,701
Oh, rubbish.

196
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,235
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

197
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:45,988
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

198
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,173
Well, obviously, the
Nazis are looking

199
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,860
for the headpiece to the Staff of
Ra and they think Abner's got it.

200
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:55,564
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

201
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:56,832
Well, the staff is just a stick...

202
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:58,133
I don't know, about this big,

203
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,835
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

204
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,871
And it's... it's... it's capped

205
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:05,807
with an elaborate headpiece...

206
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,760
in the shape of the sun, with
a crystal in the centre.

207
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,662
And what you did was

208
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,982
you take the staff to a
special room in Tanis...

209
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,683
A map room with a miniature

210
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,385
of the city all laid
out on the floor...

211
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:18,453
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

212
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,256
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

213
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:24,193
and made a beam that came
down on the floor here...

214
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,163
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

215
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:31,116
Where the Ark of the
Covenant was kept, right?

216
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,750
Which is exactly what the
Nazis are looking for.

217
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:35,821
What does this Ark look like?

218
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:39,158
There's a picture
of it right here.

219
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,564
That's it.

220
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:53,722
Good God.

221
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,957
Yes, that's just what
the Hebrews thought.

222
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,778
Now, what's that supposed
to be coming out of there?

223
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,014
Lightning...

224
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,882

225
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,051
power of God or something.

226
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,255
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.

227
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:11,957
Oh, yes.

228
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,926
The Bible speaks of the
Ark levelling mountains,

229
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:17,495
and laying waste
to entire regions.

230
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,666
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

231
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:22,935
is invincible.

232
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,191
You did it, didn't you?

233
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:47,759
They want you to go for it.

234
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,262
Oh, Marcus.

235
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:53,031
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

236
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,300
and they're prepared to
pay handsomely for it.

237
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:56,535
And the museum?

238
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,036
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

239
00:20:58,038 --> 00:20:59,439
Oh, yes.

240
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,375
Oh...

Nothing else has come close.

That thing represents everything

244
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,450
we got into archaeology
for in the first place.

245
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:19,424
You know, five years ago, I
would've gone after it myself.

246
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:21,660
I'm really rather envious.

247
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,094
I've got to locate Abner.

248
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:24,863
I think I know where to start.

249
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,204
Suppose she'll still be with him?

250
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:33,605
Possibly, but...

Well, I mean that for
nearly 3,000 years,

for the Lost Ark.

256

What are you trying
to do, scare me?

Thank you, my friend,

727

briefly yours is now mine.

What a fitting end to
your life's pursuits.

to leave you down
