<i>October is inventory time</i>.

2
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:36,979
<i>So right now, Statler Toyota is making
the best deals of the year,</i>

3
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,190
<i>on all 1985-model Toyotas.</i>

4
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,883
<i>You won't find a better car,</i>

5
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:44,262
<i>at a better price with better service
anywhere in Hill Valley.</i>

6
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,265
<i>That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.</i>

7
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:53,212
<i>The Senate is expected
to vote on this today.</i>

8
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:54,890
<i>In other news,</i>

<i>officials at the Pacific Nuclear
research facility,</i>

10
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,620

that a case of missing plutonium,</i>

11
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,581
<i>was in fact stolen from their vault
two weeks ago.</i>

12
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:07,518
<i>A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.</i>

13
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:12,407
<i>However, officials now attribute
the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.</i>

14
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,502
<i>The FBI, which is investigating
the matter, had no comment.</i>

15
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,504
Hey, Doc?

16
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:03,356
Doc?

17
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,894
Hello!
Anybody home?

18
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:07,854
Einstein, come here boy.

19
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:10,965
What's going on?
Oh, God.

20
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:13,834
Jesus!

21
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,278
That is disgusting.

22
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,662
Where the hell is he?

23
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,374
Rock 'n' roll.

24
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,508
Yo.
<i>Marty, is that you?</i>

25
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,603
Hey. Hey, Doc.

26
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,094
Where are you?

27
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,195
<i>Thank God I've found you. Listen.</i>

28
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,540
<i>Can you meet me at Twin Pines
Mall tonight at 1:15.</i>

29
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,301
<i>I made a breakthrough,
I'll need your assistance.</i>

30
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,279
Wait, wait a moment.
1:15 in the morning?

31
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,804
<i>Yeah!</i>
Doc, what's going on?

32
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:06,523
Where you been all week?

33
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:07,347
<i>Working.</i>

34
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:08,848
Where is Einstein, he's with you?

35
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,260
<i>Yeah, he's right here.</i>

36
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:13,079
You know Doc, you left your
equipment on all week.

37
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:14,499
<i>My equipment?</i>

38
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,848
<i>That reminds me, Marty.</i>

39
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:19,994
<i>You better not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.</i>

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,733
Yeah.

41
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,371
I'll keep that in mind.

42
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,955
<i>Good.
I'll see you tonight.</i>

43
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:24,983
<i>Don't forget now,</i>

44
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:27,635
<i>1:15 a.m Twin Pines Mall.</i>
Right.

45
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,138
<i>Are those my clocks I hear?</i>

46
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:39,463
Yeah, it's 8:00. clock.

47
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,682
<i>Perfect!
My experiment worked!</i>

48
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,277
<i>They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!</i>

49
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:45,973
Wait a minute.

50
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,113
Wait a minute, Doc.

51
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:50,191
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

52
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,274
<i>Precisely.</i>

53
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,910
Damn!

54
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:54,821
I'm late for school.

55
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:55,633
Oh, Jennifer.

56
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:57,658
Marty don't go this way,
Strickland's looking for you.

57
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,886
If you get caught, it'll be
four tardies in a row.

58
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,748
Alright, come on.
I think we're safe.

59
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:06,232
You know this time it wasn't my fault.

60
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:09,003
The doc set all his clocks
25 minutes slow.

61
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,061
Doc?

62
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,909
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

63
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,045
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

64
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,082
And one for you, McFly.
I believe that's four in a row.

65
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,485
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

66
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:28,039
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

67
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:30,750
Hang around with him,
you'll end up in big trouble.

68
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,918
Oh yes, sir.

69
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,596
You got a real attitude problem, McFly.
You're a slacker.

70
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:39,484
You remind me of your father when
he went here, he was a slacker too.

71
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,420
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

72
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:46,432
I noticed your band is on the roster for
the dance auditions after school today.

73
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:49,059
Why even bother?
You don't have a chance.

74
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,860
You're too much like your old man.

75
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:54,962
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

76
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,055
Yeah, well, history is going to change.

77
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:02,482
<i>Next, please.</i>

78
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,338
Ok, guys, let's rock 'n' roll.

79
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,126
<i>Alright.</i>

80
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:15,427
<i>We're the...</i>

81
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,255
<i>We're the Pinheads.</i>

82
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,091
<i>One, two, three.</i>

83
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:42,697
<i>Ok, that's enough.
Thank you, fellas.</i>

84
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,949
<i>Hold it. Hold it, fellas.</i>

85
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,202
<i>I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.</i>

86
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,637
<i>Next, please.</i>

87
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:53,683
<i>Next group, please.</i>

88
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,222
<i>Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.</i>

89
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,549
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

90
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,351
Too loud, I can't believe it.

91
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:06,387
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

92
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,831
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

93
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,309
Nah, I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

94
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,321
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good.

95
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,145
And this audition tape of yours
is great.

96
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,440
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

97
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,317
It's like Doc's always saying.
Yeah, I know, I know.

98
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,670
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

99
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,764
That's good advice, Marty.

100
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,307
Alright, ok Jennifer. What...

101
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,384
What if I send in the tape
in and they don't like it?

102
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,320
I mean what if they say
I'm no good?

103
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:33,113
What if they say. Get out of here kid,
you got no future?

104
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,491
I mean I just don't think I can take
that kind of rejection.

105
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,377
Jesus, I'm starting to sound
like my old man.

106
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,874
Come on, he's not that bad.

107
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:42,388
At least he's letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

108
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,427
Check out that 4x4.

109
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,039
That is hot.

110
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:49,721
Ok, back her up.

111
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,059
Someday, Jennifer.

112
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:53,184
Someday.

113
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,771
Wouldn't it be great, to take
that truck, up to the lake?

114
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:00,500
Throw a couple of sleeping bags
in the back.

115
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:04,303
Lie out underneath the stars.

116
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:05,780
Stop it.
What?

117
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:08,421
Does your mom know?

118
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:09,700
About tomorrow night?

119
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,253
No, get out of town.

120
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,229
My mom thinks I'm going
camping with the guys.

121
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,998
Look Jennifer, my mother would freak out
if she knew I was going with you.

122
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,860
I'd get the standard lecture about...

123
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,587
how she never did that kind
of stuff when she was a kid.

124
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:22,389
I mean look...

125
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,165
I think the woman was born a nun.

126
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,960
She's just trying
to keep you respectable.

127
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,270
She's not doing a very good job.

128
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,646
Terrible.

129
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,617
Save the clock tower!

130
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,541
Save the clock tower!

131
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:38,288
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

132
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,865
Thirty years ago,

133
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:43,050
lightning struck that clock tower
and the clock hasn't run since.

134
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:48,072
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society
think it should be preserved exactly the way it is.

135
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,283
As part of our history and heritage.

136
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:51,420
There's a quarter.

137
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,661
Thanks you.
Don't forget to take a flyer.

138
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,063
Alright.
Save the clock tower!

139
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,241
Where were we?

140
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,456
Right about here.

141
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:02,145
Jennifer!

142
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,466
It's my dad.
Right.

143
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,467
I've got to go.

144
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,176
I'll call you tonight.

145
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,553
I'll be at my grandma's.

146
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,378
Here, let me give you the number.

147
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,103
Bye.

148
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,258
<i>Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.</i>

149
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,894
<i>Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.</i>

150
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:11,930
Perfect.

151
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,507
Just perfect.

152
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:22,124
I can't believe, you'd loan me your car,

153
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,335
without telling me it had a blind spot.

154
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,745
I could've been killed.

155
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,406
Now, now Biff know,

156
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:32,552
I never noticed that the car had any
blind spot before when I would drive it.

157
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,753
Hi son.

158
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,730
What, are you blind, McFly?

159
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,207
It's there. How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

160
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,344
Biff... can I, can I assume...

161
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:44,814
that your insurance is going to pay
for the damage?

162
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,041
My insurance?

163
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,191
It's your car.

164
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:50,036
Your insurance should pay for.
I wanna know who's going to pay for this?

165
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,262
I spilled beer all over it when the car
smashed into me.

166
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:53,750
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

167
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:55,925
And where's my reports?

168
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,746
Well I haven't finished those up yet,
you know I...

169
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,771
I... I figured since they weren't due 'til...

170
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,720
Hello?

171
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:03,449
Hello, anybody home?

172
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,819
Think, McFly.
Alright.

173
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Think!

174
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,703
I got to have time to get
them retyped.

175
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,246
But, do you realize what would happen,

176
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,717
if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?

177
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:14,486
I'll get fired.

178
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:16,938
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

179
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,682
Would you?
Of course not, Biff.

180
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:21,426
No I wouldn't want that to happen.

181
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:25,595
Now look. I'll finish those reports
tonight and I'll

182
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:27,749
run them on over first
thing tomorrow alright.

183
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:29,776
Not too early, I sleep in Saturday.

184
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,336
But why your shoe's untied.

185
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,547
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

186
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,849
Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.

187
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:41,276
I have your car towed to your house,

188
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,164
and all you got for me is lite beer?

189
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:52,465
What are you looking at, butthead?

190
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,578
Say hi to your mom for me.

191
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,743
I know what you're gonna say son.

192
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:03,235
And you're right.

193
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,136
You're right.

194
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,821
But...

195
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,499
Biff just happens to be my supervisor
and I'm...

196
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,537
afraid I'm just not very good
at confrontations.

197
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,331
But the car, Dad.

198
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,702
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

199
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,956
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

200
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,534
Do you have any idea how
important this was to me?

201
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,458
Do you have any clue?

202
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,603
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

203
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,730
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,949
Believe me Marty,

205
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,661
you're better off without having
to worry about all the...

206
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:39,839
aggravation and headaches...

207
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,164
playing at that dance.

208
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,736
He's absolutely right, Marty.

209
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:46,243
The last thing you need is headaches.

210
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:55,318
Kids,

211
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:58,105
we're going to have to eat
this cake by ourselves.

212
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,708
Your Uncle Joey didn't make
parole again.

213
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:06,039
I think it would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

214
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,332
Uncle Jailbird Joey?

215
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,001
He's your brother, Mom.

216
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,838
Yeah. It's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

217
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,215
We all make mistakes in life, children.

218
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,009
Goddamn it.
I'm late.

219
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,619
David, watch your mouth!

220
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:22,188
Come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

221
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:23,900
Come here.
Come on Mom make it fast.

222
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,625
I'll miss my bus.

223
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,226
See you later, Pop.

224
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:29,954
Time to change that oil.

225
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:34,525
Hey Marty.

226
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:39,530
I'm not your answering service.
While you were outside pouting over the car.

227
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,516
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

228
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,242
I don't like her, Marty.

229
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,579
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

230
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:49,582
Mom, there is nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

231
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,114
I think it's terrible.

232
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,102
Girls chasing boys.

233
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,723
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy.

234
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,550
Or sat in a parked car with a boy.

235
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:02,645
Then how am I ever supposed
to meet anybody?

236
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,857
Well, it'll just happen.

237
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,059
Like the way I met your father.

238
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,471
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

239
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,564
It was meant to be.

240
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:15,815
Anyway...

241
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,987
if Grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

242
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,256
Yeah, well.

243
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:25,159
I still don't understand what Dad was
doing in the middle of the street.

244
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,550
What was it, George?

245
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,745
Bird-watching?

246
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:28,794
What, Lorraine?

247
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:29,895
What?

248
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,676
Anyway, your Grandpa hit him
with the car...

249
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,286
and brought him into the house.

250
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,422
He seemed so helpless.

251
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,776
Like a little lost puppy,

252
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:44,220
and my heart just went out to him.

253
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,473
Yeah, Mom, we know.
You've told us this story a million times.

254
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,775
You felt sorry for him.

255
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,144
You decided to go with him
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

256
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:55,131
No, no. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

257
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,379
Our first date.

258
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,335
I'll never forget it.

259
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:02,406
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember George?

260
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:09,662
Your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor.

261
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,541
It was then that I realized...

262
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,736
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

263
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:21,883
Oh, no.

264
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:47,073
Hello.

265
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,694
<i>Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?</i>
No I... Doc.

266
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,656
No. No, don't, don't be silly.

267
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:57,001
<i>Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.</i>

268
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,621
<i>Can you stop by my place and pick
it up on your way to the mall?</i>

269
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:01,001
Yeah.

270
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:02,673
I'm... I'm on my way.

271
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:28,037
Einstein!

272
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,751
Hey Einstein!
Where's the doc, boy?

273
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,097
Doc!

274
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:27,526
Marty!

275
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:28,559
You made it!
Yeah.

276
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,714
Welcome to my latest experiment.

277
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:33,039
This is the big one, the one
I've been waiting for all my life.

278
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:34,808
Well, it's a DeLorean, right?

279
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,716
Bear with me, Marty.
All your questions will be answered.

280
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,434
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

281
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:39,994
Oh, Doc?
Is that a Devo suit?

282
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,172
Never mind, never mind that now.
Not now. Not now.

283
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:43,941
Alright, I'm ready.

284
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:45,385
Good evening.

285
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:46,386
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

286
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,503
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

287
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:52,125
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

288
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,119
And this is temporal experiment
number one.

289
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:55,832
Come on, Einie.

290
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,005
Hey, hey, boy, get in there.

291
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:57,628
That a boy!

292
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,032
In you go. Sit down.

293
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:01,868
Put your seat belt on.
That's it.

294
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:08,682
Ok.

295
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:11,421
Please note...

296
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,200
that Einstein's clock,

297
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:15,465
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

298
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,759
Got it?
Right. Check, Doc.

299
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:18,584
Good.

300
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:22,232
Have a good trip, Einstein.

301
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:23,657
Watch your head.

302
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,348
You got that thing hooked up
to the car?

303
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,192
Watch this.
Yeah. Ok.

304
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,635
Got it.

305
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,957
Jesus!

306
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,546
Not me!
The car!

307
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:06,800
If my calculations are correct...

308
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:10,003
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour...

309
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,839
you're going to see some serious shit.

310
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,410
Watch this!
Watch this!

311
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:10,505
What did I tell you?

312
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,550
88 miles per hour!

313
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:22,358
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a.m and 0 seconds!

314
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,045
Jesus Christ!

315
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,731
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

316
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,159
Calm down.
I didn't disintegrate anything.

317
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:35,638
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

318
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,698
Then where the hell are they?

319
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:39,268
The appropriate question is...

320
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:40,892
When the hell are they?

321
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:45,456
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

322
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:48,584
I sent him into the future.

323
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:51,904
One minute into the future, to be exact.

324
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:55,258
At precisely 1:21 a.m and 0 seconds,

325
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:57,786
we shall catch up
with him and the time machine.

326
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:02,619
Wait a minute.

327
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,766
Wait a minute, Doc.

328
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:07,679
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine...

329
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:10,724
Out of a DeLorean?

330
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:11,774
The way I see it...

331
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:15,345
if you're going to build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with style?

332
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,282
Besides, the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal...

333
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,993
Look out!

334
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:07,946
What? What? Is it hot?

335
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,739
It's cold. Damn cold.

336
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:15,713
Einstein, you little devil!

337
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:21,761
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking!

338
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:26,891
He's alright.
He's fine.

339
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:29,268
He's completely unaware
that anything happened.

340
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:32,021
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

341
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,632
That's why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine.

342
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:37,869
He skipped over that minute to instantly
arrive at this moment in time.

343
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:38,693
Come here.

344
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,272
I'll show you how it works.
Alright.

345
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,561
First,

346
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,418
you turn the time circuits on.

347
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,697
This readout tells
you where you're going.

348
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,990
This one tells you where you are.

349
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,559
This one tells you where you were.

350
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,003
You input your destination time
on this keypad.

351
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:58,815
Say you want to see the signing
of the Declaration of Independence.

352
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,544
Or witness the birth of Christ.

353
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:09,359
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

354
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,395
November 5, 1955.

355
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,650
Yes, of course.

356
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,595
November 5, 1955.

357
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:22,855
Why? I don't get it.
Ok, what happened?

358
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,517
That was the day I invented
time travel.

359
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,278
I remember it vividly.

360
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,705
I was standing on the edge of
my toilet, hanging a clock.

361
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,524
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the sink.

362
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,585
And when I came to,
I had a revelation.

363
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,811
A vision. A picture in my head.

364
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:39,280
A picture of this.

365
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,350
This is what makes time travel possible.

366
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:44,586
The flux capacitor.

367
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,345
Flux capacitor?

368
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,500
It's taken almost 30 years and my entire family
fortune to realize the vision of that day.

369
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,628
My God, has it been that long?

370
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,381
Things have certainly changed
around here.

371
00:25:58,232 --> 00:26:01,669
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

372
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:06,132
Old man Peabody, owned all of this.

373
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:11,003
He had this crazy idea,
about breeding pine trees.

374
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,124
This is...

375
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,219
This is heavy-duty Doc.
This is great.

376
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,264
Does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline?

377
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:24,126
Unfortunately no. It requires
something with a little more kick.

378
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:25,451
Plutonium.

379
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:27,420
Plutonium. Wait a minute.
Are you...

380
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:30,298
Are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear?

381
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:30,805
Hey, hey, hey!

382
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,225
Keep rolling.
Keep rolling there.

383
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:34,101
No, no, no, no.
This sucker's electrical.

384
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:38,139
But I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

385
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,476
Doc, you don't just walk into
a store and buy plutonium.

386
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,495
Did you rip that off?

387
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,551
Of course.
From a group of Libyan Nationalists.

388
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:50,033
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

389
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:54,213
So, I took their plutonium and in turn gave them
a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts.

390
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:56,658
Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
Jesus!

391
00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:57,664
We must prepare to reload.

392
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,874
It's safe now.
Everything's lead-lined.

393
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:32,869
Don't lose those tapes now.

394
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,213
I need that as a record.

395
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:37,290
Let's put this back here.
There we go.

396
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,761
Almost forgot my luggage.

397
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,580
Who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future.

398
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,567
I'm allergic to all synthetics poducts.

399
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:47,916
The future?

400
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:49,811
That's where you're going.
That's right.

401
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,415
25 years in the future.

402
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,140
I've always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years,

403
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,026
seeing the progress of mankind.

404
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,851
Why not?

405
00:27:58,102 --> 00:28:00,922
I'll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 World Series.

406
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:03,074
Doc.

407
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:06,869
Look me up, when you get there.

408
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,864
Indeed I will.

409
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:10,489
Roll them.

410
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:19,240
I, Dr. Emmett Brown...

411
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,419
am about to embark on
an historic journey.

412
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:27,423
What am I thinking of?

413
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,434
I almost forgot to bring
extra plutonium.

414
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,303
How do I expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

415
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:33,830
I must be out of my mind.

416
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,001
What is it, Einie?

417
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:48,194
Oh, my God.

418
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:51,030
They found me. I don't know how,
but they found me.

419
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,624
Run for it, Marty!
Who? Who?

420
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,394
Who do you think?
The Libyans!

421
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,240
Holy shit!

422
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,971
I'll draw their fire!

423
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:16,422
Doc, wait!

424
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:32,238
No!

425
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:34,649
You bastard!

426
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:54,718
Go!

427
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:56,411
Damn Soviet gun.

428
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:02,017
Go!

429
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,061
Come on!
Move, damn it!

430
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:47,687
Jesus!

431
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,427
Holy shit!

432
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,514
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

433
00:32:04,891 --> 00:32:06,267
What is it?
What is it, Pa?

434
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:07,494
What is it, Pa?

435
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:11,230
Looks like an airplane without wings.

436
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:13,472
That ain't no airplane.

437
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:14,801
Look.

438
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:36,713
Don't look!

439
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:37,973
Listen...

440
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,062
Hello.

441
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,399
Excuse me.

442
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:01,622
Sorry about your barn.

443
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:08,054
It's already mutated into human
form, shoot it!

444
00:33:10,414 --> 00:33:12,792
Take that, you mutated
son of a bitch!

445
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,171
Wait!

446
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,326
Shoot it, Pa!

447
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:26,178
My pine!

448
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:27,748
Why you...

449
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:31,575
You space bastard!

450
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,354
You killed our pine!

451
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,310
Alright. Alright.
Ok, McFly.

452
00:33:39,694 --> 00:33:41,904
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

453
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:44,824
It's just a very intense dream.

454
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:30,995
Listen, you got to help me.
Don't stop, Wilbur! Don't!

455
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:34,782
It can't be.

456
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,357
This is nuts.

457
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:47,871
Come on.

458
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,723
Perfect.

459
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:49,225
<i>Remember, fellow citizens,
the future is in your hands.</i>

460
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,179
<i>If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

461
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:55,431
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

462
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:58,000
<i>Mayor Red Thomas'
progress platform,</i>

463
00:36:58,226 --> 00:37:00,686
<i>means more jobs,
better education,</i>

464
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,498
<i>bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.</i>

465
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:07,652
<i>On election day,
cast your vote for a proven leader.</i>

466
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:09,771
<i>Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

467
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:14,868
This has got to be a dream.

468
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:34,512
Hey, kid.
What you do, you jump ship?

469
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:36,217
What?

470
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:37,890
What's with the life preserver?

471
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:44,572
I want to use the phone.

472
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:46,583
It's in the back.

473
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:50,687
Brown.

474
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,532
Great.
You're alive.

475
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:07,870
Come on.

476
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:19,357
Do you know where 1640 Riverside...
You gonna order something, kid?

477
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:22,345
Yeah.

478
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,170
Give me..
Give me a Tab.

479
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:27,098
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

480
00:38:27,523 --> 00:38:28,883
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

481
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:31,720
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

482
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,931
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, ok?

483
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,033
Something without sugar.

484
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,526
Hey, McFly.

485
00:38:49,003 --> 00:38:50,430
What do you think you're doing?

486
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:52,589
Biff.

487
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:55,384
Hey I'm talking to you McFly,
you Irish bug!

488
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,930
Hey Biff, hey Guys.
How are you doing?

489
00:38:57,955 --> 00:38:59,355
You got my homework finished, McFly?

490
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,850
Well actually, I figured since it
wasn't due 'til Monday...

491
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,513
Hello? Hello?

492
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:05,670
Anybody home?

493
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:07,444
Hey think, McFly.

494
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,189
Think!

495
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:10,049
I got to have time to recopy it.

496
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:13,686
You realize what would happen if I hand in
my homework in your handwriting?

497
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,580
I'll get kicked out of school.

498
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:17,949
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

499
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:22,328
Would you?
Now, of course not, Biff.

500
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:23,930
No.
I wouldn't want that to happen.

501
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:26,018
What are you looking at, butthead?

502
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:28,176
Biff, get a load of this guy's
life preserver.

503
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,111
Dork thinks he's going to drown.
Yeah.

504
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:31,871
How about my homework, McFly?

505
00:39:33,297 --> 00:39:34,624
Ok, Biff. Well...

506
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:37,073
I'll finish that up tonight and then...

507
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,704
I'll bring it over first thing
tomorrow morning.

508
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:43,058
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Oh McFly, your shoe's untied!

509
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,227
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

510
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,927
I don't want to see you in
here again. Ok.

511
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,364
Alright. Bye-bye.

512
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:12,855
What?

513
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:14,547
You're George McFly!

514
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,099
Yeah. Who are you?

515
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:19,594
Say! Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

516
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:20,995
Well, they're bigger than me.

517
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:23,431
Stand tall, boy.
Have some respect for yourself.

518
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:25,844
Don't you know,
if you let people walk over you now,

519
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:28,069
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

520
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,097
Look at me.

521
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,479
You think I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life in this slop house?

522
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,274
Watch it, Goldie.
No, sir!

523
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:35,818
I'm gonna make something of myself.
I'm going to night school,

524
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:38,154
and one day, I'm going
to be somebody.

525
00:40:38,237 --> 00:40:39,814
That's right.
He's going to be mayor.

526
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:41,274
Yeah, I'm...

527
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:43,618
Mayor!

528
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:48,289
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

529
00:40:48,372 --> 00:40:49,926
A colored mayor.
That'll be the day.

530
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:52,250
You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers.
I will be mayor.

531
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:54,629
I'll be the most powerful man
in Hill Valley,

532
00:40:54,712 --> 00:40:56,505
and I'm going to clean up this town.

533
00:40:56,631 --> 00:40:58,858
Good.
You can start by sweeping the floor.

534
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:03,863
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

535
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:06,224
I like the sound of that.

536
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,591
Hey, Dad! George!

537
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:22,198
Hey, you on the bike!

538
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,323
He's a peeping Tom!

539
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:02,246
Dad!

540
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:15,071
Hey, wait.

541
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:16,795
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

542
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:19,884
Stella!

543
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:23,309
Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

544
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:26,454
Come out here!
Help me take him in the house!

545
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:33,602
Mom?

546
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:35,371
That you?

547
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:37,607
There, there, now.

548
00:42:37,857 --> 00:42:38,975
Just relax.

549
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:44,447
You've been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

550
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:49,118
I had a horrible nightmare.

551
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:53,147
I dreamed that I went back in time.

552
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:55,041
It was terrible.

553
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:56,826
Well...

554
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:01,147
you're safe and sound now
back in good old 1955.

555
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:03,674
1955?

556
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:09,498
You're my...

557
00:43:10,023 --> 00:43:11,046
You're my...

558
00:43:11,307 --> 00:43:12,784
My name is Lorraine.

559
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:15,121
Lorraine Baines?

560
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:16,395
Yeah.

561
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:18,681
But you're...

562
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:20,266
You're so...

563
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,686
You're so...

564
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:23,769
Thin!

565
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,956
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

566
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:32,929
Where are my pants?

567
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:34,781
Over there.

568
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:36,850
On my hope chest.

569
00:43:38,668 --> 00:43:41,204
I've never seen purple
underwear before, Calvin.

570
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:44,682
Calvin? Why do you keep
calling me Calvin?

571
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:47,718
That is your name, isn't it?
Calvin Klein.

572
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,313
It's written all over your underwear.

573
00:43:51,472 --> 00:43:53,249
I guess they call you Cal?

574
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:55,618
No actually people...

575
00:43:56,727 --> 00:43:57,871
call me Marty.

576
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:01,783
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

577
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,359
Marty.

578
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:07,153
Klein.

579
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:15,561
Do you mind if I sit here?

580
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,415
No. Fine.

581
00:44:17,582 --> 00:44:19,445
No. Good. Fine.

582
00:44:19,446 --> 00:44:20,126
Good.

583
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:23,889
That's a big bruise you have there.

584
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:27,975
Lorraine, are you up there?

585
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:29,777
Oh, my God!
It's my mother!

586
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:31,558
Quick!

587
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:33,347
Put your pants back on!

588
00:44:41,606 --> 00:44:43,700
So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

589
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:46,485
Excuse me?
I guessed you're a sailor.

590
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:48,530
That's why you wear that
life preserver.

591
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,331
Coast guard.

592
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:51,284
Sam,

593
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:53,894
here's the young man you hit
with your car out there.

594
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:55,276
He's alright.
Thank God.

595
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:57,371
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

596
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:59,566
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

597
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:02,425
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

598
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,546
Now, let's see.
You already know Lorraine.

599
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:07,214
This is Milton, this is Sally...

600
00:45:07,298 --> 00:45:11,310
that's Toby, and over there
in the playpen is little baby Joey.

601
00:45:13,512 --> 00:45:15,173
So, you're my uncle Joey.

602
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,368
Better get used to these bars, kid.

603
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:23,005
Yes. Joey just loves being
in his playpen.

604
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:26,617
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we leave him in there all the time.

605
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:29,320
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

606
00:45:29,612 --> 00:45:31,086
Well, listen, I really ought to...

607
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:32,531
Sit here, Marty.

608
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:37,003
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

609
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:41,049
Look at it roll.

610
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:43,777
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

611
00:45:52,468 --> 00:45:54,122
Our first television set.

612
00:45:54,123 --> 00:45:55,872
Dad just picked it up today.

613
00:45:56,764 --> 00:45:58,174
Do you have a television?

614
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,811
Well, yeah.
You know, we have two of them.

615
00:46:03,036 --> 00:46:04,689
You must be rich.

616
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:09,035
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

617
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:14,336
Hey.

618
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:17,827
Hey. I've seen this one.
I've seen this one, this is a classic.

619
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:20,513
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

620
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:23,006
What do you mean, you've seen this?

621
00:46:23,007 --> 00:46:24,233
It's brand-new.

622
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:27,095
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

623
00:46:27,753 --> 00:46:28,980
What's a rerun?

624
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:30,973
You'll find out.

625
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:33,675
You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me.

626
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:35,236
Do I know your mother?

627
00:46:36,846 --> 00:46:38,606
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

628
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:42,310
Oh, then I want to give her a call.
I don't want her to worry about you.

629
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:43,461
You can't.

630
00:46:44,628 --> 00:46:46,357
That is, nobody...

631
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:47,924
nobody home.

632
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:51,644
Yet.

633
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:55,139
Listen.

634
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:57,809
Do you... Do you know where
Riverside Drive is?

635
00:46:58,034 --> 00:47:00,473
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple.

636
00:47:00,574 --> 00:47:01,654
East end of town.

637
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,570
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.

638
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,956
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

639
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:08,845
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

640
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,230
Mother?

641
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:13,516
With Marty's parents out of town,

642
00:47:14,258 --> 00:47:16,636
don't you think he ought
to spend the night?

643
00:47:16,761 --> 00:47:19,038
I mean after all,
Dad almost killed him with the car.

644
00:47:19,263 --> 00:47:20,824
That's true, Marty.

645
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:25,002
I think maybe you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

646
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:26,348
Well, gee, I don't know.

647
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:28,248
He can sleep in my room.

648
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:30,608
I gotta go!
I gotta go!

649
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,270
Thanks very much, it was wonderful.
You were all great...

650
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:34,495
See you all later.

651
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,820
Too much later.

652
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:43,613
He's a very strange young man.

653
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,156
He's an idiot.

654
00:47:45,623 --> 00:47:47,029
Comes from upbringing.

655
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,860
His parents are probably idiots, too.

656
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,481
Lorraine, you ever have a kid
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

657
00:48:31,377 --> 00:48:32,395
Doc?

658
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:34,464
Don't say a word.

659
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,247
Doc.
I don't wanna know your name.

660
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,498
I don't want to know anything
bout you.

661
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,583
Listen, Doc...
Quiet!

662
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:40,417
Doc.

663
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,918
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.

664
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,088
Doc, you got to help...
Quiet.

665
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:43,770
Quiet.

666
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,625
I'm going to read your thoughts.

667
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,596
Let's see now. You've come here
from a great distance?

668
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,805
Yeah.
Exactly.

669
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:54,815
Don't tell me!

670
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,518
You want me to buy a subscription
to the Saturday Evening Post.

671
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,303
No.

672
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,087
Not a word. Not a word.
Not a word now!

673
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,072
Quiet.

674
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:05,654
Donations.

675
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:07,594
You want me to make a donation...

676
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,530
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

677
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,015
Doc.

678
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,176
I'm from the future.

679
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,372
I came here in a time
machine you invented.

680
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:24,544
But now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

681
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,505
My God.

682
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,137
Do you know what this means?

683
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:40,143
It means that this damn
thing doesn't work at all!

684
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,545
Doc, you got to help me.

685
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:44,064
You are the only one who knows
how your time machine works.

686
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:45,685
Time machine?

687
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,710
I haven't invented any time machine.

688
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,222
Ok. Alright, I'll prove it to you.

689
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,424
Look at my driver's license.

690
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:56,076
Expires 1987.

691
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,661
Look at my birthday, for crying out loud!

692
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,546
I haven't even been born yet.

693
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,165
And look at this picture.

694
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,250
It's my brother, my sister and me.

695
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,629
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc. Class of 1984?

696
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,590
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

697
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,526
They cut off your brother's hair.

698
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,745
I'm telling the truth, Doc.
You got to believe me.

699
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,014
Then tell me, future boy,

700
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,936
Who's President of
the United States in 1985?

701
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,454
Ronald Reagan.

702
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,669
Ronald Reagan?

703
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:26,756
The actor?

704
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,985
Then who's vice president?
Jerry Lewis?

705
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,531
I suppose Jane Wyman
is the First Lady.

706
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,699
Wait, Doc!

707
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,992
And Jack Benny
is secretary of the treasury.

708
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,494
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

709
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:41,663
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

710
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,914
Good night, future boy!

711
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,374
No, wait, Doc.
Doc.

712
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,252
The bruise. The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

713
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,753
You told me the whole story.

714
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:51,423
You were standing on your toilet
and you were hanging a clock,

715
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,717
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink.

716
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,720
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

717
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,807
which is what makes
time travel possible.

718
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,052
There's something wrong with the starter,

719
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:18,074
so I hid it... here.

720
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,714
After I fell off my toilet,

721
00:51:31,415 --> 00:51:32,622
I drew this.

722
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,120
The flux capacitor.

723
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,864
It works!

724
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,951
It works!

725
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,855
I finally invent something that works!

726
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,433
You bet your ass it works.

727
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,096
Somehow we've got to sneak
this back to my laboratory.

728
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,498
We've got to get you home!

729
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,658
Ok, Doc, this is it.

730
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,137
Never mind that.
Never mind that now.

731
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,241
Why, that's me!

732
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:24,666
Look at me!
I'm an old man.

733
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:25,975
<i>Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.</i>

734
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,144
<i>I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.</i>

735
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,830
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

736
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,215
What's on Earth is this thing
I'm wearing?

737
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,567
This is a radiation suit.

738
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:35,802
Radiation suit?

739
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,608
Of course.

740
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:39,589
Because of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

741
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,493
This is truly amazing.

742
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,230
A portable television studio.

743
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,414
No wonder your president has to be an actor.

744
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,967
He's gotta look good on television.

745
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,569
This is it.
This is the part coming up, Doc.

746
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,380
<i>No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,</i>

747
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,383
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...</i>

748
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,560
What did I just say?

749
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,348
<i>This sucker's electrical,</i>

750
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,351
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...</i>

751
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,770
1.21 gigawatts!

752
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,482
1.21 gigawatts.

753
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:17,611
Great Scott!

754
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,290
What the hell is a gigawatt?

755
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,388
How could I have been so careless?

756
00:53:25,689 --> 00:53:27,579
1.21 gigawatts!

757
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,373
Tom, how am I going
to generate that kind of power?

758
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,083
It can't be done, can it?

759
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,602
Doc, look.

760
00:53:33,603 --> 00:53:35,519
All we need is a little plutonium.

761
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,781
I'm sure that in 1985,

762
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,133
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

763
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,969
but in 1955, it's a little hard
to come by.

764
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,089
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

765
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:52,145
Doc, stuck here? I can't. I can't be
stuck here, I got a life in 1985.

766
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,313
I got a girl.

767
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:54,439
Is she pretty?

768
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,343
Doc, she's beautiful.

769
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:58,668
She's crazy about me.

770
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:01,123
Look at this.
Look what she wrote here, Doc.

771
00:54:01,148 --> 00:54:02,948
I mean, that says it all.

772
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,160
Doc, you're my only hope.

773
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:11,164
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating

774
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,467
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

775
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:16,803
What did you say?

776
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:17,854
A bolt of lightning.

777
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,550
Unfortunately, you never know when
or where it's ever going to strike.

778
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,128
We do now.

779
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,303
This is it!

780
00:54:32,428 --> 00:54:34,028
This is the answer.

781
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:35,941
It says here,

782
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:38,458
that a bolt of lightning
is going to strike the clock tower

783
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:41,594
at precisely 10:04 p.m
next Saturday night!

784
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,701
If we could somehow
harness this lightning,

785
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,122
channel it into the flux capacitor,

786
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,609
it just might work.

787
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:57,917
Next Saturday night,

788
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:00,755
we're sending you back to the future!

789
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,675
Ok, alright.
Saturday's good. Saturday's good.

790
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:05,468
I can spend a week in 1955.

791
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,303
I can hang out.
You can show me around.

792
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,222
Marty, that is completely out
of the question.

793
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,440
You must not leave this house.

794
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,725
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

795
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,395
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

796
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,730
Do you understand?

797
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,066
Yeah. Sure. Ok.

798
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:21,701
Marty,

799
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,780
have you interacted with anybody
else today, besides me?

800
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,502
Yeah, well, I might've sort
of bumped into my parents.

801
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,328
Great Scott!

802
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,406
Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

803
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,272
Just as I thought,

804
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:41,204
this proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

805
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,884
His head's gone.

806
00:55:44,185 --> 00:55:45,567
It's like it's been erased.

807
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,679
Erased from existence.

808
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,333
They really cleaned this place up.

809
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:58,187
Looks brand-new.

810
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,272
Now remember.

811
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,858
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

812
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:03,192
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

813
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,969
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

814
00:56:05,054 --> 00:56:07,430
That's why your older brother's
disappearing from that photograph.

815
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,717
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you'll be next.

816
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,036
Sounds pretty heavy.
Weight has nothing to do with it.

817
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,522
Which one's your pop?

818
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,424
That's him.

819
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,502
Ok. Ok, you guys.

820
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,382
Very funny.
You guys are being real mature.

821
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,942
Maybe you were adopted.

822
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,970
Ok, real mature, guys.

823
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,047
Ok, pick up my books.

824
00:56:34,048 --> 00:56:34,474
McFly.

825
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:35,884
That's Strickland.

826
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,428
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

827
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,980
Shape up, man.

828
00:56:40,281 --> 00:56:41,464
You're a slacker.

829
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,834
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

830
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,818
No.

831
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,779
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

832
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,238
I don't know, Doc.
Come on.

833
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,567
I guess she felt sorry for him
because her dad hit him with the car.

834
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,212
Hit me with the car.

835
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,997
That's the Florence
Nightingale effect.

836
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,517
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

837
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,552
Go to it, kid.

838
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,422
Hey, George, buddy.

839
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,283
I have been looking all over for you.

840
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,428
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

841
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,680
Yeah.
Good.

842
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,466
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

843
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,272
Lorraine?

844
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,981
Calvin!

845
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,094
I'd like you to meet my good friend
George McFly.

846
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,659
Hi.

847
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,531
It's really a pleasure to meet you.

848
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,741
How's your head?

849
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:35,159
Good. Fine.

850
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:37,120
I've been so worried about you

851
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,080
ever since you ran off the other night.

852
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,049
Are you ok?

853
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:40,623
Yeah.

854
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,126
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

855
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,460
Come on!

856
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,030
Isn't he a dreamboat?

857
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,844
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

858
00:57:53,028 --> 00:57:54,470
This is more serious than I thought.

859
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,524
Apparently, your mother is amorously
infatuated with you, instead of your father.

860
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:00,059
Wait... Wait a minute, Doc.

861
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,629
Are you trying to tell me that my mother
has got the hots for me?

862
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:04,839
Precisely.

863
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,065
This is heavy.

864
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,234
There's that word again. Heavy.

865
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,153
Why are things so heavy in the future?

866
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,221
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?

867
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:12,991
What?

868
00:58:13,016 --> 00:58:16,450
The only way we're going to get those two to
successfully mate is if they're alone together,

869
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,962
so you've got to get your father
and mother to interact,

870
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,330
some... some sort of social...

871
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,908
What? You mean like a date?

872
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:24,818
Right!

873
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,502
What kind of date?
I don't know.

874
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,129
What do kids do in the '50s?

875
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,507
What, they're your parents.
You must know them.

876
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,760
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

877
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,345
Nothing.

878
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,040
Look!

879
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:39,665
There's a rhythmic ceremonial
ritual coming up.

880
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,684
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

881
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,144
They're supposed to go to this.

882
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,062
That's where they kiss for the first time.

883
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,139
Alright, kid.

884
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,107
You stick to your father like glue,

885
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:49,734
and make sure he takes
her to that dance.

886
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,844
George, buddy.

887
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,736
Remember that girl
I introduced you to,

888
00:58:55,037 --> 00:58:56,037
Lorraine?

889
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,206
What are you writing?

890
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:05,691
Stories.

891
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:08,678
Science fiction stories about...

892
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,571
visitors,

893
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:11,890
coming down to Earth,

894
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:13,583
from other planets.

895
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,401
Get out of town!

896
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:19,597
I didn't know you did
anything creative.

897
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,124
Well, let me read some...

898
00:59:21,608 --> 00:59:22,692
No, no, no, no.

899
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,411
I never, I never let
anybody read my stories.

900
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,613
Why not?

901
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,252
Well, what if they didn't like them,
what if they told me I was no good?

902
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,373
I guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand.

903
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:39,820
No.

904
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:41,577
No, not hard at all.

905
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:43,794
So anyway, George.

906
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:45,131
About Lorraine.

907
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,934
She really likes you.

908
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,638
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

909
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:54,090
to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

910
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,241
Really?
Oh, yeah.

911
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,311
All you got to do is go
over there and ask her.

912
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,497
What? Right here, right now
in the cafeteria?

913
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:02,765
What if she said no?

914
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,210
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

915
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,191
Besides,

916
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:11,023
I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

917
01:00:12,759 --> 01:00:13,426
Who?

918
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,345
Biff.

919
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,115
Don't kid around.
Come on.

920
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,449
I'm gonna leave.

921
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,410
You want.
You know you want.

922
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,620
You know you want me
to give it to you.

923
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,290
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

924
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,094
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

925
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,212
Get your meat hooks off of me.

926
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,338
You heard her.

927
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,001
She said, get your meat hooks...

928
01:00:36,902 --> 01:00:37,700
off.

929
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,219
Please.

930
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,589
So what's it to you, butthead?

931
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,767
You know, you been looking for a fight.

932
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:57,861
Since you're new here,

933
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:00,940
I'm going to cut you a break, today.

934
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,438
So, why don't you make like a tree,

935
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:06,329
and get out of here.

936
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,259
George!

937
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,437
Why do you keep following me around?

938
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,080
Look, George.

939
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,582
I'm telling you, George,

940
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,517
if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,

941
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,102
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

942
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,645
But I can't go to the dance.

943
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,857
I'll miss my favorite television
program, Science Fiction Theatre.

944
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,117
Yeah, but, George...

945
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:38,319
Lorraine wants to go with you.

946
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,603
Give her a break.

947
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,748
Look, I'm just not ready,

948
01:01:41,749 --> 01:01:43,783
to ask Lorraine out to the dance,

949
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:45,804
and not you,

950
01:01:45,805 --> 01:01:47,787
or anybody else on this planet,

951
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,656
is going to make me change
my mind.

952
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,056
Science Fiction Theatre.

953
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:31,872
Who are you?

954
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,405
<i>Silence, Earthling.</i>

955
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,326
<i>My name is Darth Vader.</i>

956
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,834
<i>I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.</i>

957
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,020
Marty!

958
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,442
Marty! Marty!

959
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,609
Hey, George, buddy.

960
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,670
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing all day?

961
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:04,469
I overslept.

962
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,073
Look, I need your help.

963
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:07,616
I have to ask Lorraine out,

964
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,784
but I don't know how to do it.

965
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:11,604
Alright. Ok, listen, keep your pants on.
She's over in the cafe.

966
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,831
God!
How do you...

967
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,377
What made you change
your mind, George?

968
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,497
Last night, Darth Vader came down,

969
01:03:20,498 --> 01:03:23,373
from Planet Vulcan and told me that
if I didn't take Lorraine out,

970
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,384
that he'd melt my brain.
Yeah, well...

971
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:28,554
Let's. Let's just keep this brain
melting stuff to ourselves, ok?

972
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,763
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

973
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:30,700
Alright, ok.

974
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:32,141
There she is, George.

975
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,776
Now just go in there and invite her.

976
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,644
Ok. But I don't know what to say.

977
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,812
Just say anything, George.

978
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,098
Say whatever's natural,

979
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:39,841
the first thing that comes
into your mind.

980
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,186
Nothing's coming to my mind.

981
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,279
Jesus, George, it's a wonder
I was even born.

982
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,322
What?
What?

983
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:47,807
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

984
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:49,232
Look,

985
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:52,578
tell her destiny brought you together.

986
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,199
Tell her that she is the most beautiful girl
you have ever seen in the world.

987
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,942
Girls like that stuff.

988
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,719
What are you doing, George?

989
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,795
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

990
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,380
Yeah. Ok. Let's go.

991
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:04,924
Can you take care of that?
Right.

992
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:26,162
Lou, give me a milk.

993
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:28,914
Chocolate.

994
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,213
Lorraine.

995
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:50,586
My density has popped me to you.

996
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,763
What?

997
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,526
What I meant to say...

998
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:57,727
was...

999
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:58,711
Wait a minute.

1000
01:04:58,712 --> 01:05:00,396
Don't I know you from somewhere?

1001
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,314
Yes.

1002
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,932
Yes. I'm George.

1003
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,752
George McFly.

1004
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:08,746
I'm your density.

1005
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:10,948
I mean...

1006
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,776
your destiny.

1007
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,297
Hey, McFly.

1008
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:21,398
Geez...

1009
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,038
I thought I told you never
to come in here.

1010
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,751
Well, it's going to cost you.

1011
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,378
How much money you got on you?

1012
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:33,079
Well...

1013
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,039
How much do you want, Biff?

1014
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,041
Alright, punk.

1015
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:46,325
Now I'm going...

1016
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,777
Biff. What's that?

1017
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:55,985
Calvin Klein.

1018
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,937
Oh, my God, he's a dream.

1019
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,123
Kid! Kid! Stop! Stop!

1020
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,374
Hey!

1021
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:05,628
I'll get it back to you, alright?

1022
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,380
You broke it!

1023
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:09,798
Come back here!

1024
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,761
Look at him go!

1025
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,639
Get him!

1026
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,904
To the car! Go! Go!

1027
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:39,953
What's that thing he's on?

1028
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:41,497
It's a board with wheels.

1029
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,165
He's an absolute dream.

1030
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,458
Come on, come on!

1031
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,085
Look out for the car!

1032
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:20,445
I'm going to ram him.

1033
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:29,795
Shit!

1034
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,239
Thanks a lot, kid.

1035
01:07:57,866 --> 01:07:59,784
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

1036
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,410
Where does he come from?

1037
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,870
Yeah, where does he live?

1038
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,317
I don't know,

1039
01:08:06,018 --> 01:08:07,366
but I'm going to find out.

1040
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,840
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1041
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,387
<i>They found me.</i>

1042
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:18,243
<i>I don't know how,
but they found me.</i>

1043
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,695
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

1044
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:25,885
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1045
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:27,987
<i>They found me.</i>

1046
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:29,597
<i>I don't know how,
but they found me.</i>

1047
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,356
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

1048
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,650
Doc?

1049
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:35,484
Hi, Marty.

1050
01:08:35,785 --> 01:08:37,046
I didn't hear you come in.

1051
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,680
Fascinating device,

1052
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:41,149
this video unit.

1053
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,019
Listen, Doc.

1054
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,213
You know, there is something I haven't told you
about the night we made that tape.

1055
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:47,331
Please, Marty, don't tell me.

1056
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,707
No man should know too much
about his own destiny.

1057
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,167
You don't understand.
I do understand.

1058
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,460
If I know too much about
my own future,

1059
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,861
I can endanger my own existence.

1060
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,680
Just as you've endangered yours.

1061
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,959
You're right.
Now...

1062
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:02,121
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

1063
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,056
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

1064
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,475
I didn't have time to build
it to scale or paint it.

1065
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,177
It's good.
Thank you. Thank you.

1066
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:10,779
Ok, now.

1067
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:15,192
We run some industrial strength electrical
cable from the top of the clock tower,

1068
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:18,270
down suspending it over the street
between these two lamp posts.

1069
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:23,200
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook,

1070
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:26,245
which runs directly into
the flux capacitor.

1071
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,834
At the calculated moment,

1072
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:30,568
you start off,

1073
01:09:30,593 --> 01:09:35,571
from down the street, driving directly toward
the cable accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

1074
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,883
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m this Saturday night,

1075
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:43,595
lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable,

1076
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,931
just as the connecting hook makes contact

1077
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,643
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

1078
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,187
and sending you back to 1985.

1079
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:53,259
Alright, now.

1080
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,314
Watch this.

1081
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,016
You wind up the car and release it.

1082
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,620
I'll simulate the lightning.

1083
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,621
Ready.

1084
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,549
Set.

1085
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:26,722
Release.

1086
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,534
You're instilling me with
a lot of confidence, Doc.

1087
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:48,994
Don't worry.
I'll take care of the lightning.

1088
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,963
You take care of your pop.

1089
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,534
By the way, what happened today?
Did he ask her out?

1090
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,044
I think so.

1091
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,170
What did she say?

1092
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,597
It's your mom!
She's tracked you down!

1093
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,533
Quick!
Let's cover the time machine.

1094
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,740
Hi, Cal...
Marty.

1095
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,559
Mom.
Lorraine.

1096
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,112
How did you know I was here?

1097
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:34,473
I followed you.

1098
01:11:36,408 --> 01:11:37,809
This is my doc...

1099
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:38,763
My uncle.

1100
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:41,279
Doc Brown.

1101
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,265
Hi.
Hi.

1102
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:47,541
Marty listen,

1103
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:49,921
this may seem a little forward,

1104
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:51,998
but I was kind of wondering if you...

1105
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:55,150
if, if you'd ask me to the...

1106
01:11:55,451 --> 01:11:58,330
Enchantment Under
the Sea dance on Saturday.

1107
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,016
You mean...

1108
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:03,911
You mean nobody's asked you?

1109
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:05,935
No.

1110
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:08,064
Not yet.

1111
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,018
What about?
What about George?

1112
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,995
George McFly?

1113
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,543
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

1114
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,467
Well,

1115
01:12:21,968 --> 01:12:24,848
I think a man should be strong,

1116
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,419
so he can stand up for himself,

1117
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,414
and protect the woman he loves.

1118
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:37,803
Don't you?

1119
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,605
Yeah.

1120
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,150
I still don't understand.

1121
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,319
How am I supposed to go
to the dance with her,

1122
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,756
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1123
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,308
Well because George,
she wants to go with you.

1124
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,710
She just doesn't know it yet.

1125
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:57,039
That's why we got to show her that you,
George McFly, are a fighter.

1126
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,041
You're somebody who's
gonna stand up for yourself,

1127
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,584
somebody who's gonna protect her.

1128
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,379
Yeah, but I've never picked
a fight in my entire life.

1129
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,115
Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight, Dad.

1130
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,609
Dad. Dad. Daddy-o.

1131
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,086
You're coming to her rescue, right?

1132
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:12,637
Ok, let's go over the plan again.

1133
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,473
8:55, where are you going to be?

1134
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,141
I'm going to be at the dance.

1135
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,267
Right.
And where am I going to be?

1136
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:19,452
You're gonna be in the car with her.

1137
01:13:19,537 --> 01:13:20,896
Right, ok.
So, right around 9:00,

1138
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,397
she's going to get very
angry with me.

1139
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,400
Why is she going
to get angry with you?

1140
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,319
Well because George,
nice girls get angry

1141
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,654
when guys take advantage of them.

1142
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,909
You mean you're going
to go touch her on her...

1143
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,446
No. No, George.

1144
01:13:35,947 --> 01:13:36,647
Look.

1145
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,247
It's just an act, right?

1146
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,143
Ok. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

1147
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,671
You see us struggling in the car.

1148
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,312
You walk up,

1149
01:13:48,313 --> 01:13:50,058
you open the door and you say...

1150
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,537
Your line, George.

1151
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:59,601
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

1152
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,271
You really think I ought to swear?

1153
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,966
Yes, definitely.
God damn it, George, swear.

1154
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,553
Ok. So now.

1155
01:14:07,554 --> 01:14:08,251
You come up.

1156
01:14:08,336 --> 01:14:09,361
You punch me in the stomach.

1157
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,238
I'm out for the count, right?

1158
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:14,533
And you and Lorraine live
happily ever after.

1159
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,827
You make it sound so easy.

1160
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,371
I just...
I wish I wasn't so scared.

1161
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,705
George, there is nothing to be scared of.

1162
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,533
All it takes is a little self-confidence.

1163
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,828
You know, if you put your mind to it,

1164
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:27,671
you can accomplish anything.

1165
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,509
<i>Hill Valley area weather
this Saturday night.</i>

1166
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,295
<i>Mostly clear,
with some scattered clouds.</i>

1167
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,389
<i>Lows tonight in the upper 40s.</i>

1168
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,091
Are you sure about this storm?

1169
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,377
Since when can weathermen
predict the weather,

1170
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,696
let alone the future?

1171
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,166
You know, Marty, I'm going
to be very sad to see you go.

1172
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,859
You've really made
a difference in my life.

1173
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,569
You've given me something
to shoot for.

1174
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:55,123
Just knowing, that I'm going
to be around to see 1985.

1175
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,225
That I'm going to succeed in this!

1176
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,854
That I'm going to have a chance
to travel through time!

1177
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,087
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

1178
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:11,132
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

1179
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,801
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

1180
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,471
I'm really going to miss you.

1181
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,518
Doc, about the future...

1182
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:24,903
No!

1183
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,089
Marty!

1184
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:30,609
We've already agreed that having information
about the future can be extremely dangerous.

1185
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,194
Even if your intentions are good,

1186
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,937
it can backfire drastically.

1187
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,698
Whatever you've got to tell me,

1188
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,268
I'll find out through the
natural course of time.

1189
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,171
Dear Dr. Brown.

1190
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,482
On the night that I go back in time,

1191
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,593
you will be...

1192
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,171
shot by terrorists.

1193
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,758
Please take whatever
precautions are necessary

1194
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,702
to prevent this terrible disaster.

1195
01:15:58,721 --> 01:15:59,730
Your friend,

1196
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:02,474
Marty.

1197
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,542
Evening, Dr. Brown.

1198
01:16:13,743 --> 01:16:15,011
What's with the wire?

1199
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:16,599
Oh, just...

1200
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,114
a little weather experiment.

1201
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:20,951
What you got under here?

1202
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,035
No!
Don't touch that!

1203
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,213
Some new, specialized
weather sensing equipment.

1204
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,707
You got a permit for that?

1205
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,683
Of course I do.

1206
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,377
Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

1207
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,711
Do you mind if we...

1208
01:17:33,812 --> 01:17:36,000
park for a while?

1209
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,212
That's a great idea.
I'd love to park.

1210
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,991
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

1211
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,993
It's not like I've never parked before.

1212
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:46,786
What?

1213
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,123
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

1214
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:51,417
No, no, no.

1215
01:17:52,718 --> 01:17:53,302
No.

1216
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:00,576
Lorraine!
Lorraine, what are you doing?

1217
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,970
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

1218
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:05,473
Yeah, well,

1219
01:18:05,774 --> 01:18:06,973
you shouldn't drink.

1220
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:08,842
Why not?
Because you...

1221
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,319
You might regret it,

1222
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,945
later in life.

1223
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,407
Marty, don't be such a square.

1224
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,609
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

1225
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,316
Jeez, you smoke, too?

1226
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,395
Marty, you're beginning
to sound just like my mother.

1227
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,549
<i>We're going to take a little break,</i>

1228
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,334
<i>but we'll be back in a while s,</i>

1229
01:18:43,335 --> 01:18:45,404
<i>don't nobody go nowhere.</i>

1230
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:03,259
Marty?

1231
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,490
Why are you so nervous?

1232
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,742
Lorraine.

1233
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,206
Have you ever...

1234
01:19:12,131 --> 01:19:15,665
been in a situation where you knew
you had to act a certain way but when you

1235
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:18,670
got there, you didn't know if
you could go through with it?

1236
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,015
You mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

1237
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,850
Sort of.

1238
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,112
I think, I know exactly
what you mean.

1239
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,347
You do?

1240
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:32,167
You know what I do
in those situations?

1241
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:33,852
What?

1242
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,103
I don't worry.

1243
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,419
This is all wrong.

1244
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,949
I don't know what it is.

1245
01:19:58,419 --> 01:19:59,669
But when I kiss you,

1246
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,880
it's like I'm kissing...

1247
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:04,749
my brother.

1248
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:07,752
I guess that doesn't make
any sense, does it?

1249
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,140
Believe me.

1250
01:20:10,465 --> 01:20:12,065
It makes perfect sense.

1251
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:15,585
Somebody's coming.

1252
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:23,318
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car you son of a bitch.

1253
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,799
And I'm going to take it out of your ass.

1254
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,800
Hold him.

1255
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,033
Let him go, Biff.
You're drunk.

1256
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,528
Well, look-ey what we have here.

1257
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:37,786
No, no!

1258
01:20:37,787 --> 01:20:39,451
You're staying right here with me.

1259
01:20:39,676 --> 01:20:41,377
Come on, Lorraine.
Let me go!

1260
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:42,712
Leave her alone, you bastard!

1261
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,631
Take him in back, alright?
I'll be right there.

1262
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,547
Just admit that you want it.

1263
01:20:46,948 --> 01:20:47,600
Come on.

1264
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,078
Well, go on.
This ain't no peep show.

1265
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,061
Hey, let's put him in there.

1266
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,145
Yeah!

1267
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,774
That's for messing up my hair.

1268
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,243
What the hell are you doing
to my car?

1269
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,887
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1270
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,959
Who you calling spook, peckerwood?

1271
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,087
Hey, hey, listen guys...

1272
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,657
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, ok?

1273
01:21:18,658 --> 01:21:19,975
Get home to your mama, boy.

1274
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,043
Biff!

1275
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,211
Hurry, Biff!

1276
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,188
Let me out of here!

1277
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,883
Reginald, where are your keys?

1278
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,535
The keys are in the trunk.

1279
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:32,620
Say that again?

1280
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,639
I said, the keys are in here.

1281
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:49,654
Come on!

1282
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,492
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...

1283
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:59,531
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1284
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,668
George, help me!
Please!

1285
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,529
Just turn around, McFly,
and walk away.

1286
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:08,673
Please, George.

1287
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:09,841
Are you deaf, McFly?

1288
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,010
Close the door and beat it.

1289
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:18,182
No, Biff.
You leave her alone.

1290
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,227
Alright, McFly.

1291
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,577
You're asking for it,

1292
01:22:26,078 --> 01:22:27,509
and now you're going to get it.

1293
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:30,486
Biff, stop it!

1294
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,081
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1295
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:36,334
Biff, no!

1296
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,562
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1297
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,891
Damn it, man!
I sliced my hand!

1298
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,834
Whose are these?
Mine.

1299
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,336
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1300
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,748
You're going to break his arm!

1301
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:51,392
Biff!

1302
01:22:51,793 --> 01:22:53,843
Biff, leave him alone!

1303
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,787
Let him go!
Let him go!

1304
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,930
Are you ok?

1305
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:52,828
Who is that guy?

1306
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:54,821
That's George McFly.

1307
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,502
That's George McFly?

1308
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:02,078
Excuse me.

1309
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,441
The storm.

1310
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,512
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

1311
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,013
Hey, man.
Look at Marvin's hand.

1312
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,433
He can't play with his hand like that,
and we can't play without him.

1313
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,777
Yeah, well.
Look, Marvin, you got to play.

1314
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,229
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor.

1315
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,022
And if there is no music,
they can't dance.

1316
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,399
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

1317
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,560
If they can't kiss,
they can't fall in love and I'm history.

1318
01:24:33,561 --> 01:24:35,022
Hey man, the dance is over,

1319
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:37,739
unless you know somebody else
that can play the guitar.

1320
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:47,640
<i>This is for all you lovers out there.</i>

1321
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,431
George, aren't you going to kiss me?

1322
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,016
I don't know.

1323
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,936
Scram, McFly.
I'm cutting in.

1324
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:24,194
Hey, boy, you alright?

1325
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:26,779
I can't play.

1326
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,247
George!

1327
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:46,774
George!

1328
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,560
George.

1329
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,023
Excuse me.

1330
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:45,032
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

1331
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,034
No.
I got to go.

1332
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,321
Come on, man.
Let's do something that really cooks.

1333
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,499
Something that cooks.

1334
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:00,022
Alright.

1335
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:06,087
<i>Alright.</i>

1336
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:10,725
<i>Alright, this is an oldie, but...</i>

1337
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:16,105
<i>Well, it's an oldie where I come from.</i>

1338
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,401
Alright, guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B.

1339
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:23,329
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, ok?

1340
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:08,991
Hey, George, I heard you laid out Biff.
Nice going.

1341
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:11,369
George, you ever think of running
for class president?

1342
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,309
Chuck!
Chuck, it's Marvin.

1343
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,779
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

1344
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,815
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

1345
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,775
Well, listen to this.

1346
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,406
<i>I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.</i>

1347
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,267
<i>But your kids are going to love it.</i>

1348
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:03,598
Lorraine.

1349
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,167
Marty, that was
very interesting music.

1350
01:30:07,451 --> 01:30:08,435
Yeah.

1351
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:10,237
I hope you don't mind,

1352
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,364
but George asked
if he could take me home.

1353
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:15,534
Great! Great! Good.
Good, Lorraine.

1354
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,036
I had a feeling about you two.

1355
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:18,955
I have a feeling, too.

1356
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,107
Listen, I got to go,

1357
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,620
but I wanted to tell you
that it's been...

1358
01:30:24,821 --> 01:30:25,903
educational.

1359
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,707
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1360
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:31,826
I guarantee it.

1361
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,058
Well Marty,

1362
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:35,729
I want to thank you
for all your good advice so...

1363
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:37,548
I'll never forget it.

1364
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:39,842
Right, George.

1365
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,540
Well...

1366
01:30:43,641 --> 01:30:45,122
good luck you guys.

1367
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:50,205
One other thing.

1368
01:30:50,906 --> 01:30:52,847
If you guys ever have kids,

1369
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,449
and one of them,
when he's eight years old,

1370
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:58,536
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

1371
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,097
go easy on him.

1372
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:03,499
Ok.

1373
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,830
Marty.

1374
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:11,607
Such a nice name.

1375
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,098
Damn!
Where is that kid?

1376
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:23,861
Damn!

1377
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:27,598
Damn! Damn!

1378
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,759
You're late!

1379
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,617
Do you have no concept of time?

1380
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:41,078
Hey, come on.
I had to change.

1381
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:43,781
Do you think I'm going back
in that zoot suit?

1382
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,834
The old man really came through.
It worked.

1383
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,803
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1384
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,171
I didn't know he had it in him.

1385
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:52,165
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1386
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:55,910
Never?

1387
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,845
No. Why?
What's the matter?

1388
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,077
Alright!

1389
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:02,641
Let's set your destination time.

1390
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:09,732
This is the exact time you left.

1391
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:13,569
Let's send you back at exactly
the same time.

1392
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,157
It'll be like you never left.

1393
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,313
Now,

1394
01:32:21,514 --> 01:32:24,830
I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1395
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:26,490
That's where you'll start from.

1396
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,210
I've calculated the precise distance,

1397
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,962
taking into account
the acceleration speed,

1398
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,797
and wind resistance retroactive

1399
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,208
from the moment the lightning strikes,

1400
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:41,096
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1401
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,849
When this alarm goes off,
you hit the gas.

1402
01:32:43,934 --> 01:32:44,934
Right.

1403
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,066
Well...

1404
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:54,860
I guess that's everything.

1405
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:00,132
Thanks.

1406
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:01,725
Thank you.

1407
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,758
See you in about 30 years.

1408
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:11,802
I hope so.

1409
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,014
Don't worry!

1410
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,591
As long as you hit that wire

1411
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,761
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour,

1412
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,447
the instant the lightning strikes
the tower...

1413
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:27,434
everything will be fine.

1414
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:28,486
Right.

1415
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,130
What's the meaning of this?

1416
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,282
You'll find out in 30 years.

1417
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,450
It's about the future, isn't it?

1418
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:46,145
It's information about the future.
Wait a minute.

1419
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,247
I warned you about this, kid.

1420
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:51,166
The consequences could be disastrous!

1421
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,669
Doc, that's a risk you're
going to have to take.

1422
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,421
Your life depends on it!

1423
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:56,588
No!

1424
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,384
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1425
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,678
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.

1426
01:34:07,434 --> 01:34:08,751
Great Scott!

1427
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:19,820
You get the cable,
I'll throw the rope down to you.

1428
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,397
Right!
I got it!

1429
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:56,949
Doc!

1430
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,367
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

1431
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:07,447
Alright!

1432
01:35:07,848 --> 01:35:08,919
Take it up!

1433
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,057
Go!

1434
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:21,407
Doc!

1435
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:22,791
What?

1436
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:26,136
I have to tell you about the future.

1437
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:27,388
What?

1438
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:30,724
I have to tell you about the future!

1439
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:31,842
What?

1440
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:36,964
On the night I go back in time, you get...

1441
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:41,519
Doc!

1442
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:51,987
Go!

1443
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,164
No, Doc!

1444
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:55,582
Look at the time!

1445
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,709
You've got less than four minutes.

1446
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:59,470
Please, hurry!

1447
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:12,399
Yeah!

1448
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,614
Damn it, Doc!
Why did you have to tear up that letter?

1449
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:10,558
If I only had more time.

1450
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:15,237
Wait a minute.

1451
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:17,471
I got all the time I want.
I got a time machine.

1452
01:37:17,472 --> 01:37:19,909
I can just go back early and warn him.

1453
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:21,107
Ok.

1454
01:37:21,108 --> 01:37:22,436
Ten minutes ought to do it.

1455
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,595
Ok. Time circuit's on.

1456
01:37:26,596 --> 01:37:29,676
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1457
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:31,286
Engine running.

1458
01:37:31,287 --> 01:37:32,262
Alright.

1459
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,100
No. No, no.

1460
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:40,854
Come on. Not this time.
Come on. Come on.

1461
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:52,301
Come on.

1462
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:55,848
Here we go. Here we go.

1463
01:38:55,849 --> 01:38:57,206
This time. Come on.

1464
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,477
Please. Please.
Come on!

1465
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:40,926
Doc.

1466
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,866
Crazy drunk driver.

1467
01:42:34,307 --> 01:42:35,108
Alright.

1468
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:37,259
Fred.

1469
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:39,977
You look great.

1470
01:42:40,278 --> 01:42:41,655
Everything looks great.

1471
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,173
1:24.

1472
01:42:44,174 --> 01:42:46,010
I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

1473
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:51,345
No!

1474
01:42:51,646 --> 01:42:52,911
No, not again!

1475
01:42:52,912 --> 01:42:55,135
Come on! Come on!

1476
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,133
Libyans.

1477
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:34,124
No!

1478
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:36,860
You bastard!

1479
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:51,308
Go!

1480
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,136
Doc! Doc!

1481
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,769
No! No!

1482
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:51,902
You're alive.

1483
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,046
Bulletproof vest?

1484
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:05,649
How did you know?

1485
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:09,260
I never got a chance to tell you.

1486
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:24,659
What about all that talk...

1487
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,761
about screwing up future events?

1488
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:28,830
The space-time continuum?

1489
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:31,371
Well, I figured...

1490
01:45:31,372 --> 01:45:32,409
what the hell?

1491
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:44,187
So, how far ahead are you going?

1492
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:46,033
About 30 years.

1493
01:45:46,634 --> 01:45:47,774
It's a nice round number.

1494
01:45:47,858 --> 01:45:49,394
Look me up when you get there, alright?

1495
01:45:49,995 --> 01:45:52,120
Guess I'll be about 47.

1496
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:53,355
I will.

1497
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:54,990
Take care.

1498
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:57,150
You too.

1499
01:45:57,435 --> 01:45:58,090
Right.

1500
01:45:58,591 --> 01:45:59,469
Bye-bye, Einie.

1501
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:03,073
And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1502
01:46:03,983 --> 01:46:04,983
You bet.

1503
01:47:10,157 --> 01:47:11,483
What a nightmare.

1504
01:47:23,229 --> 01:47:26,189
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

1505
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:28,358
Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

1506
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:29,984
second of all, somebody named Greg

1507
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:31,945
or Craig called you just a little while ago.

1508
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,613
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

1509
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,207
I don't know!
I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

1510
01:47:36,492 --> 01:47:37,492
Hey.

1511
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:39,970
What the hell is this?

1512
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:42,122
Breakfast.

1513
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,425
Did you sleep in your clothes
again last night?

1514
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:46,309
Yeah. I...

1515
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:49,388
Yeah. What are...
What are you wearing Dave?

1516
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:51,197
Marty,

1517
01:47:51,898 --> 01:47:53,516
I always wear a suit to the office.

1518
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:55,843
You alright?

1519
01:47:55,844 --> 01:47:56,761
Yeah.

1520
01:47:57,555 --> 01:47:58,638
I think we need a rematch, George.

1521
01:47:58,722 --> 01:47:59,764
A rematch?

1522
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:00,890
Why?
Were you cheating?

1523
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:01,675
No.

1524
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:03,435
Hello.
Good morning.

1525
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:07,422
Mom! Dad!

1526
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,482
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you alright?

1527
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:11,684
You guys, you guys look great.

1528
01:48:11,685 --> 01:48:13,570
Mom, you look so thin.

1529
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:15,044
Thank you, Marty.

1530
01:48:15,545 --> 01:48:16,647
George!

1531
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,293
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1532
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,946
Good morning, Dave.
Good morning, Mom.

1533
01:48:22,947 --> 01:48:23,730
Linda.

1534
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:26,332
Oh Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1535
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:30,044
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

1536
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:32,589
Isn't tonight the night
of the big date?

1537
01:48:32,673 --> 01:48:34,232
What? What, Ma?

1538
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:36,092
Aren't you going up 
to the lake tonight?

1539
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:38,245
You've been planning it
for two weeks.

1540
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:41,498
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1541
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:42,807
The car's wrecked.

1542
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:43,273
Wrecked?

1543
01:48:43,574 --> 01:48:44,475
Wrecked?

1544
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,685
When did this happen?
Why wasn't I told?

1545
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:46,769
Quiet down.

1546
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:48,354
I'm sure the car is fine.

1547
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:50,690
Why am I always the last
one to know about these things?

1548
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,260
See? There's Biff out there
waxing it right now.

1549
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:55,695
Now Biff, I want to make sure that

1550
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,515
we get two coats of wax this time,
not just one.

1551
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:00,283
I'm just finishing up 
the second coat now.

1552
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,752
Now Biff, don't con me.

1553
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,397
I'm. I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1554
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:09,367
I meant I was just,
just starting on the second coat.

1555
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:12,255
Biff. What a character.

1556
01:49:12,556 --> 01:49:14,789
Always trying to get away
with something.

1557
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,351
I've had to stay on top of Biff
ever since high school.

1558
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:20,220
Although, if it wasn't for him...

1559
01:49:20,304 --> 01:49:21,888
We never would have fallen in love.

1560
01:49:22,172 --> 01:49:23,231
That's right.

1561
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:25,190
Mr. McFly!

1562
01:49:25,191 --> 01:49:26,684
Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1563
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:28,662
Oh, hi, Marty.
I think it's your new book.

1564
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:32,768
Honey.

1565
01:49:33,069 --> 01:49:34,885
Your first novel.

1566
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,111
Like I've always told you,

1567
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:40,014
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

1568
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:41,062
Oh, Marty.

1569
01:49:41,463 --> 01:49:42,500
Marty here's your keys.

1570
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:44,477
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1571
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:46,162
Keys?

1572
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,205
How about a ride, mister?

1573
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,415
Jennifer.

1574
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:08,503
Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes!

1575
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:10,328
Let me look at you.

1576
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:13,632
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1577
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:15,333
I haven't.

1578
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:17,370
You ok?

1579
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:19,495
Is everything alright?

1580
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:23,892
Oh, yeah.

1581
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:27,496
Everything is great.

1582
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:43,119
Marty!

1583
01:50:44,497 --> 01:50:45,997
You've got to come back with me!

1584
01:50:47,266 --> 01:50:48,274
Where?

1585
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:49,726
Back to the future.

1586
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:55,882
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

1587
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,568
I need fuel.

1588
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:03,849
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

1589
01:51:04,533 --> 01:51:06,576
No, no.
Doc, I just got here, ok?

1590
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,661
Jennifer's here.
We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

1591
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:09,798
Well, bring her along.

1592
01:51:10,723 --> 01:51:12,023
This concerns her, too.

1593
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,666
Wait a minute, Doc.
What are you talking about?

1594
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:15,793
What happens to us in the future?

1595
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,628
Do we become assholes or something?

1596
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:18,838
No, no, no, no, Marty.

1597
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:20,673
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

1598
01:51:20,758 --> 01:51:22,216
It's your kids, Marty.

1599
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,152
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1600
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:34,020
Hey, Doc, we better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1601
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:34,795
Roads?

1602
01:51:35,096 --> 01:51:37,774
Where we're going, we don't need roads.

1603
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:50,875
