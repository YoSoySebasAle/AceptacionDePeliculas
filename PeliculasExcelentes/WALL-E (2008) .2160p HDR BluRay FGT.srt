No. John.

192
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,339
Bye, WALL-E.

193
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,223
"A" is for Axiom,
your home sweet home.

"B" is for Buy N Large,
your very best friend.

195

Time for lunch in a cup.

196
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,531
Feel beautiful.

197
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,200
- It's the new you. Stunning.
- You look great.

198
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,785
- I know, honey. Men.
- Men.

199
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,871
Attention, Axiom shoppers.
Try blue.

200
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,623
It's the new red.

201
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,124
Ooh!

202
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,920
Love blue.

203
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:49,923
Date?

204
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,257
Don't get me started
on the date.

205
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,969
Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

206
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,891
If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

207
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,810
There are no good men out there.

208
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,063
I know. I know because I've ...

00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,189

Honestly, it's the one thing
I get to do on this ship.

240
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,882
Well, good morning, everybody,

241
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:06,638
and welcome to day 255,642
aboard the Axiom.

242
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,934
As always, the weather is a balmy
72 degrees and sunny and ...

243
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:15,522
I see the ship's log is showing
that today is our 700th anniversary

244
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,107
of our five-year cruise.

245
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,736
Well, I'm sure our forefathers would
be proud to know that 700 years later

246
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,532
we'd be doing the exact same thing
they were doing.

247
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,700
Fore!

248
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,328

00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,501
Wow, look at that!

251
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,585
Also today we have a ...

252
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,174
Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?

253
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:46,302
Captain, Probe One

00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:08,366

259
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,173
Greetings and congratulations,
Captain.

260
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,424
If you are seeing this,

261
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,094
that means your
Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,

262
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,556
or EVE probe, has returned from Earth

263
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,935
with a confirmed specimen
of ongoing photosynthesis.

264
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,814
That's right. It means it's time
to go back home.

265
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,817
Home? We're going back?

266
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,404
Now that Earth has been restored
to a life-sustaining status,

267
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:50,075
by golly,
we can begin "Operation Re-colonize".

268
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,461
Simply follow
this manual's instructions

269
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,756
to place the plant
in your ship's holo-detector

270
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,761
and the Axiom will immediately
navigate your return to Earth.

271
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,513
It's that easy.

272
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,391
Now, due to the effects of microgravity,

273
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,060
you and your passengers
may have suffered some

274
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:18,603
slight bone loss.

275
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,608
But I'm sure a few laps
around the ship's jogging track

276
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,777
will get you back in shape in no time.

277
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,903
We have a jogging track?

278
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,780
If you have any further questions,

279
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,825
just consult your operation manual.

280
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,035

282

Ooh.

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,080
- Where's the thingy?
- Plant.

296
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,457
Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?

297
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,085
Maybe we missed a step.

Why don't you

303
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,942
Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.

304
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:33,780
- So then, we're not going to Earth?
- Negative.

305
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,157
I guess things go back to normal?

306
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,076
Correct, Captain.

307
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,286
- Well, false alarm!
- False alarm.

308
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,249
The probe must be defective.

309
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:48,003

310
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,548

319
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:34,382

and surrounds its landmasses.

Hey. I know that guy. It's, WALL-E.

would take place.

These are called "farms".

Message received

Caution. Rogue robots.

554
01:16:55,196 --> 01:16:57,530
Caution. Rogue robots.

555
01:16:58,741 --> 01:17:01,076
- Not possible.
- Caution. Rogue robots.

556
01:17:12,922 --> 01:17:14,714
Auto! Auto!

557
01:17:14,799 --> 01:17:16,675
Mutiny. Mutiny.

558
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:19,761
Stupid wheel.

559
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:22,097
Caution. Rogue robots.

560
01:17:22,473 --> 01:17:27,185
Caution. Rogue robots.

561
01:17:27,269 --> 01:17:28,228
The plant!

562
01:17:32,483 --> 01:17:34,484
We'll see who's powerless now.

563
01:17:40,449 --> 01:17:42,951
Testing, testing.
Is this thing on?

564
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:48,456
This is the captain.
I am locked in my room.

565
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:52,085
EVE, WALL-E,
bring the plant to the "Lido Deck".

566
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,547
I'll have activated the holo-detector.
Now, hurry.

567
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:58,383
- Auto's probably going to cut me off ...
- Halt.

568
01:18:01,637 --> 01:18:02,804
Halt.

569
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,389
My.

570
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:07,058
Clear.

571
01:18:12,106 --> 01:18:13,148
Halt, halt.

572
01:18:21,782 --> 01:18:24,159
- Look what I got, Auto.
- Not possible.

573
01:18:24,243 --> 01:18:27,787
That's right. The plant.

574
01:18:27,872 --> 01:18:30,665
You want it? Come and get it, blinky.

575
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:32,584
No.

576
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,341
Captain? Captain?

577
01:18:43,304 --> 01:18:44,512
Let go.

578
01:18:45,348 --> 01:18:47,474
- Let go.
- Too heavy for you?

579
01:18:50,019 --> 01:18:50,977
Get off.

580
01:18:51,062 --> 01:18:52,771
You're not getting away
from me, one-eye.

581
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:54,814
- Get off.
- Is that all you got?

582
01:19:08,996 --> 01:19:10,080
Halt.

583
01:19:13,876 --> 01:19:15,627
- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

584
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,671
- Not good.
- Got you.

585
01:19:43,114 --> 01:19:44,406
Whoa!

586
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:57,419
Remain calm. Remain calm.

587
01:20:07,888 --> 01:20:10,974
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

588
01:20:11,058 --> 01:20:14,728
We're having a slight malfunction
with the autopilot.

589
01:20:15,563 --> 01:20:16,521
Please remain calm.

590
01:20:24,447 --> 01:20:25,613
Enough.

591
01:20:31,245 --> 01:20:32,829
Hey. What? John?

592
01:20:33,247 --> 01:20:34,706
Whoa!

593
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,641
No! No, no, no!

594
01:20:59,732 --> 01:21:01,024
I gotcha!

595
01:21:04,612 --> 01:21:07,030
John, get ready to have some kids!

596
01:21:21,253 --> 01:21:22,337
Look out!

597
01:21:41,691 --> 01:21:42,691
No.

No.

605
01:23:05,024 --> 01:23:07,984

606
01:23:17,036 --> 01:23:18,119
