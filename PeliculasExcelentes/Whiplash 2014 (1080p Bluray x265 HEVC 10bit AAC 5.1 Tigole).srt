1
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,941
No. Stay.

3
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,821
What's your name?

4
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,490
Andrew Neiman, sir.

5
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:55,253
What year are you?

6
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,376
I'm first year.

7
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:00,731
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,679
So you know I'm looking for players.

9
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:05,966
Yes, sir.

10
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,122
Then why did you stop playing?

11
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:29,375
Did I ask you to start playing?

12
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,260
- Sorry, I...
- I asked why you stopped playing...

13
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,450
...and your answer was to turn
into a wind-up monkey.

14
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,445
- Sorry, I thought...
- Show me your rudiments.

15
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:40,206
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:47,756
Double-time swing.

17
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,873
No, double-time. Double it.

18
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:56,116
Faster. Faster.

19
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,049
Oopsy-daisy.

20
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:18,087
Forgot my jacket.

21
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,646
- No Swedish Fish?
- No, not today.

22
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,249
Thanks.

23
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,310
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,427
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
He saw me play today.

25
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,383
And?

26
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,776
Well, you got plenty of options still.

27
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:17,008
- What does that mean?
- Just...

28
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,011
- Other options?
- Just, you know...

29
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,445
It's just life.

30
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,920
Listen, when you get to be my age,
you get perspective.

31
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:28,719
I don't want perspective.

32
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,198
Sorry.

33
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:37,350
All right.

34
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:41,063
I don't want the Raisinets.

35
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:43,868
Why didn't you say that?

36
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:46,224
I just eat around them.

37
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:50,896
I don't understand you.

38
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:28,696
Bye. I'll see you later. Bye.

39
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:39,886
My man, Ry. Oh, shit.

40
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:41,604
How you feeling, man?

41
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,607
It's been too long. Been too long.

42
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:46,083
Things were hurting
with Neiman on the kits.

43
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,321
Come on, man.

44
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,475
- What?
- He's fine.

45
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,151
- If you say so. Good seeing you.
- Yeah.

46
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,514
Yo, looking good.

47
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,352
- Hey.
- What's up?

48
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:58,227
- Good weekend?
- Yeah, real good.

49
00:07:58,423 --> 00:07:59,787
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Lot of fun.

50
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:01,107
Nice.

51
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,621
Hey, don't worry about Greg.
Kid's a dick.

52
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:08,335
- No big deal.
- Good morning, everybody.

53
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,500
Good morning, everybody.

54
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,212
- Good morning.
- All right.

55
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:18,852
Let's do "Billy Zane" from the top, yes?
Yes?

56
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,208
- How's that? Good?
- Little right.

57
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,320
- One, two, three...
- Okay.

58
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:37,551
Wait.

59
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,982
All right, let's do reeds, yeah?

60
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,788
- Three.
- Yo, Ryan.

61
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,340
Watch it.

62
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,464
Yeah.

63
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,621
Accent, yeah...

64
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:58,328
- Not today.
- Big on the bottom. Put some sugar on it.

65
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,207
You embarrass yourself
like what's-his-face.

66
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,604
That was truly pathetic.

67
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,074
Short-.

68
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,900
All right. All right.

69
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:47,097
That's enough of that. Just back
to the core drums, please.

70
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:50,138
Core players, let's go.

71
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,808
Dude,
what have you been practising?

72
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,560
May I?

73
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:18,994
Cute.

74
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,941
Down the line.
Trumpets, bars seven and eight.

75
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,861
Three, four.

76
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,664
Three, four.

77
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:30,540
Okay. All right.

78
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,368
Trombone, bar 24. The end of two.

79
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:35,613
Maybe not.

80
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:38,244
Tenor, let's start the pickup to 11.

81
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,205
Three, four.

82
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:45,326
Same spot. Three, four.

83
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:47,160
Okay. All right.

84
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:50,793
You're in the first chair.
Let's see if it's because you're cute.

85
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,831
Three, four.

86
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,790
Yep. That's why.

87
00:11:54,986 --> 00:12:00,226
Drums.
Let's hear a little double-time swing.

88
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,506
Behind.

89
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,383
Same thing.

90
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:16,735
Bass, five bars of "Donna Lee."

91
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,883
All right.

92
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:28,714
Drums, with me.

93
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:31,120
Thank you, Joe.

94
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,314
No, no, no. Other drums.

95
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:54,215
Room B-16 tomorrow morning,
6:00 a. m. Don't be late.

96
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,163
All right, everybody, from the top.

97
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:11,717
A-one, two, three...

98
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,065
- Hey.
- How are you?

99
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:25,099
- Good. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

100
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:26,581
Good.

101
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,815
- The usual? You want, like...?
- No.

102
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:33,490
Look, I don't really know how...

103
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:38,488
I see you in here a lot, and
I think that you're really pretty and...

104
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:43,167
Would you wanna go out with me
ever?

105
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,644
Please go away.

106
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:47,721
- Oh, God.
- Get out.

107
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:51,392
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- I'm just messing with you.

108
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,113
- I'm messing with you.
- What? Oh, my God.

109
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:57,675
I'm sorry.

110
00:13:57,863 --> 00:14:00,864
- That's actually pretty mean.
- That should've... I'm sorry.

111
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,146
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

112
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,623
- What's your name?
- It's okay. No big deal.

113
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:06,895
Oh, I'm Andrew.

114
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:08,458
- Andrew.
- Yeah.

115
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:10,858
- I'm Nicole.
- Nice to meet you, Nicole.

116
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,891
Nice to meet you too.

117
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:17,328
- So you wanna take me out.
- I would love to take you out.

118
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,445
- Where do you wanna go?
- Pizza.

119
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:20,920
- Pizza.
- Yeah.

120
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,961
- I like pizza.
- Yeah, I know this great pizza place.

121
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:27,078
Cool. Okay, well...

122
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,831
I get off at 7 on Monday.

123
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:36,313
- Okay.
- You wanna meet here?

124
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:38,904
- Okay. Yeah. I will.
- Yeah.

125
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:40,665
Great.

126
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,861
Okay. Seven o'clock?

127
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,428
- Here.
- At 7 p. m.

128
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,617
- Monday. Andrew.
- All right.

129
00:14:46,814 --> 00:14:48,416
- Bye.
- Bye.

130
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:55,866
It's not that bad. She's a go-go dancer.
Could've did porn, she chose not to.

131
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,464
- That make it better?
- Yeah, little bit.

132
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,822
- That's classier.
- I can deal with that.

133
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:12,339
Bitch had a foot fetish or something.

134
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,133
- This is good.
- You get on that?

135
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,012
That's it.

136
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:22,122
You are fucking kidding me.

137
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:27,115
- You the new alternate?
- Yeah. I'm Andrew Neiman.

138
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,679
Tune the set to B-flat,
then turn my pages.

139
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:31,360
Sure.

140
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:35,988
Excuse me. Could I get a B-flat?

141
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:38,271
Thank you.

142
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:45,941
Sorry. Can you...? Just one more time?

143
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,724
That's a great kit.

144
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,570
I play the new cymbals now.

145
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,965
Milk the cunt!

146
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:06,577
We got a squeaker today, people.
Neiman.

147
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:10,014
Nineteen years old. Isn't he cute?

148
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,256
All right, gang, "Whiplash."

149
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:02,525
Page. Page!

150
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,990
Barker, that is not your boyfriend's dick.
Do not come early.

151
00:19:14,347 --> 00:19:16,507
Bar 93.

152
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,263
Five, six, and...

153
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:58,352
Stop.

154
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:03,187
Now, this one really upsets me.
We have an out-of-tune player here.

155
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:08,138
Before I continue, would that player
care to identify himself?

156
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:11,575
No?

157
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:14,497
Okay, maybe a bug flew in my ear.

158
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,332
One-fifteen.

159
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,968
Five, six, and...

160
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:24,600
No. My ears are fine.

161
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:28,275
We definitely have
an out-of-tune player.

162
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:31,638
Whoever it is, this is your last chance.

163
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:35,191
And there it went.

164
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:38,511
Now, either you are deliberately
playing out of tune...

165
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:41,350
...and sabotaging my band...

166
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,107
...or you don't know
you're out of tune...

167
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,576
...which I'm afraid is even worse.

168
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,850
Reeds.

169
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,651
Five, six, and...

170
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:56,933
Bones.

171
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:00,442
Five, six, and...

172
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:04,485
He's here.

173
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,950
Tell me it's not you, Elmer Fudd.

174
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:35,329
It's okay. Play.

175
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:45,245
Do you think you're out of tune?

176
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,794
There's no fucking Mars bar down there.
What are you looking at?

177
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:57,634
Look up here. Look at me.

178
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:02,745
Do you think you're out of tune?

179
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:09,820
Yes.

180
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,011
Then why the fuck didn't you say so?

181
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:18,205
I've carried your fat ass for too long.

182
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:20,169
I won't have you
cost us a competition...

183
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,048
...because your mind's on a Happy Meal
instead of on pitch.

184
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,357
Jackson, congratulations,
you're fourth chair.

185
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:28,999
Metz, why are you still sitting there?
Get the fuck out!

186
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:51,172
For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune.
You were, Erickson.

187
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,293
But he didn't know...

188
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,687
...and that's bad enough.

189
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:02,008
All right, take 10.
When we get back, the squeaker's on.

190
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:14,354
Two, two, three.
Two, two, three.

191
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:19,351
If he put half the effort
into playing the trombone...

192
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:24,620
Andrew.

193
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,820
- Parents musicians?
- No.

194
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,613
- What do they do?
- My dad's a writer.

195
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,926
What's he written?

196
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:39,805
I guess he's more of a teacher, really.

197
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,598
- College?
- Pennington High School.

198
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:48,442
- Your mother, what does she do?
- I don't know. She left when I was a baby.

199
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:50,435
No musicians in the family?

200
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:54,313
You just gotta listen
to the greats, then.

201
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:57,388
Buddy Rich, Jo Jones...

202
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:01,704
You know, Charlie Parker
became Bird...

203
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,059
...because Jones threw a cymbal
at his head.

204
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,457
See what I'm saying?

205
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,857
Listen, the key is to just relax.

206
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:13,410
Don't worry about the numbers.

207
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:16,175
Don't worry about what
other guys are thinking.

208
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:19,763
You're here for a reason.

209
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,326
You believe that, right?

210
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,322
Yeah.

211
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,682
Say it.

212
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,751
I'm here for a reason.

213
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,636
Cool.

214
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,110
All right, man. Have fun.

215
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:08,636
All right, gang, "Whiplash."

216
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:12,914
A little under tempo, okay?
Neiman, just do your best.

217
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:17,034
Here we go.

218
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:19,629
Five, six, and...

219
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:37,325
Let's hear some fills.

220
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:49,112
We got Buddy Rich here.

221
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:00,980
A little trouble there.
Just pick it up at 17.

222
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:04,867
Ready?

223
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:07,655
Five, six, and...

224
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,776
Not quite my tempo.

225
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:16,535
Here we go.

226
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:17,969
Five, six, and...

227
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,602
Downbeat on 18. Okay? Here we go.

228
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,721
Five, six, and...

229
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:30,590
Bar 17, the end of four.

230
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,279
Got it?

231
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:34,674
Five, six, seven...

232
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:40,184
Not quite my tempo.
It's all good. No worries. Here we go.

233
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,386
Five, six, seven...

234
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:47,378
You're rushing. Here we go.

235
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,859
Five... Ready? Okay.

236
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,416
Five, six, and...

237
00:26:54,486 --> 00:26:55,725
Dragging just a hair.

238
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,290
Wait for my cue.

239
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,645
Five, six, seven...

240
00:27:06,194 --> 00:27:09,240
Rushing. Five, six, and...

241
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:14,835
Dragging. Five, six, and...

242
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,560
Why do you suppose I just hurled
a chair at your head, Neiman?

243
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:45,317
- I don't know.
- Sure you do.

244
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:48,517
- The tempo?
- Were you rushing or dragging?

245
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,910
I don't know.

246
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:55,869
- Start.
- Five, six, seven...

247
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:57,587
In four, damn it. Look at me.

248
00:27:58,342 --> 00:27:59,627
One, two, three, four.

249
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:02,265
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three...

250
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,584
Now, was I rushing or was I dragging?

251
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:07,135
- I don't know.
- Count again.

252
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,818
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

253
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,409
- One, two, three, four.
- Rushing or dragging?

254
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,847
- Rushing.
- So you do know the difference.

255
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:17,489
If you deliberately sabotage my band...

256
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:19,530
...I will fuck you like a pig.

257
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,604
Now, are you a rusher...

258
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,322
...or are you a dragger...

259
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:26,160
...or are you gonna be
on my fucking time?

260
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:28,440
I'm gonna be on your time.

261
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:31,479
- What does that say?
- "Quarter note equals 215."

262
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,749
- Count me a 215.
- One, two, three, four.

263
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,992
- One, two, three, four.
- Jesus Christ.

264
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,986
I didn't know they allowed retards.

265
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:40,501
Am I to understand
that you cannot read tempo?

266
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,507
- Can you even read music? What's that?
- Eighth note.

267
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:45,936
- Yes. What is that?
- Dotted 16th note.

268
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:47,499
Sight-read measure 101.

269
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:53,332
What, are you in a fucking a Capella
group? Play the goddamn kit.

270
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:55,732
Stop. Now answer my question.

271
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:59,368
Were you rushing
or were you dragging?

272
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,282
- Answer!
- Rushing.

273
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:09,194
Oh, my dear God.

274
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,671
Are you one of those
single-tear people?

275
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:16,754
Do I look like a double fucking rainbow
to you? You must be upset.

276
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:18,670
- Are you upset?
- No.

277
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:20,748
No? So you just don't give a shit?

278
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:24,145
- I do give a shit.
- So are you upset? Yes or fucking no?

279
00:29:24,616 --> 00:29:26,343
Yes, you are upset.

280
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:27,580
Yeah.

281
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:29,977
- Say it.
- I'm upset.

282
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,977
Say it so the whole band can hear you.

283
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:36,653
- I'm upset.
- Louder.

284
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:39,009
- I'm upset.
- Louder!

285
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:40,565
I'm upset.

286
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,124
You are a worthless, friendless,
faggot-lipped piece of shit...

287
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:47,795
...whose Mommy left Daddy when she
figured out he wasn't Eugene O'Neill.

288
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:50,674
Who's now weeping and slobbering
all over my drum set...

289
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:52,790
...like a fucking 9-year-old girl.

290
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:55,908
So for the final father-fucking time...

291
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:58,548
- ...say it louder!
- I'm upset!

292
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:00,589
Carl.

293
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,700
Start practising harder, Neiman.

294
00:30:05,974 --> 00:30:09,577
"Whiplash," bar 125.

295
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,936
Big-boy tempo.

296
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:14,174
Five, six, and...

297
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:49,332
This place is nice.

298
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,850
Yeah. I really like the music
that they play.

299
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:58,847
- I mean, the food's good too, but...
- No, the pizza's really good.

300
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,083
"When I Wake."

301
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:04,683
- What?
- That's the name of the song.

302
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:10,161
Jackie Hill, July 17th, 1938.

303
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,152
Bob Ellis on the drums.

304
00:33:14,146 --> 00:33:17,863
Every time I saw you at the theater,
your eyes were glued to the floor.

305
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:19,750
Really?

306
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:25,255
My dad says that I have...
I have trouble making eye contact.

307
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:29,420
My parents like to criticise me too.

308
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,497
Growing up, my mom said
I had a really big chin...

309
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:34,329
...that's why guys wouldn't like me.

310
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:36,093
- Really? You don't.
- Yeah.

311
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:38,410
Well, she said my dad cursed me
with one.

312
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,960
It's like Jay Leno. Look.

313
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,319
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

314
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:46,841
- I don't... I don't think so at all.
- Well, that's nice.

315
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:50,590
Your chin's very nice. Very nice.

316
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,795
Your mom sounds insane.

317
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:56,589
She did wanna be an actress
when she was my age.

318
00:33:57,542 --> 00:34:00,463
- What about you?
- What about me?

319
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,104
What do you do?

320
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,344
I go to Fordham.

321
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,381
What do you study?

322
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:08,859
I don't have a major yet.

323
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,969
- But, like, what do you want to study?
- I don't really know.

324
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:16,008
I don't know yet.

325
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,209
So Fordham
was just like a random school?

326
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:22,288
No, I applied to a bunch of schools,
Fordham let me in.

327
00:34:22,517 --> 00:34:23,677
Why'd you pick Shaffer?

328
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:26,201
It's the best music school
in the country.

329
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:28,715
Well, Fordham was Fordham.

330
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:44,221
I don't love it there, to be honest.

331
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:46,695
- No?
- No.

332
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:48,535
I...

333
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:53,136
I don't know. I guess it's just the people.
I don't know if they like me very much.

334
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:57,443
I'm from Arizona,
and I think they can see it.

335
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:00,690
- I feel the same about people at Shaffer.
- Yeah?

336
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,198
Yeah. I don't think they like me
too much.

337
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:05,920
But I don't... I don't...

338
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:09,240
I don't care too much.
I think it just... It changes.

339
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,437
You know, people change
and things work out.

340
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,116
No, no, I know, I know.

341
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,467
I just...

342
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,307
I feel really homesick sometimes.

343
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:25,699
I don't know.

344
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:31,017
It kind of pisses me off
when people pretend like they're not.

345
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,335
In college, you know?

346
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:37,371
Maybe I'm literally the only one,
I don't know.

347
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,364
I still go to the movies with my dad.

348
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:17,686
- Hey. How are you, man?
- Good to see you.

349
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:22,042
And please, is this really Eva?

350
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:25,758
Last time I saw you,
you were very tiny.

351
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,040
Are you playing an instrument yet?

352
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:29,596
She started piano last week.

353
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,916
When you're a big college kid,
will you come play in my band?

354
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,073
- Would you like that?
- Be my piano player?

355
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:36,794
Excellent. Give me five, baby.

356
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:38,943
- All right. Great to see you.
- Great seeing you.

357
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:41,062
- See you after the show.
- Absolutely.

358
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:42,703
Cheers.

359
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:46,903
Listen up, Cocksuckers.

360
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,412
Hurry the fuck up. Get your music.

361
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:55,735
"Irene" only. Set one.
Rhythm section out first.

362
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:59,527
The kit is a fucking tonal catastrophe.
Get it in tune, all right?

363
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,886
Rhythm and soloists, bar 45.

364
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,640
We're gonna pick up the tempo.

365
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:07,877
Bar 106, brass, do not forget
we sharp that ninth.

366
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,477
Everybody remember,
Lincoln Center use these competitions...

367
00:37:11,668 --> 00:37:14,112
...to decide who they're interested in
and who they're not.

368
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:17,664
I'm not gonna have my reputation
in that department tarnished...

369
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,988
...by a bunch of limp-dick, sour-note...

370
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,380
...flatter-than-their-girlfriends,
flexible-tempo dipshits.

371
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,383
One more thing. Give me that.

372
00:37:25,574 --> 00:37:28,177
If I ever find one of these
lying around again...

373
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,053
...I swear to fucking God,
I will stop being so polite.

374
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:35,613
Get the fuck out of my sight
before I demolish you.

375
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:37,686
Stage right, in order, now.

376
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,760
I can still fucking see you, Mini-Me!

377
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,871
Let's go. Hurry the fuck up. Let's go.

378
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:10,409
<i>The Shaffer Conservatory
Studio Band.</i>

379
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:08,598
Hold on to this for the second set.

380
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:18,712
He's dumb but he's not stupid.

381
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:21,629
At the end of the day, he wants a career,
as dumb as he is.

382
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,705
Fudd has a chance of getting put back in,
so why would he jeopardise that?

383
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:28,412
- I need to look at the music.
- It's right here.

384
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,008
- Why isn't it on you?
- Where's the folder?

385
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:36,764
- You're joking. You're fucking around?
- No...

386
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:40,362
I swear I had it here two seconds ago.
It's gotta be around here.

387
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,725
- Did you see...?
- How could you be so stupid?

388
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:45,282
- I know. Maybe a janitor came by.
- A janitor?

389
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:48,037
Find the fucking folder!
A fucking janitor?

390
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:51,757
You're a dumb fuck! A dumb fuck!

391
00:39:51,948 --> 00:39:53,869
- Find the folder!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

392
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:55,873
Tanned

393
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:03,702
Jesus fucking Christ,
where have you been?

394
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:06,624
- We have an issue.
- Okay, now is not the time.

395
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:10,253
I gave Neiman the folder
and Neiman lost it.

396
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,688
- Neiman lost it.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,848
The folder was your responsibility.

398
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,250
Why would you give it to Neiman?
Right?

399
00:40:17,442 --> 00:40:20,761
Give a calculator to a retard,
he's gonna turn on a TV with it.

400
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:24,324
- Get your sticks, get your ass on-stage.
- I... I can't.

401
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:26,478
You can't?

402
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:30,993
I... I can't go on-stage.
I don't know the charts by heart.

403
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:35,953
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I... You know this.

404
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:38,781
I need the music.
It's my memory, I need visual cues.

405
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,902
- Visual cues.
- Yes. It's a medical...

406
00:40:41,098 --> 00:40:43,258
A medical condition?
What, are you Sanjay Gupta?

407
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:44,701
Play the goddamn music.

408
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:47,218
- I can't.
- I can.

409
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:55,009
- You know "Whiplash" by heart?
- Yes. Every measure.

410
00:40:57,682 --> 00:41:01,683
All right. Well, you better fucking hope
your memory doesn't fail you.

411
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:05,004
I hope you play it a lot better
than you did last month.

412
00:41:05,194 --> 00:41:07,035
I do not intend to start losing.

413
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:10,073
Get your sticks and get your ass
on-stage. On-stage!

414
00:42:35,464 --> 00:42:37,385
<i>And in first place...</i>

415
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:39,469
<i>"Shaffer Conservatory".</i>

416
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:55,808
Hey.
Don't fucking touch my folder, man.

417
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:07,839
Do not touch this kit.

418
00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:15,185
All right, let's get to work, ladies.

419
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:19,511
Tanner, what you doing? It's core only.
I don't have time for alternates.

420
00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:24,458
"Cherokee." From the top.

421
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:37,207
Tanner, are you a fucking statue?
Let's go. Get off the stool.

422
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:47,678
Don't forget to turn Neiman's pages.
Here we go.

423
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:50,516
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

424
00:44:11,848 --> 00:44:13,416
<i>What did you do to your hand?</i>

425
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:16,165
- Is that from drumming?
- Yeah. It's nothing.

426
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,443
So how's it going
with the Studio Band?

427
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:19,727
Good.

428
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:21,885
Yeah, I think he likes me more now.

429
00:44:23,636 --> 00:44:26,443
And his opinion means a lot to you,
doesn't it?

430
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:28,832
Yeah.

431
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:32,878
Wanna grab the shakers?

432
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:36,864
Jimbo? Overcooked.

433
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:39,028
You can barely chew this.

434
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:43,101
- He just laughs.
- So how's the drumming going, Andy?

435
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:47,253
Yeah, it's going really well.
I'm the new core drummer, so...

436
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:50,975
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

437
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:52,617
Tom Brady.

438
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:55,533
- Did you hear, Jim?
- No, what?

439
00:44:55,764 --> 00:44:59,049
- Trav got named this year's MVP.
- That's fantastic, Travis.

440
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,718
Yeah, and Dustin is heading up
Model UN...

441
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:04,724
...soon to be Rhodes Scholar
and who knows what else.

442
00:45:05,074 --> 00:45:06,995
And Jim, teacher of the year.

443
00:45:07,192 --> 00:45:08,999
- Well, hey, listen...
- I mean, come on.

444
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,555
The talent at this table,
that is stunning.

445
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:15,986
- And Andy, with your drumming.
- It's going okay, Andy?

446
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:18,667
Yeah, it's going really,
really well, actually.

447
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,185
I'm part of Shaffer's
top jazz orchestra...

448
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:23,903
...which means
it's the best in the country.

449
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:26,295
And I'm a core member...

450
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:29,096
...so I'll start playing in competitions.
I just...

451
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,813
I found out I'm the youngest person
in the band.

452
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:35,849
How do you know who wins in
a music competition? Isn't it subjective?

453
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:38,928
- No.
- Does the studio get you a job?

454
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,810
It's not an actual studio.

455
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:43,879
It's the name of the ensemble,
but it's a big step forward in my career.

456
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:47,241
I'm so glad you figured it out.
It's a nasty business, I am sure.

457
00:45:47,672 --> 00:45:50,559
Hey, are you gonna tell them
about your game this week?

458
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:54,068
- Living up to your title.
- I scored a 93-yard touchdown.

459
00:45:54,305 --> 00:45:55,987
School record, school record.

460
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:59,190
- Is that true? That's fantastic.
- It's Division Three.

461
00:46:02,816 --> 00:46:06,578
It's Carlton football. It's not even
Division Two, it's Division Three.

462
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:09,573
- You got any friends, Andy?
- No.

463
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,696
- Oh, why is that?
- I don't know. I never saw the use.

464
00:46:12,926 --> 00:46:16,893
Who are you gonna play with otherwise?
Lennon and McCartney were buddies.

465
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:20,481
Charlie Parker didn't know anybody
till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

466
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,049
That's your idea of success?

467
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,840
Being the greatest musician of the 20th
century is anybody's idea of success.

468
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,477
Dying broke and drunk
and full of heroin...

469
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:31,115
...at the age of 34
is not my idea of success.

470
00:46:31,308 --> 00:46:34,434
I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34
and have people talk about me...

471
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,751
...than live to be rich and sober at go
and nobody remember who I was.

472
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,219
But your friends will remember you,
that's the point.

473
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:43,818
None of us were friends
with Charlie Parker. That's the point.

474
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:47,732
Travis and Dustin, they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose.

475
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,051
They'll make great
school board presidents.

476
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:51,971
You think you're better than us?

477
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:55,008
- Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?
- I got a reply for you.

478
00:46:55,204 --> 00:46:58,125
You think Carlton football is a joke?
Come play with us.

479
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:00,720
Four words you will never hear
from the NFL.

480
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,759
- Who wants dessert?
- Heard from Lincoln Center?

481
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:40,210
Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new
chart by the door on your way out.

482
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:45,560
Rehearsal 9 p. m. sharp tonight.
That's how long you have to learn it.

483
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:53,156
Neiman. Stick around a minute.

484
00:47:57,861 --> 00:47:59,987
See the tempo marking on there?

485
00:48:00,898 --> 00:48:03,376
"Quarter note equals 330."

486
00:48:03,695 --> 00:48:06,218
That is a double-time swing.

487
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:09,892
- That's what got you in here, right?
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,532
As fate would have it,
I recently stumbled across another kid...

489
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:18,203
...in the practice room
working on his double-time swing.

490
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,367
So I'm gonna give him a shot.

491
00:48:21,558 --> 00:48:23,877
- Am I late?
- Perfect timing.

492
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:25,916
Come on in, Connolly.

493
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:29,396
- You two know each other, right?
- Yeah, Nassau band.

494
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,636
What's up, Andrew?

495
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:35,828
I've made Neiman a temporary core,
but with this competition coming up...

496
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:39,467
...I just wanna make very sure
this chart is in the best shape it can be.

497
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:41,580
Yeah, this one right here, right?

498
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:46,339
I gave Connolly the chart this morning.

499
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:49,534
All I wanna do is give you both
a crack at it, all right?

500
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:52,889
So, Neiman, go ahead,
jump on the kit, take it from the top.

501
00:48:53,086 --> 00:48:54,530
Okay.

502
00:48:57,082 --> 00:49:00,367
I don't want you to worry about hits now.
Just tempo, okay?

503
00:49:05,593 --> 00:49:07,082
All set?

504
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:10,231
One, two...

505
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,344
Not quite my tempo. Connolly.

506
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:21,269
- I can take it from the top.
- Connolly, go ahead.

507
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,538
- I can do...
- No. We'll go with Connolly now.

508
00:49:30,728 --> 00:49:32,138
Hey, do you mind?

509
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,687
Okay, man, ready?

510
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:43,726
One and two and...

511
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:52,071
- Perfect, Connolly.
- Oh, my God.

512
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:55,347
See, this to me
is the beauty of Studio Band.

513
00:49:55,504 --> 00:49:58,232
You walk in here an alternate,
you could be the new core.

514
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:00,427
- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- Thanks.

515
00:50:00,618 --> 00:50:02,664
That shit?

516
00:50:06,572 --> 00:50:08,174
Fletcher.

517
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,773
Thanks, man. Here you go.

518
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:15,408
Don't worry about Fletcher.
He's more bark than bite.

519
00:50:22,117 --> 00:50:24,277
Hey, look, you...
I can play these charts.

520
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:27,674
- Now is not the time, I swear to God.
- I can play it, okay?

521
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:31,315
I said not now!
If you want the fucking part, earn it.

522
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,775
<i>I'm just gonna lay it out there.</i>

523
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,614
This is why I don't think
we should be together.

524
00:50:56,522 --> 00:50:59,966
And I've thought about it a lot,
and this is what's gonna happen.

525
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,444
I'm gonna keep pursuing
what I'm pursuing.

526
00:51:02,676 --> 00:51:05,483
Because I'm doing that,
it's gonna take up my time.

527
00:51:05,673 --> 00:51:07,992
I'm not gonna be able
to spend time with you.

528
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,669
Even when I do,
I'm gonna be thinking about drumming.

529
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:14,789
About jazz, my charts. Because of that,
you're gonna start to resent me.

530
00:51:15,384 --> 00:51:19,305
You're gonna tell me to ease up on
the drumming, spend more time with you.

531
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:24,056
I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'll start
to resent you for even asking me to stop.

532
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:27,574
We're just gonna start to hate
each other. It's gonna be ugly.

533
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:29,658
And so for those reasons...

534
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:32,895
...I'd rather just, you know,
break it off clean.

535
00:51:40,638 --> 00:51:42,718
Because I wanna be great.

536
00:51:44,874 --> 00:51:47,034
And you're not?

537
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,391
I wanna be one of the greats.

538
00:51:51,947 --> 00:51:54,754
And I would stop you from doing that?

539
00:51:56,103 --> 00:51:57,705
Yeah.

540
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:02,104
You know I would stop you
from doing that?

541
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:04,616
You know that for a fact?

542
00:52:04,774 --> 00:52:06,297
Yes.

543
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,452
And I'd barely see you anyway?

544
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:15,884
- Yeah.
- I see you, you'd treat me like shit...

545
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,651
...because I'm some girl
who doesn't know what she wants.

546
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,443
You have a path, you're going
to be great, I'm gonna be forgotten...

547
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:25,154
...and you won't be able
to give me the time of day...

548
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:28,275
...because you have bigger things
to pursue.

549
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,067
That's exactly my point.

550
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:34,546
What the fuck is wrong with you?

551
00:52:37,062 --> 00:52:39,028
You're right.
We should not be dating.

552
00:52:46,932 --> 00:52:48,932
I'm okay. Thanks.

553
00:53:02,117 --> 00:53:04,243
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:53:23,136 --> 00:53:24,704
Fucking piece of shit!

555
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,502
Fuck you!

556
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:28,181
Fuck!

557
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,049
Fucking piece of shit! Come on!

558
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:49,717
Sorry, we have a new player.
Ryan Connolly.

559
00:53:54,344 --> 00:53:56,071
I'm sorry.

560
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:59,030
Guys, just put your instruments
down for a minute.

561
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:15,206
Just listen for a minute.

562
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,159
Six years ago...

563
00:54:23,675 --> 00:54:27,756
...I came across a kid in a practice room
working on his scales.

564
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:33,113
He was early second year and he'd
started at Shaffer with a lot of hope.

565
00:54:35,903 --> 00:54:37,824
Like all you guys.

566
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:45,061
But the truth was that he barely
squeaked in to begin with...

567
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,857
...and he was really struggling.

568
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:57,645
The faculty were all telling him,
"Maybe this isn't for you."

569
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:01,765
But they didn't see what I saw.

570
00:55:01,957 --> 00:55:04,878
This scared, skinny kid...

571
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:08,677
...cursing himself
because he couldn't get his scales right.

572
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,189
I saw a drive in him.

573
00:55:11,427 --> 00:55:14,075
And I put him in Studio Band.

574
00:55:14,304 --> 00:55:16,031
And when he graduated...

575
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:19,502
...Marsalis made him third trumpet
at Lincoln Center.

576
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:22,267
A year later, he was first.

577
00:55:22,456 --> 00:55:24,536
That's who you're listening to now.

578
00:55:26,252 --> 00:55:28,775
His name was Sean Casey.

579
00:55:36,802 --> 00:55:39,201
I found out this morning...

580
00:55:40,398 --> 00:55:42,125
...that Sean...

581
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:46,280
...died yesterday...

582
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:50,231
...in a car accident.

583
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:55,945
And I just...

584
00:55:57,581 --> 00:56:01,060
I wanted you guys to know
he was a beautiful player.

585
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,971
I just thought you should know.

586
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:19,323
I'm sorry.

587
00:56:23,555 --> 00:56:25,044
Okay.

588
00:56:27,231 --> 00:56:32,835
Let's get to work, huh?
How about "Caravan," bar 105?

589
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:41,459
Two bars for free.

590
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,664
One and two and...

591
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,732
It's not quite right, Connolly.

592
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:54,048
I'd like to try Neiman on this.

593
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:01,807
Maybe now's the time
for Neiman to earn the part.

594
00:57:05,513 --> 00:57:08,241
One and two and...

595
00:57:10,588 --> 00:57:13,350
Nope, I guess not. Tanner?

596
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:25,821
One and two and...

597
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:28,419
Motherfucker!

598
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:33,376
Connolly,
get your ass back on the kit.

599
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:43,206
We will stay here for as long as it takes
until one of you faggots can play in time.

600
00:57:44,035 --> 00:57:45,876
One and two and...

601
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:50,912
Looks like that might be all night.
Neiman.

602
00:57:52,866 --> 00:57:55,673
One and two and...

603
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:57,431
Not my fucking tempo!

604
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:03,306
Sorry, guys.
Hate to put you through this.

605
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,901
If you need to fucking take a dump
or get a coffee...

606
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,817
...whatever,
now might be a good time.

607
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:13,765
We're gonna stay until I find a drummer
who can fucking play in time.

608
00:58:13,965 --> 00:58:16,533
I apologise to the musicians.

609
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:19,842
Seriously, take 10, 20,
a fucking hour.

610
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,357
You hear me, cocksuckers?
Better start shitting me perfect 400s.

611
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:25,715
Connolly, get your fucking ass
back on the kit.

612
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:45,298
Is that really the fastest you can play,
you worthless Hymie fuck?

613
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:49,616
No wonder Mommy ran out on you.
Get off the fucking kit.

614
00:58:51,847 --> 00:58:57,564
And here comes Mr. Gay Pride
of the Upper West Side himself.

615
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:02,041
This is not a Bette Midler concert.
We will not be serving baked Alaska...

616
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:05,197
...so just play faster
than you give hand jobs, will you?

617
00:59:05,433 --> 00:59:07,399
One, two, one, two.

618
00:59:10,308 --> 00:59:11,513
Not even fucking close.

619
00:59:11,707 --> 00:59:14,151
Let's go with the Irish Mick
Paddy cracker now.

620
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,464
You know, you actually do look
quite a bit like a leprechaun.

621
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:19,383
I'm gonna start
calling you Flannery.

622
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:42,360
Get off!

623
00:59:45,952 --> 00:59:48,430
What are you looking for?
There's no gold down there.

624
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,074
Adjusting the seat? Really?

625
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:52,786
That's been your problem
the whole time? The seat height?

626
00:59:52,985 --> 00:59:54,553
So now you have it, right?

627
00:59:54,864 --> 00:59:56,466
Go.

628
01:00:01,777 --> 01:00:03,266
Bullshit! Fuck you!

629
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:05,463
Neiman.

630
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:11,532
Maybe it's time...

631
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:15,052
...to finally bring this home.
What do you say?

632
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,926
Show me.

633
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:21,764
Don't slow down.

634
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:26,995
Pick it up.

635
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,311
Faster!

636
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:49,093
Faster!

637
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:57,171
Faster!

638
01:00:59,878 --> 01:01:01,003
Faster!

639
01:01:01,437 --> 01:01:03,199
Faster!

640
01:01:11,227 --> 01:01:13,034
Keep playing!

641
01:01:15,982 --> 01:01:18,869
Keep playing! Keep playing!
Keep playing!

642
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:22,539
Don't stop.

643
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:40,800
Neiman...

644
01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:43,595
...you earned the part.

645
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:50,191
Alternates, you wanna clean
the blood off my drum set?

646
01:01:53,345 --> 01:01:55,550
Okay, we can start now.

647
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:21,126
5 p. m. call tomorrow in Dunellen.

648
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:25,433
Give yourselves at least two hours
to get there this time, all right?

649
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:27,315
Save your travel receipts.

650
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:30,438
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

651
01:03:35,722 --> 01:03:38,768
- Do you know where the cabs are?
- You gotta call the cabs.

652
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:41,846
- The cab was supposed to be here.
- You gotta call. They take forever.

653
01:03:42,036 --> 01:03:43,366
How do I get to Hargrove?

654
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,590
Hey. Come on.
Please, come on. You're still open.

655
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:55,513
You're still open.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

656
01:04:11,367 --> 01:04:12,413
Yeah, hello?

657
01:04:12,606 --> 01:04:14,971
<i>Neiman, where are you, man?
Call time was 5.</i>

658
01:04:15,163 --> 01:04:18,004
I know, I know.
I'm almost there. I'm right there.

659
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,087
<i>- We 're on-stage in 20.
- I know.</i>

660
01:04:20,238 --> 01:04:22,886
<i>- Fletcher's got Connolly warming up.
- God fucking da... Okay.</i>

661
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:26,837
You just tell that little fucking redhead
I'll... I'm gonna be there, okay? Fuck.

662
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:30,830
Hey. Hey. Sorry I'm late.

663
01:04:31,187 --> 01:04:34,313
Well, glad you could fit us
into your busy schedule, darling.

664
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:36,470
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm ready to go.

665
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:39,229
- Connolly's playing the part.
- Like fucking hell.

666
01:04:39,419 --> 01:04:40,863
What the fuck did you say to me?

667
01:04:44,094 --> 01:04:45,140
It's my part.

668
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:48,011
It's my part and I decide
who to lend it to.

669
01:04:49,009 --> 01:04:52,089
Usually it's somebody
that has fucking sticks.

670
01:04:53,525 --> 01:04:56,173
I left them in the car.
I'll be right back. Five minutes.

671
01:04:56,322 --> 01:04:57,686
I'm warming up the band now.

672
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,280
- I can use Ryan's sticks.
- Neiman, you lost the fucking part.

673
01:05:01,517 --> 01:05:03,358
No, I didn't. You can't do this.

674
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:04,641
- Can't?
- Yeah.

675
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:07,232
When did you become a fucking expert
on what I can do...

676
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:10,312
- ...you fucking weepy-willow shit sack?
- I earned that part.

677
01:05:10,508 --> 01:05:13,236
You never earned anything.
You are a self-righteous prick.

678
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:17,064
The only reason you're a fucking core
is because you misplaced a folder.

679
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:20,580
Only reason you're in Studio Band
to begin with is because I told you...

680
01:05:20,777 --> 01:05:22,823
...what I'd be asking for in Nassau.

681
01:05:23,055 --> 01:05:24,260
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah.

682
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:26,898
- I'm in Studio Band because I'm the...
- Back off.

683
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:29,739
Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah.
Turn my pages, bitch.

684
01:05:30,128 --> 01:05:32,776
Hey. I can cut you
any fucking time I want.

685
01:05:32,965 --> 01:05:35,932
- You would've cut me by now.
- Try me, you fucking weasel.

686
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,602
At 5:30, that's in exactly 11 minutes,
my band is on-stage.

687
01:05:41,796 --> 01:05:45,036
If your ass is not on that stool
with your own sticks in hand...

688
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,279
...or if you make one fucking mistake...

689
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:50,432
...one, I will drum your ass
back to Nassau...

690
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:53,946
...where you can turn pages
until you graduate or fucking drop out.

691
01:05:54,144 --> 01:05:58,111
By the time you're done at Shaffer, you'll
make Daddy look like a success story.

692
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:01,466
Got it? Or we can let Johnny Utah
play the part.

693
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:04,544
- You choose.
- That's my part. I'll be on your stage.

694
01:06:04,693 --> 01:06:06,216
- Fuck you.
- You got 10 minutes...

695
01:06:06,372 --> 01:06:09,213
...you fucking pathetic,
pansy-ass fruit fuck.

696
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,762
<i>- Tell Fletcher I'm coming.
- What's taking you so long?</i>

697
01:06:21,956 --> 01:06:25,196
<i>- We 're moving on-stage.
- I got locked in my car. I'm coming.</i>

698
01:06:25,433 --> 01:06:27,035
<i>Left turn, 200 feet.</i>

699
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:29,118
<i>- Are you driving, man?
- No.</i>

700
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:30,872
<i>What the hell was that noise?</i>

701
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:35,624
Okay, why don't you just tell Fletcher
that I'm coming, you motherfucker?

702
01:07:19,778 --> 01:07:20,983
Hey. Hey, hey-

703
01:07:21,217 --> 01:07:24,138
Are you okay? Are you okay?

704
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:27,221
- I gotta get my sticks.
- No, stay away from the car.

705
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:29,377
- I've called 911.
- Look, I gotta go.

706
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:31,568
- No, no, sir.
- A couple more blocks.

707
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:34,045
- Sir, no, you don't have to...
- Please get off me.

708
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:07,495
- Hey, guy.
- What the fuck happened to you?

709
01:08:13,365 --> 01:08:17,002
<i>The Shaffer Conservatory
Studio Band.</i>

710
01:09:14,304 --> 01:09:15,464
Neiman, what the fuck?

711
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,012
<i>Fuck.</i>

712
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,628
Neiman...

713
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:03,226
...you're done.

714
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:16,445
Gentlemen, ladies, I apologise...

715
01:10:16,681 --> 01:10:19,522
...on behalf of Shaffer Conservatory.

716
01:10:24,313 --> 01:10:26,075
Piece of shit. I'll fucking kill you.

717
01:10:26,711 --> 01:10:28,279
- Fuck you.
- Get the...

718
01:10:28,509 --> 01:10:30,828
- Get the fuck off me.
- Get off me. Fuck off.

719
01:10:34,503 --> 01:10:35,833
Fuck you.

720
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:37,706
Fuck you!

721
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,900
Fuck you, Fletcher! Fuck you!

722
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:42,900
Get off. Fuck. Piece of shit!

723
01:10:43,135 --> 01:10:44,817
Fuck you!

724
01:10:59,998 --> 01:11:04,318
- When did you start talking to her?
- Your father got in contact this week.

725
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,271
Does the name Sean Casey
mean anything to you?

726
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:10,070
You know of his death?

727
01:11:10,827 --> 01:11:13,794
Last month, he hanged himself
in his apartment.

728
01:11:18,419 --> 01:11:22,420
- What does that have to do with me?
- He suffered from anxiety, depression.

729
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:26,014
His mother claims this started
during his time as Fletcher's student.

730
01:11:27,011 --> 01:11:30,978
Now, the Caseys aren't wealthy,
they don't wanna file suit.

731
01:11:32,925 --> 01:11:35,971
So, what do they want?

732
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:40,044
To make sure Terence Fletcher is never
allowed to do this to another student.

733
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:07,413
<i>Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle.</i>

734
01:12:09,728 --> 01:12:12,172
<i>Yeah, that's my boy.</i>

735
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:16,252
- He didn't do anything.
- What is wrong with you? It's over, okay?

736
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:19,044
He's out of your life.
Why would you let him get away?

737
01:12:19,238 --> 01:12:22,603
Would you characterise his conduct
as extreme, Andrew?

738
01:12:22,955 --> 01:12:26,274
Did he ever intentionally inflict
emotional distress?

739
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:37,950
This would not be a public hearing,
you know.

740
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:41,498
Fletcher would never know
it was you who spoke up.

741
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,132
Why would you do this to me?

742
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:53,487
Do you think that I would let him
put my son through hell...

743
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:56,123
...and then just walk away scot-free?

744
01:12:56,441 --> 01:12:59,089
Don't you know
I would never let that happen?

745
01:12:59,278 --> 01:13:04,074
That there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you?

746
01:13:04,273 --> 01:13:06,194
Don't you know that?

747
01:13:16,901 --> 01:13:18,583
Andrew?

748
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:07,259
Andrew?

749
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:14,006
Just tell me what to say.

750
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:28,161
Hey.

751
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:49,014
<i>I'd give anything to be there again
this fall.</i>

752
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,413
<i>I like weddings,
provided they're not mine.</i>

753
01:14:51,606 --> 01:14:53,050
<i>Marriages are very healthy.</i>

754
01:14:53,244 --> 01:14:55,529
<i>Married men live much longer
than bachelors.</i>

755
01:14:55,762 --> 01:14:59,047
<i>They're trying to outlive their wives
so they can be bachelors again.</i>

756
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:02,039
<i>- Haven't you thought of getting married?
- I did.</i>

757
01:15:02,195 --> 01:15:04,594
<i>The young lady changed her mind
at the last moment.</i>

758
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:07,521
<i>I've been deeply indebted to her
ever since.</i>

759
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:10,029
And I loaded the pantry up
with Gushers.

760
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:12,592
- Saw that.
- Okay.

761
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:14,388
All right.

762
01:15:15,582 --> 01:15:17,071
Thanks.

763
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,483
Right on, man.

764
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,382
Andrew.

765
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:05,857
Hey.

766
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,446
I don't know if you heard.

767
01:18:15,562 --> 01:18:17,722
I'm not at Shaffer anymore.

768
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,127
Yeah, I did hear that.

769
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:23,114
Did you quit?

770
01:18:25,312 --> 01:18:27,199
Not exactly.

771
01:18:28,509 --> 01:18:32,590
Some parents got a kid
from Sean Casey's year, I think...

772
01:18:32,785 --> 01:18:35,672
...to say some things about me.

773
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:38,180
Although why anybody
would have anything...

774
01:18:38,379 --> 01:18:41,346
...other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery.

775
01:18:43,454 --> 01:18:44,943
Yeah.

776
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:47,413
- That's a good laugh, right?
- I'm sorry.

777
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:49,372
- No, listen... I get it.
- I'm sorry.

778
01:18:49,568 --> 01:18:51,534
I know I made enemies.

779
01:18:52,924 --> 01:18:55,323
I'm conducting a little, though.

780
01:18:56,681 --> 01:18:59,682
They brought back the JVC Fest
this year.

781
01:18:59,877 --> 01:19:02,923
They got me opening
in a couple of weeks with a pro band.

782
01:19:03,953 --> 01:19:05,680
That's great.

783
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,669
Yeah. It's all right.

784
01:19:11,306 --> 01:19:16,102
Truth is,
I don't think people understood...

785
01:19:16,341 --> 01:19:18,989
...what it was I was doing at Shaffer.

786
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:20,820
I wasn't there to conduct.

787
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,579
Any fucking moron can wave his arms
and keep people in tempo.

788
01:19:24,772 --> 01:19:29,329
I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them.

789
01:19:31,286 --> 01:19:33,173
I believe that is...

790
01:19:34,563 --> 01:19:37,086
...an absolute necessity.

791
01:19:38,758 --> 01:19:42,123
Otherwise, we're depriving the world
of the next Louis Armstrong.

792
01:19:42,315 --> 01:19:43,759
The next Charlie Parker.

793
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:49,588
I told you about how Charlie Parker
became Charlie Parker, right?

794
01:19:49,787 --> 01:19:52,594
- Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
- Exactly.

795
01:19:52,784 --> 01:19:54,944
Parker's a young kid,
pretty good on the sax.

796
01:19:55,102 --> 01:19:59,739
Gets up to play at a cutting session,
and he fucks it up.

797
01:20:00,856 --> 01:20:03,743
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

798
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:06,576
And he's laughed off-stage.

799
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,572
Cries himself to sleep that night,
but the next morning, what does he do?

800
01:20:10,726 --> 01:20:12,692
He practises.

801
01:20:13,044 --> 01:20:16,840
And he practises and he practises
with one goal in mind...

802
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,643
...never to be laughed at again.

803
01:20:19,957 --> 01:20:24,799
And a year later, he goes back to
the Reno and he steps up on that stage...

804
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:28,515
...and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard.

805
01:20:32,105 --> 01:20:34,673
So imagine if Jones had just said:

806
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:39,943
"Well, that's okay, Charlie.
That was all right. Good job."

807
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:45,181
And then Charlie thinks to himself,
"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."

808
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:47,211
End of story.

809
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,092
No Bird.

810
01:20:50,966 --> 01:20:54,569
That, to me, is an absolute tragedy.

811
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:57,924
But that's just
what the world wants now.

812
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,285
People wonder why jazz is dying.

813
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:09,672
I tell you, man,
and every Starbucks "jazz" album...

814
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:12,311
...just proves my point, really.

815
01:21:13,024 --> 01:21:17,820
There are no two words
in the English language more harmful...

816
01:21:18,019 --> 01:21:19,860
...than "good job."

817
01:21:24,333 --> 01:21:26,333
But is there a line?

818
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:31,092
You know, maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next Charlie Parker...

819
01:21:31,246 --> 01:21:35,292
- ...from ever becoming Charlie Parker.
- No, man, no.

820
01:21:35,482 --> 01:21:38,881
Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.

821
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:40,687
Yeah.

822
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:48,749
The truth is, Andrew...

823
01:21:50,467 --> 01:21:53,115
...I never really had a Charlie Parker.

824
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:57,828
But I tried.

825
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,380
I actually fucking tried.

826
01:22:01,576 --> 01:22:03,542
And that's more than most people
ever do.

827
01:22:03,693 --> 01:22:08,933
And I will never apologise
for how I tried.

828
01:22:22,315 --> 01:22:23,520
I'll see you later.

829
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:24,873
Yeah.

830
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:30,472
Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea
how you're gonna take this...

831
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:35,828
...but the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.

832
01:22:38,379 --> 01:22:40,425
You understand what I'm saying?

833
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:43,495
No.

834
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:45,978
I'm using the Studio Band playlist.

835
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:49,536
You know, "Caravan," "Whiplash."

836
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:52,447
I need somebody
who really knows those charts.

837
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,003
What about Ryan Connolly?

838
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:01,716
All Connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you.

839
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:06,797
- Tanner?
- Tanner switched to premed.

840
01:23:07,869 --> 01:23:09,358
I guess he got discouraged.

841
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:13,275
Hey.

842
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:16,228
Take the weekend. Think about it.

843
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,961
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew.</i>

844
01:23:42,754 --> 01:23:45,436
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

845
01:23:46,311 --> 01:23:51,507
It's been a while since I talked to you.

846
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,591
Look, I...

847
01:23:54,782 --> 01:23:58,147
I'm really sorry about everything.

848
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:03,823
I know that's not, you know, enough,
but I'm just really sorry.

849
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:13,373
But anyway, I got...
I actually have this show this weekend.

850
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:15,245
It's a...

851
01:24:15,442 --> 01:24:18,761
Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't know
if maybe you'd wanna go...

852
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:24,595
...and we, you know, maybe
get some, like, pizza afterwards...

853
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:29,554
...and, like, complain
about our schools again.

854
01:24:29,747 --> 01:24:31,827
<i>What is...? You said Jayvees?</i>

855
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:35,026
No, it's JVC.

856
01:24:35,262 --> 01:24:39,388
It's like a... It's a jazz thing.

857
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:41,341
Yeah.

858
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,217
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

859
01:24:44,093 --> 01:24:49,289
<i>Well, I don't know if I can come. I...
I'll have to check with my boyfriend.</i>

860
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:56,566
Okay.

861
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,323
Yeah.

862
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:02,162
<i>Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know.</i>

863
01:25:02,355 --> 01:25:04,640
<i>I don't really think he likes jazz music.</i>

864
01:25:04,832 --> 01:25:07,594
Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody.

865
01:25:10,227 --> 01:25:14,387
Okay. Well, I guess
maybe I'll see you guys there.

866
01:25:15,302 --> 01:25:17,825
- Okay.
- Okay.

867
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:19,463
Bye.

868
01:26:43,214 --> 01:26:46,931
All right, gang, listen up. Now,
for those of you who are new at this...

869
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:51,489
...which looks like everybody except Cal,
tonight could change your life.

870
01:26:51,925 --> 01:26:57,131
The folks out there make a phone call,
you could be a Blue Note signee...

871
01:26:57,319 --> 01:27:00,876
...an EMC client,
a Lincoln Center core.

872
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:02,921
On the other hand...

873
01:27:03,074 --> 01:27:06,597
...if you drop the ball, you might be
looking for a new line of work...

874
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:11,546
...because the other thing
about these cats is they never forget.

875
01:27:14,982 --> 01:27:16,584
We all set?

876
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:19,621
All right. Let's have fun.

877
01:28:21,275 --> 01:28:23,514
You think I'm fucking stupid?

878
01:28:24,153 --> 01:28:27,120
- What?
- I know it was you.

879
01:28:40,856 --> 01:28:42,743
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

880
01:28:42,934 --> 01:28:46,616
We're very excited to be here kicking off
the JVC Festival this year.

881
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:49,936
I'm Terence Fletcher, these are some
of the best musicians in New York...

882
01:28:50,127 --> 01:28:52,889
...which means they're some of the best
musicians in the world.

883
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:57,130
We're gonna do some old standards,
but we're gonna start with a new tune...

884
01:28:57,319 --> 01:29:00,001
...by Tim Simonec called "Upswingin'."

885
01:29:45,231 --> 01:29:47,516
What the fuck you doing?

886
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:01,057
Come on, man.

887
01:31:05,111 --> 01:31:07,589
Yeah, I guess maybe you don't have it.

888
01:31:44,992 --> 01:31:49,357
That was a little extra avant-garde there
from the rhythm section.

889
01:31:59,337 --> 01:32:01,905
Come on, let's go home.

890
01:32:11,045 --> 01:32:12,647
What are you doing?

891
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:33,348
Now we're gonna slow it down
a little bit.

892
01:32:33,503 --> 01:32:35,469
I'm guessing most of you folks
have heard...

893
01:32:49,007 --> 01:32:50,053
I'll cue you in.

894
01:32:50,246 --> 01:32:52,372
"Caravan."

895
01:32:54,442 --> 01:32:56,249
Three, four.

896
01:33:53,383 --> 01:33:55,463
I'm gonna gouge out
your motherfucking eyes.

897
01:37:38,078 --> 01:37:41,045
<i>- Andrew, what are you doing, man?
- I'll cue you.</i>
