1
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,546
<i>So, where are you?

2
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,724
<i>You're in.. some motel room..</i>

3
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,793
<i>You just.. You just wake up, and
you're in.. in a motel room.

4
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,333
<i>There's the key.

5
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:47,714
<i>It feels like maybe it's just the
first time you've been there but...</i>

6
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,948
<i>perhaps.. you've been there for a week..

7
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,751
<i>three months..

8
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:55,734
<i>It's.. It's kinda hard to say.
I.. I don't know.</i>

9
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:58,219
<i>It's just.. an anonymous room.</i>

10
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:00,809
<i>Nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.

11
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:06,493
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible,
which I of course, read religiously.

12
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:12,293
<i>You know who you are,
and you know kind of all about yourself.

13
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,137
<i>But just for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.

14
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:20,672
<i>Sammy Jankis had the same problem...

15
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,698
<i>but he.. he really had no system.

16
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:25,145
<i>He wrote himself
a ridiculous amount of notes...

17
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,254
<i>but he'd get them all mixed up.

18
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:31,746
<i>You really do need a system
if you're gonna make it work.

19
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:35,770
<i>You kind of learn
to trust your own handwriting.

20
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:39,735
<i>That becomes an important part of your life.
You write yourself notes...

21
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,612
<i>and where you put your notes...
That also becomes really important.

22
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,227
<i>You need like, a jacket that's got
like, six pockets in it.

23
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:47,313
<i>Particular pockets for particular things.

24
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:51,473
<i>You just kind of learn to know
where things go and how the system works.

25
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:55,411
<i>And you have to be wary of other people writing
stuff for you that is not gonna make sense...

26
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,591
<i>or is gonna lead you astray.

27
00:03:56,615 --> 00:04:00,816
<i>I mean.. I.. I don't know. I guess people try and take
advantage of somebody with this condition.

28
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:07,160
<i>If you have a piece
of information which is vital...

29
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:10,520
<i>writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.

30
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,518
<i>It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.

31
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,928
Who is this?

32
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:24,726
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

33
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,026
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

34
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:29,905
I remember everything up until my injury.
I just can't make new memories.

35
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,692
So I can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?

36
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,278
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

37
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:36,685
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

38
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,085
Sammy's story helps me
understand my own situation.

39
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,389
Sammy wrote himself endless
amounts of notes...

40
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,471
But he got mixed up.

41
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,192
I have a more graceful
solution to the memory problem.

42
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:53,357
I'm disciplined and organized.

43
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:57,002
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

44
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,333
Sammy had no drive,
no reason to make it work.

45
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,682
Me?
Yeah...

46
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:06,352
I got a reason.

47
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,629
I met Sammy through work;
Insurance - I was an investigator.

48
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:14,325
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.

49
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:16,547
I had to see through people's bullshit.

50
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,405
It was useful experience,
'cause now it's my life.

51
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:22,743
But when I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

52
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:25,838
I have to just look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

53
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,123
<i>My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was just let them talk.</i>

54
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:31,383
<i>And watch the eyes. And the body language..</i>

55
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,589
<i>If someone scratches their
nose while they're talking,</i>

56
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:35,367
<i>experts will tell you
it means they're lying.</i>

57
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,778
<i>It really means they're nervous.
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i>

58
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,304
<i>It's all about context.</i>

59
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:41,828
Yeah, I was good.

60
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:44,681
Sammy was my first real challenge.

61
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:49,336
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

62
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,152
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.

63
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:56,188
You know, the guy's a 58-year-old
semi-retired accountant.

64
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,940
He and his wife had been in this car accident.
Nothing too serious.

65
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:01,865
<i>But he's acting funny.
He can't get a handle on what's going on.</i>

66
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:07,443
<i>The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus. Nothing conclusive.</i>

67
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:10,685
<i>But Sammy can't remember
anything for more than a couple of minutes.</i>

68
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:13,741
<i>Can't work, can't do shit.
The medical bills pile up.</i>

69
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,492
<i>His wife calls the insurance company,
and I get sent in.</i>

70
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:21,380
<i>Now, this is my first big claims investigation,
so I really check into it.</i>

71
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,436
<i>Sammy can think just fine.</i>

72
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,485
<i>But he can't make any new memories.</i>

73
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:28,881
<i>He could only remember things
for a couple of minutes.</i>

74
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:30,889
- This is Mr. Shelby.
<i>- He'd watch TV...

75
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:33,529
<i>but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing.</i>

76
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:35,054
<i>He couldn't remember how it began.</i>

77
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:37,345
<i>He liked commercials. They were short.</i>

78
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,695
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

79
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,274
<i>The crazy part was...</i>

80
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:45,254
<i>that this guy, who couldn't even follow the
plot of Green Acres anymore...</i>

81
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,754
<i>could do the most complicated things...</i>

82
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,020
<i>as long as he learned them
before the accident...</i>

83
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,048
<i>and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.</i>

84
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,655
Be gentle.

85
00:06:56,711 --> 00:07:01,674
<i>Now, the doctors assure me there's a real condition
called "Anterograde Memory Loss"...</i>

86
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,531
<i>or "Short-term memory loss".</i>

87
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,341
<i>It's rare, but legit.</i>

88
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,641
<i>But every time I see him...</i>

89
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:11,819
<i>I catch this look...</i>

90
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:15,097
<i>this.. slight look of recognition.</i>

91
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,084
<i>But he says he can't remember me at all.</i>

92
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,758
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

93
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:23,516
- Hi, Mr. Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

94
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:27,781
<i>Now, I can read people, and
I'm thinking: Bad actor.</i>

95
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,618
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

96
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,601
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

97
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,522
But I find something in my research:

98
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:38,406
"Conditioning".

99
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,935
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

100
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:44,686
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You just get better through practice.

101
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:47,381
It's a completely different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

102
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:50,516
So I had the doctors test
Sammy's response to conditioning.

103
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:52,632
Just pick up any three objects.

104
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:54,797
That's a test?

105
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,863
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

106
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,413
Sorry.

107
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:02,742
Ta-da!

108
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:06,023
Ow! What the fuck?

109
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:09,141
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Well, test this, you fucking quack!

110
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:12,055
<i>Some of the objects were electrified.</i>

111
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,054
<i>They'd give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test...</i>

112
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,789
always with the same objects electrified.

113
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:20,631
The point was to see if Sammy could learn
to avoid the electrified objects...

114
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,711
not by memory, but by instinct.

115
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:25,844
They kept testing Sammy for months...

116
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,979
Always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

117
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,890
Ow! What the fuck?

118
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:34,553
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

119
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,661
Even with total short-term memory loss...

120
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:40,216
<i>Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop
picking up the wrong objects.</i>

121
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:44,059
<i>All the previous cases responded to conditioning.
Sammy didn't respond at all.</i>

122
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:48,070
<i>It was enough to suggest that his condition
was psychological, not physical.</i>

123
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:51,164
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

124
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,695
His wife got stuck with the bills,
and I got a big promotion.

125
00:08:57,258 --> 00:09:00,147
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy.
-So he became helpless.

126
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,938
But it works for me.

127
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:04,962
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

128
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,429
Habit and routine make my life possible.

129
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,168
Conditioning.

130
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:10,884
Acting on instinct.

131
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:14,585
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him.

132
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:16,841
And fighting the company's decision...

133
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:20,476
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

134
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,242
<i>- I never said that Sammy was faking.</i>
- Listen. I have an idea.

135
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,930
Sammy, I have an idea.

136
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,471
<i>Just that his problem was mental, not physical.</i>

137
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:32,033
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

138
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:34,422
<i>- But she couldn't understand.</i>
And you're gonna have a pad. Like that.

139
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,744
...in your pocket. - I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

140
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,185
Now, we're gonna deal with it. We'll figure out..
We're gonna try a little harder.

141
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,153
<i>She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person,</i>

142
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:45,506
<i>and if it's not a physical problem,
he should just.. snap out of it.</i>

143
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:48,191
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called?

144
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:51,422
- Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!
- Okay. I'm sorry!

145
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:55,216
- I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.
- Try harder!

146
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:03,086
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt...

147
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,108
just like he gave it to the doctors.

148
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:08,811
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.

149
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,496
Well, what Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was
that you can't bully someone into remembering.

150
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,086
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

151
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:26,344
Well, then call m.. call me back?

152
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:02,836
Who is this?

153
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:06,499
Yeah.

154
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:08,023
Uh-huh.

155
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:12,797
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

156
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:16,417
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle.
Can you hang on a sec?

157
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:28,586
The police report mentioned
the drugs found in the car outside my house.

158
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,438
The car was stolen,
but his prints were all over it.

159
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:33,020
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy of it.

160
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,727
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

161
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:39,786
In my condition, it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

162
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:43,354
I have to summarize the different sections.
And there's pages missing.

163
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:44,992
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

164
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,162
I don't know why these are crossed out.

165
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,665
But they weren't even looking for John G.

166
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,236
The stuff they found in the car just fit in with
what they believed had happened

167
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,761
so they didn't chase any of it up.

168
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:59,461
There's something about the drugs stashed
in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

169
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:01,938
Because the police claim
the guy was an addict

170
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:03,996
needing money to score,
which I think is bullshit

171
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:07,617
'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

172
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,250
Well, I think John G. Left it there.
Or planted it there.

173
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,547
How do you know that?

174
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,199
Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

175
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,656
So he's a dealer.

176
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:23,277
Hang on a sec.

177
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,506
Now we're getting somewhere.

178
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,007
I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously;

179
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,261
this is a difficult condition
for people to understand.

180
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:44,367
I mean, look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn't deal with it...

181
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,338
I told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out of it.

182
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:50,496
Eventually she came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

183
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,866
<i>She told me about life with
Sammy - how she treated him.</i>

184
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,216
Thank you for seeing me.

185
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,058
You know, it got to the point where she'd get Sammy
to hide food all around the house,

186
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,718
and then she'd stop feeding him
to see if his hunger

187
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:01,417
would make him remember
where he'd hidden the food.

188
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,682
<i>She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted old Sammy back.</i>

189
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:10,474
Mr. Shelby. You know all about Sammy
and you've decided that he's faking.

190
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,524
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position
isn't that Sammy is faking anything,

191
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:15,463
just that his condition can't be shown to be ph...

192
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:18,482
I just want to know what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

193
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:22,142
Ah... We shouldn't even be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

194
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,011
I'm not appealing the decision.

195
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:25,417
Then why are you here?

196
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,859
Try to understand.
When I look at Sammy...

197
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,477
I don't see some...

198
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:31,554
Vegetable.

199
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,144
I see my same old Sammy.

200
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:39,197
What do you think that's like for me
to suspect that he might be imagining

201
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:41,942
this whole problem, and that if I
just could say the right thing,

202
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,803
he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal?

203
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,320
If I...

204
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,461
If I knew that my
old Sammy were truly gone,

205
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:58,310
then I could say good-bye
and start loving this new Sammy.

206
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:03,615
As long as I have doubt, I can't
say good-bye and move on.

207
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,437
What do you want from me?

208
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:09,097
I want you to forget the company
you work for for 30 seconds and...

209
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:12,828
tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition?

210
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,398
I need to know...

211
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,517
what you honestly believe.

212
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:26,273
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

213
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,367
Thank you.

214
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:41,172
I thought I helped her.
I thought she just needed some kind of answer.

215
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:43,205
I didn't think it was important
what the answer was...

216
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:45,379
Just that she had one to believe.

217
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:46,904
<i>"FACT 5:
DRUGDEALER"</i>

218
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:55,582
No! She shouldn't have
given me that responsibility.

219
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:58,417
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor...

220
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,234
Yeah, I guess.

221
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,176
But I've got all sorts of other considerations.

222
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,716

224
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:14,516
Who is this?

225
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:43,706
Front desk?

226
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,115
Burt. Right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

227
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,609
Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't want any calls.

228
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,586
Nope. None at all.

229
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,915
<i>Hello?</i>

230
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:07,691
<i>It's Burt, from the front desk.</i>

231
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,959
- Yeah?
- Ah.. I know you said you didn't want any calls,

232
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:15,492
but this guy called..
He's on the phone now. -He says he's a cop.

233
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:17,148
- A cop?
- Yeah.

234
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,578
And, ah...

235
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,917
He says you're really gonna wanna
know what he has to say so, ah...

236
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:24,028
No, I'm not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.

237
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:25,553
Kay. Wh...what...

238
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,345
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?!

239
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:20,018
I know you're a cop, but what do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

240
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,595
I don't know, something bad, maybe, I ah...

241
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:29,285
Why are you asking me? I can't remember
what I've done. You wouldn't believe me anyway.

242
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,446
Because of my condition!
You don't believe someone with this condition!

243
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,620
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

244
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:38,977
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

245
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:43,066
Oh, it's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility...

246
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,539
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

247
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,398
You know the truth about my condition, Officer?

248
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,319
You don't know anything.

249
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:53,289
You feel angry. You don't know why.

250
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,849
You feel guilty...
You have no idea why.

251
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:00,537
You could do anything...
Not have the faintest idea 10 minutes later.

252
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,403
Like Sammy.
What if I've done something like Sammy?

253
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:04,879
I didn't tell you?

254
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,734
What happened to Sammy and his wife?

255
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,468
She came to see me at my office.
I thought she was just trying to catch me off guard,

256
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:14,229
<i>so I didn't tell her what I really thought,
but I never said that he was faking it.</i>

257
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:16,595
<i>Just that his condition was mental - not physical.</i>

258
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,761
<i>I found out later that she went home,
and gave Sammy his final exam...</i>

259
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,016
<i>Sammy?</i>

260
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:24,695
It's time for my shot.

261
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:41,862
<i>She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.</i>

262
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:44,929
<i>So she found a way to test him.</i>

263
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:59,406
Sammy?

264
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:01,891
It's time for my shot.

265
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:15,126
<i>She really thought she'd call his bluff.</i>
There you go.

266
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:19,379
<i>Or she just.. didn't wanna live
with the things she'd put him through.</i>

267
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,586
Sammy?

268
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:34,461
It's time for my shot.

269
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:42,578
I won't hurt.

270
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:28,424
<i>She went into a coma and never recovered.</i>

271
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:32,567
<i>Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.</i>

272
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:38,622
He's been in a home ever since...
<i>He doesn't even know that his wife is dead...

273
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,393
I was wrong about Sammy.

274
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:44,063
And I was wrong about his wife.
She wasn't interested in the money...

275
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,947
She just needed to understand his problem.

276
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:50,463
<i>His brain didn't respond to conditioning.
But he wasn't a con-man.</i>

277
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:54,151
<i>And when she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.</i>

278
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:56,592
<i>When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.</i>

279
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,766
Now I know. You fake it.

280
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:01,737
If you think you're supposed to
recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

281
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,315
<i>You bluff it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors.</i>

282
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,266
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

283
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:12,758
What drug dealer?

284
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,682
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out
of the bar where his girlfriend works?

285
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:20,008
But he's not gonna bring her along,
he'll come by himself, right?

286
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:23,934
I always figured the drugs-angle
would be the best way to get him.

287
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:27,091
No, Officer.

288
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:28,615
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

289
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:30,984
You're in the lobby?

290
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,802
What do you look like?

291
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,933
I'll be right there.

292
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,215
Lenny!

293
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:23,394
Officer Gammell.

294
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,860
Yeah.

295
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:28,384
Come on.

296
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:46,538
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, you don't ah... Not here.

297
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:49,758
Over here.

298
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:57,683
Now, is it "Officer", or "Lieutenant" Gammell?

299
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,894
You know what? Don't write Gammell.
Just Teddy.

300
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,483
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

301
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:08,324
This is the directions where he's going.

302
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,883
- My number's on the bottom if you need me.
- You're not coming?

303
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
No, it wouldn't be appropriate.

304
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,097
Nice picture.

305
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:21,653
I look thin.

306
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:26,481
Hey, Lenny...

307
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:28,776
Make him beg.

308
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:52,812
<i>Teddy!</i>

309
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:57,402
<i>Hey, Teddy!</i>

310
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,108
Teddy!

311
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,035
Jimmy.

312
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,953
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

313
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:12,158
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man?

314
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:13,898
Do you remember me?

315
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:16,368
Yeah, I remember you.

316
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,940
Where the fuck's Teddy?

317
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,586
Well?

318
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:22,804
Ow!

319
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,668
Motherfuck..! Fuckin' retard!

320
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,056
Strip.

321
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,873
You're making a <i>big</i> fucking mistake, pal!

322
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,398
Strip!

323
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,755
My associates are not
the kind of people you wanna piss off.

324
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,280
Don't say anything else.

325
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:41,557
- I knew I couldn't trust that <i>fuck</i> !
- Take it off.

326
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:46,185
Cocksucker...

327
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:48,988
Your pants too.

328
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:52,353
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on'em.

329
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,100
Wow..wow..wo..wait wait wait wait.
- Did he tell you what I was bringing?!

330
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,625
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got 200.. 200 grand stashed in the car!

331
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,593
- Just take it! Just take it!
- What? You think you can bargain with me?

332
00:26:02,618 --> 00:26:05,182
- Just take the money and walk away!
- I don't want your fuckin' money.

333
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,566
Then what?

334
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:12,191
<i>- What do you want from me?
- I want my fuckin' life back!</i>

335
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,264
<i>Sammy...</i>

336
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:52,414
<i>He said "Sammy".
How does he know about Sammy?</i>

337
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,141
Oh, fuck...

338
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:16,346
<i>What have I done?!</i>

339
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:21,768
Hey, mister, I need help!
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

340
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,406
- We gotta get him to a doctor!
- All right.

341
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,598
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

342
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,726
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

343
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,328
- Is he still breathing?
- Oh, I don't know. Maybe.

344
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,422
What the hell were you guys doing down here?

345
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,586
Well... I don't remember. I have this condition.

346
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,491
I hope it's not as serious as his,
'cause this guy's dead.

347
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:45,281
Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!

348
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,847
So you remember me now, huh?!
You <i>are</i> a fuckin' cop...

349
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:51,897
Yeah! And I'm the guy
that helped you find him!

350
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:53,489
Get up! Get up!

351
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:56,206
Lenny, you got the wrong idea!

352
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,794
Who is that? He knew me.

353
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:03,525
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.

354
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,272
Bullshit! He's not the guy.

355
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,829
His name is James F. Grants.
<i>"John G."</i> -Check your tattoos!

356
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:11,871
- What was he bringing the 200 grand for?
- What?!

357
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:16,978
- What was it for?
- A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

358
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:20,224
- This a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

359
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:24,222
Look! Leonard, Jimmy's your guy.
I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side!

360
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:26,413
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn.

361
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,030
 He dealt out of there.

362
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:30,883
The guy at the front desk let him know
if anybody came snooping around.

363
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,578
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you
taking a picture of the dump!

364
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,290
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half!

365
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:39,189
He knew about Sammy! Why would I
tell him about fuckin' Sammy?!

366
00:29:39,214 --> 00:29:42,214
You tell everybody about Sammy!
-Everybody who'll listen!

367
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:44,320
<i>"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"</i>

368
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:47,792
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

369
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,363
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

370
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,898
There's nothing wrong with that!
We all do it.

371
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:55,767
Who cares if there's a few little details
you'd rather not remember?

372
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,738
What the fuck are you talking about?

373
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,262
I don't know.

374
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,113
Your wife surviving the assault...

375
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,662
Her not believing your condition.

376
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:10,171
The torment and pain and
anguish tearing her up inside.

377
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:12,305
The "insulin".

378
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:14,950
That's Sammy, not me.

379
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:16,246
I told you about Sammy.

380
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,251
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

381
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:21,367
"Conditioning" yourself to remember.

382
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:24,249
- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.

383
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:25,687
Sammy ended up in an institution..

384
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:27,473
Sammy was a con-man.

385
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,998
-A faker.

386
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:31,386
I never said that Sammy was faking.

387
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,757
You exposed him for what he was...
<i>-A fraud.</i>

388
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,445
And I was wrong...
That's the whole point!

389
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:40,778
- See, Sammy's wife came to me.
- Sammy didn't have a wife!

390
00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:45,701
It was <i>your</i> wife who had diabetes!

391
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:54,447
Ouch!

392
00:30:56,345 --> 00:30:57,845
My wife wasn't diabetic.

393
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,189
You sure?

394
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:07,626
- Ouch. <i>Cut it out.</i>
- She wasn't diabetic!

395
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:10,821
You think I don't know my own wife?

396
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,468
What the fuck is wrong with you?

397
00:31:12,492 --> 00:31:16,295
Well, I guess I can only make you remember
the things you wanna be true.

398
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:18,775
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

399
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:20,517
He was to you.

400
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,150
Come on! You got your revenge!
Enjoy it while you still remember.

401
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,966
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

402
00:31:27,658 --> 00:31:29,991
- It makes <i>all</i> the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

403
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:30,767
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

404
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,752
I will. Somehow I'll know.

405
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:35,004
- You won't remember!
- When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

406
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:38,775
I thought so too.
In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

407
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:43,517
That's right.

408
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,041
The real John G.

409
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,498
I helped you find him over a year ago.

410
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:48,642
He's already dead!

411
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,537
Don't lie to me anymore.

412
00:31:50,562 --> 00:31:52,062
Look, Lenny.

413
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,552
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case.

414
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:55,384
-I believed you.

415
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:57,623
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

416
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,810
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy
in your bathroom that night...

417
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:03,806
the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife?

418
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:06,209
We found him. You killed him.

419
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:09,811
But you didn't remember.

420
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,249
So I helped you...

421
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:13,509
start looking again...

422
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,533
Looking for the guy you already killed.

423
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,931
Oh yeah? So who was he?

424
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:20,525
Just some guy. I mean, does it even matter who?

425
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:22,456
<i>No reason, Lenny.</i>

426
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,940
<i>No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.</i>

427
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:29,926
Couple of junkies too strung out to
realize your wife didn't live alone.

428
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:33,471
But when you killed him, I was so convinced..

429
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:34,996
that you'd remember.

430
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:37,155
But it didn't stick.

431
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,721
Like nothing ever sticks...
Like this won't stick...

432
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,044
I took that picture...

433
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,859
Just when you did it.

434
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,920
Look how happy you are!

435
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:56,635
I wanted to see that face again.

436
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,051
Oh gee, thanks.

437
00:32:58,075 --> 00:32:59,575
Fuck you!

438
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,322
I gave you a reason to live!

439
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,971
And you were more than happy to help!

440
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:05,271
You don't want the truth...

441
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,072
You make up your own truth.

442
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:08,982
Like your police file.

443
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,625
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?

444
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,415
- You, probably.
- No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

445
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,235
- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle you could never solve?

446
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,666
You know how many.. how many towns...

447
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:23,900
How many John G.'s or James G.'s?

448
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:26,486
I mean.. Shit, Lenny. I'm a fucking John G.

449
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:29,357
- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

450
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:32,303
My name's John Edward Gammell.

451
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:36,572
Cheer up.
There's plenty of John G.'s for us to find.

452
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:42,658
All you do is moan.

453
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:45,138
I'm the one that has to live
with what you've done.

454
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:46,857
I'm the one that put it all together.

455
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,696
You wander around, you're playing detective...

456
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,649
You're living a dream, kid.

457
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:55,048
A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.

458
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,307
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

459
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:03,594
- I should kill you.
- Quit it. Lenny, come on.

460
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,178
You're not a killer.

461
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,820
<i>That's why you're so good at it!</i>

462
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,556
Come on... What are you doing?
You know what time it is?

463
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:14,981
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying!

464
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:18,383
Fuck..!

465
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:29,838
<i>I'm not a killer.</i>

466
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:32,900
<i>I'm just someone who wanted
to make things right.</i>

467
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,244
<i>Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?</i>

468
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:01,825
<i>Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?</i>

469
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,998
<i>You think I just want another puzzle to solve?</i>

470
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:20,572
<i>Another John G. to look for?</i>

471
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:23,973
<i>You're a John G.</i>

472
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,329
<i>So you can be my John G.</i>

473
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:38,367
<i>Do I lie to myself to be happy?</i>

474
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,470
<i>In your case, Teddy...</i>

475
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,639
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

476
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,019
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

477
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:02,570
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

478
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,662
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

479
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:07,234
Somebody'll recognize it!

480
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:12,501
You know... I think I'd rather be mistaken
for a dead guy than a killer.

481
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,740
I might hang on to this for a while.

482
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:17,886
Lenny.

483
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:19,518
Look. Don't let me...

484
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,094
Will you help me find the keys?!

485
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:23,873
Help me find my keys!

486
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:25,764
Lenny!

487
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:27,516
Wai...

488
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,598
Lenny!

489
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:49,078
<i>I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.</i>

490
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:52,128
<i>I have to believe that
my actions still have meaning...</i>

491
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:54,153
<i>even if I can't remember them.</i>

492
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:58,784
<i>I have to believe
that when my eyes are closed...</i>

493
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:00,351
<i>the world's still here.</i>

494
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,377
<i>Do I believe the world's still here?</i>

495
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:09,129
<i>Is it still out there?</i>

496
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:14,512
<i>Yeah.</i>

497
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:19,073
<i>We all need mirrors
to remind ourselves who we are.</i>

498
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:23,121
<i>I'm no different.</i>

499
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:55,908
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

500
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,939
- It's okay. We know each other, right kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

501
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,322
Oh, the Jag's out front.
-Should have put it around back.

502
00:38:01,803 --> 00:38:03,309
What are you still doing here, Lenny?

503
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:04,892
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

504
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:07,732
Well, I guess I just wanted to get
something down before it slipped my mind.

505
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:10,155
- Alright then, give me the keys. I'll move it for ya.
- It'll be alright for a minute.

506
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,335
Wait out there!

507
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,626
For cryin'...

508
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,633
Look, give me a minute.
I gotta get something for you.

509
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:22,646
<i>Fact six: Car license SG137IU.</i>

510
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:30,328
Good.

511
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:31,852
Give me a minute, will ya?

512
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:36,871
- A'right, we gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

513
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:40,100
Oh, my man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

514
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,542
- It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore.
- Why not?

515
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:44,422
Because that cop's looking for ya.

516
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,223
Now, I gotta get you a new
identity, some new clothes.

517
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:49,779
A different car would do for now.
So put these on!

518
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:51,304
Woa woa. What cop?

519
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:54,132
He's a bad cop.

520
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,997
He's the one that checked
you into the Discount Inn.

521
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:59,519
He's been calling you for days now, telling you shit,
slipping envelopes under your door. Shit like that.

522
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:00,450
How do you know this?

523
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:01,418
He told me.

524
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:03,562
He thinks it's funny.
He's been laughing at ya.

525
00:39:03,586 --> 00:39:04,280
You're full of shit.

526
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:07,313
No, I'm not. He knows you're no good on the phone,
so he's been calling you up.

527
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,898
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

528
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:12,054
so he slips shit under your door to scare you
into answering the phone again.

529
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,170
Giving you a line of crap about John G.
being some local drug dealer.

530
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:16,695
- Jimmy Grants.

531
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:20,580
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard... Jimmy's the drug dealer.

532
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,657
The cop wants to know how his operation's run.

533
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:25,290
He's got some score in mind.
Somehow you're involved.

534
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:26,853
Uh-huh. How do you know him?

535
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,332
I'm a snitch.

536
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:31,994
He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

537
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:34,897
If he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

538
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:39,148
So take these clothes, put them on,
and get the fuck out of here!

539
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:41,441
Come on, Leonard. Just go!

540
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:03,906
You are full of shit!

541
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:08,247
<i>"Come by after. Natalie."</i>

542
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,830
<i>"Ferdy's Bar."</i>

543
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:54,011
Hey, Jimmy.

544
00:40:56,793 --> 00:40:59,091
I'm sorry.
I uh.. thought you were somebody else.

545
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:01,656
Sorry.

546
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,050
That's okay.

547
00:41:28,844 --> 00:41:30,210
I'll have a beer, please.

548
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:31,951
- What do you want?
- A beer, please.

549
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:34,850
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

550
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,209
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

551
00:41:37,234 --> 00:41:38,734
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.

552
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:40,467
Well, that's me.

553
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:42,047
Yeah. We met before, right?

554
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:46,202
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know. Why don't you tell me.

555
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:49,067
I don't remember. I have no short-term memory.
It's not amnesia.

556
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,225
- You're the Memory Guy.
- How do you know about me?

557
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:54,059
My boyfriend told me about you.

558
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:55,584
- Oh yeah? Who's your boyfriend?

559
00:41:56,438 --> 00:41:57,938
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

560
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,883
No.

561
00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:02,414
Well, he knows you.

562
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:04,078
He told me about you.

563
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:05,663
He said you were staying at the Discount.

564
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:08,632
In fact, a cop came by earlier,
was looking for you.

565
00:42:09,714 --> 00:42:11,379
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything

566
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,307
wouldn't know how he got here
or what he'd done.

567
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,234
-Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.

568
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,758
Well, you know chronic alcoholism is
one cause of short-term memory loss.

569
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:24,609
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name's Leonard.

570
00:42:25,195 --> 00:42:26,695
Did Teddy send you?

571
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,440
I don't know.

572
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:30,289
What's happened to Jimmy?

573
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,590
I don't know that either. Sorry.

574
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:34,023
You don't remember anything?

575
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:37,006
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done?

576
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:39,278
No. I can't make new memories.

577
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:41,046
Everything just fades.

578
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:42,571
Then why did you come here?

579
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,102
I found this in my pocket.

580
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:48,718
<i>Your</i>  pocket...

581
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:15,298
Bar bet.

582
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:16,897
Care to contribute?

583
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:18,558
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

584
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:21,722
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

585
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:35,918
Thank you.

586
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:54,872
- On the house.
- Thanks.

587
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:02,433
Ah, you really do have a problem.

588
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:05,212
Just like that cop said.

589
00:44:05,506 --> 00:44:06,749
Hm?

590
00:44:06,773 --> 00:44:08,273
Your condition.

591
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,710
Well, nobody's perfect.

592
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:13,867
What's the last thing...

593
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:15,771
that you do remember?

594
00:44:18,902 --> 00:44:20,538
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

595
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,625
Dying.

596
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:24,969
I remember my wife dying.

597
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,281
Let me uh... get you another one.

598
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:34,823
I think this one is dusty.

599
00:44:41,274 --> 00:44:45,026
You can uh... You crash on the couch.
It's comfortable.

600
00:44:45,336 --> 00:44:47,422
Just have a seat.

601
00:44:47,737 --> 00:44:49,237
Thanks.

602
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:55,995
So, how long do you think it's gonna take you?

603
00:44:57,234 --> 00:44:57,843
Hm?

604
00:44:57,867 --> 00:45:00,447
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife?

605
00:45:01,391 --> 00:45:05,582
Oh well, it depends on if he's
here in town or if he's moved on.

606
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:08,438
I have my file here.

607
00:45:10,953 --> 00:45:14,113
Can I ask you something?
If you have all of that information...

608
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,892
then why haven't the police
found him for you?

609
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:20,484
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

610
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:22,805
They don't think he exists.

611
00:45:23,594 --> 00:45:25,686
You see, I told them what I remembered.

612
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,000
I was asleep.

613
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:30,734
Something woke me up.

614
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:38,336
<i>Her side ofthe bed was cold.
She'd obviously been out of bed for a while.</i>

615
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,195
There had to be a second man.

616
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,277
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

617
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:44,552
It's about the last thing that I do remember.

618
00:46:44,813 --> 00:46:47,132
Look. The police did not believe me.
If we check the police...

619
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:50,916
<i>How did they explain what you do remember?</i>
-The gun and stuff.

620
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:55,998
John G. was clever.

621
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:57,999
He was clever.

622
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:02,377
See, he took the dead man's gun,
he replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.

623
00:47:03,078 --> 00:47:07,469
He left my gun, and he left the get away car.
He gave the police a complete package.

624
00:47:07,664 --> 00:47:11,193
They found the sap, with my blood on it,
in the dead man's hand.

625
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:13,938
And they only found my gun.

626
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,497
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

627
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:21,936
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts,
and I had brain damage.

628
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:24,711
See, the cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

629
00:47:24,736 --> 00:47:28,116
Leonard, you can stay here
for a couple of days if it'll help you.

630
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:31,975
Oh, well, thanks.

631
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:34,617
I have to go back to work.

632
00:47:34,664 --> 00:47:36,652
So, just make yourself at home.

633
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:39,847
You can watch TV or
you can have some food.

634
00:47:39,892 --> 00:47:42,591
Whatever you want, okay?
Make yourself at home.

635
00:47:42,954 --> 00:47:44,454
One thing...

636
00:47:47,078 --> 00:47:48,578
Something to remember you by.

637
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:50,229
My name is Natalie.

638
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:53,683
<i>"Natalie."</i>

639
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,374
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

640
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:33,388
- Who?
- He calls himself Dodd.

641
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:34,564
What does he want?

642
00:48:34,588 --> 00:48:36,137
He wants to know what happened
to Jimmy and his money

643
00:48:36,162 --> 00:48:38,133
he thinks I have it, he thinks I took it.

644
00:48:38,277 --> 00:48:39,777
Huh... Well, did you?

645
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:41,687
No.

646
00:48:45,486 --> 00:48:47,316
- What's this all about?
- Fuck!

647
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,594
You don't have a fucking clue, do you?
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?

648
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:54,789
- I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

649
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:58,461
Probably know more about it than you do.
You don't have a fucking clue about anything else.

650
00:48:58,945 --> 00:48:59,649
What happened?

651
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:02,585
What happened is that Jimmy
went to meet some guy named Teddy.

652
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:05,517
He took a lot of money with him,
and he never came back.

653
00:49:05,627 --> 00:49:09,486
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy, or how well.

654
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,901
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him!

655
00:49:10,925 --> 00:49:12,093
- I'm not.
- Help me.

656
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,617
How?

657
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,220
Get rid of Dodd for me.

658
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:17,921
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

659
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:20,832
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money!

660
00:49:20,892 --> 00:49:22,665
What then? Love?

661
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:24,747
What would you kill for?

662
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:26,364
You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?

663
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,410
That's different!

664
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:29,861
Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her!

665
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:31,110
Hey, don't talk about my wife!

666
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,639
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

667
00:49:34,068 --> 00:49:36,086
I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember.

668
00:49:36,111 --> 00:49:37,986
I could call your wife a fucking whore
and we could still be friends.

669
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:40,142
- Calm down.
- Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.

670
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:44,008
- You don't know how, you fucking idiot!
- Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

671
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:47,213
Well, maybe it does. How the fuck would
you know? You don't know a fucking thing!

672
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,892
- You can't get scared, but hey... Can you get angry?
- Yes!

673
00:49:52,265 --> 00:49:54,054
You pathetic piece of shit!

674
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,673
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

675
00:49:56,713 --> 00:49:59,419
and you won't have a fucking clue,
you fucking retard!

676
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:01,835
- Shut your mouth.
- You know what? I'm gonna use you.

677
00:50:02,213 --> 00:50:04,213
I'm telling you now,
because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

678
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:07,425
if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak!

679
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,923
Did you lose your pen?

680
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:11,265
Well, that's too bad, freak.

681
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:13,722
Otherwise, you could write yourself
a little note about how much

682
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:17,001
Natalie hates your retarded guts and
that I called your wife a fuckin' whore.

683
00:50:17,026 --> 00:50:19,666
- Hey, don't say another fuckin' word!
- About your whore of a wife?

684
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,212
I read about your condition, Leonard.

685
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:30,886
You know what one of the causes
of short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.

686
00:50:30,911 --> 00:50:34,765
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife
sucked one too many diseased cocks

687
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,174
and turned you into a fucking retard!

688
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:42,548
You sad... sad freak.

689
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:46,504
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

690
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:48,767
and you won't remember.

691
00:50:50,252 --> 00:50:52,302
We'll still be best friends...

692
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,720
or maybe, even lovers.

693
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:00,221
Fuck.

694
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:06,773
I'll see you soon.

695
00:51:13,922 --> 00:51:17,112
<i>Stay focused.
Find a pen.</i>

696
00:51:17,419 --> 00:51:20,201
<i>Gotta write this down.
Gotta write it down.</i>

697
00:51:21,984 --> 00:51:24,447
<i>Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.</i>

698
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,494
<i>Keep it in mind.
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.</i>

699
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:33,547
<i>Come on. Gotta find a pen.
I gotta find a pen.</i>

700
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:37,094
<i>Gotta write this down.
Write this down, exactly what happened.</i>

701
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,728
<i>Gonna write down exactly what happened.
Come on. Come on. Come on!</i>

702
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:41,343
<i>I gotta find a pen. Geez! Come on.</i>

703
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,817
<i>Keep focused. Keep focused.</i>

704
00:51:45,338 --> 00:51:47,650
<i>Keep it in mind.
Come on. Find a pen.</i>

705
00:51:47,675 --> 00:51:49,549
<i>Write this note.
Write down what happened.</i>

706
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:52,379
<i>Write it down. Write it down.
Come on! Concentrate. Keep it in mind.</i>

707
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:54,084
<i>Find a pe....</i>

708
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,056
What happened?

709
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,097
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

710
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,465
Who?

711
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:07,989
Who?!

712
00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:10,719
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

713
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:12,414
- Why?
- Why?! Because of you!

714
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:15,105
Because I did what you told me to do!
-Go in and reason with him!

715
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:19,153
- Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!
- Calm down. Calm down. Take it easy.

716
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,678
You're safe. It's okay.

717
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,413
Come on. Just sit down.

718
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:26,603
Sit down.

719
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:28,127
Here. Sit down.

720
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,314
Okay. You're okay.

721
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,353
I'll just get some ice, for your face.

722
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,158
Here.

723
00:52:49,502 --> 00:52:51,759
I did exactly what you told me to do.

724
00:52:52,994 --> 00:52:54,494
I went to Dodd...

725
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:58,877
and I told him that I...
I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

726
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:02,002
or the drugs...

727
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:06,673
and that this Teddy,
must have taken everything.

728
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:08,681
And what did he say?

729
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:11,338
He didn't believe me.

730
00:53:14,384 --> 00:53:17,157
He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me,

731
00:53:17,182 --> 00:53:19,364
and then he just.. he just started hitting me.

732
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:24,586
Where is he?

733
00:53:24,611 --> 00:53:26,111
Why?

734
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:28,417
- I'll go see him.
- And?

735
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:31,279
I'll give him some bruises of his own and
tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

736
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,810
Ah, he'll kill you, Lenny.

737
00:53:36,736 --> 00:53:38,236
My wife used to call me Lenny.

738
00:53:38,457 --> 00:53:39,957
Yeah?

739
00:53:41,207 --> 00:53:42,707
Yeah, I hated it.

740
00:53:44,697 --> 00:53:48,867
This guy... This guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, okay?

741
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,298
No, no. You just tell me what he looks like...

742
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,482
and where I can find him.

743
00:53:54,506 --> 00:53:56,006
Have you got a pen?

744
00:53:56,572 --> 00:53:58,072
In my purse.

745
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:10,148
He'll uh... He'll probably find you.

746
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:11,837
What do you mean?

747
00:54:11,861 --> 00:54:13,908
I told him about your car.

748
00:54:14,486 --> 00:54:15,986
Why?

749
00:54:17,642 --> 00:54:20,048
He was beating the shit out of me,
I had to tell him something.

750
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:23,407
Just write it all down.

751
00:54:38,644 --> 00:54:40,144
Be careful.

752
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:42,181
I'll be fine.

753
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:52,009
A car this nice, you should lock...

754
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,701
- Who the fuck are you?!
- Teddy.

755
00:54:54,056 --> 00:54:55,118
- Your buddy!
- Prove it!

756
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:56,867
Sammy. Remember Sammy?

757
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:58,395
You told me about Sammy!

758
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:02,420
Geez!

759
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:04,070
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

760
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:05,908
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?

761
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:08,172
Do you even know why you're here?

762
00:55:08,197 --> 00:55:09,804
Unfinished business.

763
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:11,422
Lenny, let me inform you...

764
00:55:11,793 --> 00:55:14,460
Your business here is very much finished...

765
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:16,384
<i>You're still here because of Natalie.</i>

766
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,161
Who's Natalie?

767
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:20,276
Schmuck, whose house do you think you just walked out of?

768
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:24,852
Oh, that's right. Take a look at your pictures.

769
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:26,377
I bet you got one of her.

770
00:55:28,314 --> 00:55:30,264
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz.

771
00:55:31,378 --> 00:55:32,967
You wanna make a note...

772
00:55:33,407 --> 00:55:35,629
- You can't trust her.
- Oh yeah? Why's that?

773
00:55:35,654 --> 00:55:38,871
Because by now she's taking a
look at this suit, and the car

774
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:43,581
and she's starting to figure out ways of
turning the situation to her advantage.

775
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:47,227
She's already got you stayin' with her, for Christ' sakes!

776
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:50,149
You can't go back in there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.

777
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:53,146
<i>You're lucky I ran into you.
Broad's bad news.</i>

778
00:55:53,171 --> 00:55:56,363
- What do you mean, bad news?
- She's involved with drugs.

779
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:58,627
Alright, look. These.
You see these?

780
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:01,587
This is the bar where she works.

781
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:03,112
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

782
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,398
She takes orders for him,
arranges meets.

783
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:09,135
He writes answers on the back of these.

784
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:12,113
Then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

785
00:56:12,138 --> 00:56:13,638
Why should I care?

786
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,838
Because when she gets jammed up...

787
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:19,220
she's gonna use you to protect herself.
- From whom?

788
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:22,527
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend...

789
00:56:22,552 --> 00:56:24,376
Guys are gonna come after her.

790
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:26,211
Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

791
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:27,887
Somebody always pays.

792
00:56:27,912 --> 00:56:29,477
Maybe she'll make it you.

793
00:56:29,502 --> 00:56:30,411
Oh yeah?

794
00:56:30,435 --> 00:56:32,008
Or maybe she'll make it you?

795
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:34,526
Is that it?
You worry if she's gonna use me against you?

796
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,744
- No.
- Why not?

797
00:56:37,705 --> 00:56:39,630
Because she doesn't know who I am.

798
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,763
-Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

799
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:47,933
She doesn't know anything about your
investigation, okay Einstein?

800
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:49,971
So write this down.

801
00:56:50,685 --> 00:56:52,332
When she offers to help,

802
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:55,414
it'll be for her own reasons.

803
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:57,211
I'm not lying.

804
00:56:57,236 --> 00:56:58,984
Take my pen.

805
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:00,509
Write this down;

806
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,339
<i>Do not trust her.</i>

807
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:11,716
There. You happy now?

808
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:13,664
I won't be happy until you leave town.

809
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:15,189
I know.

810
00:57:15,455 --> 00:57:19,503
You ever wonder how long you can hang around
here before people start asking questions?

811
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:22,363
- What sort of questions?
- The same sort of questions you should be asking yourself!

812
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:23,376
Like what?

813
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,458
Like how did you get this suit?
The car.

814
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,748
- I have money.
- From what?

815
00:57:26,772 --> 00:57:28,272
My wife's death.

816
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:30,611
I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.

817
00:57:30,783 --> 00:57:32,283
Oh...

818
00:57:32,525 --> 00:57:35,939
So in your grief you wandered
into a Jaguar dealership...

819
00:57:38,361 --> 00:57:39,861
You don't have a clue, do you.

820
00:57:40,736 --> 00:57:42,856
- You don't even know who you are.
- Yes I do.

821
00:57:43,384 --> 00:57:44,884
I don't have amnesia.

822
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,146
I remember everything right
up until the incident.

823
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:48,985
I am Leonard Shelby.
I am from San Francisco...

824
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,830
That's who you were.

825
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,185
You do not know who you are!

826
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:55,178
What you've become since...

827
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:57,494
the incident.

828
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:59,791
You wander around playing detective.

829
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:02,228
You don't even know how long ago it was.

830
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:05,642
Let me put it this way;

831
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:08,604
Were you wearing designer suits
when you sold insurance?

832
00:58:08,629 --> 00:58:11,948
- I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.
- Right, right. You're an investigator.

833
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:16,049
Or maybe you should start investigating yourself.

834
00:58:16,548 --> 00:58:18,048
Thank you for the advice.

835
00:58:20,486 --> 00:58:22,916
Look, do me a favor.
Don't go back in there.

836
00:58:23,658 --> 00:58:25,838
Will you take the motel out of town?

837
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:30,986
It's been fun, Lenny.

838
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:40,017
<i>"Do not trust her."</i>

839
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:42,627
<i>"Don't believe his lies."</i>

840
00:58:57,392 --> 00:58:58,892
Fuck it. I need my own place.

841
00:59:56,978 --> 00:59:58,478
Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.

842
01:00:01,459 --> 01:00:02,959
Well... that's what they say.

843
01:00:03,627 --> 01:00:05,869
<i>The Discount Inn. 304.</i>

844
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,236
Leonard.

845
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,161
<i>Well, what then?</i>

846
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:14,270
We just go to bed.
You.. wait for me to fall asleep.

847
01:00:14,295 --> 01:00:16,273
Go into the bathroom and just.. slam the door.

848
01:00:16,298 --> 01:00:18,657
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

849
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:19,885
And that's it?

850
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,409
That's it.

851
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:26,166
Yeah, first I just need you to put
these things around the room.

852
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:32,541
Just pretend they're your things
and that this is your bedroom.

853
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:46,388
- Should I wear it?
<i>- No no no, ah...</i>

854
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:49,267
You know... just like you
took it off, or.. something.

855
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:55,056
I.. I.. I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

856
01:00:56,095 --> 01:00:58,884
Ju.. I just.. I just mean, put them
around.. the room, you know, as if..

857
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:01,112
as if they were your.. your  things.

858
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:07,820
Whatever gets you off.

859
01:02:03,911 --> 01:02:05,411
Honey?

860
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:08,753
Honey, it's late.

861
01:02:31,342 --> 01:02:32,842
Everything okay?

862
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,771
You okay in there?

863
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:57,519
Was it good for you?

864
01:03:00,055 --> 01:03:02,680
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

865
01:03:03,786 --> 01:03:05,286
No.

866
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:08,756
I'd like you to leave now.

867
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,538
Ouch.
<i>Cut it out.</i>

868
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,338
How can you read that again?

869
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:12,431
It's good.

870
01:05:13,088 --> 01:05:14,978
Yeah, but you've read it,
like, a thousand times.

871
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:16,892
I enjoy it.

872
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,590
I always thought the pleasure of a book
was in wanting to know what happens next.

873
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:22,115
Look, don't be a prick.

874
01:05:22,556 --> 01:05:25,252
I'm not reading it to annoy you.
I enjoy it.

875
01:05:25,994 --> 01:05:27,494
Just let me read.

876
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:29,322
Please.

877
01:05:39,705 --> 01:05:41,205
<i>Probably tried this before.</i>

878
01:05:44,142 --> 01:05:46,530
<i>Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.</i>

879
01:05:49,517 --> 01:05:51,021
<i>Can't remember to forget you.</i>

880
01:06:19,262 --> 01:06:20,762
<i>Do I know this guy?</i>

881
01:06:22,293 --> 01:06:23,881
<i>He seems to know me.</i>

882
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:30,098
What the fuck?!

883
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,466
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

884
01:06:45,658 --> 01:06:47,968
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

885
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,462
What, I haven't made a strong
enough impression on you?

886
01:06:50,487 --> 01:06:52,487
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

887
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,340
<i>Okay. So what am I doing?</i>

888
01:07:08,463 --> 01:07:10,463
<i>Oh, I'm chasing this guy.</i>

889
01:07:12,937 --> 01:07:15,562
<i>No. He's chasing me...</i>

890
01:07:37,746 --> 01:07:39,746
Fuck.

891
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:45,326
<i>"Dodd. White guy.</i>

892
01:07:45,351 --> 01:07:47,351
<i>Mountcrest Inn on 5th Street."</i>

893
01:07:48,754 --> 01:07:50,754
<i>I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.</i>

894
01:08:27,406 --> 01:08:28,906
Oh, fuck...

895
01:08:31,864 --> 01:08:33,364
Sorry.

896
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:08,383
<i>I need a weapon.</i>

897
01:09:12,198 --> 01:09:13,698
<i>This'll do.</i>

898
01:09:36,775 --> 01:09:39,158
<i>Hmm... I don't feel drunk...</i>

899
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,105
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Oh, shit.

900
01:10:53,129 --> 01:10:54,499
<i>Housekeeping.</i>

901
01:10:54,523 --> 01:10:55,453
Not right now..!

902
01:10:55,477 --> 01:10:56,977
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

903
01:11:25,807 --> 01:11:29,813
<i>"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
OR just get RID of him for NATALIE."</i>

904
01:11:35,973 --> 01:11:37,473
<i>"Dodd."</i>

905
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,422
<i>"Get rid of him.</i>

906
01:11:44,753 --> 01:11:46,253
<i>Ask Natalie."</i>

907
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:49,142
<i>Teddy, Teddy.</i>

908
01:12:00,193 --> 01:12:02,254
<i>Yeah, leave your number.
You know what to do.

909
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:04,844
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

910
01:12:05,244 --> 01:12:07,189
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn
of 5th Street, Room 6.

911
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:09,949
I need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It's important.

912
01:12:10,312 --> 01:12:11,923
Oh, this is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

913
01:12:15,173 --> 01:12:16,673
Phew...

914
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:18,619
Fuck...

915
01:12:34,427 --> 01:12:35,927
<i>Awake.</i>

916
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:39,094
<i>Where am I?</i>

917
01:12:40,775 --> 01:12:42,275
<i>Motel room.</i>

918
01:12:48,986 --> 01:12:50,978
<i>Some anonymous motel room.</i>

919
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:57,603
<i>Nothing in the drawers,
but I'll take a look anyway.</i>

920
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,794
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bi...</i>

921
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,650
<i>Bible...</i>

922
01:13:16,324 --> 01:13:18,257
<i>Lenny! Open up!</i>

923
01:13:20,357 --> 01:13:21,857
Just a minute!

924
01:13:21,895 --> 01:13:23,395
<i>Open the door.</i>

925
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:27,115
<i>Lenny!</i>

926
01:13:29,766 --> 01:13:31,266
<i>Open the door!</i>

927
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,720
<i>Come on!</i>

928
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:40,223
Hi, Teddy.

929
01:13:40,247 --> 01:13:41,747
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

930
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:56,275
Oh.. I get it.

931
01:13:57,392 --> 01:13:58,657
Amorous neighbors.

932
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:00,181
What are you doing here?

933
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,637
You called me. You said you needed my help.

934
01:14:04,056 --> 01:14:06,648
You know, I've had more rewarding
friendships than this one...

935
01:14:07,502 --> 01:14:10,366
Although I do get to keep
telling the same jokes.

936
01:14:11,306 --> 01:14:12,806
The fuck is that?

937
01:14:18,809 --> 01:14:19,859
Who the fuck is that?

938
01:14:19,883 --> 01:14:22,143
- You don't know him?
- No! Should I?!

939
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:24,392
Wait a minute...

940
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:26,928
- Is that John G.?
- I don't think so.

941
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:28,904
-You don't think so? You don't know?
You didn't write it down?!

942
01:14:28,929 --> 01:14:31,689
- I might've fallen asleep before I did.
- For Christ' sakes!

943
01:14:33,794 --> 01:14:35,294
Ask him.

944
01:14:39,377 --> 01:14:40,877
What's your name?

945
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:42,606
Your name.

946
01:14:42,706 --> 01:14:44,506
- Dodd.
- Who did this to you?

947
01:14:44,722 --> 01:14:46,301
- What?
- Who did this to you?

948
01:14:47,244 --> 01:14:48,744
You did.

949
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:55,344
- Look, I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.
- No no no, just let me think for a minute.

950
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:03,267
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?

951
01:15:03,478 --> 01:15:04,693
- Natalie who?
- Why?

952
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:06,250
Maybe I know her.

953
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:07,775
Look. We gotta get him out of here.

954
01:15:09,033 --> 01:15:10,533
All right, all right, all right.

955
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,712
A'ight, he's gotta have a car, right?

956
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:17,453
So we take him down to his car, we tell him to get
the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

957
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:19,478
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding!

958
01:15:19,502 --> 01:15:21,377
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know!

959
01:15:21,828 --> 01:15:23,328
You don't know.

960
01:15:26,274 --> 01:15:27,887
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

961
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,907
It must be his room. Great! Let's go.

962
01:15:29,932 --> 01:15:32,210
- No no no no no no, we can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

963
01:15:32,235 --> 01:15:36,435
Because, the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

964
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:40,588
Okay. We untie him...

965
01:15:40,806 --> 01:15:43,211
We clean him up, and we march him
out of here with a gun in his back.

966
01:15:43,236 --> 01:15:44,123
A gun?

967
01:15:44,147 --> 01:15:45,647
Why would I have a gun?

968
01:15:46,658 --> 01:15:48,171
It must be his.

969
01:15:48,196 --> 01:15:50,243
I don't think they'd let
someone like me carry a gun.

970
01:15:52,392 --> 01:15:53,892
Fuckin' hope not..

971
01:16:00,486 --> 01:16:01,986
Which one?

972
01:16:05,222 --> 01:16:07,582
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

973
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:08,827
Shut up.

974
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:10,720
Yeah, that's alright for you to say.
-You're the one with the Jag.

975
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:12,245
Alright, get in.

976
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,184
I'm gonna ride with him.
You follow us.

977
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:15,709
Give me your keys.

978
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:17,653
Take your own car!

979
01:16:46,336 --> 01:16:49,191
- So, was he scared?
- Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache.

980
01:16:49,446 --> 01:16:52,129
- Fuck you.
- You should have stolen his car.

981
01:16:52,184 --> 01:16:55,270
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothin'. You wanna trade?

982
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:00,693
So what do you do now?

983
01:17:00,969 --> 01:17:02,969
I'm going to find out
what the fuck that was all about.

984
01:17:23,701 --> 01:17:26,221
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?

985
01:17:30,093 --> 01:17:32,903
- Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
- What the fuck have you got me into?

986
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:34,427
Shh, come inside.

987
01:17:37,727 --> 01:17:40,234
- Who is he?!
- Calm down. Okay?

988
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:44,652
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It has nothing to do with your investigation.

989
01:17:44,677 --> 01:17:45,660
How did you get me into this?

990
01:17:45,684 --> 01:17:48,128
You offered to help when you saw
what he did to my face.

991
01:17:48,153 --> 01:17:49,536
How do I know he did that to your face?!

992
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,830
Because I came straight to you after he did it.
I showed you what he did,

993
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:55,317
and I asked you to help me.
- Oh, and I just take your word?

994
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:56,841
Yeah.

995
01:17:57,704 --> 01:17:59,204
Something doesn't feel right.

996
01:17:59,521 --> 01:18:02,215
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

997
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,455
- Did you?
- What?

998
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:04,979
Kill him?

999
01:18:05,111 --> 01:18:06,157
Of course not!

1000
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:09,294
Hey. What..
Sit down, okay? Sit.

1001
01:18:09,325 --> 01:18:12,872
This.. has nothing to do with you.

1002
01:18:13,302 --> 01:18:15,935
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

1003
01:18:16,285 --> 01:18:17,801
You have to burn them.

1004
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:23,912
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust yourself.

1005
01:18:23,936 --> 01:18:26,204
Trust your own judgment.
You can question everything.

1006
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:28,021
You can never know anything for sure.

1007
01:18:28,372 --> 01:18:31,728
- There are things you know for sure.
- Such as?

1008
01:18:33,153 --> 01:18:35,851
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it.

1009
01:18:36,038 --> 01:18:38,004
I know what that's gonna
feel like when I pick it up.

1010
01:18:38,443 --> 01:18:39,536
See?

1011
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,684
Certainties.
It's the kind of memory you take for granted.

1012
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,184
You know... I can remember so much.

1013
01:18:48,403 --> 01:18:49,903
The feel of the world...

1014
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:51,794
and her.

1015
01:18:58,427 --> 01:18:59,927
She's gone.

1016
01:19:00,254 --> 01:19:03,892
And the present is trivia..
Which I scribble down as fucking notes!

1017
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:06,621
Hey.. hey. Come on. Try and relax. Come on.

1018
01:19:06,646 --> 01:19:09,794
It's not easy for me to relax, you know?

1019
01:19:10,472 --> 01:19:11,982
Come on. Take your jacket off.

1020
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:14,708
Now. Come on.

1021
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:18,141
Hey.

1022
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,521
Didn't think you were the type.

1023
01:19:30,169 --> 01:19:31,669
It's backwards.

1024
01:19:33,138 --> 01:19:34,458
Come here.

1025
01:19:34,482 --> 01:19:35,982
Come here!

1026
01:19:57,489 --> 01:19:58,989
What about here?

1027
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,513
Maybe it's.. for when I find him.

1028
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,880
I've lost somebody too.

1029
01:20:10,552 --> 01:20:12,052
I'm sorry.

1030
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,285
His name was Jimmy.

1031
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,801
What happened to him?

1032
01:20:15,825 --> 01:20:19,052
He went to meet somebody..
-He never came back.

1033
01:20:20,513 --> 01:20:23,052
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

1034
01:20:24,818 --> 01:20:28,983
- What do the police think?
- They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy...

1035
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:35,005
When you find this guy, this John G...

1036
01:20:36,372 --> 01:20:37,872
What are you gonna do?

1037
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:41,232
I'm gonna kill him.

1038
01:20:43,403 --> 01:20:45,536
Maybe I can help you find him.

1039
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:52,763
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

1040
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,162
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

1041
01:21:02,927 --> 01:21:05,015
Because she's gone to
the bathroom or something.

1042
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,732
But somehow I just...

1043
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:16,020
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

1044
01:21:21,896 --> 01:21:23,266
If I could just...

1045
01:21:24,107 --> 01:21:27,390
reach over and touch
her side of the bed...

1046
01:21:29,114 --> 01:21:31,169
I would know that it was cold.

1047
01:21:34,099 --> 01:21:35,599
But I can't.

1048
01:21:40,653 --> 01:21:42,747
I know I can't have her back.

1049
01:21:43,896 --> 01:21:45,925
But I don't want to wake up in the morning...

1050
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,450
thinking she's still here.

1051
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:53,457
I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

1052
01:22:00,225 --> 01:22:01,725
So how...

1053
01:22:02,474 --> 01:22:04,224
How can I heal?

1054
01:22:07,169 --> 01:22:09,769
How am I supposed to heal
if I can't...

1055
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:12,226
feel time?

1056
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:27,710
<i>"She has also lost someone.</i>

1057
01:23:28,114 --> 01:23:29,852
<i>She will help you out of pity."</i>

1058
01:23:57,677 --> 01:23:59,177
<i>Awake.</i>

1059
01:24:00,974 --> 01:24:02,474
Where am I?

1060
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:08,206
Somebody's bedroom.

1061
01:24:10,177 --> 01:24:11,920
It must be her room.

1062
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:14,966
But who is she?

1063
01:24:23,732 --> 01:24:25,232
It's only me.

1064
01:24:27,755 --> 01:24:30,474
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?

1065
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:35,388
Oh, shit.. Shit.. I gotta be someplace.

1066
01:24:40,571 --> 01:24:42,071
It's pretty weird.

1067
01:24:42,622 --> 01:24:44,122
It's useful.

1068
01:24:44,627 --> 01:24:49,372
- You never write a phone number on your hand?
- I uhm.. I should be able to talk to my friend...

1069
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:51,865
today about the license plate.

1070
01:24:52,364 --> 01:24:53,864
Yeah, the license plate.

1071
01:24:54,114 --> 01:24:56,200
John G.'s license plate.

1072
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:01,872
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

1073
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:21,036
<i>"Natalie."</i>

1074
01:25:23,693 --> 01:25:25,842
<i>"She has also lost someone.</i>

1075
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,177
<i>She will help you out of pity."</i>

1076
01:25:33,345 --> 01:25:34,654
If it's registered in this state...

1077
01:25:34,678 --> 01:25:38,090
it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.

1078
01:25:38,115 --> 01:25:39,896
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

1079
01:25:39,921 --> 01:25:43,567
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.

1080
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:53,982
You know.. it's great that you...

1081
01:25:55,997 --> 01:25:57,497
Well, that you're...

1082
01:25:57,958 --> 01:25:59,777
Helping me.. like this.

1083
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:01,825
I'm helping you...

1084
01:26:02,271 --> 01:26:03,771
because you helped me.

1085
01:26:15,724 --> 01:26:17,495
So next time you see me,

1086
01:26:18,364 --> 01:26:19,864
will you remember me?

1087
01:26:36,716 --> 01:26:38,216
I think you will.

1088
01:26:40,427 --> 01:26:41,927
I'm sorry.

1089
01:26:45,068 --> 01:26:47,881
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

1090
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:05,217
Yo, Lenny!

1091
01:27:05,621 --> 01:27:08,638
- I thought you split for good.
- Well, things change.

1092
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:11,448
- So I see.
- My name's Teddy.

1093
01:27:11,473 --> 01:27:15,242
- I guess I've.. told you about my condition.
- Only every time I see you.

1094
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:17,044
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

1095
01:27:22,544 --> 01:27:24,505
Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?

1096
01:27:24,732 --> 01:27:26,872
Yeah.
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

1097
01:27:27,732 --> 01:27:29,896
What about John G?
You think he's still here?

1098
01:27:29,927 --> 01:27:32,273
- Who?
- Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.

1099
01:27:32,298 --> 01:27:34,535
I mean, that's why you haven't left town, am I right?

1100
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,928
- Maybe.
- Leonard, look. You have to be very careful.

1101
01:27:37,953 --> 01:27:39,776
- Why?
- The other day you mentioned that maybe

1102
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:42,129
 somebody was trying to set you up...

1103
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:43,473
Get you to kill the wrong guy.

1104
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:46,200
Oh well, I go on facts, not
recommendations, but thank you.

1105
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,155
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

1106
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,949
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

1107
01:27:52,974 --> 01:27:53,969
Memory's unreliable.

1108
01:27:53,994 --> 01:27:55,219
- Oh, please!
- No no no, really.

1109
01:27:55,244 --> 01:27:57,058
 Memory's not perfect. 
It's not even that good.

1110
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,372
Ask the police.

1111
01:27:58,396 --> 01:28:00,232
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

1112
01:28:00,257 --> 01:28:03,154
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

1113
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:06,714
They collect facts, they make notes,
and they draw conclusions.

1114
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:08,239
Facts, not memories.

1115
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:11,463
That's how you investigate.
I know. It's what I used to do.

1116
01:28:11,622 --> 01:28:15,210
Look, memory can change the shape of a room.
It can change the color of a car.

1117
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:17,208
And memories can be distorted.

1118
01:28:17,771 --> 01:28:19,905
They're just an interpretation,
they're not a record.

1119
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:21,987
And they're irrelevant if you have the facts.

1120
01:28:22,919 --> 01:28:24,948
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

1121
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:27,829
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

1122
01:28:30,864 --> 01:28:32,590
He destroyed my ability to live.

1123
01:28:36,794 --> 01:28:38,294
You're living.

1124
01:28:39,403 --> 01:28:40,903
Only for revenge...

1125
01:28:41,364 --> 01:28:43,903
Then we'll get the bastard.
Where you staying?

1126
01:28:47,117 --> 01:28:48,617
Discount Inn.

1127
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,113
I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

1128
01:28:52,138 --> 01:28:53,638
Probably left it in your room.

1129
01:29:09,146 --> 01:29:12,278
Hi. I'm checked in here,
but I think I've misplaced my key.

1130
01:29:12,536 --> 01:29:14,036
How you doing, Leonard?

1131
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,880
Probably in the room, right?

1132
01:29:34,888 --> 01:29:35,934
Don't see my key anywhere.

1133
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:37,527
Oh, shit, This is the wrong room.

1134
01:29:37,552 --> 01:29:39,958
You're in 304 now. I'm sorry.
I fucked up.

1135
01:29:40,221 --> 01:29:42,732
- This is not my room?
- No. Come on, let's go.

1136
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:44,989
Then why is this my handwriting?

1137
01:29:49,552 --> 01:29:51,052
This <i>was</i> your room..

1138
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:52,583
But now you're in 304.

1139
01:29:52,708 --> 01:29:54,840
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

1140
01:29:54,864 --> 01:29:57,049
But then I rented you
another room on top of it.

1141
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,731
- Why?
- Business is slow, I mean, I.. I...

1142
01:29:59,756 --> 01:30:02,349
I.. I told my boss about the...
your condition and stuff...

1143
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,349
and he said,
"Try and rent him another room."

1144
01:30:04,568 --> 01:30:06,878
How many rooms am I checked
into in this shit-hole?

1145
01:30:06,903 --> 01:30:08,208
<i>Just two...</i>

1146
01:30:08,232 --> 01:30:09,559
So far...

1147
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:11,059
<i>Well...</i>

1148
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,881
At least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

1149
01:30:13,161 --> 01:30:15,048
Well, you're not gonna remember anyway.

1150
01:30:15,294 --> 01:30:16,811
You don't have to be <i>that</i> honest, Burt.

1151
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:19,112
Leonard..

1152
01:30:19,183 --> 01:30:20,886
<i>Always</i> get a receipt.

1153
01:30:21,467 --> 01:30:23,358
Oh yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

1154
01:30:26,232 --> 01:30:28,587
<i>- What time is it?</i>
- Quarter to 1:00.

1155
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,091
Y...

1156
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,380
Your room's...

1157
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,328
<i>"Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet Natalie for info"</i>

1158
01:30:58,153 --> 01:31:01,997
<i>"She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity."</i>

1159
01:31:19,693 --> 01:31:21,444
- Natalie..
- You don't remember me.

1160
01:31:22,325 --> 01:31:25,568
- I'm sorry, I should have explained. I have this cond...
- You did explain, Lenny.

1161
01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:27,583
Please call me Leonard.

1162
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:28,684
My wife called me Lenny.

1163
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:30,129
Yeah, I know. You told me.

1164
01:31:30,153 --> 01:31:33,147
- Well, then I probably told you how much I hated it.
- Yeah.

1165
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:36,771
Do you mind taking your glasses off?

1166
01:31:36,796 --> 01:31:38,296
It's hard for me to...

1167
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:40,727
Thanks.

1168
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:43,989
- So you have information for me?
- Is that what your little note says?

1169
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,333
Yeah.

1170
01:31:45,357 --> 01:31:48,447
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper;

1171
01:31:48,472 --> 01:31:50,516
You mix your laundry list
with your grocery list,

1172
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:52,696
and you'll end up eating your
underwear for breakfast.

1173
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:56,119
I guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

1174
01:31:57,177 --> 01:31:59,938
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

1175
01:32:00,935 --> 01:32:03,605
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

1176
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:08,638
I do have information for you.

1177
01:32:09,489 --> 01:32:11,966
You gave me a license plate number.

1178
01:32:12,489 --> 01:32:14,522
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

1179
01:32:15,635 --> 01:32:17,612
Guess what name came up...

1180
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:21,509
"John Edward Gammell". -John G.

1181
01:32:22,266 --> 01:32:23,348
Do you know him?

1182
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:24,708
No.

1183
01:32:24,732 --> 01:32:27,698
But his face on his driver's license
looked really familiar, I think he...

1184
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,797
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

1185
01:32:29,935 --> 01:32:32,755
Here's a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.

1186
01:32:33,997 --> 01:32:37,224
- Are you sure you want this?
- Have I told you what this man did?

1187
01:32:37,435 --> 01:32:39,973
- Yeah.
- Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.

1188
01:32:39,997 --> 01:32:42,944
But even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

1189
01:32:43,232 --> 01:32:45,070
You're not even gonna
know that it happened.

1190
01:32:45,095 --> 01:32:48,722
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make
any difference whether I know about it.

1191
01:32:48,747 --> 01:32:52,513
Just because there are things I don't
remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.

1192
01:32:52,919 --> 01:32:55,584
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes, does it?

1193
01:32:57,005 --> 01:32:58,254
Anyway...

1194
01:32:58,278 --> 01:33:00,373
Maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself.

1195
01:33:00,919 --> 01:33:02,564
Get another freaky tattoo...

1196
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:08,833
Tell me about her again.

1197
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:13,745
- Why?
- Because you like to remember her.

1198
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,091
She was beautiful.

1199
01:33:20,427 --> 01:33:22,056
- To me, she was perfect.
- No.

1200
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:24,979
Don't just recite the words.

1201
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:27,867
Close your eyes,

1202
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:29,989
and remember her.

1203
01:33:41,357 --> 01:33:43,433
You can just feel the details.

1204
01:33:45,755 --> 01:33:48,567
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

1205
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:55,600
And you can feel these extreme moments...

1206
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:58,130
<i>even if you don't want to.</i>

1207
01:34:01,161 --> 01:34:03,700
<i>You put these
together, and you get a feel of a person.</i>

1208
01:34:07,169 --> 01:34:09,167
<i>Enough to know how much you miss them.</i>

1209
01:34:14,966 --> 01:34:17,633
<i>And how much we hate the person who took them away.</i>

1210
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,136
I uhm...

1211
01:34:29,161 --> 01:34:32,419
I added an address in here.
It might be useful.

1212
01:34:32,447 --> 01:34:34,426
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

1213
01:34:34,451 --> 01:34:37,877
Uhm, a guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

1214
01:34:40,193 --> 01:34:41,693
It's isolated.

1215
01:34:41,935 --> 01:34:43,435
Sounds perfect.

1216
01:34:45,991 --> 01:34:49,261
- Do I owe you any...
- Nah, I wasn't helping you for money.

1217
01:34:49,286 --> 01:34:51,648
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1218
01:34:51,672 --> 01:34:53,419
See, you have this.. condition.

1219
01:34:55,943 --> 01:35:00,589
Oh, you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304?
You left it at my place.

1220
01:35:05,387 --> 01:35:06,887
Yeah.

1221
01:35:08,793 --> 01:35:11,818
- They treating you okay?
- I don't remember.

1222
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:16,794
You know what we have in common?

1223
01:35:18,122 --> 01:35:20,691
We are both survivors.

1224
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:25,427
You take care, Leonard.

1226
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:28,368

You left these at your table.

01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:32,013
Thanks.
Ah... Lincoln Street?

1228
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:34,851
Oh, yeah, just go straight out on
6th Street. Go east all the way...

1229
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:37,403
- Hold on. I'm gonna write this down.
- Oh, it's easy, just go...

1230
01:36:37,427 --> 01:36:39,434
Trust me. I need to write this down.

- Hi.
- Hi.

I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.

- Uhm...
- Burt.

1255
01:41:47,052 --> 01:41:50,369
Burt. I'm not sure.. I think I may
have asked you to hold my calls.

1256
01:41:50,394 --> 01:41:53,340
- You don't know?
- I think I may have, I'm not good on the phone.

1257
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:55,872
Right. You said you like to look people
in the eye when you talk to them.

1258
01:41:55,897 --> 01:41:57,397
Yeah.

1259
01:41:57,858 --> 01:42:00,099
- You don't remember saying that?
- Well, that's the thing..

1260
01:42:00,124 --> 01:42:01,629

I have this condition.

1261
01:42:01,654 --> 01:42:03,972
- A condition?
- It's my memory.

1262
01:42:03,997 --> 01:42:06,377
- Amnesia?
No, no, no, no, it's different from that,

1263
01:42:06,402 --> 01:42:07,761

I have no short-term memory.

1264
01:42:07,786 --> 01:42:10,645
I know who I am. I know all
about myself. I just...

1265
01:42:10,669 --> 01:42:13,566
Since my injury, I can't make new memories.

1266
01:42:13,591 --> 01:42:15,339
Everything fades.

1267
01:42:15,364 --> 01:42:17,366
If we talk for too long,
I'll forget how we started,

1268
01:42:17,391 --> 01:42:19,829
and the next time I see you,
I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

1269
01:42:21,009 --> 01:42:22,956
I don't even know if I've met you before...

1270
01:42:23,896 --> 01:42:26,677
So, if I seem a little strange,
or rude or something...

1271
01:42:26,702 --> 01:42:28,202
eh..

1272
01:42:30,036 --> 01:42:31,452
I've told you this before, haven't I?

1273
01:42:31,476 --> 01:42:34,839
Yeah, I mean.. I don't mean to
mess with you, but it's so weird.

1274
01:42:34,864 --> 01:42:36,842
You don't remember me at all?

1275
01:42:37,112 --> 01:42:37,934
No.

1276
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:40,740
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

1277
01:42:41,956 --> 01:42:43,755
What's the last thing you remember?

1278
01:42:44,255 --> 01:42:45,755
My wife.

1279
01:42:46,544 --> 01:42:48,044
What's it like?

1280
01:42:53,021 --> 01:42:54,521
It's like waking.

1281
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:56,336
It's like you just woke up.

1282
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,450
<i>That must suck.</i>

1283
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:01,732
It's all backwards, I mean..

1284
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:03,262
Like...

1285
01:43:03,286 --> 01:43:07,537
Maybe you get an idea what about what you wanna to do next,
but you don't remember what you just did?

1286
01:43:07,896 --> 01:43:11,225
- I mean, I'm exactly the opposite, I...
- How long have I been staying here?

1287
01:43:11,903 --> 01:43:13,878
- Couple of days.
- And you're holding my calls?

1288
01:43:13,903 --> 01:43:17,810
- Like you said.
- Okay. But this guy's an exception.

1289
01:43:18,356 --> 01:43:19,856
Do you know this guy?

1290
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,505
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
- What makes you think he's my friend?

1291
01:43:24,513 --> 01:43:25,997
I just saw you together, that's all.

1292
01:43:26,021 --> 01:43:27,639
- He's not my friend.
- Okay.

1293
01:43:28,451 --> 01:43:30,139
If he calls or if he shows up here...

1294
01:43:30,271 --> 01:43:31,771
you give me a call in my room, okay?

1295
01:43:31,902 --> 01:43:33,402
What, his name's Teddy?

1296
01:43:33,469 --> 01:43:34,969
- Teddy, yeah.
- All right.

1297
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:39,590
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

1298
01:43:39,615 --> 01:43:42,000
No, not as long as
you remember to pay the bill.

1299
01:43:42,782 --> 01:43:44,282
Yeah. Okay.

1300
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,543
- Forty.
- Forty.

1301
01:43:48,306 --> 01:43:49,806
This guy...

1302
01:43:51,435 --> 01:43:52,935
He's here already.

1303
01:43:54,716 --> 01:43:56,216
Lenny!

1304
01:43:56,758 --> 01:43:58,258
It's Leonard.

1305
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:02,997
- Like I told you before.
- Did you? I must have forgot.

1306
01:44:04,597 --> 01:44:06,496
I guess I've already
told you about my condition.

1307
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:08,874
Oh well, only every time I see ya.

1308
01:44:18,523 --> 01:44:20,595
- My car.
- This is your car!

1309
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:22,246
Oh, you're in a playful mood?

1310
01:44:23,927 --> 01:44:26,160
It's not good to make fun
of someone's handicap.

1311
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,454
Just trying to have a little fun.

1312
01:44:35,236 --> 01:44:36,753
Roll up your window.

1313
01:44:43,309 --> 01:44:45,746
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.

1314
01:44:47,356 --> 01:44:50,519
- So where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

1315
01:44:50,544 --> 01:44:52,310
Oh, what the hell you wanna go there for?

1316
01:44:52,335 --> 01:44:54,920
- You know it?
- Yeah. It's just this fucked-up building.

1317
01:44:54,945 --> 01:44:56,546
- Why do you wanna go there?

1318
01:44:57,053 --> 01:44:58,553
Don't remember.

1319
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:22,335
- Looks like somebody's home.
- Nah, that thing's been here for years.

1320
01:45:25,814 --> 01:45:27,911
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

1321
01:45:28,654 --> 01:45:30,995
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

1322
01:45:33,044 --> 01:45:34,544
Come on!

1323
01:45:42,172 --> 01:45:43,672
Let's take a look inside.

1324
01:46:02,224 --> 01:46:03,724
<i>"Teddy."</i>

1325
01:46:04,094 --> 01:46:06,454

He is the one.</i>

1326
01:46:07,107 --> 01:46:08,286
<i>Kill him."</i>

1327
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,810
<i>I finally found him.</i>

1328
01:46:10,122 --> 01:46:11,974
<i>How long have I been looking?</i>

1329
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,388
Find anything?

1330
01:46:16,716 --> 01:46:18,216
Didn't think so.

1331
01:46:18,474 --> 01:46:19,974
Let's go, huh?

1332
01:46:20,088 --> 01:46:21,588
Oh, fuck this...

1333
01:46:23,799 --> 01:46:25,299
You're gonna pay for what you did.

1334
01:46:25,524 --> 01:46:27,511
Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.

1335
01:46:27,536 --> 01:46:29,036
Leonard.

1336
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,101
Y...

1337
01:46:32,125 --> 01:46:35,035
You don't have... a clue, you freak.

1338
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,779
Beg my wife's forgiveness....

1339
01:46:37,036 --> 01:46:39,024
before I blow.. your brains out.

1340
01:46:39,049 --> 01:46:42,467
Leonard! You don't know what's going on!

1341
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:44,595
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

1342
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:47,142
That's 'cause you read it
off a fucking picture.

1343
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:50,671
You don't know.. who <i>you</i> are.

1344
01:46:50,696 --> 01:46:52,972
I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.

1345
01:46:52,997 --> 01:46:57,077
That's who you were.
That's not what you've become.

1346
01:46:57,235 --> 01:46:59,485
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny?

1347
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,324
Come on.

1348
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,193
Come on. Let's go down to the basement.

1349
01:47:03,814 --> 01:47:05,503
Let's go down, you and me, together.

1350
01:47:06,035 --> 01:47:07,837
Then you'll know who you really are.

1351
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:13,884
No!

1352
01:47:16,101 --> 01:47:17,920
It's just an anonymous room.

1353
01:47:18,037 --> 01:47:18,980
It's a motel room.

1354
01:47:19,004 --> 01:47:20,248
There's the key..

1355
01:47:20,272 --> 01:47:23,910
It feels like maybe it's just the
first time you've been there but...

1356
01:47:23,935 --> 01:47:26,898
perhaps.. you've been there for a week..

1357
01:47:26,923 --> 01:47:28,423
Three months..

1358
01:47:28,774 --> 01:47:31,951
It's.. It's kinda hard to say.
I.. I don't know.

1359
01:47:31,976 --> 01:47:33,422
It's just.. an anonymous room.

01:47:36,526 --> 01:47:42,401
