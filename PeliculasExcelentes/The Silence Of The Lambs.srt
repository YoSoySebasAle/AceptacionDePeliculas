1
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,292
Starling.

2
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,795
Starling.

3
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,551
Crawford wants to see
you in his office.

4
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,344
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,810
- Clarice.
- Hey.

6
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,035
Hey, I got right to the end.

6
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,569
So there shouldn't be any
problem if you could...

7
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,154
- You looking for Crawford?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,577
He should be back in
a couple minutes.

9
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:43,782
Why don't you wait in his office?

10
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,866
Okay.

11
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,868
And I think they were
over in Flushing...

12
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,799
Starling,

13
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,761
Clarice M. Good morning.

14
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,262
Good morning, Mr Crawford.

15
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,682
Sorry to pull you off the
course at such short notice.

16
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,726
Your instructors tell
me you're doing well.

17
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,770
- Top quarter of your class.
- I hope so.

18
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,314
They haven't posted
any grades yet.

19
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,150
A job's come up, and
I thought about you.

20
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,111
Not a job really. More
of an interesting errand.

21
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,446
Sit down.

22
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,114
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,118
I remember you from
my seminar at UVA.

24
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,121
You grilled me pretty
hard, as I recall,

25
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,707
on the Bureau's civil rights
record in the Hoover years.

26
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,125
I gave you an "A."

27
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,627
A-minus, sir.

28
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,549
Let's see. Double major, psych and
criminology. Graduated magna.

29
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,302
Summer internships at
the Reitsinger Clinic.

30
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,304
It says here when you graduate,

31
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,391
you want to come to work for
me in Behavioural Science.

32
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,643
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

33
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,772
We're interviewing all the
serial killers now in custody

34
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,941
for a psycho-behavioural profile.

35
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,693
It could be a real help
in unsolved cases.

36
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,655
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

37
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,907
Do you spook easily, Starling?

38
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,617
Not yet, sir.

39
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,787
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.

40
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,665
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

41
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,333
And who's the subject?

42
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,710
The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

43
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,838
Hannibal the Cannibal.

44
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,841
I don't expect him to talk to you,

45
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,011
but I have to be able
to say we tried.

46
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,098
So if he won't cooperate, I
want just straight reporting.

47
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,183
How's he look? How's
his cell look?

48
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,893
Is he sketching, drawing?

49
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,187
If he is, what's he sketching?

50
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,943
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

51
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,866
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

52
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,869
Have your memo on my
desk by 0800 Wednesday.

53
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,120
Okay.

54
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,709
Excuse me, sir, but
why the urgency?

55
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,752
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

56
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,047
Is there some connection between
him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

57
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,716
I wish there were.

58
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,895
I want your full
attention, Starling.

59
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:51,896
Yes, sir.

60
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,639
Be very careful with
Hannibal Lecter.

61
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,516
Dr Chilton at the asylum

62
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,728
will go over all the physical
procedures used with him.

63
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,064
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,

64
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,109
and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.

65
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,779
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

66
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,866
Just do your job, but
never forget what he is.

67
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,159
And what is that?

68
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,369
Oh, he's a monster.

69
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,371
A pure psychopath.

70
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,208
So rare to capture one alive.

71
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,212
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

72
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,839
Well.

73
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,093
You know, we get a lot of
detectives here, but I must say,

74
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,804
I can't ever remember
one as attractive.

75
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,476
Will you be in
Baltimore overnight?

76
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,897
Because this can be quite a fun
town if you have the right guide.

77
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,651
Well, I'm sure this is a
great town, Dr Chilton,

78
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,142
but my instructions
are to talk to Dr...

79
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:52,614
Lecter and report
back this afternoon.

80
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,115
I see.

81
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,451
Let's make this quick, then.

82
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,286
We've tried to study
him, of course,

83
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,289
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

84
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,708
Oh, my, does he hate us.

85
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,794
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

86
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,298
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he? Using you.

87
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,716
What do you mean, sir?

88
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,511
A pretty young woman
to turn him on.

89
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,847
I don't believe Lecter's even
seen a woman in eight years.

90
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,183
And, oh, are you ever his taste.

91
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,810
So to speak.

92
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,063
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

93
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,358
Good. Then you should be
able to remember the rules.

94
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,655
Do not touch the glass. Do
not approach the glass.

95
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,075
You pass him nothing but soft
paper. No pencils or pens.

96
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,286
No staples or paper
clips on his paper.

97
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,705
Use the sliding food
carrier. No exceptions.

98
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,165
If he attempts to pass you
anything, do not accept it.

99
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,168
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

100
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,423
I'm going to show you why we
insist on such precautions.

101
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,134
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

102
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,178
he complained of chest pains and
was taken to the dispensary.

103
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,931
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

104
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,851
When the nurse leaned over
him, he did this to her.

105
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,857
The doctors managed to reset
her jaw, more or less,

106
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,442
save one of her eyes.

107
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,736
His pulse never got above 85,

108
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,196
even when he ate her tongue.

109
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,866
I keep him in here.

110
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,492
Dr Chilton.

111
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,372
If Lecter feels that
you're his enemy,

112
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,168
then, well, maybe we'll have
more luck if I go in by myself.

113
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,919
What do you think?

114
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,635
You might have suggested this in
my office and saved me the time.

115
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,131
Yes, sir, but then I
would have missed

116
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,223
the pleasure of your company, sir.

117
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,520
When she's finished,
bring her out.

118
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,342
Hi. I'm Barney.

119
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,428
He told you, don't
get near the glass?

120
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,931
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

121
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,974
Nice to meet you, Clarice.

122
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,560
You can hang your coat
up here if you like.

123
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,270
Thank you. I will.

124
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,692
He's past the others.
The last cell.

125
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,610
You keep to the right.

126
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,781
I put out a chair for you.

127
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,409
Oh, yes. That's very
good. Thank you.

128
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,454
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

129
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,383
Hi.

130
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,362
I can smell your cunt.

131
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,377
Good morning.

132
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,423
Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice
Starling. May I speak with you?

133
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,509
You're one of Jack
Crawford's, aren't you?

134
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,927
I am, yes, sir.

135
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,055
May I see your credentials?

136
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,766
Certainly.

137
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,357
Closer, please.

138
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,903
Closer.

139
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,712
That expires in one week.

140
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,507
You're not real FBI, are you?

141
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,301
I'm still in training
at the Academy.

142
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,013
Jack Crawford sent
a trainee to me?

143
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,390
Yes. I'm a student.

144
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,726
I'm here to learn from you.

145
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,144
Maybe you can decide for yourself

146
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,314
whether or not I'm qualified
enough to do that.

147
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,569
That is rather slippery
of you, Agent Starling.

148
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,783
Sit, please.

149
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,917
Now, then. Tell me,

150
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,253
what did Miggs say to you?

151
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,839
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

152
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,799
He hissed at you.

153
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,467
What did he say?

154
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,596
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

155
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,139
I see.

156
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,434
I myself cannot.

157
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,113
You use Evyan skin cream.

158
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,618
And sometimes you
wear L'Air du Temps,

159
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,538
but not today.

160
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,251
Did you do all these
drawings, Doctor?

161
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,007
That is the Duomo, seen
from the Belvedere.

162
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,135
You know Florence?

163
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,471
All that detail just
from memory, sir?

164
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,434
Memory, Agent Starling, is
what I have instead of a view.

165
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,643
Well,

166
00:14:55,728 --> 00:15:00,565
perhaps you'd care to lend us your
view on this questionnaire, sir.

167
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,984
Oh, no, no, no.

168
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,111
You were doing fine.

169
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,323
You had been courteous and
receptive to courtesy.

170
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,994
You had established trust with the
embarrassing truth about Miggs.

171
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,248
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

172
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,335
It won't do.

173
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,629
I'm only asking you to
look at this, Doctor.

174
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,797
Either you will or you won't.

175
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,924
Yeah.

176
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,676
Jack Crawford must
be very busy indeed,

177
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,596
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

178
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,515
Busy hunting that new
one, Buffalo Bill.

179
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,684
What a naughty boy he is.

180
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,605
Do you know why he's
called Buffalo Bill?

181
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,858
Please tell me. The
newspapers won't say.

182
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,779
Well, it started as a bad
joke in Kansas City Homicide.

183
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,616
They said, "This one likes
to skin his humps."

184
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,121
Why do you think he
removes their skins,

185
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,706
Agent Starling?

186
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,959
Enthral me with your acumen.

187
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,252
It excites him.

188
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,340
Most serial killers keep some sort
of trophies from their victims.

189
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,716
I didn't.

190
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,926
No.

191
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,678
No, you ate yours.

192
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,265
You send that through now.

193
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,335
Oh, Agent Starling,

194
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,922
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

195
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,507
No.

196
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,467
I thought that your knowledge...

197
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,803
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

198
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,430
You know what you look like to me

199
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,932
with your good bag and
your cheap shoes?

200
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,767
You look like a rube.

201
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,230
A well-scrubbed, hustling
rube with a little taste.

202
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,442
Good nutrition has given
you some length of bone,

203
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,862
but you're not more than one
generation from poor white trash,

204
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,864
are you, Agent Starling?

205
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,783
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

206
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,535
pure West Virginia.

207
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,413
What does your father
do? Is he a coal miner?

208
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,498
Does he stink of the lamp?

209
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,209
And, oh, how quickly
the boys found you.

210
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,318
All those tedious,
sticky fumblings

211
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,838
in the back seats of cars,

212
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,675
while you could only dream of
getting out, getting anywhere,

213
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,471
getting all the way to the FBI.

214
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,642
You see a lot, Doctor.

215
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,158
But are you strong
enough to point that

216
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,523
high-powered perception
at yourself?

217
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,068
What about it? Why don't you...

218
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,738
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

219
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,407
Maybe you're afraid to.

220
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,795
A census-taker once
tried to test me.

221
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,548
I ate his liver with
some fava beans,

222
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,675
and a nice Chianti.

223
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,395
You fly back to school
now, little Starling.

224
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,564
Fly, fly, fly.

225
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,375
I bit my wrist so I could die.

226
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,711
Look at the blood.

227
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,421
Gotcha.

228
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,550
Miggs. You stupid fuck.

229
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,512
Hannibal the Cannibal.

230
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,180
Agent Starling. Come back.

231
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,474
Agent Starling. Agent Starling.

232
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,143
I would not have had
that happen to you.

233
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,019
Discourtesy is
unspeakably ugly to me.

234
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,730
- Then do this test for me.
- No, but I will make you happy.

235
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,607
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

236
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,651
- And what is that, Doctor?
- Advancement, of course.

237
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,363
Now listen carefully. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

238
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,141
Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old

239
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:21,284
patient of mine.
M-o-f-e-t. Go now.

240
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,410
Doctor.

241
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,186
I don't think Miggs could
manage again quite so soon,

242
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:25,188
even though he is crazy.

243
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,581
Go now.

244
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,624
Hey, Bill.

245
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,295
Hey.

246
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,505
- Daddy.
- Hey, Clarice.

247
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,383
How are you?

248
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,345
Did you get any bad
guys today, Daddy?

249
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,431
- No, angel, they all got away.
- Aw, shoot.

250
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,287
FBI. Hands up. Don't move.

251
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,497
Turn around.

252
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,916
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

253
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,505
You're dead, Starling.

254
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,850
Johnson, good job. Good
entry. Good commands.

255
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,227
Starling, where's
your danger area?

256
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,228
In the corner, sir.

257
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,637
- Did you check the corner?
- No, sir.

258
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,846
That's the reason you're dead.

259
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,723
3109.

260
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,225
3109.

261
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,521
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

262
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,023
Rule 404...

263
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,795
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford?

264
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,171
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Ardelia.

265
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,132
- Starling?
- Sir?

266
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,592
Miggs is dead.

267
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,346
Dead? How?

268
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,103
The orderly heard
Lecter whispering to

269
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:51,809
him all afternoon,
and Miggs crying.

270
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,563
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

271
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,733
Starling?

272
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,068
Yeah, I'm still here, sir.

273
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,113
I just... I don't know
how to feel about this.

274
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,770
You don't have to
feel any way about

275
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,909
it. Lecter did it
to amuse himself.

276
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,662
Look, I know it got ugly today,

277
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,082
but you mentioned a
name at the end. Mofet.

278
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,043
Any follow-up on her?

279
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,588
Well, Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories

280
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,257
prior to capture, so there's no
record of anyone named Mofet.

281
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,553
But I thought the
"yourself" reference

282
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,221
was too hokey for Lecter,

283
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:33,601
so I figured, he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book,

284
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,146
and there's a "Your
Self Storage" facility,

285
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,482
right outside of
downtown Baltimore, sir.

286
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,571
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

287
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,365
prepaid in full.

288
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,866
The contract

289
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,953
is in the name of a
Miss Hester Mofet.

290
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,332
So nobody's been in
here since 1980?

291
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,376
Not to my knowledge.

292
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,922
Privacy is a great
concern to my customers.

293
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,716
Yes, I won't disturb
anything. I promise.

294
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,260
I'll be out of here
before you know it.

295
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,931
- Can I help you?
- Yes, actually, you can.

296
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,312
It's stuck.

297
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,107
We could return
tomorrow with my son.

298
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,817
What about him?

299
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:28,948
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labour.

300
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,991
Great.

301
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,620
Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

302
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,154
It's stuck.

303
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,322
Hand me that flashlight, sir.

304
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,042
Oh.

305
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,215
If this door should fall
down or anything else,

306
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,678
this is the number for our
Baltimore field office.

307
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,555
Now, they know that
you're with me.

308
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,724
You call them if
anything should happen.

309
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,392
Yes, Miss Starling.

310
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,878
Clarice...

311
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,348
They're waiting for
you. Watch yourself.

312
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,349
Thank you.

313
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,302
Hester Mofet. It's an
anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

314
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,556
Hester Mofet, "The rest of me."

315
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,268
"Miss The Rest Of Me," meaning
that you rented that garage?

316
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,722
Thank you.

317
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,308
Your bleeding has stopped.

318
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,937
How did you...

319
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,065
It's nothing.

320
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,150
It's just a scratch.

321
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,862
Dr Lecter, whose head
is in that bottle?

322
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,116
Why don't you ask me
about Buffalo Bill?

323
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,201
Why, do you know
something about him?

324
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,412
I might, if I saw the case file.

325
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,414
You could get that for me.

326
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,124
Why don't we talk
about Miss Mofet?

327
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,167
You wanted me to find him.

328
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,796
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

329
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,090
A former patient of mine,

330
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,636
whose romantic attachments ran
to, shall we say, the exotic.

331
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,805
I did not kill him, I assure you.

332
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,599
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,

333
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,185
after he'd missed
three appointments.

334
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,689
If you didn't kill him,
then who did, sir?

335
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,065
Who can say?

336
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,817
Best thing for him, really.

337
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,111
His therapy was going nowhere.

338
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,656
His dress, make-up...

339
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,117
Raspail was a transvestite?

340
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,578
In life? Oh, no.

341
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,997
Garden variety manic-depressive.

342
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,124
Tedious. Very tedious.

343
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,252
And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

344
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,714
a fledgling killer's first
effort at transformation.

345
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,675
How did you feel when
you saw him, Clarice?

346
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,178
Scared at first, then,

347
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,513
exhilarated.

348
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,475
Jack Crawford is helping
your career, isn't he?

349
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,603
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.

350
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,897
I never thought about it.

351
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,150
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

352
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,777
True, he is much older,

353
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,489
but do you think he visualises
scenarios, exchanges,

354
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,907
fucking you?

355
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,203
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

356
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,831
Frankly, it's the sort of
thing that Miggs would say.

357
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,210
Not any more.

358
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,552
Thank you, Barney.

359
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,809
What happened to your drawings?

360
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,437
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.

361
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,773
Just like that gospel program.

362
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,901
When you leave, they'll
turn the volume way up.

363
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,029
Dr Chilton does enjoy
his petty torments.

364
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,699
What did you mean by
transformation, Doctor?

365
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,586
I've been in this room for
eight years now, Clarice.

366
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,465
I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

367
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,093
What I want is a view.

368
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:50,430
I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.

369
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,677
I want to be in a
federal institution

370
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:54,101
far away from Dr Chilton.

371
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,728
What did you mean by
fledgling killer?

372
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,106
Are you saying that
he's killed again?

373
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,442
I'm offering you a psychological
profile on Buffalo Bill,

374
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,570
based on the case evidence.

375
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,411
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

376
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,295
You know who he is, don't you?

377
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,965
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

378
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,759
All good things to those who wait.

379
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,595
I've waited, Clarice,

380
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,514
but how long can you and
old Jackie boy wait?

381
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,975
Our little Billy must
already be searching

382
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,103

I'll be right there.

385
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,514
Oh, shoot.

386
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,814
Goddamn it.

387
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,449
Perfect. Jesus.

388
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,040
Can I help you with that?

389
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,168
- Would you?
- Sure.

390
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,921
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

391
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,382
- You look kind of handicapped.
- Yeah.

392
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,719
I got it this far. I just
can't get it up in the truck.

393
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,303
Here. Just grab this.

394
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,888
Okay.

395
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,099
Good. Just set it
down. That's good.

396
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,103
Get in the truck. I want
to push it all the way up.

397
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,355
I really appreciate
this. Thank you.

398
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,356
All right.

399
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,524
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

400
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,110
Just go all the way back.

401
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,779
Okay. Is this good?

402
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,364
Yeah, that's good.

403
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,410
- That's great.
- Okay.

404
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,246
Say, are you about a size 14?

405
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,581
Sorry?

406
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,978
Good.

407
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:47,125
Oh, good. Good.

408
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,226
Hold.

409
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,031
Starling.

410
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,452
Outside. Let's go.

411
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,540
Cindy, in the ring for
Starling. Let's go.

412
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,800
- FBI. Hold it.
- Hold it right there.

413
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,593
Saddle up. Pack your field
gear. You're moving out.

414
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,095
- You're going with Crawford.
- Where?

415
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,888
Found a girl's body
down in West Virginia.

416
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,470
Been in the water
about a week. Looks

417
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:44,891
like a Buffalo
Bill-type situation.

418
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,948
He keeps them alive for three
days. We don't know why.

419
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,201
There's no evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death.

420
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,288
All the mutilation you see
there is post-mortem.

421
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,331
Okay, three days.

422
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,085
Then he shoots them, skins
them, and dumps them.

423
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,171
Each body in a different river.

424
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,424
The water leaves us no trace
evidence of any kind.

425
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,135
That's Fredrica Bimmel,
the first one.

426
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,221
Her body was the only one he
took the trouble to weight down,

427
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,016
so actually, she was
the third girl found.

428
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,101
After her, he got lazy.

429
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,939
Okay. Let's see.

430
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,609
Circles where the
girls were abducted,

431
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,944
arrows where their
bodies were found.

432
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,198
This new one today washed up here.

433
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,741
Elk River, West Virginia.

434
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,305
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

435
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,807
Well, he's a white male.

436
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,561
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

437
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,687
He's not a drifter.

438
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,316
He's got his own house
somewhere, not an apartment.

439
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,401
Why?

440
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,653
What he does with
them takes privacy.

441
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,197
He's in his 30s or 40s.

442
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,574
He's got real physical strength,

443
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,661
combined with an older
man's self-control.

444
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,996
He's cautious, precise.

445
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,667
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

446
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,293
Why not?

447
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,507
He's got a real taste for it now.
He's getting better at his work.

448
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,843
Not bad, Starling.

449
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,221
- Questions?
- Yes, sir.

450
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,843
You haven't mentioned
anything about

451
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:50,684
the information
contained in my report

452
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,852
or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.

453
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,688
I'm considering it.

454
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,732
That's why you sent me
in there, isn't it?

455
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,985
To get his help on
Buffalo Bill, sir?

456
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,865
Well, if that was the
case, then I just...

457
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,660
I just wish I was in
on it. That's all.

458
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,204
If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

459
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,164
Lecter would have
known it instantly.

460
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,543
He would have toyed with
you, then turned to stone.

461
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,580
Excuse me. Sheriff Perkins,
these are the FBI people.

462
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,333
Sheriff Perkins.
Jack Crawford, FBI.

463
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,252
Special Agent Terry,
Agent Starling.

464
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,921
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

465
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,761
I didn't call you.
That was somebody

466
00:39:03,762 --> 00:39:05,300
from the State Attorney's office.

467
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,552
We'll extend you every
courtesy, but right now...

468
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:12,057
Sheriff, this type of sex
crime has certain aspects.

469
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,434
I'd just as soon
discuss in private.

470
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,311
You know what I mean?

471
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,644
Oscar, fetch Dr Akin
from the chapel.

472
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:09,645
Yes, sir.

473
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,884
Starling, we're back here.

474
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,095
Tell Lamar to come on when he's
finished playing his music.

475
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,397
Yeah. We'll be
sending in a minute.

476
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:16,941
Yeah. We'll be
sending in a minute.

477
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,766
Is this working?

478
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,561
I need a six-way link-up.

479
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,313
Chicago, Detroit...

480
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,772
What? What?

481
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,697
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.

482
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,033
You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.

483
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,701
There's things we
need to do for her.

484
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,620
I know that you all
brought her this far

485
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,372
and that her folks would
thank you if they could

486
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,750
for your kindness and
your sensitivity.

487
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,253
And now, please, go on now
and let us take care of her.

488
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,339
Go on, now.

489
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,760
Thank you.

490
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,848
Thank you.

491
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,018
Okay, good.

492
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,987
Yeah, that's right. West
Virginia. Elk River.

493
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,114
Stand by for transmission.

494
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,078
Ray.

495
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,260
Doctor, Lamar, let's
take a look at her.

496
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,111
Oh, Jesus.

497
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,453
Okay, Starling.

498
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,626
Bill.

499
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:29,147
Star-shaped contact entrance
wound over the sternum.

500
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,484
Muzzle stamp at the top.

501
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,987
- Wrongful death.
- "Wrongful death."

502
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,199
She'll have to go to the state
pathologist at Claxton.

503
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,577
Well, I better get
back to that service.

504
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,412
Lamar will help you.

505
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,247
Lord Almighty.

506
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,046
What else do you see, Starling?

507
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,299
Well, she's not local.

508
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,720
Her ears are pierced three
times, and there's...

509
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,058
Glitter nail polish. It
looks like town to me.

510
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,440
Two of her fingernails
are broken off,

511
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,069
and there's dirt or
grit under them.

512
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,323
It looks like she's tried to
claw her way through something.

513
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,902
Ray, get pictures
of her teeth. We'll

514
00:44:21,903 --> 00:44:23,242
fax them through Missing Persons.

515
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,452
Right.

516
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,922
Let's do another.

517
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,141
She's got something in her throat.

518
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,602
When a body comes
out of the water,

519
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,772
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

520
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,806
What is that, some
kind of seedpod?

521
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,017
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

522
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,521
But there's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

523
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,315
Not unless somebody
shoved it in there.

524
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,154
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.

525
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,502
Lamar, will you give
me a hand with this?

526
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:44,532
Yes, sir, I will.

527
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,873
Oh, Jack. What do
you make of these?

528
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,417
Different configuration
than the other victims.

529
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,793
Get close-ups.

530
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,505
Victim's skin removed this time in
two large diamond-shaped sections

531
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,798
above the buttocks.

532
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,411
Stellate exit wound level with the

533
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:04,260
second or the third
thoracic vertebrae

534
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,054
approximately six inches from
the right shoulder blade.

535
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,431
Starling?

536
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,338
When I told that sheriff we

537
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,436
shouldn't talk in
front of a woman,

538
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,354
that really burned you, didn't it?

539
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,858
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

540
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,860
It matters, Mr Crawford.

541
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,446
Cops look at you
to see how to act.

542
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,740
- It matters.
- Point taken.

543
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,707
Ligature marks found
around the wrists,

544
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,542
not around the ankles.

545
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,962
This would indicate that the
skinning was post-mortem.

546
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,445
Time, Pilch. My move.

547
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,405
No fair. You lured
him with produce.

548
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,699
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

549
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,744
Nice and slow, baby.

550
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,249
If the beetle moves one of your
men, does that still count?

551
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,252
Of course it counts.
How do you play?

552
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,129
Agent Starling?

553
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,426
Where the heck did this come
from? It's practically mush.

554
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,762
It was found behind the soft
palate of a murder victim.

555
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,098
The body was in the Elk
River, West Virginia.

556
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,558
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

557
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,393
I'm afraid I can't tell
you any more about that.

558
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,727
We heard about it on the radio.

559
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,106
You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case? Cool.

560
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,608
Just ignore him. He's not a PhD

561
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,112
A Sphingid Ceratomia, maybe.

562
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,072
Boy, he's a big sucker.

563
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,783
Okay.

564
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,827
Let's check morphology.

565
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,338
What do you do when you're not
detecting, Agent Starling?

566
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,426
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.

567
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,304
You ever go out for
cheeseburgers and beer?

568
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,348
The amusing house wine?

569
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,019
- Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
- Yes.

570
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,479
- Got you.
- What do you got, Roden?

571
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,817
Agent Starling, meet
Mr Acherontia styx.

572
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,903
Weird.

573
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,323
Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.

574
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,117
- And where does it come from?
- That's what's strange.

575
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,869
- They only live in Asia.
- Asia?

576
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,311
In this country, they'd have to be

577
00:48:36,312 --> 00:48:37,830
specially raised
from imported eggs.

578
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,459
Somebody grew this guy, fed
him honey and nightshade,

579
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,044
kept him warm.

580
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,546
Somebody loved him.

581
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,290
Where are you?

582
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,585
Let me out of here.

583
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,721
Please don't leave.

584
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,393
Talk to me, please.

585
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,896
Why won't you answer me? Please.

586
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,442
Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.

587
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,069
I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

588
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,406
And I'm Tim Langhorn. Our
top story for this morning.

589
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,824
Catherine Martin,

590
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,576
the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,

591
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,414
listed first as a
missing person, is

592
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:01,122
now believed to
have been kidnapped

593
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,958
by the serial killer known
only as Buffalo Bill.

594
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,627
Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse

595
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,713
has been identified,
sliced up the back

596
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:12,425
in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.

597
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,093
Young Catherine Martin,
as we've said,

598
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,429
is the only daughter of
US Senator Ruth Martin,

599
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,764
the Republican junior
senator from Tennessee.

600
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,725
And while her kidnapping
is not, at this point,

601
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,435
considered to be
politically motivated,

602
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,604
nevertheless, it has stirred the
government to its highest levels.

603
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,607
Reached for a comment on the
ski slopes of Stowe, Vermont,

604
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,558
the president himself said to be,

605
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,653
and I quote,
"Intensely concerned."

606
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,238
Just moments ago, Senator Martin

607
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,501
taped this dramatic personal plea.

608
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:37,502
Excuse me.

609
00:50:37,503 --> 00:50:40,995
I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.

610
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,082
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

611
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,461
Talk to her, and you'll see.

612
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,090
You have the power.
You are in charge.

613
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,472
I know you can feel
love and compassion.

614
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,477
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

615
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,022
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

616
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,177
that you're big enough
to treat Catherine

617
00:51:11,178 --> 00:51:13,527
better than the world
has treated you.

618
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,821
You have that power.

619
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,573
Please.

620
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,576
My daughter is Catherine.

621
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,745
- Boy, that's smart.
- Release her unharmed.

622
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,288
Jesus, that's really smart.

623
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,582
She keeps repeating the name.

624
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:30,086
If he sees Catherine as a
person and not just an object,

625
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,548
- it's harder to tear her up.
- Please. Release my little girl.

626
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,134
What you're doing, Miss Starling,

627
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,386
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

628
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,349
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

629
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,684
Sir, I told you,

630
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,895
this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

631
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,315
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

632
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,528
Look, I am not just some
turnkey, Miss Starling.

633
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,323
This is the number for the
US Attorney's office.

634
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,659
Please, either you
discuss this with him,

635
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,453
or you let me do my
job. Do you understand?

636
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,002
If your profile helps
us catch Buffalo Bill

637
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,964
in time to save Catherine Martin,

638
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,300
the senator promises
you a transfer

639
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,303
to the V.A. Hospital at
Oneida Park, New York,

640
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,721
with a view of the woods nearby.

641
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,558
Maximum security still
applies, of course.

642
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,394
You'd have reasonable
access to books.

643
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,021
Best of all, though.

644
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,149
One week of the year,

645
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:37,278
you get to leave the
hospital and go here.

646
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,241
Plum Island.

647
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,829
Every day of that week you
may walk on the beach,

648
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,498
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

649
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,835
under SWAT team
surveillance, of course.

650
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,462
And there you have it.

651
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,760
A copy of the Buffalo
Bill case file.

652
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,598
A copy of the senator's offer.

653
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,185
This offer is
non-negotiable and final.

654
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,771
If Catherine Martin
dies, you get nothing.

655
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,951
"Plum Island Animal
Disease Research Centre."

656
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,748
Sounds charming.

657
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:35,294
That's only part of the island.
There's a very, very nice beach.

658
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,744
Terns nest there.
There's beautiful...

659
00:53:37,745 --> 00:53:38,745
Terns?

660
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,094
If I help you, Clarice, it
will be "turns" with us, too.

661
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,306
Quid pro quo. I tell you
things, you tell me things.

662
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,309
Not about this case,
though. About yourself.

663
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,020
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

664
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,151
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor
little Catherine is waiting.

665
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,987
Go, Doctor.

666
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,783
What is your worst
memory of childhood?

667
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,578
The death of my father.

668
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,332
Tell me about it. And
don't lie, or I'll know.

669
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,335
He was a town marshal,

670
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,131
and one night he
surprised two burglars

671
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,842
coming out of the
back of a drugstore.

672
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,345
They shot him.

673
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,806
Was he killed outright?

674
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,185
No. He was very strong. He
lasted more than a month.

675
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,147
My mother died when
I was very young,

676
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,193
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

677
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,863
and when he left me, I had
nothing. I was ten years old.

678
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,701
You're very frank, Clarice.

679
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,752
I think it would
be quite something

680
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:53,539
to know you in private life.

681
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,043
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

682
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,338
So tell me about
Miss West Virginia.

683
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,382
Was she a large girl?

684
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,344
Yes.

685
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,098
- Big through the hips? Roomy?
- They all were.

686
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,267
What else?

687
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:17,146
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

688
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,065
Now, that hasn't been
made public yet.

689
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,067
We don't know what it means.

690
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,902
Was it a butterfly?

691
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,239
Yes. A moth.

692
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,194
Just like the one we found in

693
00:55:30,195 --> 00:55:32,536
Benjamin Raspail's
head an hour ago.

694
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,665
Why does he place
them there, Doctor?

695
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:40,294
The significance of
the moth is change.

696
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,964
Caterpillar into
chrysalis or pupa,

697
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,925
and from thence into beauty.

698
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,137
Our Billy wants to change, too.

699
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,119
There's no correlation
in literature

700
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,808
between transsexualism
and violence.

701
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,978
- Transsexuals are very passive...
- Clever girl.

702
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,105
You're so close to the way
you're gonna catch him.

703
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,067
- Do you realise that?
- No. Tell me why.

704
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,737
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

705
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,572
What happened next?

706
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:16,163
I don't imagine the answer is on
those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

707
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,626
I went to live with my mother's
cousin and her husband in Montana.

708
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,378
They had a ranch.

709
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,506
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

710
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,927
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

711
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,180
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

712
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,307
Why, Clarice?

713
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,893
Did the rancher make
you perform fellatio?

714
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,978
Did he sodomise you?

715
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,399
No. He was a very decent man.

716
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,236
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

717
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,615
Billy is not a real transsexual.

718
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,992
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be.

719
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,954
He's tried to be a lot
of things, I expect.

720
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,790
And you said that I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

721
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,250
What did you mean, Doctor?

722
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,877
There are three major centres
for transsexual surgery.

723
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,807
Johns Hopkins, the University of

724
00:57:05,808 --> 00:57:08,173
Minnesota, and Columbus
Medical Centre.

725
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,718
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy
had applied for sex reassignment

726
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,721
at one or all of them
and been rejected.

727
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,766
On what basis would
they reject him?

728
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,236
Look for severe
childhood disturbances

729
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,938
associated with violence.

730
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,233
Our Billy wasn't born
a criminal, Clarice.

731
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,070
He was made one through
years of systematic abuse.

732
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,366
Billy hates his own
identity, you see,

733
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,202
and he thinks that makes
him a transsexual.

734
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,290
But his pathology is a
thousand times more savage

735
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,167
and more terrifying.

736
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,883
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

737
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,552
Mister, my family will pay cash.

738
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,889
Whatever ransom you're
asking for, they'll pay it.

739
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:01,894
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

740
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,899
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.

741
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,818
Okay, okay, okay.

742
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,238
Okay. I'm there.

743
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,781
Okay.

744
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,953
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.

745
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,413
I promise.

746
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,445
See, my mum is a real important

747
00:58:24,446 --> 00:58:27,002
woman. I guess you
already know that.

748
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,047
Now it places the
lotion in the basket.

749
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:34,593
Please. Please. I want to go home.

750
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,931
I want to go home, please.
Please, I want to...

751
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,517
It places the lotion
in the basket.

752
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:46,146
I want to see my mummy. Please.

753
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,816
I want to see my mother again.

754
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:53,111
I want to see my mummy.

755
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,823
Put the fucking
lotion in the basket.

756
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,946
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

757
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,906
No, I don't think so.

758
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,160
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

759
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,871
She never heard of
any deal with you.

760
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,666
They scammed you, Hannibal.

761
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,253
Stand outside

762
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,256
and shut the door.

763
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,716
Barney.

764
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:06,018
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

765
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,811
I designed it.

766
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,346
Of course, I worked in a few

767
01:00:09,347 --> 01:00:11,481
conditions for my own
benefit as well.

768
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,860
Identify Buffalo Bill by name

769
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,195
and if the girl is found in time,

770
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,989
Senator Martin will
have you transferred to

771
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,199
Brushy Mountain State
Prison in Tennessee.

772
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,453
Answer me, Hannibal.

773
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:30,626
You answer me now, or by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

774
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,880
Who is Buffalo Bill?

775
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,216
His first name is Louis.

776
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,387
I'll tell the rest to the Senator
herself, but only in Tennessee,

777
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,098
and I have a few
conditions of my own.

778
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,020
Clean him up and get
him ready to go.

779
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,024
Jack, Hannibal Lecter is being
transferred to Memphis.

780
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,692
Transferred?

781
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,862
Did you have a trainee make some
sort of phoney offer to Lecter

782
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,238
in the Senator's name?

783
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,366
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

784
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,743
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

785
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,828
Paul Krendler's over
here from Justice.

786
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,581
She's asking him to
take over in Memphis.

787
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,149
Welcome to Memphis, Dr Lecter.

788
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:39,027
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

789
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,279
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

790
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:44,825
You be a gentleman, you gonna
get three hots and a cot.

791
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:49,079
Sir. If you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

792
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,583
Where is it?

793
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,628
Here, sir. Use mine.

794
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:47,512
Senator Martin, Dr
Hannibal Lecter.

795
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,227
Dr Lecter,

796
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:58,231
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

797
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,193
You'll want to read
it before I sign.

798
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,998
I won't waste your
time or Catherine's

799
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:09,201
time bargaining for
petty privileges.

800
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,369
Clarice Starling and
that awful Jack Crawford

801
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,538
have wasted far too
much time already.

802
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,666
I only pray they haven't
doomed the poor girl.

803
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:21,379
Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.

804
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,381
You have my word. Paul?

805
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,720
Buffalo Bill's real
name is Louis Friend.

806
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,056
I met him just once.

807
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,226
He was referred to me
in April or May, 1980,

808
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,603
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

809
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,231
They were lovers, you see.

810
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,818
But Raspail had become
very frightened.

811
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,822
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

812
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,367
and done things with her skin.

813
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,496
We need his address and
a physical description.

814
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,165
Tell me, Senator.

815
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,252
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

816
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,004
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

817
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,715
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

818
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,407
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

819
01:04:08,408 --> 01:04:09,761
You son of a bitch.

820
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,598
Amputate a man's leg, and he
can still feel it tickling.

821
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,477
Tell me, Mum, when your
little girl is on the slab,

822
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,563
where will it tickle you?

823
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:22,607
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

824
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,237
Five-foot-ten, strongly
built, about 180 pounds.

825
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,614
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

826
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,408
He'd be about 35 now.

827
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,536
He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.

828
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,621
That's all I can remember, Mum.

829
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,791
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

830
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,296
Oh, and, Senator,
just one more thing.

831
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,174
Love your suit.

832
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,637
I tell you now that in a
meeting earlier this evening

833
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,972
with Senator Ruth Martin,

834
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,058
Dr Lecter agreed to assist
in the investigation

835
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,978
of trying to find the abductor of
Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

836
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,062
How do you fit in, sir?

837
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,647
Well, it's only through
my own unique insight

838
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,774
into Lecter's mind that this
breakthrough was possible.

839
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:05,942
And Buffalo Bill's real name...

840
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,993
Buffalo Bill's real
name is now a matter

841
01:05:07,994 --> 01:05:09,905
of record with the
proper authorities.

842
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,367
Can you give us any
more information?

843
01:05:11,368 --> 01:05:12,574
My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.

844
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,159
- How do you spell that?
- C-H...

845
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,796
Are you with Dr Chilton's group?

846
01:05:17,797 --> 01:05:20,332
Oh, well, I just saw
him outside, sir.

847
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,492
Access to Lecter is
strictly limited.

848
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:24,127
We've been getting death threats.

849
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,879
I understand, sir.

850
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,012
Log in. Check your weapon.

851
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,265
Well, I can't take all
the credit for myself.

852
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,893
Senator Martin, the Justice
Department, the people at the FBI,

853
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,187
the folks at the Baltimore
State Hospital.

854
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:45,565
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

855
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:48,276
Excuse me, folks, I'm gonna
have to catch a flight.

856
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,407
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

857
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,168
Is it true what they're saying?

858
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,297
He's some kind of vampire?

859
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,302
They don't have a
name for what he is.

860
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,846
You do know the rules, madam?

861
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,933
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle. I've
questioned him before.

862
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,562
Go ahead.

863
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,393
Good evening, Clarice.

864
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,398
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

865
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,736
Just until you get your view.

866
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,030
How very thoughtful.

867
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,534
Or did Jack Crawford send
you for one last wheedle

868
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,828
before you're both
booted off the case?

869
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,581
No. I came because I wanted to.

870
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,421
People will say we're in love.

871
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,761
Anthrax Island.

872
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,347
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

873
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,850
- Yours?
- Yes.

874
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,896
Yeah. That was good.

875
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,815
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

876
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,817
Ticktock, ticktock,
ticktock, ticktock.

876
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,820
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

877
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,239
Louis Friend?

878
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,951
Iron sulphide, also
known as Fool's Gold.

879
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,664
Oh, Clarice. Your problem is you
need to get more fun out of life.

880
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,918
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

881
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,795
Please continue now.

882
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,006
Well, I have read the
case files, have you?

883
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:18,218
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

884
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,678
Then tell me how.

885
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,722
First principles,
Clarice. Simplicity.

886
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,766
Read Marcus Aurelius.

887
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:28,144
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?

888
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,146
What is its nature?

889
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:33,858
What does he do,
this man you seek?

890
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,570
He kills women.

891
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,198
No. That is incidental.

892
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,201
What is the first and
principal thing he does?

893
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:46,538
What needs does he
serve by killing?

894
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,248
Anger.

895
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:54,337
Social acceptance and
sexual frustrations...

896
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,340
No. He covets.

897
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,385
That is his nature.

898
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,388
And how do we begin
to covet, Clarice?

899
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,224
Do we seek out things to covet?

900
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,102
Make an effort to answer now.

901
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,437
No. We just...

902
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,983
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

903
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,611
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

904
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,699
And don't your eyes seek
out the things you want?

905
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,869
All right. Yes. Now
please tell me how.

906
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,081
No. It is your turn
to tell me, Clarice.

907
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,209
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

908
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,795
Why did you leave that ranch?

909
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:40,049
Doctor, we don't have any more
time for any of this now.

910
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,219
But we don't reckon time the
same way, do we, Clarice?

911
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,221
This is all the time
you'll ever have.

912
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,765
Later. Now, please, listen to
me. We've only got five...

913
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:50,393
No. I will listen now.

914
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:55,273
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

915
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,566
You were ten years old.

916
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,445
You went to live with cousins on a
sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

917
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,613
And?

918
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,909
And one morning, I just ran away.

919
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,662
Not "just", Clarice.
What set you off?

920
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,875
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

921
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:18,254
Then something woke you, didn't
it? Was it a dream? What was it?

922
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,633
I heard a strange noise.

923
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,968
What was it?

924
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:28,056
It was screaming.

925
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,977
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

926
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,979
What did you do?

927
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,900
I went downstairs, outside.

928
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,780
I crept up into the barn.

929
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,533
I was so scared to look
inside, but I had to.

930
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,871
And what did you see,
Clarice? What did you see?

931
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:57,168
Lambs. They were screaming.

932
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,089
They were slaughtering
the spring lambs?

933
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,508
And they were screaming.

934
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,220
- And you ran away?
- No.

935
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,556
First I tried to free them.

936
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,559
I opened the gate to their
pen, but they wouldn't run.

937
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,938
They just stood there,
confused. They wouldn't run.

938
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,024
But you could and you
did, didn't you?

939
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:24,195
Yes. I took one lamb, and I
ran away as fast as I could.

940
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,864
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know.

941
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:31,661
I didn't have any food, any water,
and it was very cold, very cold.

942
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:38,376
I thought if I could
save just one, but,

943
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,588
he was so heavy.

944
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,216
He was so heavy.

945
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,539
I didn't get more than a few miles

946
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,851
when the sheriff's
car picked me up.

947
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,896
The rancher was so angry,

948
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:02,442
he sent me to live at the
Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

949
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,736
I never saw the ranch again.

950
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,780
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

951
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,617
They killed him.

952
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,078
You still wake up
sometimes, don't you?

953
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:18,750
Wake up in the dark and hear
the screaming of the lambs.

954
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:20,918
Yes.

955
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,911
And you think if you
save poor Catherine,

956
01:12:24,912 --> 01:12:26,924
you could make them
stop, don't you?

957
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,385
You think if Catherine lives,

958
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,221
you won't wake up in
the dark ever again

959
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:35,350
to that awful screaming
of the lambs.

960
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,687
I don't know. I don't know.

961
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:45,526
Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.

962
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,446
Tell me his name, Doctor.

963
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,288
Dr Chilton, I presume.

964
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,333
I think you know each other.

965
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,294
Okay.

966
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,297
- We found her.
- Let's go.

967
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,466
It's your turn, Doctor.

968
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,718
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

969
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,471
Sorry, madam, I've got orders.
I have to put you on a plane.

970
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,972
Come on now.

971
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,557
Brave Clarice.

972
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,020
You will let me know when those
lambs stop screaming, won't you?

973
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,106
Tell me his name, Doctor.

974
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,440
Clarice.

975
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,318
Your case file.

976
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,242
Goodbye, Clarice.

977
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,059
Ready when you are, Doc.

978
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:44,395
Just another minute, please.

979
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,781
The son of a bitch
demanded a second dinner.

980
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,909
Lamb chops, extra rare.

981
01:14:57,951 --> 01:14:59,911
Wonder what he wants
for breakfast.

982
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,246
Some damn thing from the zoo?

983
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,853
Good evening, gentlemen.

984
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:29,440
- Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.
- Same drill as before, please.

985
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,575
Ready when you are,
Sergeant Pembry.

986
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:56,926
Okay.

987
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,810
Hand me that, would you?

988
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,191
Thanks.

989
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:18,114
Mind the drawings, please.

990
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,493
Thank you.

991
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:49,186
- Jimmy, watch it. He's got me.
- Jesus, Bill.

992
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,695
Jesus Christ.

993
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,859
Ready when you are,
Sergeant Pembry.

994
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,787
What is this shit?

995
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:36,293
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

996
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,546
Call Pembry. Ask him...

997
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:43,926
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat.

998
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,846
- Shots fired on five.
- Sergeant Tate.

999
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,933
Holy shit.

1000
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,810
What the hell? Bitch.

1001
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,603
Shut up.

1002
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,440
- Bobby, get the vest.
- Right, Sarge.

1003
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,984
- Brady, Howard...
- Look.

1004
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,530
It stopped.

1005
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,742
Seal off a 10 block radius.

1006
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,661
Get me the SWAT team and
an ambulance double-quick.

1007
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:11,912
We're going up.

1008
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,651
Pembry.

1009
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,863
Boyle.

1010
01:19:58,543 --> 01:19:59,752
Oh, God.

1011
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,052
Go.

1012
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,353
- Clear.
- Clear.

1013
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:20,397
Command post, two officers down.

1014
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,107
- Clear.
- Clear.

1015
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,401
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

1016
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:26,278
The prisoner is missing.

1017
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,280
Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.

1018
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,908
Repeat. Lecter is
missing and armed.

1019
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:34,078
He stripped the bed.
Might be making a rope.

1020
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,830
Check all windows.

1021
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,249
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

1022
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,334
He's alive.

1023
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:43,087
Sergeant Tate, he's alive.

1024
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,757
Get a hold of him where you can
feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

1025
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,509
What do I say?

1026
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,387
It's Jim Pembry. Now
talk to him, damn it.

1027
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,515
Lecter is missing and armed.

1028
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,934
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

1029
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:00,020
He took Boyle's gun.
Pembry got off one round.

1030
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,106
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

1031
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,275
Keep breathing in
and out. That's it.

1032
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,611
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.

1033
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,240
Yeah, you look...
You look real good.

1034
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:29,592
- You ready?
- Let's go.

1035
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,552
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

1036
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,815
Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

1037
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,984
You're just fine. You're doing
all right. That's right.

1038
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,486
- Okay, I need that IV now.
- Lactated ringers.

1039
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:50,821
Can we get the strap?

1040
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:51,947
Where's the fucking oxygen?

1041
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,302
Looking good, buddy. That's right.

1042
01:21:53,303 --> 01:21:54,303
Bob.

1043
01:21:54,304 --> 01:21:55,659
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

1044
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,538
We're losing him.
Downstairs. Take him.

1045
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,540
And up.

1046
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,251
- Elevator.
- Out of the way.

1047
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,836
Out of the way.

1048
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,009
CP to Tate.

1049
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,929
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

1050
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,474
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

1051
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,768
He seems to be hanging on.

1052
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,395
Top three floors secured.

1053
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,940
Main stairwell secured.

1054
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,817
We think he's on two.

1055
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,249
Tate, are you still with me?

1056
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,629
We're pretty sure he's
somewhere on two, sir.

1057
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,714
That's all for now. Over.

1058
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,569
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1059
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:16,740
Okay, guys.

1060
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,675
I see him.

1061
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,720
There's a gun by his
hand. He's not moving.

1062
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,888
One warning. We need him alive.

1063
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:41,265
Got him.

1064
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,100
Lecter.

1065
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,686
Put your hands on your head.

1066
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,314
One in the leg.

1067
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:01,744
No movement.

1068
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:06,165
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1069
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:09,501
- We're opening the hatch.
- Watch his hands.

1070
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,796
If there's any fire, it'll
come from us. Affirm.

1071
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,214
Got it.

1072
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,284
Memphis General, this
is Medical Unit 26.

1073
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,953
We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer

1074
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:47,456
with severe facial
lacerations. Weapon unknown.

1075
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,501
We've got grand mal seizure
activity, but he's postictal now.

1076
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:51,668
Copy that.

1077
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:54,630
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1078
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:56,173
- Ninety?
- Yeah, that's right. 90.

1079
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:57,508
Pulse, 84.

1080
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,259
We've got him on lactated
ringers running.

1081
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,887
And the patient is on 10 litres...

1082
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:12,356
They found the ambulance in a
parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1083
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,941
The crew was dead.

1084
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:18,529
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

1085
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,156
By now he could be anywhere.

1086
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,200
- He won't come after me.
- Oh, really?

1087
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,744
No, he won't. I can't explain it.

1088
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,455
He would consider that rude.

1089
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,542
It's over. She's dead.

1090
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,669
It's not your fault it
worked out like this.

1091
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:35,546
The thing is that, Lecter
said everything we need

1092
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,173
to catch him with is right here
in these pages, only I can't...

1093
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:41,969
- Dr Lecter said a lot of things.
- He's here, Ardelia.

1094
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,417
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1095
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,297
"Clarice, doesn't this
random scattering of sites

1096
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,384
"seem desperately random? Like
the elaboration of a bad liar.

1097
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,261
"Ta, Hannibal Lecter."

1098
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:27,014
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

1099
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,267
Not random at all maybe. Like
there's some pattern here.

1100
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,218
Yeah, but there is no pattern, or

1101
01:26:33,219 --> 01:26:34,938
the computers would
have nailed it.

1102
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,857
They're even found
in random order.

1103
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:41,069
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

1104
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:43,697
- Fredrica Bimmel...
- Right.

1105
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:47,075
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1106
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:51,163
First girl taken, third
body found. Why?

1107
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,624
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1108
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,793
What did Lecter say about
the first principles?

1109
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,545
Simplicity.

1110
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,465
What does this guy do? He covets.

1111
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,718
How do we first start to covet?

1112
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,971
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

1113
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,143
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

1114
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:31,221
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.

1115
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:35,058
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1116
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:41,773
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr Bimmel.

1117
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:44,776
I don't know nothing
new to tell you.

1118
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:48,071
Police been back here
so many times already.

1119
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:52,034
Fredrica went into Chicago on
the bus to see about a job.

1120
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:55,912
She left the interview
okay. She never come home.

1121
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,335
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1122
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:04,254
Upstairs. Door to the left.

1123
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:53,256
He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr Crawford, out of real women.

1124
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:56,259
And he can sew, this
guy. He's very skilled.

1125
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,140
He's a tailor or a
dressmaker or...

1126
01:31:58,141 --> 01:31:59,141
Starling...

1127
01:31:59,142 --> 01:32:01,306
That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive

1128
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:02,474
so he can starve them a while,

1129
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:03,964
so he can loosen their
skin and take...

1130
01:32:03,965 --> 01:32:04,965
Starling.

1131
01:32:04,966 --> 01:32:07,103
Starling. Starling, we know
who he is and where he is.

1132
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:09,439
- We're on our way right now.
- Where?

1133
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:12,110
Calumet City, edge
of Chicago. Be on

1134
01:32:12,111 --> 01:32:14,402
the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1135
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:16,863
Oh, that's great news,
sir, but how...

1136
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,865
Johns Hopkins came
up with some names.

1137
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:20,450
We fed him into "Known Offenders."

1138
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:24,704
Subject's name is Jamie
Gumb, AKA John Grant.

1139
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,290
Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.

1140
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,458
Listen to this.

1141
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,919
Customs had some paper on him.

1142
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:34,089
They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX.

1143
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:36,633
Live caterpillars from Surinam.

1144
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:39,261
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1145
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:42,180
Well, Chicago's only
400 miles from here.

1146
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:44,057
- I'll be there in...
- No, no, no, Starling.

1147
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:47,435
There's not enough time. We want
him for murder, not kidnapping.

1148
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,021
I need you to link him to the
Bimmel girl before he's indicted.

1149
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,252
See what you can dredge
up in Belvedere.

1150
01:32:52,253 --> 01:32:54,150
Yes, sir. You bet.
I'll do my best.

1151
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:57,529
Starling, we wouldn't have
found him without you.

1152
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:01,408
Nobody's gonna forget
that. Least of all me.

1153
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:06,162
Thank you, sir. Thank you
very much, Mr Crawford.

1154
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,332
Mr Crawford?

1155
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:25,849
Thanks for the scraps,
asshole. I got a better idea.

1156
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,206
Okay, Precious. Time
for a little treat.

1157
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:04,638
Precious.

1158
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,725
Come on, girl.

1159
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:12,562
Come on, Precious.
Come on, Precious.

1160
01:34:21,697 --> 01:34:23,406
Come on, Precious.

1161
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:26,242
I got a yummy, yummy
snack for you.

1162
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:28,036
Come on. Come and get it.

1163
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,252
Precious.

1164
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,631
Are you up there, you little shit?

1165
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,759
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1166
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,436
Precious. Please come. Come on.

1167
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:02,821
Come on...

1168
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:16,876
Would you fuck me?

1169
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,587
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1170
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:23,591
Come on. Come. Come on.

1171
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:25,427
I'd fuck me.

1172
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:27,303
Come on.

1173
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:33,017
I'd fuck me hard.

1174
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:35,311
I'd fuck me so hard.

1175
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:41,276
No.

1176
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:44,547
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1177
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,807
You get to travel
around and stuff?

1178
01:36:46,808 --> 01:36:48,802
I mean, better places than this?

1179
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,096
Sometimes you do.

1180
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:56,684
Freddie was so happy for me when
I got this job at the bank.

1181
01:36:57,436 --> 01:37:01,231
Toaster giveaways and Barry
Manilow on the speakers all day.

1182
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,900
She thought it was such hot shit.

1183
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:06,736
What did she know? Big dummy.

1184
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:09,280
Stacy, did Fredrica
ever mention a man

1185
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:12,992
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

1186
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,912
- How about John Grant?
- No.

1187
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,364
Oh, would she have had a friend

1188
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:18,623
that you didn't know about, or...

1189
01:37:18,707 --> 01:37:21,501
No way. If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.

1190
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:23,378
Sewing was her life.

1191
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,797
Did you two ever work together?

1192
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:27,882
Oh, sure. Me and Pam
Malavesi used to help her

1193
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,468
do alterations for
old Mrs Lippman.

1194
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:33,930
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's
address? I need to talk to her.

1195
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:05,628
So powerful. So beautiful.

1196
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,510
Precious?

1197
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:19,517
Precious?

1198
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,811
Down here, you sack of shit.

1199
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:31,779
Put her in that bucket.

1200
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:35,366
No. You get me a telephone
and lower it down here. Now.

1201
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,496
Poolie-poo. Precious.

1202
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:42,457
Darling heart, are you all right?

1203
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:45,668
She's in a lot of pain,
mister. She needs a vet.

1204
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:52,675
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it. She's been licking...

1205
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,802
Hey, don't you hurt my dog.

1206
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:59,223
- Don't you make me hurt your dog.
- Oh, you don't know what pain is.

1207
01:39:04,521 --> 01:39:08,358
Get me a live telephone line
down here or the dog's dead.

1208
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:13,738
Damn fuck.

1209
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:15,698
Get me that telephone.

1210
01:39:17,242 --> 01:39:19,202
I'm gonna do it, mister.

1211
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:22,830
I'll snap her neck
off. I swear to God.

1212
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,541
You little fuck.

1213
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:35,093
Down here. Down here.

1214
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:36,469
Help.

1215
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:51,067
Okay, I'm coming.

1216
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,696
We're going in.

1217
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:01,911
Good afternoon. Sorry
to bother you.

1218
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:04,080
I'm looking for Mrs
Lippman's family.

1219
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:07,500
- FBI. Everybody down.
- Everybody down, now.

1220
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,460
No. The Lippmans don't
live here any more.

1221
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,630
No. Excuse me, sir. I really
need to speak with you.

1222
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,341
- Clear.
- Clear.

1223
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:18,386
What's the problem, Officer?

1224
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:21,931
Well, I'm investigating the
death of Fredrica Bimmel.

1225
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,185
There's no one here, Jack.

1226
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:29,939
Clarice.

1227
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,399
Your name is?

1228
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:34,068
- Oh, Jack Gordon.
- Mr Gordon. Good.

1229
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:38,448
Well, Fredrica used to work for
Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?

1230
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:40,450
No.

1231
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:42,702
Oh, wait.

1232
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,413
Was she a great, big fat person?

1233
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:48,958
- Yes. She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I...

1234
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,128
I may have... No, I read
about her in the newspaper.

1235
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:56,591
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

1236
01:40:56,633 --> 01:40:58,428
I got his card in here
some place. Do you

1237
01:40:58,429 --> 01:41:00,011
want to come in while
I look for it?

1238
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,304
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

1239
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:02,680
Thank you.

1240
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,951
Are you close to catching
somebody, you think?

1241
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:26,996
Yes. We may be.

1242
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,666
Did you

1243
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:34,754
take over this place after Mrs
Lippman died? Is that right?

1244
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:40,551
Yeah. I bought this
house two years ago.

1245
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,223
Did she leave any records,
any business records,

1246
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:48,768
tax forms, list of employees?

1247
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,188
No. Nothing like that at all.

1248
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,984
Say, has the FBI learnt something?

1249
01:41:57,361 --> 01:42:00,238
The police around here don't
seem to have the first clue.

1250
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,832
I mean, have you got,
like, a description,

1251
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:14,877
fingerprints, anything like that?

1252
01:42:16,338 --> 01:42:17,380
No.

1253
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,717
No, we don't.

1254
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,771
Yeah. Here's that number.

1255
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:39,193
Very good, Mr Gordon. May
I use your phone, please?

1256
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:49,787
Sure you can use my phone.

1257
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:52,415
Freeze.

1258
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:56,752
Put your hands over your head. And
turn around. Spread your legs.

1259
01:42:58,338 --> 01:43:01,841
Spread your legs. Put your
hands in the back. Thumbs up.

1260
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:02,925
Freeze.

1261
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:17,416
Hey.

1262
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:39,563
Hello. Are you there?

1263
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,859
I'm down here. I'm down here.

1264
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,716
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes.

1265
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:11,262
FBI. You're safe.

1266
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:14,223
Safe, shit. Get me out of here.

1267
01:45:29,906 --> 01:45:31,949
You're all right,
Catherine. Where is he?

1268
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:35,077
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here.

1269
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:38,247
Catherine, you've got to be
quiet. Now shut that dog up.

1270
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,416
Just get me out of here.

1271
01:45:41,543 --> 01:45:42,918
Oh, my God.

1272
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,631
Catherine, I'm going to
get you out of there,

1273
01:45:47,716 --> 01:45:49,425
but right now, you listen to me.

1274
01:45:49,551 --> 01:45:52,053
I've got to leave this
room. I'll be right back.

1275
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:54,889
No. Don't you leave me
here, you fucking bitch.

1276
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:57,433
No. Don't you leave me here.

1277
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,894
This guy's fucking crazy.

1278
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,398
Please.

1279
01:46:04,566 --> 01:46:07,818
I've got to get out of here.

1280
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:14,241
Catherine, the other officers
will be here any minute now.

1281
01:46:15,243 --> 01:46:16,494
Wait.

1282
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,954
Don't go. Please.

1283
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:20,247
Quiet.

1284
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,210
Oh, God.

1285
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:12,187
No...

1286
01:50:20,832 --> 01:50:21,832
You okay?

1287
01:50:21,833 --> 01:50:23,616
Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1288
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,827
Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?

1289
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:35,544
Clarice M. Starling.

1290
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:39,673
Congratulations.

1291
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:55,064
Ernest W. Stevens.

1292
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:16,877
- Special Agent Starling.
- Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1293
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:18,504
- Phone call.
- Thank you.

1294
01:51:18,588 --> 01:51:20,923
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Starling.

1295
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,136
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1296
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:27,763
Sure.

1297
01:51:29,265 --> 01:51:32,101
Look, I just wanted to
say congratulations.

1298
01:51:32,477 --> 01:51:34,395
And I'm not much good
at this kind of thing,

1299
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:36,271
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1300
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:37,606
Okay, sure.

1301
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:41,235
Thank you, Mr Crawford.

1302
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:51,620
Your father would have
been proud today.

1303
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,750
Don't forget your phone call.

1304
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:02,297
Starling.

1305
01:52:02,465 --> 01:52:06,802
Well, Clarice, have the
lambs stopped screaming?

1306
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:08,637
Dr Lecter.

1307
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:11,807
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1308
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:17,079
Where are you, Dr Lecter?

1309
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:19,690
I have no plans to
call on you, Clarice.

1310
01:52:19,774 --> 01:52:22,276
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1311
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,988
So you take care now to
extend me the same courtesy.

1312
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:28,490
You know I can't
make that promise.

1313
01:52:29,033 --> 01:52:31,702
I do wish we could
chat longer, but...

1314
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:35,330
I'm having an old
friend for dinner.

1315
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:37,958
Bye.

1316
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,002
Dr Lecter...

1317
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:43,839
Dr Lecter.

1318
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:47,509
Dr Lecter.

1319
01:52:49,512 --> 01:52:50,846
Dr Lecter.

1320
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:53,515
Hey, what? Oh, excuse
me. I'm sorry.

1321
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:55,414
Is the security system all set up?

1322
01:52:55,415 --> 01:52:56,810
We have the big-shot security.
