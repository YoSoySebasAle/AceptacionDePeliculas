1
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:03,439
<i>On September 3, 1973...</i>

2
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:08,694
<i>a blue fly capable of flapping
70 beats a minute...</i>

3
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,948
<i>landed on St. Vincent Street
in Montmartre.</i>

4
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:19,705
<i>At that moment,
on a restaurant terrace nearby...</i>

5
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,167
<i>the wind magically
made two glasses dance unseen...</i>

6
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,294
<i>on a tablecloth.</i>

7
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:31,592
<i>Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat
on Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9...</i>

8
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:34,804
<i>returning from
his best friend's funeral...</i>

9
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:38,641
<i>Eugéne Colére erased him
from his address book.</i>

10
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,024
<i>At the same moment,
a sperm with one X chromosome...</i>

11
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,776
<i>belonging to Raphael Poulain...</i>

12
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,656
<i>made a dash for an egg
in his wife Amandine.</i>

13
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,783
<i>Nine months later...</i>

14
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,369
<i>Amélie Poulain was born.</i>

15
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,295
AMELIE FROM MONTMARTRE

16
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,559
<i>Her father, an ex-Army doctor...</i>

17
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,104
<i>works at a spa at Enghien Les Bains.</i>

18
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,314
TIGHT LIPS, HARD HEART

19
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,486
<i>Raphael Poulain dislikes
peeing next to someone else.</i>

20
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,363
<i>He also dislikes...</i>

21
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,616
<i>catching scornful glances
at his sandals...</i>

22
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,456
<i>clingy wet swimming trunks.</i>

23
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,460
<i>Raphael Poulain likes...</i>

24
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,131
<i>peeling large strips of wallpaper...</i>

25
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,635
<i>lining up and shining his shoes...</i>

26
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,556
<i>emptying his toolbox...</i>

27
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,599
<i>cleaning it out...</i>

28
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,644
<i>and putting everything back.</i>

29
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,188
<i>Amélie's mother...</i>

30
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,898
<i>a schoolmistress from Grugeon...</i>

31
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,650
<i>has always had shaky nerves.</i>

32
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,027
FACIAL TWITCH, WEAK NERVES

33
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:41,365
<i>She dislikes puckered fingers
in the bath...</i>

34
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:46,203
<i>having her hands touched by strangers...</i>

35
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,125
<i>pillow marks on her cheek in the morning.</i>

36
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,671
<i>Amandine Poulain likes figure
skaters' costumes on TV...</i>

37
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,966
<i>polishing the parquet...</i>

38
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,260
<i>emptying her handbag...</i>

39
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,345
<i>cleaning it out...</i>

40
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,306
<i>and putting everything back.</i>

41
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,270
<i>Amélie is six.</i>

42
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,649
<i>Like all little girls,
she'd like to be hugged by her Daddy.</i>

43
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,737
<i>But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.</i>

44
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,490
<i>The thrill of this rare contact...</i>

45
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,950
<i>makes her heart beat like a drum.</i>

46
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:29,788
<i>As a result, he thinks
she has a heart defect.</i>

47
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,791
<i>Declared unfit for school...</i>

48
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,377
<i>Amélie is taught by her mother.</i>

49
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:42,801
The hens brood here henceforth.

50
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,639
- Four hens brood...
- Very good.

51
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,225
- Hens fourth.
- No!

52
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,894
<i>Deprived of playmates...</i>

53
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,397
<i>slung between a neurotic and an iceberg...</i>

54
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:59,193
<i>Amélie retreats into her imagination.</i>

55
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:03,197
<i>In this world, LPs are made like pancakes.</i>

56
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,991
<i>The neighbor's comatose wife...</i>

57
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:09,828
<i>has chosen to get
all her life's sleep in one go.</i>

58
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,499
After this,
I can stay awake day and night.

59
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,213
<i>Amélie has one friend, Blubber.</i>

60
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,968
<i>Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.</i>

61
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,948
<i>Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.</i>

62
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,533
<i>A decision is made.</i>

63
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,618
Enough!

64
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:27,865
<i>To comfort Amélie,
her mother gives her a used Instamatic.</i>

65
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,171
Little girl, look what you did!

66
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,964
<i>A neighbor fools her...</i>

67
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:47,343
<i>into thinking her camera causes accidents.</i>

68
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,095
<i>Having taken pictures all afternoon...</i>

69
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,931
<i>Amélie is petrified.</i>

70
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,101
<i>She stares at the TV,
racked by the guilt...</i>

71
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,270
<i>of causing a huge fire...</i>

72
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,272
<i>two derailments...</i>

73
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,191
<i>a jumbo jet crash.</i>

74
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,109
<i>A few days later...</i>

75
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,986
<i>realizing she'd been had...</i>

76
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,906
<i>Amélie gets her revenge.</i>

77
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,877
What?!

78
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,865
<i>One day, tragedy strikes.</i>

79
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,618
<i>Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame...</i>

80
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,121
<i>to pray for a baby brother.</i>

81
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,290
<i>Minutes later, heaven sends...</i>

82
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,543
<i>alas, not a baby boy...</i>

83
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,878
<i>but Marguerite, a tourist from Quebec...</i>

84
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,755
<i>bent on ending her life.</i>

85
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,720
<i>Amandine dies instantly.</i>

86
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,390
<i>After her mother's death...</i>

87
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,685
<i>Amélie lives alone with her father.</i>

88
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,814
<i>His unsociable tendencies increase.</i>

89
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,359
<i>He's obsessed with building
a miniature shrine...</i>

90
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:30,279
<i>to house his wife's ashes.</i>

91
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,120
<i>Days, months, and years go by.</i>

92
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,879
<i>In such a dead world,
Amélie prefers to dream...</i>

93
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,173
<i>she'll earn enough to leave home.</i>

94
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,603
<i>Five years later,
she's a waitress in Montmartre...</i>

95
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,813
<i>at the Two Windmills.</i>

96
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,649
<i>It's August 29th.</i>

97
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:11,528
<i>In 48 hours,
her life will change forever...</i>

98
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,533
<i>but she doesn't know it yet.</i>

99
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:20,954
<i>She lives quietly among
her coworkers and regulars.</i>

100
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,290
<i>Suzanne, the owner...</i>

101
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,376
<i>limps a little but never spills a drink.</i>

102
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,505
<i>A former bareback artiste, she likes...</i>

103
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,132
<i>athletes who cry with disappointment.</i>

104
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,009
<i>She dislikes seeing men...</i>

105
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,677
<i>humiliated in front of their kids.</i>

106
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,016
<i>Georgette, the tobacconist,
is a hypochondriac...</i>

107
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,520
<i>migraines one day, sciatica the next.</i>

108
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:48,190
<i>She hates the words, fruit of thy womb.</i>

109
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,402
<i>Gina works with Amélie.
Her grandma was a healer.</i>

110
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,279
<i>She likes cracking bones.</i>

111
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,742
<i>She brings a kir to Hipolito,
a failed writer.</i>

112
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,538
<i>He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.</i>

113
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,836
<i>Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.</i>

114
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,547
<i>He's always jealously spying on her.</i>

115
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,467
<i>All he likes is popping bubble wrap.</i>

116
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,804
<i>Here's Philoméne, an air hostess.</i>

117
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,849
<i>Amélie keeps her cat when she's away.</i>

118
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,016
<i>Philoméne likes...</i>

119
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,143
<i>the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.</i>

120
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:29,022
<i>The cat likes overhearing
children's stories.</i>

121
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,653
No, thanks, ma'am.
I never work Sundays.

122
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:39,575
<i>On weekends, Amélie often takes
a train to see her father.</i>

123
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:43,453
- Why not use your retirement?
- To do what?

124
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,164
Travel.
You've never been away.

125
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:52,546
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

126
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,632
We couldn't, because of your heart.

127
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,509
I know.

128
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,094
So, now...

129
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,180
Now...

130
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,017
<i>Some Fridays, Amélie sees a movie.</i>

131
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,229
I like looking back
at people's faces in the dark.

132
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:19,615
I like noticing details
that no one else sees...

133
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,785
but I hate it in old movies...

134
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,121
when drivers don't watch the road.

135
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,956
You know, you're
a very beautiful woman, Ellie.

136
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,251
- Why, Stan!
- A very, very beautiful woman.

137
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,545
<i>Amélie has no boyfriend.</i>

138
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:38,091
<i>She tried once or twice,
but the results were a letdown.</i>

139
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,096
<i>Instead, she cultivates
a taste for small pleasures.</i>

140
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,474
<i>Dipping her hand into sacks of grain...</i>

141
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,312
<i>cracking crème brulée with a teaspoon...</i>

142
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,111
<i>and skipping stones at St. Martin's Canal.</i>

143
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,737
<i>They call him the Glass Man.</i>

144
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,449
<i>He was born with bones
as brittle as crystal.</i>

145
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,119
<i>All his furniture is padded.</i>

146
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,414
<i>A handshake could crush his fingers.</i>

147
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,708
<i>He's stayed inside for twenty years.</i>

148
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,839
<i>Time has changed nothing.</i>

149
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,341
<i>Amélie still seeks solitude.</i>

150
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,971
<i>She amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below...</i>

151
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,058
<i>such as, how many couples
are having an orgasm now?</i>

152
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,487
Fifteen!

153
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,409
<i>Finally, on August 30, 1997...</i>

154
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:31,204
<i>comes the event
that changes her life forever.</i>

155
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,165
Lady Di, Princess of Wales...

156
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:36,001
died in a car crash last night...

157
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:41,423
with her companion Dodi Al-Fayed.

158
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,560
<i>Only the discoverer
of Tutankhamen's tomb...</i>

159
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,479
<i>would know how she felt...</i>

160
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,940
<i>upon finding this treasure...</i>

161
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,652
<i>hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.</i>

162
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,827
<i>On August 31st at 4:00 a.m...</i>

163
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,538
<i>Amélie had a dazzling idea.</i>

164
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,375
<i>Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner...</i>

165
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,544
<i>and give him back his treasure.</i>

166
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:05,423
<i>If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.</i>

167
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,467
<i>If not, too bad.</i>

168
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,518
The girl from the fifth floor.

169
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,353
We don't see much of you.

170
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:22,524
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the Fifties?

171
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,528
A boy? Have a glass of port.

172
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,323
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

173
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,577
Boys? I've known so many.

174
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,911
They're cute...

175
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,290
until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

176
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,125
I've known so many boys.

177
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,377
When did you come here?

178
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,879
In '64.

179
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,631
You'll have heard the story?

180
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,884
No.

181
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm amazed. Sit down.

182
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,473
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

183
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:59,019
It's no secret
he slept with his secretary.

184
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,981
They used every hotel around.

185
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,733
Not cheap ones either.

186
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,111
The bimbo liked spreading her legs...

187
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,696
but only on satin...

188
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,699
so he swiped from the till...

189
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,785
a little at first, then 50 million.

190
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,122
Off they flew to Panama.

191
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,417
Drink up.

192
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,505
On January 20,1970...

193
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,966
my doorbell rang.

194
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,096
Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America.

195
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,266
My life stopped there.

196
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,478
Black Lion died of heartbreak.

197
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,774
Poor creature.

198
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,946
See how lovingly he stares at his master?

199
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,699
I'll read you his letters.

200
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,493
Don't go!

201
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,370
You can spare 5 minutes.

202
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,207
He wrote this from the Army camp.

203
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,002
Darling Mado...

204
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,088
That's me, Madeleine.

205
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:11,258
I can't sleep, can't eat...

206
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:16,263
knowing that my only reason
to live is far away in Paris...

207
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,599
and I won't see her until next Friday...

208
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:24,396
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station...

209
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,691
in her blue dress.

210
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,361
In brackets,
the one you think is too transparent.

211
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,497
Did anyone ever write you like that?

212
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,668
I'm nobody's little weasel.

213
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,254
My name is Madeleine Wells.

214
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,382
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

215
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,302
She wept, right?

216
00:18:55,385 --> 00:19:00,265
Wells, as in water.
Talk about being born to cry!

217
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,313
About your question...

218
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,190
ask Collignon, the grocer.

219
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,151
He's lived here all his life.

220
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,571
Hello, Amélie-mellow!

221
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,157
A fig and three nuts, as usual?

222
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,993
Who lived in my flat in the Fifties?

223
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,911
What was their name?

224
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,039
You've got me there, dear.

225
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:28,209
In 1950, I was two,
the mental age of a cretin.

226
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,627
<i>The cretin is Lucien.</i>

227
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,714
<i>He's no genius, but Amélie likes him.</i>

228
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:33,798
<i>She likes the way...</i>

229
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,676
<i>he handles each endive
like a precious object...</i>

230
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,470
<i>to be treated with care.</i>

231
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,681
<i>It's his way of showing
his love of good work.</i>

232
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:42,974
Look at him!

233
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,478
Like he's nursing a baby bird!

234
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,190
Don't ask him for currants.

235
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,900
You'd be here till Monday!

236
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,070
Get moving, spastic!

237
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,197
She hasn't got all day!

238
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,955
Go see my mother.
She has an elephant's memory.

239
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,123
Elephant mom!

240
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,960
Thank you.

241
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,730
Bredoteau.

242
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,026
- Pardon?
- The name you're after.

243
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,614
But if I say it, it won't count.
I'm senile.

244
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,574
Ignore him. He's senile.

245
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,285
See what he's done to my laurel?

246
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,543
His old job was punching metro tickets.

247
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,587
Now he gets up every night...

248
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,424
to punch holes in my laurel!

249
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,343
Too bad it's not hardy.

250
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,555
We all need a way to relax.

251
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,557
- I skip stones.
- You do?

252
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,060
I'll find it, don't worry.
I'm very organized.

253
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,063
- I like everything.
- Like what?

254
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,315
Your son's nearly fifty...

255
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,901
and I'm still doing his bookkeeping!

256
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,613
You were still squeezing
his toothpaste at fifteen.

257
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,575
- It follows.
- Camus...

258
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:28,121
second floor, Broussard was on B block...

259
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,747
Got it!

260
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,958
Bredoteau, fifth floor.

261
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,627
They were northerners.

262
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,629
Bredoteau.

263
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,381
What more I can say?

264
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:46,806
<i>How could I live</i>

265
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:56,316
<i>Never to know the joy that you give</i>

266
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:00,820
<i>When I'm in your arms</i>

267
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:07,076
<i>I'm under your charms</i>

268
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:14,501
<i>How could I live</i>

269
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:20,715
<i>Without you</i>

270
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,821
<i>Groping under the photo booth...</i>

271
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,865
<i>is Nino Quincampoix.</i>

272
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:54,958
<i>When Amélie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.</i>

273
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,888
<i>Five miles apart, they both dreamed...</i>

274
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,182
<i>of having a brother and sister...</i>

275
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,685
<i>to be with all the time.</i>

276
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,165
Hi, Dad.

277
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,711
A new friend?

278
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,255
I've had him for years.

279
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:46,551
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

280
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,262
There. Let's reconcile them.

281
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,143
There. How about that?

282
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:03,860
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood...

283
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,570
how would you feel?

284
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,698
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic?

285
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,409
This gnome isn't a relic.

286
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:15,371
He was a retirement gift
from my old regiment.

287
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:20,960
No, I mean something you hid,
like a secret treasure.

288
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,130
I should varnish him before the autumn.

289
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,927
I'll make some tea.
You want some?

290
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,305
Breathe in. Hold still.

291
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,017
Better now?

292
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,854
Shut the door!
There's a howling gale.

293
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,898
It's not Siberia.

294
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,485
You're not allergic to car fumes!

295
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,655
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

296
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,657
Cough up a pleura?

297
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,410
- What's on today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

298
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,913
They'll have you on your knees.

299
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,956
- That's good?
- Depends where you fall.

300
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,751
- If in front of the toilet...
- Not good.

301
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:11,260
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

302
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,638
He's gonna drive me berserk.

303
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,765
Can't he give up?

304
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,642
There are plenty of other bars!

305
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,727
Good-bye.

306
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,812
Madame Suzanne?

307
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,230
Madame Suzanne?

308
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,067
Au gratin means white sauce, right?

309
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,735
Yes. Why?

310
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:32,824
I can't stomach it,
like you and horse meat.

311
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,494
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

312
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,454
I'd rather cook human flesh.

313
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,581
You're kidding.

314
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:56,097
Madame Suzanne, can I leave early today?

315
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,141
What's his name?

316
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,143
Dominique Bredoteau.

317
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,650
Hello.

318
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,113
- You're Dominique Bredoteau?
- That's me.

319
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,074
Why?

320
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:18,578
It's about the petition.

321
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,079
Petition?

322
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,834
Yes. The petition to...

323
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,171
to canonize Lady Di!

324
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,881
No, thanks.

325
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,716
No.

326
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,350
Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry to bother you...

327
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,982
- Yes?
- Hello.

328
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:53,154
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

329
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,490
Come up, third floor.

330
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,168
Hello, kitten.

331
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,632
Earl Grey? Jasmine?

332
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,636
What will you have?

333
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,974
I'm busy.

334
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,527
Here.

335
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,653
Coming!

336
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,532
Where can I find Dominique Bredoteau?

337
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:43,204
Poor dear! You just missed him.

338
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:46,207
Look, there he goes now.

339
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:56,926
Bretod-eau.

340
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,887
Not Bredot-eau.

341
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,101
You need a little mulled wine.

342
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,185
Come in.

343
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,987
I've lived here for five years.
I never saw you before.

344
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,823
I never go out on the landing.

345
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,660
I'm fussy about who I meet.

346
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,704
They're all bums.

347
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,166
Come in.

348
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:34,672
They call me the Glass Man...

349
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,134
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

350
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,262
Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...

351
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,265
The Two Windmills. I know.

352
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:50,855
And right now,
your Bredoteau basket is empty.

353
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,442
Because it's not do. It's to.

354
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,110
Like Toto.

355
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,533
I love that painting.

356
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,620
It's the Luncheon of the Boating Party.

357
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,080
By Renoir.

358
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,840
I've painted one each year
for twenty years.

359
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,178
The hardest part is the looks.

360
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,512
I sometimes feel like...

361
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:28,309
they deliberately change
their mood behind my back.

362
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,227
They look quite happy.

363
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,229
They should be!

364
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,399
They're eating hare with morels...

365
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:39,320
and waffles with jam for the kids.

366
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:45,326
Now, where's that piece of paper?

367
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:51,874
You've noticed my video camera.

368
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:55,086
A gift from my sister-in-law.

369
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:58,089
I put it there...

370
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:02,218
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

371
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,096
After all these years...

372
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,433
the only person I still can't capture...

373
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:12,520
is the girl with the glass of water.

374
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:16,190
She's in the middle, yet she's outside.

375
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,652
Maybe she's just different.

376
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,239
In what way?

377
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,325
I don't know.

378
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:32,206
When she was little,
she rarely played with other kids.

379
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,710
Maybe never.

380
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,464
Dominique...

381
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:45,094
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

382
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,347
It's for you.

383
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,266
<i>Every Tuesday morning...</i>

384
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,477
<i>Dominique Bretodeau buys a chicken.</i>

385
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:56,731
<i>He roasts it with potatoes.</i>

386
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,067
<i>After carving the legs and wings...</i>

387
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:04,238
<i>he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers...</i>

388
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,490
<i>starting with the oysters.</i>

389
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:13,164
<i>But not today.
Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.</i>

390
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,625
<i>He'll go no further
than this phone booth here.</i>

391
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,824
<i>In a flash, it all came back.</i>

392
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:33,035
<i>Bahamontes winning the Tour de France.</i>

393
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,332
<i>Aunt Josette's slips.</i>

394
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,170
<i>And most of all, the tragic day...</i>

395
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,801
<i>The day he won all the marbles.</i>

396
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,616
The pinch, Bretodeau!

397
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,869
Bretodeau, does he know what it is?

398
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,128
Cognac, please.

399
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,052
Amazing, what just happened.

400
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,680
It must be my guardian angel.

401
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,768
The phone booth was calling me...

402
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,859
Same here!
The microwave's calling me.

403
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,363
I'll have another cognac.

404
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,541
Life's funny.

405
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,589
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're fifty.

406
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:16,263
All that's left of your childhood
fits in a rusty little box.

407
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,686
You got kids, Miss?

408
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,777
I have a daughter about your age.

409
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,659
We haven't spoken for years.

410
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:40,704
I heard she had a child, a boy.

411
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,665
His name is Lucas.

412
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:53,133
It's time I looked them up,
before I'm in a box myself.

413
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,719
Don't you think?

414
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:07,898
<i>Amélie has a strange feeling
of absolute harmony.</i>

415
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,650
<i>It's a perfect moment.</i>

416
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,026
<i>Soft light...</i>

417
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,363
<i>a scent in the air,
the quiet murmur of the city.</i>

418
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,783
<i>She breathes deeply.
Life is simple and clear.</i>

419
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:23,289
<i>A surge of love, an urge
to help mankind comes over her.</i>

420
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:39,430
Let me help you.
Step down. Here we go!

421
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,348
The drum major's widow!

422
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,809
She's worn his coat since the day he died.

423
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,438
The horse's head has lost an ear!

424
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:51,150
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.

425
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,320
In the bakery window, lollipops.

426
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:58,699
Smell that!
They're giving out melon slices.

427
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,536
Sugarplum ice cream!

428
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,288
We're passing the park butcher.

429
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,708
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

430
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:12,588
Now the cheese shop.
Picadors are 12.90. Cabecaus 23.50.

431
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:17,217
A baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens.

432
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:20,471
Now we're at the kiosk by the metro.

433
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,681
I'll leave you here. Bye!

434
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,319
She can't relate to other people.

435
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,657
She was always a lonely child.

436
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,496
On a sparkling evening in July...

437
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:32,876
while on the beaches, holiday hordes
relax in the new-found sun...

438
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,671
and Paris's sweltering denizens...

439
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:40,008
gaze at the star bursts
of the traditional fireworks...

440
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,343
Amélie Poulain...

441
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:46,807
Godmother of Outcasts,
Madonna of the Unloved...

442
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,435
finally succumbed to exhaustion.

443
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,189
In Paris's stricken streets...

444
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,024
a countless throng of mourners...

445
00:37:56,108 --> 00:38:00,237
lined her funeral route in silence...

446
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,576
with the measureless grief
of newly orphaned children.

447
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:09,913
What a strange destiny
for one who gave her all...

448
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,750
yet took such joy
in life's simple pleasures.

449
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,085
GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN
RELIEF INITIATIVE

450
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:18,547
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself...

451
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,177
against the grinding windmills
of all life's miseries.

452
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,682
WINTER IN SWITZERLAND

453
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:38,275
It was a losing battle
that claimed her life too soon.

454
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:44,531
At barely 23, Amélie Poulain
let her young, tired body merge...

455
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:48,035
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

456
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,080
As she went, she felt a stab of regret...

457
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,291
for letting her father die...

458
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,795
without trying to give his stifled life...

459
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:04,092
the breath of air she had given
to so many others.

460
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,521
Wait!

461
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,028
Wait!

462
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:32,407
Wait!

463
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,535
Wait! Wait! Wait!

464
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,498
Wait! Wait!

465
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:23,417
<i>Pages full of dual ID photos...</i>

466
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,962
<i>torn up and discarded by their owners...</i>

467
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,549
<i>carefully reassembled by some oddball.</i>

468
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,094
<i>Some family album!</i>

469
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,391
A pack of Gaulaises.

470
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,686
Just a second.
It's so smoky in here.

471
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,355
Where are they?
I can't see a thing.

472
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:48,024
More to the left. More...

473
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:54,030
You need change.

474
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,615
Forget it.

475
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,036
A mauresque for the young man.

476
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,707
One kir, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

477
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,877
Was that prenuptial or post-smooching?

478
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,296
Are you a congenital schmuck?

479
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,048
Prenuptial.

480
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:15,469
Don't worry.
You'll find your Mr. Right one day.

481
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,681
All women want to sleep
on a man's shoulder.

482
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:23,059
All men snore after a few drinks...

483
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,020
and I have a musical ear.

484
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,481
I had my nasal cavities fixed.

485
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:30,525
I see you're a born romantic.

486
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:35,113
I see you've never known true love.

487
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,992
I did. It shortened my leg.

488
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,246
I thought you fell off a horse.

489
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,998
I did.

490
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,417
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

491
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:50,921
Stupid me. They always
drop you at the last minute.

492
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:54,424
He dropped me just before my act.

493
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,219
It floored me.

494
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,346
Plus the horse...

495
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,474
with me under it.

496
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,728
The mauresque?

497
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:09,689
Still, true love does exist.

498
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,566
I know.

499
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,693
After 30 years behind a bar...

500
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,278
I'm an expert.

501
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:17,405
I'll even give you the recipe.

502
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,619
Take two regulars...

503
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,831
mix them together and let them stew.

504
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,833
It never fails.

505
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,926
Excuse me!

506
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,555
- Excuse me!
- I'll go.

507
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,352
Haven't you hurt enough people?

508
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,774
Gina can defend herself.

509
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:55,151
I don't mean Gina.

510
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,736
I mean Georgette.

511
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:01,867
Look!

512
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,579
She craves your attention,
but all you can see is Gina.

513
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,583
Poor girl!

514
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,669
The things she does
to catch your eye!

515
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,049
You really must be blind.

516
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,435
I'm off on a date. Bye!

517
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,233
Whoever her new one is...

518
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:39,279
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

519
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,699
Joseph's not so nutty.

520
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,618
He's just in pain.

521
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,579
Come on!
They split up two months ago.

522
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:51,124
To keep on coming here,
he must be a masochist.

523
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,544
Don't say you haven't noticed.

524
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,130
Noticed what?

525
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,300
Well, he always sits here, right?

526
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,468
At number 8?

527
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,719
Sit down.

528
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:05,513
Sit down, Georgette.

529
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,225
What can you see?

530
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,561
My cigarette counter.

531
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,980
Nothing's missing?

532
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:15,273
Well, no.

533
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:17,817
Make an effort.

534
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:27,494
I can't see what!

535
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:30,246
Think about it. Good night.

536
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:53,395
<i>Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.</i>

537
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:58,316
<i>A mailbag found by climbers
on a glacier on Mont Blanc...</i>

538
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,613
<i>was part of a cargo lost
in a plane crash in the late 1960s.</i>

539
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:08,284
So sad.
A young, pretty princess for once.

540
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:10,745
It's OK if she's old and ugly?

541
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,039
Sure! Look at Mother Teresa.

542
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,419
Is he still chasing Gina?

543
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:21,214
No, he has somebody else.

544
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,508
Anyone I know?

545
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,594
Funny about this glacier...

546
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,596
Somebody at the Two Windmills?

547
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:31,725
Not you!

548
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,938
Not Suzanne...

549
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,734
- No!
- Yes.

550
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:45,613
There he is again.

551
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,907
How strange.

552
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:51,327
- And here.
- Him again!

553
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:52,954
Lyon Station.

554
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:57,584
And here.
March 5, Austerlitz.

555
00:47:58,168 --> 00:48:01,588
Always the same blank face.
Always neutral.

556
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:04,132
Twelve times.

557
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:06,259
I counted.

558
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,511
It's very odd.

559
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:12,223
Why keep taking your picture
all over town...

560
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,225
and throw them away?

561
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,436
Good one too.

562
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,772
It's like a ritual.

563
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:22,484
He's probably terrified of growing old.

564
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,986
It's his only consolation.

565
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,114
He's dead!

566
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:33,286
He's scared of being forgotten.

567
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,582
He wants to remind people of his face.

568
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:41,294
Like faxing his portrait
from the afterlife.

569
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:46,382
A dead man scared of being forgotten.

570
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:49,302
These guys here have it made!

571
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,471
They're long dead...

572
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:55,475
but they'll never be forgotten.

573
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,354
The girl with the glass...

574
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,650
Maybe her thoughts are with somebody else.

575
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:05,652
Somebody in the picture?

576
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:11,032
More likely a boy she saw somewhere...

577
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,494
and felt an affinity with.

578
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:20,708
You mean she'd rather imagine herself
relating to an absent person...

579
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:25,505
than build relationships
with those around her?

580
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:33,304
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

581
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:35,849
What about her?

582
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:38,393
Her own messy life?

583
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:41,855
Who'll fix that?

584
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:48,153
It's better to help people
than a garden gnome.

585
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:04,062
The trucker had 2.8 grams
of alcohol in his blood!

586
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,521
Makes me sick.

587
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,608
Talk about employing irresponsible morons!

588
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,778
- Your keys.
- Hold on, Mello.

589
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,947
Speed kills nowadays.

590
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,366
Model yourself on Lucien.

591
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:20,119
No radar will ever catch him
while he's working!

592
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:22,664
Shame on you, Mr. Collignon.

593
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,624
It's not his fault.

594
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,417
True, Mrs. Couchoix.

595
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:29,170
It's not his fault he can't sleep.

596
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:30,463
It's Lady Di's.

597
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,759
Guess what I found in the truck?

598
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,178
A lingerie catalog.

599
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:40,640
He'd pasted Lady Di's face
over the model's!

600
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:46,813
What today? Five asparagus
or more local history?

601
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,190
Nothing.

602
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:00,034
KEYS CUT WHILE YOU WAIT

603
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,925
The migraine's better?

604
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:19,887
Yes, but my sciatica
kept me awake all night.

605
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:23,850
- It's ages since I saw you looking so good.
- Oh, yeah?

606
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:29,022
A woman without love wilts
like a flower without sun.

607
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:36,612
Strange weather today!

608
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:39,073
What's so funny?

609
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:41,659
You're only the 100th one to say it.

610
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:44,662
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.

611
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:48,082
We do it to keep from taking crap.

612
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,793
I write crap that nobody publishes.

613
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:53,421
- Another rejection?
- My 30th!

614
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,090
Isn't your cousin a book critic?

615
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,717
Forget it!

616
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,347
Critics are like leeches,
sucking the blood of writers.

617
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,265
Is your book...

618
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,559
a love story?

619
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,020
It's about a guy who keeps a journal.

620
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,397
Not about his past...

621
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:14,233
but about disasters in his future.

622
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:17,737
So he gets depressed and does nothing.

623
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,614
Basically, it's about a loafer.

624
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,785
I'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

625
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,705
So you'll write off his tab.

626
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:31,918
His scribbles for my nibbles.
That's sponsorship.

627
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,760
What took you so long?

628
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,387
Look at the time!

629
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,516
Somebody peed in his mother!

630
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,818
FOOT CREAM

631
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:46,159
TOOTH PASTE

632
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:49,472
<i>Without you, today's emotions...</i>

633
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,807
<i>would be the scurf of yesterday's.</i>

634
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,352
Without you, today's emotion's...

635
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,605
would be the scurf of yesterday's.

636
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,108
Without you, today's emotions...

637
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,945
would be the scurf of yesterday's.

638
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:06,405
Tickets, please.

639
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,203
How's work?

640
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,081
You asked me already.

641
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,337
You OK these days?

642
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,922
Pretty much.

643
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:26,217
I feel a change.

644
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:31,389
I had two heart attacks...

645
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,725
an abortion,
did crack while I was pregnant.

646
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,354
Other than that, I'm fine.

647
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,064
Good.

648
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,820
Something wrong?

649
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:49,949
No, nothing.

650
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,452
Your gnome's gone.

651
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:57,248
Is he back in the toolshed?

652
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,638
Moscow. There. See?

653
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,642
No explanation.

654
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,979
He wants to see the world?

655
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,026
I can't understand it.

656
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,170
LOST

657
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:44,920
BAG

658
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:45,671

659
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,095
<i>Any normal girl would call the number...</i>

660
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:55,306
<i>meet him, return the album...</i>

661
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,643
<i>and see if her dream is viable.</i>

662
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,936
<i>It's called a reality check.</i>

663
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,190
<i>The last thing Amélie wants.</i>

664
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:09,987
I say!

665
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:12,531
Could she be falling in love?

666
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,212
Where's the boss?

667
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,382
Sleeping in the cauliflower.

668
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:57,595
- What?
- Sleeping in the cauliflower.

669
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,729
You want me... want what?

670
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,689
A scratchcard, please.

671
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,325
How does it work?

672
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:26,665
Tell you what.
Let's both do one together.

673
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,713
You scratch it here...

674
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:34,298
sideways.

675
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,518
Nothing. You?

676
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,353
Me neither.

677
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:52,817
Unlucky at cards...

678
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,654
So they say.

679
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:01,367
I have to get back.

680
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:04,036
Yes.

681
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,129
Porno Video Palace.

682
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:16,507
I'm calling about the ad.

683
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,717
- You're over 18?
- Yes.

684
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:22,179
- Shaved?
- Sorry?

685
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:26,517
Are you shaved?
Fur pie doesn't sell.

686
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,288
How's life, Mrs. Wells?

687
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,832
When you've nothing to live for...

688
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,543
Come on, life's great!

689
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,253
Dream on, kid.

690
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,604
Hello, Mr. Dufayel.

691
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:16,275
Here's your order, Mr. Dufayel.

692
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:19,528
I doubt it. I hate artichokes.

693
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:23,741
You shouldn't. Watch this.

694
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,624
Take it.

695
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:36,128
That's better.

696
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:50,601
Lucien, you're a wizard!

698
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:58,233
Mister Collignon?

699
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:01,904
Sorry, it slipped out.

700
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,156
Practice, Lucien!

701
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:07,785
Practice! Repeat after me.

702
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:10,037
Collignon, down the john.

703
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,377
- Collignon, down the john.
- Your turn now.

704
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,628
Collignon...

705
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,175
Collignon, big moron!

706
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,928
See? You can do it.

707
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,597
Collignon, dead and gone!

708
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,849
Very good!

709
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,895
Collignon, big moron, down the john!

710
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:46,156
OK! That's enough for today.

711
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:51,161
Lucien, that's enough!

712
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:52,997
Very good.

713
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,585
I found this under your mat.

714
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,122
Still no win!

715
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:20,292
Me neither.

716
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,254
May I?

717
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,131
There's a little...

718
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:35,682
You're gorgeous when you blush.

719
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:38,977
Like a wild flower.

720
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,356
It's my dyspepsia.

721
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,026
Morning, all!

722
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,862
Beautiful day.

723
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,257
Pack of Gitanes, please.

724
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,301
Bravo! Vive la France!

725
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,428
You scalded me!

726
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:17,057
Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

727
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,856
It was Amélie, she...

728
01:06:57,264 --> 01:07:01,268
When they went up Mont Blanc...

729
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,730
the silicon in her face froze up.

730
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,275
Her face was a festering mass!

731
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:38,430
Mulled wine and spice cookies.

732
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:44,478
I was too hard on the girl with the glass.

733
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:50,150
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

734
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:55,364
They're into different things.

735
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,866
Luck is like the Tour de France.

736
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:01,578
You wait, and it flashes past you.

737
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:06,291
You have to catch it while you can.

738
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:31,858
Can I help you?

739
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:34,903
Excuse me. I found this in the street.

740
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:37,781
Nino will be glad!

741
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,658
He was so sad the other day.

742
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,660
I almost prayed to St. Anthony!

743
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:45,414
Is Nino here now?

744
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:48,292
On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

745
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,671
How long has he had this collection?

746
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:57,426
Since I got him the job here, last year.

747
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:01,471
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

748
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:07,436
In the daytime, he took pictures
of footprints in wet cement.

749
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:09,688
He's a funny guy.

750
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,024
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

751
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,903
Other things, like...

752
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:21,366
whenever he heard a funny laugh,
he'd tape it.

753
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,705
Gosh!

754
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,500
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

755
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,878
He never keeps them long.

756
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:35,714
Times are hard for dreamers.

757
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,550
Eva! Are those coffees coming?

758
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,969
Gotta go. Thanks for the album.

759
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:44,806
It's OK. I have time
to take it to the funfair.

760
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:49,770
Suit yourself. The Ghost Train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix.

761
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:15,629
Is Nino here?

762
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:19,132
He doesn't get in till 7:00.

763
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:22,969
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

764
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:24,721
20 francs.

765
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,711
See you next Wednesday.

766
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,349
<i>5 p.m. tomorrow, Montmartre carousel.</i>

767
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,393
<i>Bring 5 francs.</i>

768
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:13,663
Want to know about her?

769
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:19,085
- You know her?
- You bet!

770
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:21,963
She put us in her shirt pocket.

771
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:23,757
Next to her breast.

772
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:28,512
- Is she pretty?
- Not bad.

773
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,639
- Beautiful.
- No. Pretty.

774
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:33,475
- Beautiful!
- Pretty.

775
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:36,061
- What does she want from me?
- She's broke.

776
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:38,730
She wants a reward for the album.

777
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:40,982
Or else she collects photos too.

778
01:12:41,066 --> 01:12:46,112
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

779
01:12:50,242 --> 01:12:51,243
No, you dope!

780
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,871
She's in love.

781
01:12:54,955 --> 01:12:57,916
- I don't even know her.
- You do.

782
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:01,586
- Since when?
- Since always.

783
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:04,047
In your dreams.

784
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:22,816
You! Man with the plastic bag!
It's for you.

785
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,537
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

786
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:04,542
The fool looks at a finger
that points at the sky...

787
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,453
I know the stranger in the pictures.

788
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:25,540
He's a ghost. He's invisible!

789
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:29,002
He only appears
when the film is developed.

790
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,422
When a girl has her photo taken...

791
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:35,675
he goes "wooo" in her ear...

792
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:38,428
while he fondles her neck.

793
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:41,097
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix!

794
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,060
Who are you?

795
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,313
Page 51.

796
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,864
DO YOU

797
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,824
WANT

798
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,160
TO MEET ME?

799
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,010
Listen to this.

800
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:44,137
Boy of 6, while parents sleep...

801
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,973
drives off in a pedal car.

802
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:50,727
Found on a highway in Germany...

803
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:54,355
he told police
he wanted to see the stars.

804
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:58,067
Ain't life beautiful though?

805
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:02,697
Love. The only bug she hadn't caught.

806
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,700
- Nobody's immune.
- It gives me a break.

807
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:08,077
Love's a great beautician.

808
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:14,709
What's she like?
Tall, small? Fair, dark?

809
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:18,504
Let's say average height.

810
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:23,593
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

811
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,054
Pretty, for her type.

812
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:30,850
As for fair or dark, it's hard to say.

813
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:33,227
She wasn't a redhead.

814
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:36,272
- Unless...
- Forget it.

815
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:40,902
I remember she casually asked
about your girlfriend.

816
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:42,111
And?

817
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:46,032
I said you weren't interested, right?

818
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,617
You didn't!

819
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,453
What do you care?
You don't even know her.

820
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:55,124
- Exactly. It's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

821
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,293
A pound of nectarines.

822
01:19:57,377 --> 01:20:00,254
The ones here are the prettiest.

823
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:02,340
Trust him. He's an artist.

824
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,468
He goes home with a ton of unsold stock.

825
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:08,554
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

826
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:11,015
No, sir! He's studying art!

827
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:14,477
Sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

828
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,813
The boy's a useless vegetable!

829
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,398
<i>With a prompter...</i>

830
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:22,110
<i>in each cellar window
whispering comebacks...</i>

831
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,779
<i>shy people would have the last laugh.</i>

832
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,907
At least you'll never be a vegetable!

833
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:31,077
Even artichokes have hearts.

834
01:20:33,413 --> 01:20:37,208
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

835
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:42,190
<i>Darling Mado, I miss you
more and more each day.</i>

836
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:45,526
<i>I'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki.</i>

837
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:47,528
<i>I can't sleep, can't eat...</i>

838
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,615
<i>This camp was the mistake of my life...</i>

839
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:54,535
<i>depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.</i>

840
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:57,872
<i>I think of you endlessly.
Your Adrien.</i>

841
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:04,253
<i>I turned down my last month's wages
instead of giving notice.</i>

842
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:08,382
<i>I dream of better times ahead.</i>

843
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:12,261
<i>An orange-colored day.
Remember, my love?</i>

844
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,472
<i>Your everloving Adrien.</i>

845
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:17,600
<i>Good news, sweetheart.</i>

846
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:21,104
<i>Soon I'll be able to afford a car...</i>

847
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:23,689
<i>and drive home every night.</i>

848
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:28,694
<i>Till then, meet me on Friday,
and we'll go out.</i>

849
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:17,280
MOTHER

850
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:22,451
Psychiatric Helpline.

851
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:57,028
WHERE & WHEN?

852
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:09,081
<i>One hour later, on Boulevard St. Martin...</i>

853
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:13,878
<i>Amélie walks into a party goods
and costume shop.</i>

854
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:18,382
<i>At the same time, a man leaves
his home on Rue Lecourbe.</i>

855
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:24,096
<i>26 minutes later,
Amélie is at East Station.</i>

856
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:32,438
<i>Simultaneously, the man
in red shoes parks outside.</i>

857
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:36,901
<i>The time is exactly 11:40.</i>

858
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,531
<i>At this precise moment...</i>

859
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:29,036
<i>only Amélie has the key
to the riddle of the mystery man.</i>

860
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,875
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

861
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:37,878
Not so bad when it's not raining.

862
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:41,090
- This is for you.
- Me?

863
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:53,936
<i>Dear Mrs. Wells,
we recently recovered a mailbag...</i>

864
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,188
<i>that was lost in a plane crash...</i>

865
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:59,775
<i>on October 12th, 1969, on Mont Blanc.</i>

866
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:04,238
<i>We are forwarding
the enclosed letter to your address...</i>

867
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:08,451
<i>with our apologies
for the uncustomary delay.</i>

868
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:11,745
<i>Jacques Grasjeau, Customer Services.</i>

869
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,957
<i>Darling Mado, I'm in exile.</i>

870
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,792
<i>I can't sleep, can't eat...</i>

871
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:18,586
<i>I think of you endlessly.</i>

872
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:22,590
<i>I know I've made the mistake of my life.</i>

873
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:25,259
<i>I turned down that woman's money.</i>

874
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:30,264
<i>If all goes well,
I'll soon be able to afford a house.</i>

875
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:33,476
<i>I dream of better times ahead...</i>

876
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:36,270
<i>when you'll forgive me
and join me here...</i>

877
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,898
<i>one orange-colored day.</i>

878
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,233
<i>Your everloving Adrien.</i>

879
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:13,224
Another package for you.

880
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,070
You heard about the concierge?

881
01:29:27,154 --> 01:29:29,573
She got a letter.

882
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:33,410
From her husband, 40 years late.

883
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:37,456
That's a lot, isn't it?

884
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:53,472
I'm not big on still life, Mr. Dufayel.

885
01:29:53,556 --> 01:29:56,642
Then work on your lean layer.

886
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,436
Fat over lean. Always!

887
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:24,336
I heard there'll soon be a new star.

888
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,548
You're into stars now?

889
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:31,677
I saw it on TV at my ma's, that's why.

890
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,306
I dunno if it's true.

891
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,142
In America...

892
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:41,770
they'll take rich people's ashes...

893
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,731
put them in a satellite...

894
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:45,858
and shoot it into space.

895
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:48,277
It's going to shine forever.

896
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:54,575
And Lady Di...

897
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,869
will they do the same for her?

898
01:30:56,952 --> 01:31:00,372
Lady Di! Lady Di! Give it a rest!

899
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,166
I can't concentrate!

900
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:08,130
Lady Di! Lady Di!

901
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,007
Renoir!

902
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:17,176
I don't understand.

903
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,054
Brilliant! You were perfect.

904
01:33:21,138 --> 01:33:24,349
- Did it work?
- It's getting there.

905
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:27,311
Ask me again anytime. The harm's done.

906
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:31,023
- Harm?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

907
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:39,591
THE TWO WINDMILLS AT 4 P.M.

908
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:51,895
Could you stand in for me at 4:00?

909
01:34:51,979 --> 01:34:53,730
Again?

910
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:04,408
What's eating him?

911
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:08,120
- I smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

912
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,330
With other men, yes.

913
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,460
<i>Nino is late.</i>

914
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:18,130
<i>Amélie can only see two explanations.</i>

915
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:20,424
<i>1, he didn't get the photo.</i>

916
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:24,761
<i>2, before he could assemble it...</i>

917
01:35:24,845 --> 01:35:29,016
<i>a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.</i>

918
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:31,059
<i>The cops gave chase.</i>

919
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:34,646
<i>They got away but he caused a crash.</i>

920
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:40,193
<i>When he came to, he'd lost his memory.</i>

921
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:43,405
<i>An ex-con picked him up...</i>

922
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:47,868
<i>mistook him for a fugitive
and shipped him to Istanbul.</i>

923
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,412
<i>There he met some Afghan raiders...</i>

924
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:54,499
<i>who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.</i>

925
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:01,965
<i>But their truck hit a mine in Tajikistan.</i>

926
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:05,052
<i>He survived, took to the hills...</i>

927
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:07,429
<i>and became a Mujaheddin.</i>

928
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:10,557
<i>Amélie refuses to get upset for a guy...</i>

929
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:15,145
<i>who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cozy.</i>

930
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:37,417
- What can I get you?
- Coffee, please.

931
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,680
TODAY'S MENU

932
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,107
<i>He's understood.</i>

933
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:45,402
<i>He's going to put down his spoon...</i>

934
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:50,407
<i>dip his finger in the sugar...</i>

935
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:59,958
<i>turn around slowly and speak to me.</i>

936
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:11,136
Is this you?

937
01:38:16,641 --> 01:38:18,060
Yes, it's you.

938
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:46,421
- More coffee?
- No thanks.

939
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:12,322
So it's this man here, with his hand up?

940
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:19,830
Is she in love with him?

941
01:39:25,252 --> 01:39:29,798
I think it's time she took a real risk.

942
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:33,260
She might. She's devising a stratagem.

943
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:37,472
She's fond of stratagems.

944
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:44,688
In fact, she's cowardly.

945
01:39:45,147 --> 01:39:49,234
That's why I can't capture her look.

946
01:39:50,527 --> 01:39:56,032
Dufayel's attempts to meddle
are intolerable!

947
01:39:58,535 --> 01:40:04,457
If Amélie chooses to live in a dream...

948
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:08,712
and remain an introverted young woman...

949
01:40:08,795 --> 01:40:13,425
she has an absolute right
to mess up her life!

950
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,920
What are you doing?

951
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:54,507
Tell me, Lucien.

952
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:59,804
For deliveries, do you keep
keys to all the apartments?

953
01:41:11,858 --> 01:41:15,737
One of your booths is out of order.

954
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:21,326
It seems to be jammed.

955
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,787
East Station ticket hall.

956
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:29,417
Buy a video, get one free?

957
01:41:38,301 --> 01:41:39,719
Samantha?

958
01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:52,524
Can you stand in for me at...

959
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:17,799
Photo booth.
East Station. Tuesday 5 p.m.

960
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:33,291
Almost done.

961
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:41,966
<i>The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of aging...</i>

962
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:43,927
<i>but simply the repairman...</i>

963
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:46,930
<i>a normal technician doing his work.</i>

964
01:44:35,812 --> 01:44:40,024
He keeps spying on me.
It's making me sick.

965
01:44:40,108 --> 01:44:43,862
4:05, blatant female conspiracy.

966
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:48,116
Gosh, you're tense!

967
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:50,160
Good luck. You'll need it.

968
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:57,750
Excuse me.

969
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:01,254
- Did you put this in my pocket?
- Yes, but it's not from me.

970
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:03,256
I know. Where is she?

971
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:05,008
She's at her father's.

972
01:45:05,675 --> 01:45:07,677
It bothers me. Can I talk to you?

973
01:45:08,845 --> 01:45:10,472
I get off at 6:00.

974
01:45:10,555 --> 01:45:12,807
- Can you come back?
- OK.

975
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:14,642
See you then.

976
01:45:15,894 --> 01:45:18,855
4:08, docking scheduled.

977
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:53,139
A blond guy in a camel coat.

978
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:54,974
Absent-minded too.

979
01:45:55,058 --> 01:45:57,310
How come?

980
01:45:57,393 --> 01:46:00,063
He came back three times the same day.

981
01:46:01,064 --> 01:46:02,482
1:12.

982
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:04,067
Camel coat.

983
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,193
2:50.

984
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:06,653
Camel coat.

985
01:46:06,736 --> 01:46:10,281
- 4:17.
- Stop it!

986
01:46:10,365 --> 01:46:13,576
My rash has come back!
Look. Suzanne!

987
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:17,956
My rash is back.
He's driving me nuts!

988
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:19,582
Lay off!

989
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:22,961
Her conscience is at fault.

990
01:46:23,044 --> 01:46:25,922
I've had it! I'm going home.

991
01:46:26,756 --> 01:46:30,009
Psychos are the last straw!

992
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:37,183
Stop smothering them.
Women need air.

993
01:46:37,267 --> 01:46:40,520
You give them air, they blow you off.

994
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,438
Fresh air's healthy.

995
01:46:42,522 --> 01:46:44,357
Cram it, failure!

996
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:48,778
Failed writer, failed life...

997
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:51,364
I love the word fail.

998
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:53,157
Failure is human destiny.

999
01:46:53,241 --> 01:46:54,993
It's gasbag time!

1000
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:58,371
Failure teaches us
that life is but a draft...

1001
01:46:58,454 --> 01:47:02,834
a long rehearsal
for a show that will never play.

1002
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:05,461
I bet he stole that.

1003
01:47:05,545 --> 01:47:08,631
I do have some original ideas...

1004
01:47:09,299 --> 01:47:12,260
but people always steal them.

1005
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:14,095
Same as your women.

1006
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:16,180
Meaning?

1007
01:47:16,973 --> 01:47:19,434
You'd better get used to it.

1008
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:22,353
Speak for yourself, you...

1009
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:28,943
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

1010
01:47:29,027 --> 01:47:31,779
Georgette went out, Joseph got mad.

1011
01:47:31,863 --> 01:47:33,323
Went out?

1012
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:36,451
Like Gina.
You know who Gina's with?

1013
01:47:37,035 --> 01:47:39,329
The guy with the plastic bag!

1014
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:42,832
I saw their little game.

1015
01:47:42,915 --> 01:47:45,043
The note in the coat pocket.

1016
01:47:45,126 --> 01:47:46,544
4:08.

1017
01:47:46,628 --> 01:47:50,715
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1018
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:57,847
I'm worried for Amélie because I like you.

1019
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,223
What do you mean?

1020
01:47:59,307 --> 01:48:02,935
By and large,
the men I like are mentally unsound.

1021
01:48:03,019 --> 01:48:05,063
I'd like to know more about you.

1022
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:06,272
Ask me.

1023
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,778
One swallow doesn't make?

1024
01:48:11,861 --> 01:48:13,446
A swallow?

1025
01:48:14,447 --> 01:48:15,990
A summer.

1026
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:17,450
Practice makes...

1027
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:18,951
Perfect.

1028
01:48:19,035 --> 01:48:20,536
- Curiosity...
- Killed the cat.

1029
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:22,080
- Haste...
- Makes waste.

1030
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:23,956
- Rolling stone...
- Gathers no moss.

1031
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,084
- It's a sin...
- To steal a pin.

1032
01:48:26,167 --> 01:48:29,754
- Absence makes...
- The heart grow fonder.

1033
01:48:29,837 --> 01:48:31,839
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1034
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:36,803
At home, we say a man
who knows proverbs can't be all bad.

1035
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:44,143
Pretty girl from the fifth floor,
listen to this!

1036
01:48:44,227 --> 01:48:48,523
- You believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1037
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:50,858
You're in for a surprise.

1038
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:54,487
What if I told you
that a team of climbers...

1039
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:58,241
on Mont Blanc had found...

1040
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:03,329
hard proof that my husband loved me?

1041
01:49:35,903 --> 01:49:38,239
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1042
01:49:38,322 --> 01:49:40,158
For Miss Amélie?

1043
01:49:40,241 --> 01:49:42,201
She's baking her famous plum cake?

1044
01:49:42,285 --> 01:49:44,370
Collignon! Go!

1045
01:49:44,454 --> 01:49:46,289
I'll be right back.

1046
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:15,169
I'LL BE BACK.

1047
01:51:44,407 --> 01:51:47,535
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

1048
01:52:03,509 --> 01:52:07,763
So, little Amélie...

1049
01:52:07,847 --> 01:52:10,808
your bones aren't made of glass.

1050
01:52:10,892 --> 01:52:14,103
You can take life's knocks.

1051
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:18,566
If you let this chance go by...

1052
01:52:19,609 --> 01:52:24,655
eventually, your heart will become...

1053
01:52:24,739 --> 01:52:30,453
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

1054
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:34,498
So...

1055
01:52:34,582 --> 01:52:38,294
go get him, for Pete's sake!

1056
01:55:25,336 --> 01:55:27,963
Without you, today's emotions...

1057
01:55:28,047 --> 01:55:31,425
would be the scurf of yesterday's.

1058
01:56:27,565 --> 01:56:29,066
International airport.

1059
01:56:29,150 --> 01:56:34,280
<i>September 28, 1997.
It is exactly 11 a.m.</i>

1060
01:56:34,363 --> 01:56:37,116
<i>At the funfair, near the ghost train...</i>

1061
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:40,119
<i>the marshmallow twister's twisting...</i>

1062
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:43,080
<i>while in Villette Park, Félix Lerbier...</i>

1063
01:56:43,164 --> 01:56:46,041
<i>learns there are more links

1064
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:48,252
<i>than atoms in the universe.</i>

1065
01:56:49,545 --> 01:56:51,630
<i>At the Sacré Coeur...</i>

1066
