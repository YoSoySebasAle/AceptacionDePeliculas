for my family.

Why us then?

660
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:37,249
If it's kid stuff, why not have
the kids from Detroit do it?

661
01:53:39,916 --> 01:53:45,749
Excuse me, Noodles. He means that
it's something that's very simple.

662
01:53:45,833 --> 01:53:49,165
But he needs kids
from outside to handle it.

663
01:53:49,333 --> 01:53:52,582
He just found out they're moving
these diamonds to Holland

664
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:56,249
in a few days. So it's something
came up right away.

stumbled on this whole thing.

- Tell them the story.

671
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:26,499
Pussy insurance. The insurance
pussies. Tell them that story.

672
01:54:26,666 --> 01:54:32,707
Life is stranger than shit, that's
all. It's a pisser. No big story.

673
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:36,249
I got this insurance agent,
this Jew kid named David.

674
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:41,082
He conned me into every policy
in the world. Every policy, name it.

675
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:44,999
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.

676
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:49,999
I'm drinking with the boys one
night, he comes in with his wife...

677
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:52,665
...a brunette with a nice ass
who works for a jeweler.

678
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:55,582
And he's still on the hustle,
this guy.

679
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:59,457
So I wink at the guys,
I say, "Look...

680
01:55:01,166 --> 01:55:05,457
...the most serious policy,
you don't have me covered for."

681
01:55:05,625 --> 01:55:09,665
He goes, "What's that, Joe?"
"Cock insurance."

682
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:14,499
"You make me a policy that when
it don't work, I get a payment...

683
01:55:14,666 --> 01:55:16,832
...I'll write out a check now."

684
01:55:19,125 --> 01:55:22,957
He thinks, and he says,
"I don't know if the actuality

685
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:27,124
gauges govern this...
but we can make a policy.

686
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:30,499
But you gotta guarantee
you're in good health now."

687
01:55:30,666 --> 01:55:35,415
I says, "Look, leave her with me.
Come back and see if it stands up.

688
01:55:35,583 --> 01:55:38,832
If it stands up,
you know I'm in good health."

689
01:55:38,916 --> 01:55:40,957

02:17:56,583 --> 02:17:58,915
Was there any violence to justify...

862
02:17:59,083 --> 02:18:02,749
My motto is:
"Prevention, not repression."

863
02:18:02,916 --> 02:18:04,999
You let scabs move in and work.

864
02:18:05,166 --> 02:18:09,040
Young lady, you wanna talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

865
02:18:09,208 --> 02:18:10,624
With your permission,

866
02:18:10,791 --> 02:18:14,249
I'll take these flowers
to my missis before they wilt.

867

REPORTER:
Chief, one more question.

870
02:18:23,750 --> 02:18:25,665
We heard he's the youngest
stockholder

871
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:28,207
in that factory you occupied.

872
02:18:32,916 --> 02:18:34,874
What'd you mean by that?

873
02:18:35,041 --> 02:18:39,582
They say management expressed their
thanks with a present for the baby.

874
02:18:42,625 --> 02:18:45,249
You know,
slander is a serious offense.

875
02:18:45,416 --> 02:18:47,665
Especially from a hack reporter.

876
02:18:48,166 --> 02:18:50,915
You wanna find out how serious?

877
02:18:53,041 --> 02:18:58,040
But since this is my first boy
after four girls...

878
02:18:58,208 --> 02:19:00,749
...I'll declare amnesty.

879
02:19:02,416 --> 02:19:04,749
Behave yourself.

880
02:19:06,125 --> 02:19:08,040
Go.

- He's eating?
- Mmm.

884
02:21:24,041 --> 02:21:27,457
- For five.
- For five? Well, why not.

885
02:21:27,625 --> 02:21:30,415
You could feed an army
with these milk plants.

886
02:21:30,583 --> 02:21:33,082
We could open up a dairy.

887

Oh, hey. Che bella.

02:21:38,625 --> 02:21:44,415

I love you.

- Vincent.

- The girls.
- The girls!

My son, where is he?

Where do you think? He's in the
maternity ward. He never left.

He got restless, so he wanted
to change his bed.

so they wanted to change their beds.

just come in on weekends.

Yeah, beats the seashore.

She takes on 10 guys while her hubby
watches through the peephole.

1024

Beats the hell out of the movies.

1025
02:31:48,083 --> 02:31:50,707
I wonder what that jerk
is up to in his cubbyhole?

1026
02:31:50,875 --> 02:31:54,082

where is his fucking wife.

We'll make it a foursome.

1031

I'm not that kind of guy.

1032
02:32:20,166 --> 02:32:22,582
I'm afraid if I give you
a good crack in the mouth,

1033
02:32:22,666 --> 02:32:24,999
you'd probably like it.

1034

lunatics who go around Germany

1037
02:32:53,291 --> 02:32:55,832
burning down all Jewish stores.

1038
02:32:55,916 --> 02:32:59,540
Those lunatics burned down also
our store and made us go to America.

1039
02:33:01,541 --> 02:33:04,124
- I'm Jewish too.
- I know, sir.

1040
02:33:04,416 --> 02:33:07,499

- Knows what?

1041

Everybody knows who you are, sir.

1042
02:33:15,875 --> 02:33:20,165
- And what do you think? - I don't
think, it's your business, sir.

1043
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:21,874
No, you think.

1044
02:33:23,375 --> 02:33:25,832
You think it's a disgrace,
don't you?

1045
02:33:26,375 --> 02:33:28,832

like the Italians,

1046

1047
02:33:31,833 --> 02:33:35,207
We have enough enemies
without becoming gangsters, sir.

How much money do you make a week?

1049
02:33:39,041 --> 02:33:41,249
Not everybody tips like you, sir.

1050
02:33:41,333 --> 02:33:44,332
I make enough to go to school
and learn for my degree.

1051
02:33:44,416 --> 02:33:47,749
Good for you. So maybe by the time
you are 60, you'll make enough,

1052
02:33:47,833 --> 02:33:51,207
but then you won't be able
to get it up anymore.

1053
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,499
- Been waiting long?
- All my life.

1054
02:34:29,375 --> 02:34:32,040
You wanted a place by the ocean.
I had it opened.

1055
02:34:32,208 --> 02:34:33,874
It was closed for the season.

1056
02:34:34,041 --> 02:34:36,832

Blanquette de veau.

1061
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:26,582
I'll have the asperges sauce

1062

and then a Châteaubriand.

1063

- Natures.

- Comme dessert?
- I'll decide later.

throw away the key, wouldn't you?

And the thing is,
I probably wouldn't even mind.

1087

- So?
- So I got to get to where I'm going.

- To the top.

...no time at all,
because you're not doing anything.

1100
02:39:24,916 --> 02:39:28,874
There were two things I couldn't
get out of my mind. One was Dominic.

1101

The way he said, "I slipped,"
just before he died.

1102

The other was you.

How you used to read me
your Song of Songs, remember?

1104

How beautiful are your feet
In sandals, O prince's daughter

1105
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,124
I used to read the Bible
every night.

1106
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:01,165
Every night
I used to think about you.

1107
02:40:03,416 --> 02:40:08,124
Your navel is a bowl
Well-rounded with no lack of wine

1108
02:40:08,583 --> 02:40:12,165
Your belly, a heap of wheat
Surrounded with lilies

1109
02:40:12,333 --> 02:40:14,749

1110
02:40:16,291 --> 02:40:18,749

Nobody's gonna love you
the way I loved you.

1113
02:40:38,958 --> 02:40:42,457
At times I couldn't stand it.
I used to think about you.

1114
02:40:42,625 --> 02:40:46,707
I'd think, "Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."

Let's drink to our last shipment.

1363
03:20:07,208 --> 03:20:10,040
There's more onboard
tonight than just booze.

1364
03:20:10,208 --> 03:20:15,624
It's 10 years of our lives. Ten
years that were really worth living.

1365
03:20:15,791 --> 03:20:17,165
Yeah.

1366
03:20:35,625 --> 03:20:37,457
MAX: Noodles.

1367
03:20:38,833 --> 03:20:40,415
Noodles.

1368
03:20:42,125 --> 03:20:44,707
- L'Chaim.
- L'Chaim.

1369
03:20:47,708 --> 03:20:50,290
How long will I have to wait?

1370
03:20:53,958 --> 03:20:57,457
A year and a half, more or less.

1371
03:20:58,833 --> 03:21:00,999
Six months off for good behavior.

1372
03:21:01,458 --> 03:21:04,290
- What are you gonna do?
NOODLES: Don't ask.

1373
03:22:38,958 --> 03:22:40,790
FEMALE OPERATOR: Operator.

1374
03:22:42,125 --> 03:22:43,290
Police, please.

1375
03:22:43,791 --> 03:22:45,665
(RINGS)

1376
03:22:49,291 --> 03:22:51,540
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.

1377
03:22:54,291 --> 03:22:55,832
Hello.

1378
03:22:56,791 --> 03:22:59,874
Who's speaking? Can I help you?

1379
03:23:00,041 --> 03:23:02,040
- Hello.
- Yeah.

1380
03:23:04,625 --> 03:23:06,374
I got a good tip for you.

1381
03:23:32,833 --> 03:23:36,624
NOODLES: Yeah, who is it?
MAX: It's Max. Open the door.

1382
03:23:42,500 --> 03:23:46,540
- What's the matter with you?
You sick? - No, I'm fine.

1383
03:23:46,708 --> 03:23:48,374
MAX: You don't look it.

1384
03:23:50,500 --> 03:23:53,332
Maybe you'd better stay home
tonight, huh?

1385
03:23:53,833 --> 03:23:56,749
- Why?
- Huh.

1386
03:23:59,208 --> 03:24:02,124
You know, I've been watching you
all night.

1387
03:24:03,625 --> 03:24:06,457
And you've been drinking
like a fish.

1388
03:24:07,333 --> 03:24:09,749
Trying to get your courage up?

1389
03:24:13,250 --> 03:24:16,540
We're only bringing
in a shipment of booze.

1390
03:24:18,083 --> 03:24:21,290
It's got so you're even scared
to do that.

1391
03:24:23,041 --> 03:24:25,790
Maybe you just better
stay home tonight.

1392
03:24:26,833 --> 03:24:28,374
With Eve.

1393
03:24:38,708 --> 03:24:43,124
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you go,
I go too. Remember that.

1394
03:24:52,958 --> 03:24:55,415
Maybe Sharkey was right.

1395
03:24:55,583 --> 03:24:58,374
Maybe I ought to just dump you.

1396
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:11,124
- You're really crazy.
- Never say that.

1397
03:25:11,625 --> 03:25:14,790
Don't say it!

1398
03:25:21,666 --> 03:25:25,749
CAROL: Max made fools of us,
Noodles. He wanted to die.

1399
03:25:25,916 --> 03:25:28,957
Did you know his old man died
in the nut house?

1400
03:25:29,125 --> 03:25:31,957
Max didn't want to end up
the same way.

1401
03:25:32,166 --> 03:25:36,290
So he put the idea
in our heads to tip off the cops.

1402
03:25:36,458 --> 03:25:41,332
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first

1403
03:25:41,500 --> 03:25:44,790
just to get himself killed.

1404
03:26:01,958 --> 03:26:04,290
What is this?

1405
03:26:07,333 --> 03:26:08,499
Opening night.

1406
03:26:10,166 --> 03:26:12,832
Fifteen years ago.

1407
03:26:13,291 --> 03:26:15,290
Who's this?

1408
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:19,999
Patron saint of the place.

1409
03:26:21,375 --> 03:26:23,624
And some actress.

1410
03:26:24,416 --> 03:26:25,790
Do you know her?

1411
03:26:27,791 --> 03:26:29,332
No.

1412
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:00,082
This proves me base:

1413
03:27:01,458 --> 03:27:04,332
If she first meet the curled Antony,
he'll make demand of her,

1414
03:27:04,416 --> 03:27:07,624
and spend that kiss
which is my heaven to have.

1415
03:27:30,958 --> 03:27:33,290
Come, thou mortal wretch,

1416
03:27:35,958 --> 03:27:40,624
with thy sharp teeth this knot
intrinsicate of life at once untie:

1417
03:27:43,291 --> 03:27:45,499
Poor venomous fool.

1418
03:27:47,833 --> 03:27:50,874
Be angry, and dispatch.

1419
03:27:53,666 --> 03:27:56,499
Oh, couldst thou speak,

1420
03:27:57,416 --> 03:28:01,707
that I might hear thee call
great Caesar ass unpolicied!

1421
03:28:01,791 --> 03:28:04,582
Oh eastern star! Peace, peace!

1422
03:28:04,666 --> 03:28:07,040
Dost thou not see my baby
at my breast,

1423
03:28:07,125 --> 03:28:10,707
that sucks the nurse asleep?
Oh, break! Oh, break!

1424
03:28:10,791 --> 03:28:12,915
As sweet as balm,

1425
03:28:13,583 --> 03:28:17,457
as soft as air, as gentle...

1426
03:28:19,166 --> 03:28:21,082
Oh, Antony!

1427
03:28:29,291 --> 03:28:31,415
Nay, I will take thee too.

1428
03:28:39,208 --> 03:28:41,499
What should I stay...

1429
03:28:41,583 --> 03:28:44,915
In this vile world?
So, fare thee well.

1430
03:28:46,041 --> 03:28:50,957
Now boast thee, death, in thy
possession lies a lass unparallel'd.

1431
03:28:51,041 --> 03:28:53,165
Downy windows, close,

1432
03:28:53,250 --> 03:28:57,665
and golden Phoebus never be beheld
of eyes again so royal!

1433
03:28:57,750 --> 03:29:01,124
Your crown's awry.
I'll mend it, and then play.

1434
03:29:38,750 --> 03:29:41,040
Hello, Deborah.

1435
03:29:48,625 --> 03:29:51,290
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1436
03:29:58,041 --> 03:30:01,374
What is someone
supposed to say after...

1437
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:05,040
...more than 30 years.

1438
03:30:10,166 --> 03:30:15,374
Well, how about, "How you doing?
You're looking good." Or...

1439
03:30:18,125 --> 03:30:21,290
"I was hoping
I'd never see you again."

1440
03:30:23,708 --> 03:30:26,707
I never thought I would.

1441
03:30:27,791 --> 03:30:30,124
There's a difference.

1442
03:30:30,833 --> 03:30:33,207
At least you recognized me,
that's something.

1443
03:30:33,291 --> 03:30:37,124
Actresses have good memories.

1444
03:30:46,875 --> 03:30:49,207
You want a drink?

1445
03:30:53,416 --> 03:30:55,832
I'm having one.

1446
03:31:06,250 --> 03:31:07,290
Margo.

1447
03:31:09,041 --> 03:31:11,749
- Yes, miss?
DEBORAH: That's all. You can go.

1448
03:31:11,916 --> 03:31:14,124
All right, miss.

1449
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:21,874
She called you "miss."

1450
03:31:22,208 --> 03:31:24,624
You never got married?

1451
03:31:25,458 --> 03:31:27,082
No.

1452
03:31:30,666 --> 03:31:32,207
You live alone?

1453
03:31:40,333 --> 03:31:41,832
No.

1454
03:31:48,666 --> 03:31:50,999
Where were you?

1455
03:31:53,916 --> 03:31:56,332
I was out of town.

1456
03:31:59,166 --> 03:32:01,957
Have you been back long?

1457
03:32:02,916 --> 03:32:05,332
A couple of days.

1458
03:32:05,500 --> 03:32:07,749
Are you staying?

1459
03:32:19,375 --> 03:32:20,790
That depends.

1460
03:32:23,708 --> 03:32:25,790
Why do you want to see me?

1461
03:32:27,625 --> 03:32:29,957
Two reasons.

1462
03:32:30,125 --> 03:32:33,290
First, I wanted to see
if you did the right thing,

1463
03:32:33,375 --> 03:32:35,457
turning me down
to become an actress.

1464
03:32:39,791 --> 03:32:41,374
Well?

1465
03:32:44,041 --> 03:32:46,457
You did. You're terrific.

1466
03:33:02,041 --> 03:33:05,124
"Age cannot wither her."

1467
03:33:05,333 --> 03:33:08,332
It's like the play
was written for you.

1468
03:33:11,791 --> 03:33:14,249
What was the other reason?

1469
03:33:14,458 --> 03:33:16,749
The other reason...

1470
03:33:19,958 --> 03:33:24,290
...is to decide whether I should go
to a party tomorrow night.

1471
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:32,540
Party?

1472
03:33:35,833 --> 03:33:38,332
Yeah, on Long Island.

1473
03:33:39,833 --> 03:33:42,999
A Secretary Bailey.

1474
03:33:46,833 --> 03:33:48,999
Do you know Secretary Bailey?

1475
03:33:50,833 --> 03:33:52,040
No.

1476
03:33:54,458 --> 03:33:56,790
But I was invited anyway.

1477
03:34:05,291 --> 03:34:08,165
If you don't know each other,
why were you invited?

1478
03:34:08,333 --> 03:34:09,874
I don't know.

1479
03:34:11,500 --> 03:34:13,540
I thought you might know why.

1480
03:34:14,583 --> 03:34:15,957
Me?

1481
03:34:16,166 --> 03:34:17,790
Why me?

1482
03:34:23,208 --> 03:34:25,124
Because you know him.

1483
03:34:25,291 --> 03:34:26,415
(KNOCKING)

1484
03:34:26,583 --> 03:34:28,040
DEBORAH: Who is it?
DAVID: David.

1485
03:34:28,208 --> 03:34:30,874
- No, David.
DAVID: Can I come in?

1486
03:34:31,083 --> 03:34:33,915
No. Just wait outside,
I'll call you.

1487
03:34:34,125 --> 03:34:36,499
Okay, I'll be right here.

1488
03:34:39,291 --> 03:34:43,082
- What does Bailey want from me?
- You came to ask me that?

1489
03:34:43,291 --> 03:34:46,249
- Why'd he send me an invitation?
- I don't know.

1490
03:34:46,458 --> 03:34:50,790
Why should I know about your
invitations? I don't know anything.

1491
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:54,999
What do you want? Why did you come
here? I know nothing.

1492
03:34:55,166 --> 03:34:57,832
Now you're a lousy actress.

1493
03:35:00,666 --> 03:35:03,499
Who is Secretary Bailey?

1494
03:35:12,250 --> 03:35:15,874
Secretary Bailey
is a rich businessman.

1495
03:35:21,583 --> 03:35:26,165
He came to the United States as an
immigrant and made a lot of money...

1496
03:35:26,375 --> 03:35:30,332
...in San Francisco and L.A.,
where he's lived for 30 years.

1497
03:35:30,500 --> 03:35:34,499
NOODLES: I know all that. It's all
in the papers. What else is there?

1498
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:43,999
He married a very wealthy woman.

1499
03:35:45,291 --> 03:35:47,624
They had a child.

1500
03:35:48,000 --> 03:35:51,040
She died when the child was born.

1501
03:35:51,625 --> 03:35:56,165
A few years ago, he went
into politics. Moved here.

1502
03:35:56,333 --> 03:36:00,957
That's history. I'm not talking
about that. I'm talking about now.

1503
03:36:01,541 --> 03:36:04,165
Right now he's in trouble.

1504
03:36:05,833 --> 03:36:09,290
Just tell me you've been living
with him all these years,

1505
03:36:09,375 --> 03:36:11,332
and you're his lover.

1506
03:36:20,166 --> 03:36:23,165
DEBORAH:
Age can wither me, Noodles.

1507
03:36:26,875 --> 03:36:29,499
We're both getting old.

1508
03:36:34,833 --> 03:36:38,124
All that we have left now
are our memories.

1509
03:36:41,041 --> 03:36:46,999
If you go to that party on Saturday
night, you won't have those anymore.

1510
03:36:48,375 --> 03:36:50,832
Tear up that invitation.

1511
03:36:53,208 --> 03:36:55,832
There's an exit back this way.

1512
03:36:56,750 --> 03:36:59,665
Noodles, go through it.

1513
03:37:02,333 --> 03:37:04,207
Keep walking.

1514
03:37:04,416 --> 03:37:06,665
Don't turn around.

1515
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:10,124
Please, Noodles.

1516
03:37:10,333 --> 03:37:13,332
I'm begging you. Please.

1517
03:37:19,791 --> 03:37:23,332
Are you afraid that I'll turn
into a pillar of salt?

1518
03:37:26,833 --> 03:37:30,582
If you go out that door, yes.

1519
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:31,707
DEBORAH:
This is Secretary Bailey's son.

1520
03:38:31,916 --> 03:38:35,415
His name's David, just like yours.

1521
03:41:07,708 --> 03:41:12,665
I must admit this party was
a wonderful idea, Mr. Secretary.

1522
03:41:13,375 --> 03:41:16,999
It's a bit like saying, "I'm going
up before the Commettee in 5 days,

1523
03:41:17,083 --> 03:41:19,165
like, my conscience is clear.

1524
03:41:19,708 --> 03:41:23,124
The most important people
in New York are my guests.

1525
03:41:23,833 --> 03:41:27,040
It's going to be a night
to remember."

1526
03:41:27,125 --> 03:41:29,290
Especially if the house blows up.

1527
03:41:30,166 --> 03:41:32,290
Where are you putting the next bomb?

1528
03:41:33,791 --> 03:41:35,540
In the freezer?

1529
03:41:36,541 --> 03:41:38,457
Or in the toilet?

1530
03:41:46,541 --> 03:41:49,499
You can't even think straight
anymore.

1531
03:41:50,625 --> 03:41:52,915
I'll tell you something.

1532
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:57,749
A waiting list of people would like
to send flowers to your funeral.

1533
03:41:59,916 --> 03:42:03,624
- I can point out ten right now,
if you like me to. - Yes.

1534
03:42:03,708 --> 03:42:06,749
But none of them wants to read my
obituary in front of the Committee

1535
03:42:06,833 --> 03:42:08,832
as much as you do.

1536
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:10,790
You and your union.

1537
03:42:14,250 --> 03:42:17,082
We just want to resolve
this situation clean.

1538
03:42:17,166 --> 03:42:20,790
I've heard that same song from you
for 35 fucking years!

1539
03:42:20,875 --> 03:42:23,249
Who do you think you are talking to?

1540
03:42:24,916 --> 03:42:28,624
I helped you to make a fortune,
you and the rest of those parasites!

1541
03:42:28,708 --> 03:42:33,290
It was a reasonable arrangement
between labour and management.

1542
03:42:34,708 --> 03:42:38,040
2% for them and 40% for you.

1543
03:42:38,541 --> 03:42:41,540
You defend them and you screw them.
Come on!

1544
03:42:42,291 --> 03:42:44,499
It's been the story of your life.

1545
03:42:45,500 --> 03:42:48,749
- Do you think anybody believe you
anymore? - Some.

1546
03:42:49,791 --> 03:42:52,374
But no one believes in you anymore,

1547
03:42:52,458 --> 03:42:55,499
because you have made mistakes
and I haven't.

1548
03:42:56,875 --> 03:42:59,540
But that's beside the point.

1549
03:43:01,375 --> 03:43:04,249
The important thing right now
is that

1550
03:43:04,333 --> 03:43:07,624
you and I straighten out
these transfers of authority.

1551
03:43:10,041 --> 03:43:12,374
Now it's all as we have agreed.

1552
03:43:15,666 --> 03:43:18,207
Have had our lawyers drawn it up.

1553
03:43:20,250 --> 03:43:22,540
All you have to do is sign.

1554
03:43:30,833 --> 03:43:32,749
My last will?

1555
03:43:34,375 --> 03:43:37,124
You are not in a position
to exercise your will.

1556
03:43:39,750 --> 03:43:42,040
I give up everything.

1557
03:43:43,833 --> 03:43:46,665
12% would be set aside for your boy.

1558
03:43:46,750 --> 03:43:51,082
In that way he can be assured
of living to a ripe old age.

1559
03:43:52,166 --> 03:43:54,957
Or not, if I don't sign?

1560
03:45:05,541 --> 03:45:08,374
Why don't you take care of this
by yourself?

1561
03:45:09,791 --> 03:45:13,249
I'd be very happy for you tonight,
if during all the noise of the party

1562
03:45:13,333 --> 03:45:16,332
- I heard a shot.
- Maybe you will.

(DOOR OPENS)

1564
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:30,832
BUTLER: Please go in.

1565
03:46:44,875 --> 03:46:47,207
MAX: What are you waiting for?

1566
03:46:50,875 --> 03:46:53,540
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

1567
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:22,082
Sit down, Noodles.

1568
03:47:26,333 --> 03:47:28,124
Make yourself comfortable.

1569
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:49,207
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

1570
03:47:49,375 --> 03:47:51,374
NOODLES: Well, I was curious.

1571
03:47:54,333 --> 03:47:57,457
So many important people
in one place.

1572
03:47:57,666 --> 03:48:01,540
MAX: Yes. Well, the rats usually
desert a sinking ship.

1573
03:48:02,000 --> 03:48:05,915
But in my case, they appear to be
flocking onboard.

1574
03:48:17,541 --> 03:48:21,374
Yeah, well, I read about
your troubles in the newspapers.

1575
03:48:22,750 --> 03:48:24,624
But a man in your position,

1576
03:48:24,708 --> 03:48:27,415
with all your power
and all your privileges...

1577
03:48:27,625 --> 03:48:31,874
...has to assume a certain amount
of responsibility...

1578
03:48:32,541 --> 03:48:34,999
...a certain amount of risk.

1579
03:48:42,458 --> 03:48:45,207
Why'd you ask me
to come here, Mr. Bailey?

1580
03:48:48,541 --> 03:48:53,040
That invitation doesn't mean
a goddamn thing, and you know it.

1581
03:48:53,416 --> 03:48:56,957
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

1582
03:48:58,625 --> 03:49:01,332
The money and the contract.

1583
03:49:04,166 --> 03:49:07,374
It didn't say who the contract
was on, though.

1584
03:49:08,708 --> 03:49:11,124
Haven't you figured that out yet?

1585
03:49:12,833 --> 03:49:14,374
You, Mr. Bailey?

1586
03:49:28,166 --> 03:49:31,874
I haven't had a gun in my hand
for many, many years.

1587
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:39,040
My eyes aren't too good, even
with my glasses. My hands shake.

1588
03:49:41,916 --> 03:49:45,915
- And I wouldn't want to miss.
- Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

1589
03:49:47,458 --> 03:49:50,207
I'm already a dead man.

1590
03:49:51,125 --> 03:49:55,540
At least give me the chance to
settle the debt that I owe to you.

1591
03:49:56,208 --> 03:49:59,707
I'll never make it before
the investigating committee.

1592
03:49:59,875 --> 03:50:03,832
They're scared I'll implicate
the whole bunch of 'em.

1593
03:50:04,208 --> 03:50:06,415
They gotta get rid of me.

1594
03:50:09,083 --> 03:50:12,040
Today is as good a day as any.

1595
03:50:14,375 --> 03:50:16,582
You do it, Noodles.

1596
03:50:17,541 --> 03:50:20,915
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

1597
03:50:27,791 --> 03:50:30,374
You see, I found out where you were.

1598
03:50:30,541 --> 03:50:33,624
I brought you back here for this.

1599
03:50:34,958 --> 03:50:38,165
To even the score
between you and me.

1600
03:50:40,541 --> 03:50:42,999
You can get out through there.

1601
03:50:50,250 --> 03:50:54,790
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.

1602
03:51:01,541 --> 03:51:05,915
I don't know what you're talking
about. You don't owe me a thing.

1603
03:51:13,875 --> 03:51:18,457
Your eyes were too full of tears
to see it wasn't me burned up

1604
03:51:18,541 --> 03:51:19,999
on that street.

1605
03:51:20,833 --> 03:51:22,707
It was somebody else.

1606
03:51:24,291 --> 03:51:29,207
You were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too.

1607
03:51:29,833 --> 03:51:33,040
That was a syndicate operation,
Noodles.

1608
03:51:43,333 --> 03:51:45,332
You're crazy.

1609
03:51:47,791 --> 03:51:52,040
You said that to me once before,
a long time ago.

1610
03:51:52,333 --> 03:51:55,790
My mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

1611
03:51:56,541 --> 03:52:00,040
I took away your whole life
from you.

1612
03:52:00,250 --> 03:52:03,082
I've been living in your place.

1613
03:52:04,333 --> 03:52:06,915
I took everything.

1614
03:52:08,333 --> 03:52:10,499
I took your money.

1615
03:52:11,208 --> 03:52:13,332
I took your girl.

1616
03:52:14,041 --> 03:52:18,832
All I left for you was 35 years
of grief over having killed me.

1617
03:52:20,666 --> 03:52:22,457
Now, why don't you shoot?

1618
03:53:57,000 --> 03:53:59,915
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.

1619
03:54:00,125 --> 03:54:04,874
Sometimes to defend myself.
Sometimes for money.

1620
03:54:05,166 --> 03:54:07,707
And many people used to come to us.

1621
03:54:07,916 --> 03:54:10,832
Business partners, rivals...

1622
03:54:11,208 --> 03:54:13,374
...lovers.

1623
03:54:13,750 --> 03:54:17,874
Some of the jobs we took,
and some we didn't.

1624
03:54:31,250 --> 03:54:34,207
Yours is one we would never touch.

1625
03:54:35,083 --> 03:54:38,040
Is this your way of getting revenge?

1626
03:54:42,000 --> 03:54:43,582
No.

1627
03:54:46,916 --> 03:54:50,040
It's just the way I see things.

1628
03:55:52,666 --> 03:55:55,457
It's 10:25...

1629
03:55:56,750 --> 03:55:59,915
...and I've got nothing left
to lose.

1630
03:56:02,041 --> 03:56:05,999
When you've been betrayed
by a friend, you hit back.

1631
03:56:11,041 --> 03:56:12,874
Do it.

1632
03:56:35,000 --> 03:56:37,624
You see, Mr. Secretary...

1633
03:56:39,625 --> 03:56:41,707
...I have a story also.

1634
03:56:42,666 --> 03:56:45,207
A little simpler than yours.

1635
03:56:46,333 --> 03:56:51,040
Many years ago I had a friend,
a dear friend.

1636
03:56:52,666 --> 03:56:55,915
I turned him in to save his life...

1637
03:56:56,125 --> 03:56:58,415
...but he was killed.

1638
03:56:59,708 --> 03:57:02,540
But he wanted it that way.

1639
03:57:03,583 --> 03:57:05,790
It was a great friendship.

1640
03:57:08,875 --> 03:57:12,915
It went bad for him,
and it went bad for me too.

1641
03:57:17,875 --> 03:57:20,040
Good night, Mr. Bailey.

1642
03:57:29,208 --> 03:57:32,915
I hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing.

1643
03:57:34,833 --> 03:57:38,874
It'd be a shame to see
a lifetime of work go to waste.
