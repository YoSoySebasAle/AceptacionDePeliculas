Have you guys noticed that his
legs can stay up like this?

part of his condition.

A word.

326

to consult another department

with me first.

and I had a concern.

00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:23,890
I mean,
how do you explain Xavier's leg

staying up on its own?

331
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,849
- Probably just spasticity,

332
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,242
which is common
in a vegetative state.

333

of muscle stiffness

presentation.

for a pressure ulcer,

so that is what
we're treating him for.

I had been reviewing
Xavier's medical records.

And I think that
there's a very good chance

357
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:27,736
that he was misdiagnosed there.

son is in a vegetative state.

Do you know how his joints,

they stay in the same position
after they've been moved?

- Mm-hmm.

363
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,140
- That's something
called waxy flexibility.

364
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:43,273
It is indicative
of only one condition.

365
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,579
Catatonia.

366
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:45,928
- Catatonia?

367
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:48,104
- Yeah, it's a--it's a
neuropsychiatric disorder

368
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:51,064
that can lead to paralysis,
but it's treatable.

369
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,240
- And this was caused
by the head injury?

370
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,677
- I'm suggesting that
this has nothing to do

371
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,636
with your son hitting his head.

- What's going on?

373
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,510
- He's saying our son
might be catatonic.

374
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,251
- Xavier was fully evaluated

375
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:07,080
before being diagnosed
as being in a PVS.

376
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:09,256
- Catatonia's
a pretty rare condition,

377
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,954
so without a psychiatrist
weighing in,

378
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,651
it's possible that
the doctors at Norris

379
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:14,870
weren't even looking for it.

380

fell off his bike.

381
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,220
He hit his head.

382
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:18,961
- Yeah, but the scans
were inconclusive,

383
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,833
meaning that there was
no clear brain injury.

421
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:55,188
- Catatonia only freezes
the voluntary muscle groups,

So if I'm right,

We've been living together
for the past three years.

483
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:54,236
- How about school?

484
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,196
- Xavier's always been
a good student.

485
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,546
Loved reading.

486
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:02,026
- Friends?
- Lots.

487
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,028
I used to take them all
to White Sox games.

488
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,553
- He did watch this movie
"Poltergeist"...

489
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,511
[phone vibrates]
Which gave him nightmares.

490
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,339
But that was a few years ago.

491
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:14,735
- Unlikely that one movie's
gonna induce catatonia.

492
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,084
- I have to take this.

493
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,999
I'm working a task force
with the DEA.

494
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,957
Sorry.

495
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,308
Alvin here.
Yeah.

496
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,399
- How did Xavier feel about,
uh, about Alvin's work?

497
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,748
- Alvin's always
been good about

498
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,793
not bringing it home
with him.

499
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,448
He took all the precautions.
Keeps his gun in a safe.

500
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:33,710
- But still,
did he ever talk to you

501
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,712
about how he felt about

502
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,714
the fact that Alvin
was a police officer?

503
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,282
- Xavier's a 10-year-old boy.

504
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,632
Alvin being a cop is like

505
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,982
having a superhero
sleeping down the hall.

506
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,419
- Mm.

507
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:49,509
- Why would you ask that?

508
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:52,381
- Just trying
to get some background.

509
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:57,038
- Alvin's the best father
figure Xavier could ever have.

510
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,127
You don't have to worry
about that.

511
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,874
- Hey, why did you stop?

512
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,354
It seemed like you were
on to something.

513
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:11,618
- I think we're getting
to a sensitive area here.

514
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:13,707
So I just like to,
you know, take a pause

515
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,491
before we push forward,

516
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:18,015
but Alvin's work life

517
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,975
is absolutely something
we want to look into.

518
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,985
- Nina's stable for now.

519
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,813
- It doesn't make sense.
The antihistamine was working.

520
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,250
- So she must have been
re-exposed to the allergen.

521
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,339
- I guess we can move her
to a clean room.

522
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,515
- But she had the rash before
she even came to the hospital.

523
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,605
- Yeah, I just wish we could've
gotten that scratch test.

524
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:45,652
- I tried,
but they were indisposed.

525
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,349
Before I could get
back in there, she crashed.

526
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,133
- Indisposed?

527
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:51,440
What do you mean, "indisposed?"

528
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,529
Were they having sex?

Harlan,
I'm not here to judge you,

but I gather you and Nina
had sex in the hospital.

534

you had to walk in on that.

We need to know.
