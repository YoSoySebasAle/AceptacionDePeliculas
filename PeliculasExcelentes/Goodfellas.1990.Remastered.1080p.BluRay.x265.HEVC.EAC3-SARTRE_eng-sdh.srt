You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

2096
02:13:54,652 --> 02:13:58,656
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

2097
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:03,369
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

2098
02:14:05,287 --> 02:14:06,622
Know what I'm saying?

2099
02:14:11,627 --> 02:14:14,797
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

2100
02:14:15,381 --> 02:14:16,966
Mm-mm.

2101
02:14:17,883 --> 02:14:19,134
No, not at all.

2102
02:14:20,761 --> 02:14:22,346
That way they got nothing.

2103
02:14:31,188 --> 02:14:33,941
HENRY: <i>Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.</i>

2104
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:38,070
<i>But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.</i>

2105
02:14:45,619 --> 02:14:48,956
<i>That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.</i>

2106
02:15:03,345 --> 02:15:06,640
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

2107
02:15:06,807 --> 02:15:08,642
I don't want to go any place cold.

2108
02:15:09,643 --> 02:15:11,812
You don't have a choice in that matter.

2109
02:15:12,187 --> 02:15:14,732
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

2110
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:18,193
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to--

2111
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,070
He's bronchial, that's why.

2112
02:15:20,237 --> 02:15:22,948
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

2113
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:25,200
I'd like to go some place not cold.

2114
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,079
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

2115
02:15:30,039 --> 02:15:31,081
What about them?

2116
02:15:31,248 --> 02:15:33,834
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

2117
02:15:35,085 --> 02:15:37,296
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?

2118
02:15:38,172 --> 02:15:39,214
No.

2119
02:15:40,341 --> 02:15:43,677
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

2120
02:15:44,053 --> 02:15:48,057
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

2121
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:51,226
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

2122
02:15:51,727 --> 02:15:53,896
if there's extraordinary circumstances--

2123
02:15:54,063 --> 02:15:56,899
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2124
02:15:58,025 --> 02:15:59,777
I can't leave my parents.

2125
02:16:01,028 --> 02:16:03,238
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

2126
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:07,493
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

2127
02:16:09,828 --> 02:16:11,497
I can't do it without you.

2128
02:16:11,914 --> 02:16:16,001
So, you do whatever, but... that's it.

2129
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:20,005
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

2130
02:16:20,422 --> 02:16:22,883
Frankly, I don't care whether you go or not.

2131
02:16:23,217 --> 02:16:26,595
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

2132
02:16:26,762 --> 02:16:28,347
They want Henry, not me.

2133
02:16:28,514 --> 02:16:31,600
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

2134
02:16:32,518 --> 02:16:35,771
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2135
02:16:35,938 --> 02:16:38,524
If he goes into the program, you're in danger--

2136
02:16:38,691 --> 02:16:41,068
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

2137
02:16:41,235 --> 02:16:42,736
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2138
02:16:42,903 --> 02:16:47,282
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2139
02:16:47,449 --> 02:16:50,786
<i>Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.</i>

2140
02:16:55,999 --> 02:16:58,085
It doesn't matter. Whether he goes to jail...

2141
02:16:58,252 --> 02:17:01,547
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2142
02:17:02,297 --> 02:17:04,007
He knows it and you know it.

2143
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:07,344
What about the kids and school?

2144
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:09,805
KAREN: <i>Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?</i>

2145
02:17:10,139 --> 02:17:12,558
TUDDY: Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2146
02:17:12,725 --> 02:17:15,185
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2147
02:17:15,352 --> 02:17:18,439
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2148
02:17:19,273 --> 02:17:22,693
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2149
02:17:26,947 --> 02:17:29,575
<i>This morning you told the jury
about your background.</i>

2150
02:17:29,742 --> 02:17:31,577
HENRY: <i>It was easy for us to disappear.</i>

2151
02:17:32,119 --> 02:17:34,246
<i>My house was in my mother-in-law's name.</i>

2152
02:17:34,413 --> 02:17:36,373
<i>My cars were registered to my wife.</i>

2153
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:40,002
<i>My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.</i>

2154
02:17:40,169 --> 02:17:42,504
<i>I never voted or paid taxes.</i>

2155
02:17:43,088 --> 02:17:47,551
<i>My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know I was alive.</i>

2156
02:17:47,718 --> 02:17:49,636
ATTORNEY: Do you see him here in this courtroom?

2157
02:17:49,803 --> 02:17:50,846
Yes.

2158
02:17:51,013 --> 02:17:53,098
ATTORNEY:
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2159
02:17:55,684 --> 02:18:00,314
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2160
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:04,526
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?

2161
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:06,862
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

2162
02:18:07,446 --> 02:18:09,364
ATTORNEY: Can you point him out for the jury?

2163
02:18:11,325 --> 02:18:15,412
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2164
02:18:16,747 --> 02:18:18,457
Your Honor, I have a document...

2165
02:18:18,624 --> 02:18:21,043
HENRY: <i>The hardest thing was leaving the life.</i>

2166
02:18:21,877 --> 02:18:23,337
<i>I still love the life.</i>

2167
02:18:23,712 --> 02:18:25,631
<i>We were treated like movie stars with muscle.</i>

2168
02:18:25,798 --> 02:18:28,050
<i>We had it all, just for the asking.</i>

2169
02:18:28,217 --> 02:18:31,553
<i>Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along.</i>

2170
02:18:31,887 --> 02:18:35,057
<i>I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.</i>

2171
02:18:35,224 --> 02:18:37,476
<i>I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.</i>

2172
02:18:37,643 --> 02:18:41,438
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2173
02:18:41,605 --> 02:18:43,649
ATTORNEY: Objection! 
JUDGE: Objection sustained.

2174
02:18:43,816 --> 02:18:47,402
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it.

2175
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:49,446
ATTORNEY: Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

2176
02:18:49,613 --> 02:18:51,740
HENRY: <i>Anything I wanted was a phone call away.</i>

2177
02:18:51,907 --> 02:18:55,327
<i>Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.</i>

2178
02:18:55,494 --> 02:18:57,996
<i>I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...</i>

2179
02:18:58,163 --> 02:19:02,209
<i>then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.</i>

2180
02:19:02,376 --> 02:19:03,710
It didn't matter.

2181
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:09,132
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2182
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:10,926
We ran everything.

2183
02:19:11,468 --> 02:19:15,764
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid offjudges.

2184
02:19:16,014 --> 02:19:19,434
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2185
02:19:21,562 --> 02:19:23,063
And now it's all over.

2186
02:19:23,981 --> 02:19:25,440
<i>That's the hardest part.</i>

2187
02:19:26,441 --> 02:19:28,068
<i>Today everything is different.</i>

2188
02:19:28,235 --> 02:19:32,406
<i>There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone</i> else.

2189
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:34,575
<i>Can't even get decent food.</i>

2190
02:19:35,325 --> 02:19:38,453
<i>After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...</i>

2191
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,455
<i>and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</i>

2192
02:19:41,290 --> 02:19:42,791
<i>I'm an average nobody.</i>

2193
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:46,962
<i>I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.</i>

2194
02:25:11,494 --> 02:25:13,496
