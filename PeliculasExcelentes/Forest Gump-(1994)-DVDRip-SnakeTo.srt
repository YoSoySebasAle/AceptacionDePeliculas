(BUS APPROACHING)

2
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:00,689
Hello.

3
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:04,321
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

4
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,912
Do you want a chocolate?

5
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:17,918
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

6
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:24,304
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

7
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:29,176
You never know what you're gonna get.

8
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,939
Those must be comfortable shoes.

9
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:44,987
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

10
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:49,662
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,868
My feet hurt.

12
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,747
Mama always said there's an awful lot

13
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:58,045
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

14
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:02,133
where they're going,
where they've been.

15
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:11,430
I've worn lots of shoes.

16
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:19,355
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

17
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,898
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

18
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,318
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

19
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:31,576
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

20
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,338
Let's take a little walk around.

21
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,927
How do those feel?

22
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:55,056
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

23
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:57,639
as strong as I've ever seen,

24
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:01,101
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

25
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:05,488
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

26
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:06,690
Forrest!

27
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,470
<i>FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,</i>

28
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:12,328
<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,</i>

29
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:14,827
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

30
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,124
<i>She said we was related to him
in some way.</i>

31
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,576
<i>And what he did was,</i>

32
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,914
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

33
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:26,342
<i>They'd all dress up in theirrobes
and their bed sheets</i>

34
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:30,763
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

35
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,718
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

36
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:37,849
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

37
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,350
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

38
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,182
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

39
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:44,815
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

40
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,693
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

41
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:49,158
(CLANG)

42
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,865
Okay... Get it, get it...

43
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,917
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

44
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,328
All right...

45
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:04,585
What are you all staring at?

46
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:09,135
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

47
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,390
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

48
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:17,059
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

49
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:19,262
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

50
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:21,125
<i>FORREST: Mama always had a way of
explaining things</i>

51
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,141
<i>so I could understand them.</i>

52
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:28,104
<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>

53
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:31,236
<i>about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

54
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:34,069
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

55
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:38,577
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

56
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,579
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

57
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:42,581
<i>something like that.</i>

58
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:45,379
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

59
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:48,208
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

60
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:50,258
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

61
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:54,305
<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>

62
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:57,099
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

63
00:06:57,185 --> 00:06:59,928
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

64
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:05,016
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

65
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,896
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

66
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,155
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

67
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:19,122
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

68
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,415
Now, his IQ is 75.

69
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,328
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

70
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,965
<i>FORREST: She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

71
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:34,966
<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>

72
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:37,298
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

73
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,677
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

74
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:44,014
Now, this is normal.

75
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:47,813
Forrest is right here.

76
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:54,194
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

77
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:57,569
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

78
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:59,779
Now, he'll be just fine.

79
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:02,665
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

80
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,119
He might be a bit on the slow side,

81
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,996
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

82
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,628
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

83
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:15,507
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

84
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:18,761
We're talking about
five little points here.

85
00:08:20,477 --> 00:08:23,094
There must be something can be done.

86
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:27,147
We're a progressive school system.

87
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:30,897
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

88
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,239
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

89
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:40,361
He's on vacation.

90
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:44,116
(GASPING AND PANTING)

91
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:01,636
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

92
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,606
You don't say much, do you?

93
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:16,152

94
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,078

95

"oh, what happened.

97
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:31,746
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

98
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,882
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

99
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:40,220
Vacation's when you go somewhere

100
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,934
and you don't ever come back.

101
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:53,063
<i>FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.</i>

102
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,898
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

103
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,574
<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>

104
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,741
MRS. GUMP: Supper.

105
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:05,242
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

106
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:07,870
<i>FORREST: Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us</i>

107
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,622
<i>that every room
was filled with travelers.</i>

108
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:14,331
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

109
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:17,383
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

110
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:20,883
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...

111
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:23,510
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

112
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,219
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

(SINGING <i>HOUND DOG)</i>

114
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:45,195
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

ELVIS PRESLEY:
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

116
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:49,540
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

117
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:52,585
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

118
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,630
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

119
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:59,883
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

120
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,835

<i>It sounded good.</i>

124
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:14,270
<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>

<i>swinging my hips.</i>

126
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,318
<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

127
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:24,401
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

128

<i>had himself a heart attack,

135
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:57,103
Must be hard being a king.

You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

Are you coming along?

140
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:24,001
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

141
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,257

on my first outdoor picnic.

152

Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

162
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,563
These are going to make me...

163
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:08,398
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

164

Are you stupid or something?

165
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,987
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

166
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:19,287
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,873
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

504
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:02,292
I can't help it. I love you.

505
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:06,751
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

506
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,053
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

507
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:22,434
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

508
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:25,770
Yes, I do.

509
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:32,577
You think I could fly off this bridge?

510
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:41,414
What do you mean, Jenny?

511
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,791
Nothing.

512
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,800
I gotta get out of here.

513
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,181
Wait, Jenny...

514
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:59,729
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

515
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:01,100
Can I have a ride?

516
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:02,727
- MAN: Where you going?
- I don't care.

517
00:39:02,817 --> 00:39:04,183
Get in the truck.

518
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:06,109
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

519
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:10,948
They sending me to Vietnam.

520
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:16,116
It's this whole other country.

521
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,617
Just hang on a minute.

522
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:25,083
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

523
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:28,507
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

524
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:30,217
Just run away.

525
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:32,803
Okay.

526
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:39,017
Jenny.

527
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:43,184
I'll write you all the time.

528
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:55,318
<i>FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone.</i>

529
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:14,762
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

530
00:40:58,057 --> 00:41:02,017
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

531
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:04,971
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

532
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:10,105
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

533
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:23,330
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

534
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:26,580
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

535
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:30,208
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

536
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:31,505
we can get American shrimpers

537
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:33,332
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

538
00:41:33,426 --> 00:41:34,962
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

539
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:38,258
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

540
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:40,844
You must be my FNGs.

541
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,175
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

542
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:44,885
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

543
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:47,096
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

544
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,024
who would love to grease an officer.

545
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:53,602
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

546
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:56,902
What's wrong with your lip?

547
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,358
I was born with big gums, sir.

548
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:04,163
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

549
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,699
Where you boys from in the world?

550
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:09,160
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

551
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:11,370
You twins?

552
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:15,879
No, we are not relations, sir.

553
00:42:18,137 --> 00:42:21,050
Look, it's pretty basic here.

554
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:24,307
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

555
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:27,057
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

556
00:42:27,146 --> 00:42:29,058
There is one item of GI gear

557
00:42:29,148 --> 00:42:33,313
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

558
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:36,817
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

559
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:38,192
Try and keep your feet dry.

560
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:39,802
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

561
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:42,284
to change your socks whenever we stop.

562
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,329
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

563
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:47,702
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

564
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,311
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

565
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:51,247
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

566
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:53,399
DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

567
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:55,961
<i>FORREST: Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.</i>

568
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,337
<i>I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

569
00:42:59,095 --> 00:43:02,554
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

570
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:05,849
<i>Somebody in his family
had fought and died</i>

571
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:11,097
<i>in every single American war.</i>

572
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:14,086
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

573
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,226
Get on it!

574
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:18,695
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

575
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:25,244
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

576
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:27,533
Little Rock's a fine town.

577
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:31,791
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

578
00:43:31,878 --> 00:43:34,336
draw what you need for the field.

579
00:43:34,422 --> 00:43:38,382
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

580
00:43:38,468 --> 00:43:41,336
Two standing orders in this platoon:

581
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:44,092
one, take good care of your feet,

582
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:49,264
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

583
00:43:55,735 --> 00:43:57,818
I sure hope I don't let him down.

584
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:11,907
<i>FORREST: I got to see
a lot of the countryside.</i>

585
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:14,334
<i>We would take these real long walks.</i>

586
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:26,923
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

587
00:44:34,774 --> 00:44:37,016
DAN: Hold it up!
SOLDIER: Hold up, boys!

588
00:44:39,862 --> 00:44:42,195
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

589
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:46,571
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

590
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:51,747
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

591
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,825
Get down! Shut up!

592
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:56,251
<i>(WHISPERING)...so we did.</i>

593
00:45:13,813 --> 00:45:15,975
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

594
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:19,900
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

595
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:22,694
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

596
00:45:24,407 --> 00:45:27,195
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

597
00:45:27,326 --> 00:45:29,693
(WHISPERING) Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

598
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:31,991
Man, what the hell's going on?

599
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:36,416
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

600
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:38,038
DAN: Nothing.

601
00:45:42,175 --> 00:45:44,667
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

602
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:48,471
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

603
00:45:48,556 --> 00:45:50,343
Come on, move out.

604
00:45:52,393 --> 00:45:54,806
Step it up. Look alive out there.

605
00:45:54,896 --> 00:45:59,231
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

606
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:00,724
DAN: Fire in the hole!

607
00:46:04,197 --> 00:46:06,530
Gump, check out that hole.

608
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:09,609
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

609
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:12,866
- Mount them up.
- SOLDIER: Spread out! Cover his back.

610
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:23,540
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

611
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,418
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

612
00:46:27,553 --> 00:46:30,091
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

613
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:33,470
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

614
00:46:33,935 --> 00:46:36,643
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

615
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:40,769
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

616
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:44,935
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

617
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:48,446
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

618
00:46:48,574 --> 00:46:51,863
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

619
00:46:51,953 --> 00:46:55,788
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

620
00:46:56,749 --> 00:47:00,208
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

621
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:02,786
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

622
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:04,788
like brothers and stuff.

623
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:10,423
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

624
00:47:10,513 --> 00:47:13,506
I got a very important question
to ask you.

625
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:19,102
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

626
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:21,889
Okay.

627
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:25,442
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

628
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:28,316
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

629
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:31,736
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

630
00:47:31,826 --> 00:47:34,113
We ain't got to pay no rent.

631
00:47:34,203 --> 00:47:36,286
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

632
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:40,616
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

633
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:44,294
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

634
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,627
That's a fine idea.

635
00:47:48,718 --> 00:47:50,835
<i>FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

636
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,724
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

637
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:01,728
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

638
00:48:01,814 --> 00:48:06,809
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

639
00:48:06,903 --> 00:48:09,646
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

640
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,949
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

641
00:48:14,035 --> 00:48:16,527
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

642
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:20,906
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

643
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:27,375
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

644
00:48:42,229 --> 00:48:45,973
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

645
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:49,026
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

646
00:48:49,946 --> 00:48:53,360
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

647
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,201
DAN: Ambush!

648
00:48:58,704 --> 00:49:00,070
Take cover!

649
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:01,613
(GUNS FIRING)

650
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:04,870
Get down!

651
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:06,418
Get the sixty!

652
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,673
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

653
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:13,876
Forrest, you okay?

654
00:49:17,098 --> 00:49:19,715
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

655
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:22,680
Medic, we got a man down!

656
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,729
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

657
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,774
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

658
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:33,395
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

659
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:35,860
Misfire! Misfire!

660
00:49:38,244 --> 00:49:40,236
DAN: God damn it! Mac!

661
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:44,619
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

662
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:46,745
Jesus!

663
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:49,085
My unit is down hard and hurting!

664
00:49:49,213 --> 00:49:52,752
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

665
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:55,508
Pull back! Pull back!

666
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:57,711
Run! Run, Forrest!

667
00:49:57,805 --> 00:50:00,138
- Pull back!
- BUBBA: Forrest, Forrest!

668
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:02,849
Run, man! Run!

669
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:04,722
DAN: Pull back! Run!

670
00:50:06,564 --> 00:50:08,772
Run, God damn it, run!

671
00:50:29,962 --> 00:50:34,582
SOLDIER: Medic! Can I get a medic?

672
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:38,301
<i>FORREST: I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.</i>

673
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:45,892
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

674
00:50:45,978 --> 00:50:47,935
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

675
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:50,017
Bubba!

676
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:55,940
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

677
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:01,695
SOLDIER 1: Any friendlies out there?

678
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:04,823
SOLDIER 2: Yeah, I've got
three over here.

679
00:51:05,456 --> 00:51:07,448
Where the hell are you?

680
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:09,374
Bubba?

681
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:13,169
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

682
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:16,085
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

683
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:17,382
Tex!

684
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:20,470
Okay.

685
00:51:20,554 --> 00:51:24,514
<i>I couldn't just let him lay there
all alone, scared the way he was,</i>

686
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:28,511
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

687
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:46,074
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

688
00:51:46,205 --> 00:51:49,698
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

689
00:51:57,383 --> 00:51:59,249
Can't hear... Can't hear...

690
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:02,906
SOLDIER: No sweat, man. Just lay back.

691
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,422
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

692
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:10,472
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

693
00:52:10,563 --> 00:52:11,804
<i>MAN ON RADIO:...over.</i>

694
00:52:11,897 --> 00:52:15,186
DAN: Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

695
00:52:15,276 --> 00:52:17,108
We got Charlie all over this area.

696
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:19,523
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

697
00:52:19,613 --> 00:52:22,981
<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

698
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:24,282
I know he's dead!

699
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,244
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

700
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:28,765
<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

701
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:31,497
<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

702
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,918
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

703
00:52:35,045 --> 00:52:37,332
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

704
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:40,040
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

705
00:52:40,134 --> 00:52:43,298
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

706
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:45,386
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

707
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:48,886
<i>FORREST: Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

708
00:52:49,768 --> 00:52:51,430
Something bit me!

709
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,436
You chink son of a bitch!

710
00:53:02,948 --> 00:53:04,940
I can't leave the platoon.

711
00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:09,991
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

712
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:12,239
Did you hear what I said?

713
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,915
God damn it, put me down!

714
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:17,665
Get your ass out of here!

715
00:53:20,966 --> 00:53:23,549
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

716
00:53:23,636 --> 00:53:25,071
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

717
00:53:25,095 --> 00:53:26,176
To get Bubba.

718
00:53:26,305 --> 00:53:30,140
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

719
00:53:30,267 --> 00:53:32,634
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

720
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,183
I gotta find Bubba!

721
00:53:51,163 --> 00:53:52,620
BUBBA: Forrest.

722
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:03,044
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

723
00:54:03,842 --> 00:54:05,504
I'm okay.

724
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:15,184
Oh, Bubba, no...

725
00:54:15,312 --> 00:54:17,520
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

726
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,273
(MEN CHATTERING)

727
00:54:25,698 --> 00:54:28,361
Come on. Come on. Come on.

728
00:54:33,372 --> 00:54:34,863
I'm okay, Forrest.

729
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:39,042
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

730
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:19,199
DAN: Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

731
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:24,747
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

732
00:55:24,882 --> 00:55:27,169
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

733
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:28,750
Hey, Bubba.

734
00:55:29,887 --> 00:55:31,253
Hey, Forrest.

735
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,808
Forrest, why'd this happen?

736
00:55:38,145 --> 00:55:39,932
You got shot.

737
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:45,813
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

738
00:55:46,612 --> 00:55:48,274
I wanna go home.

739
00:55:50,282 --> 00:55:52,319
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

740
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:57,825
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

741
00:55:57,956 --> 00:56:01,040
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

742
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:05,086
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

743
00:56:10,803 --> 00:56:13,090
That's all I have to say about that.

744
00:56:15,474 --> 00:56:17,636
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

745
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:22,641
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

746
00:56:25,025 --> 00:56:27,108
Oh, yes, sir.

747
00:56:27,194 --> 00:56:30,312
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

748
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:35,693
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

749
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:39,663
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

750
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:43,992
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

751
00:56:44,128 --> 00:56:45,835
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

752
00:56:45,963 --> 00:56:48,546
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

753
00:56:48,674 --> 00:56:49,960
<i>And guess what?</i>

754
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,168
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

755
00:56:55,389 --> 00:56:58,473
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

756
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:03,015
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

757
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:17,028
MALE NURSE:
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

758
00:57:25,544 --> 00:57:26,876
Harper!

759
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,548
Cooper, Larson,

760
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:36,093
Webster,

761
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:41,007
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

762
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:47,852
Kyle, Nichols,

763
00:57:50,068 --> 00:57:56,030
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

764
00:57:57,367 --> 00:57:58,733
Holiday...

765
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:07,743
<i>MAN ON TV:
Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

766
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:13,581
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

767
00:58:13,675 --> 00:58:15,320
<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

768
00:58:15,344 --> 00:58:18,587
<i>...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

769
00:58:18,722 --> 00:58:21,055
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

770
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:25,431
SOLDIER: Good catch, Gump.

771
00:58:27,397 --> 00:58:29,559
You know how to play this?

772
00:58:30,859 --> 00:58:32,942
Come on, let me show you. Here.

773
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:37,363
Now, the secret to this game is,

774
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:43,286
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

775
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,207
All right.

776
00:58:51,547 --> 00:58:55,211
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

777
00:58:55,551 --> 00:58:58,464
See? Any idiot can play.

778
00:58:58,971 --> 00:59:01,714
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

779
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:04,223
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

780
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:07,598
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

781
00:59:15,654 --> 00:59:20,319
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

782
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,282
<i>whatever that means.</i>

783
00:59:22,744 --> 00:59:25,987
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

784
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:35,372
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

785
00:59:43,181 --> 00:59:48,267
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

786
00:59:48,353 --> 00:59:51,391
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

787
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:54,186
I should have died out there
with my men,

788
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,278
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

789
00:59:58,363 --> 01:00:01,982
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

790
01:00:02,743 --> 01:00:03,824
Do you see that?

791
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:07,699
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

792
01:00:11,043 --> 01:00:12,659
Yes, sir, I do.

793
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,377
Did you hear what I said?

794
01:00:19,259 --> 01:00:21,000
You cheated me.

795
01:00:21,094 --> 01:00:22,255
I had a destiny.

796
01:00:22,346 --> 01:00:25,885
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

797
01:00:26,558 --> 01:00:30,598
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

798
01:00:40,238 --> 01:00:42,946
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

799
01:00:45,077 --> 01:00:48,445
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

800
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:52,745
I had a destiny.

801
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:59,081
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

802
01:01:05,263 --> 01:01:07,596
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

803
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:32,322
Look at me.

804
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:35,624
What am I gonna do now?

805
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:41,334
What am I gonna do now?

806
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:53,184
PFC Gump?

807
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,141
Yes, sir!

808
01:01:56,815 --> 01:01:58,306
As you were.

809
01:01:58,817 --> 01:02:02,652
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

810
01:02:03,697 --> 01:02:07,316
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

811
01:02:14,082 --> 01:02:17,826
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

812
01:02:18,754 --> 01:02:20,541
They sent him home.

813
01:02:26,553 --> 01:02:29,296
<i>FORREST:
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

814
01:02:30,348 --> 01:02:33,887
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

815
01:02:33,977 --> 01:02:37,345
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

816
01:02:37,439 --> 01:02:39,556
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor</i>

817
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:41,311
<i>to men
from each of the Armed Services.</i>

818
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:44,314
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

819
01:02:46,323 --> 01:02:50,112
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

820
01:02:50,202 --> 01:02:53,366
<i>- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.</i>

821
01:02:54,122 --> 01:02:56,409
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

822
01:03:07,844 --> 01:03:09,130
(CHUCKLING)

823
01:03:10,555 --> 01:03:12,012
<i>God damn, son.</i>

824
01:03:14,142 --> 01:03:17,977
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

825
01:03:18,063 --> 01:03:21,556
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

826
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,252
ISABEL: Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

827
01:03:23,276 --> 01:03:24,767
what do you want me to do with them?

828
01:03:24,861 --> 01:03:26,602
HILARY: What are you doing here
so late?

829
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:30,736
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

830
01:03:30,826 --> 01:03:33,990
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

831
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,696
<i>and some of them people were loud
and pushy.</i>

832
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,749
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

833
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:43,544
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

834
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,336
HILARY: Follow me, let's go!

835
01:03:50,136 --> 01:03:51,752
Come on. Let's go.

836
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:59,393
Stand here.

837
01:04:01,857 --> 01:04:05,021
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

838
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,435
Okay.

02:01:46,026 --> 02:01:48,143
I named him after his daddy.

1490
02:01:49,112 --> 02:01:51,570
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1491
02:01:52,866 --> 02:01:54,903
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1492
02:02:09,382 --> 02:02:10,589
Hey.

1493
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,628
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

1494
02:02:17,223 --> 02:02:21,342
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1495
02:02:21,895 --> 02:02:23,261
Okay?

1496
02:02:27,609 --> 02:02:29,475
Isn't he beautiful?

1497
02:02:30,487 --> 02:02:33,446
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1498
02:02:37,243 --> 02:02:38,324
But...

1499
02:02:41,998 --> 02:02:44,866
Is he smart, or...

1500
02:02:44,959 --> 02:02:48,953
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1501
02:02:58,306 --> 02:03:00,764
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1502
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:12,944
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1503
02:03:36,052 --> 02:03:37,839
Forrest,

1504
02:03:39,305 --> 02:03:40,841
I'm sick.

1505
02:03:43,518 --> 02:03:47,137
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1506
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:49,597
I have some kind of virus,

1507
02:03:49,691 --> 02:03:52,399
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1508
02:03:52,527 --> 02:03:55,520
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1509
02:03:59,909 --> 02:04:02,196
You could come home with me.

1510
02:04:03,872 --> 02:04:09,539
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1511
02:04:13,882 --> 02:04:16,670
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1512
02:04:19,053 --> 02:04:21,340
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1513
02:04:26,603 --> 02:04:27,844
Okay.

1514
02:04:28,897 --> 02:04:30,559
MINISTER: Please take your seats.

1515
02:04:34,402 --> 02:04:36,735
Forrest? It's time to start.

1516
02:04:56,132 --> 02:04:57,714
Hi.

1517
02:04:58,593 --> 02:05:00,084
Your tie.

1518
02:05:12,649 --> 02:05:14,265
Lieutenant Dan.

1519
02:05:29,624 --> 02:05:31,581
Lieutenant Dan.

1520
02:05:32,418 --> 02:05:34,080
Hello, Forrest.

1521
02:05:34,754 --> 02:05:37,417
You got new legs. New legs!

1522
02:05:38,633 --> 02:05:42,422
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1523
02:05:43,137 --> 02:05:47,131
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1524
02:05:50,979 --> 02:05:52,470
Magic legs.

1525
02:05:54,482 --> 02:05:58,852
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1526
02:06:01,656 --> 02:06:05,024
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1527
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:10,329
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1528
02:06:10,707 --> 02:06:13,700
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1529
02:06:23,845 --> 02:06:28,010
MINISTER: Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1530
02:06:29,892 --> 02:06:34,136
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1531
02:06:35,481 --> 02:06:38,849
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1532
02:07:09,724 --> 02:07:11,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

1533
02:07:25,281 --> 02:07:27,068
Hey, Forrest.

1534
02:07:32,413 --> 02:07:34,200
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1535
02:07:35,875 --> 02:07:38,208
Yes. Well, I...

1536
02:07:39,545 --> 02:07:41,252
I don't know.

1537
02:07:41,964 --> 02:07:46,925
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.</i>

1538
02:07:50,056 --> 02:07:52,093
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1539
02:07:55,478 --> 02:07:59,438
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1540
02:08:00,733 --> 02:08:04,602
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1541
02:08:06,406 --> 02:08:10,320
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1542
02:08:10,451 --> 02:08:15,037
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1543
02:08:17,583 --> 02:08:20,621
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1544
02:08:23,089 --> 02:08:27,254
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1545
02:08:27,802 --> 02:08:30,169
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1546
02:08:31,431 --> 02:08:33,297
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1547
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:41,104
I wish I could've been there with you.

1548
02:08:44,193 --> 02:08:45,604
You were.

1549
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:57,787
I love you.

1550
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:05,504
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1551
02:09:07,216 --> 02:09:10,960
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1552
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:20,686
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1553
02:09:24,817 --> 02:09:26,479
<i>Mama</i>

1554
02:09:27,570 --> 02:09:32,565
always said that dying was a part of life.

1555
02:09:35,995 --> 02:09:38,328
I sure wish it wasn't.

1556
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,744
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1557
02:09:46,088 --> 02:09:47,169
But...

1558
02:09:47,423 --> 02:09:50,086
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1559
02:09:51,928 --> 02:09:55,717
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1560
02:09:57,892 --> 02:10:03,889
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1561
02:10:07,026 --> 02:10:09,609
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1562
02:10:10,905 --> 02:10:11,941
Okay.

1563
02:10:12,198 --> 02:10:13,359
<i>He's really good.</i>

1564
02:10:13,449 --> 02:10:15,566
Forrest, you go.

1565
02:10:19,789 --> 02:10:21,371
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1566
02:10:24,919 --> 02:10:28,378
(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1567
02:10:31,634 --> 02:10:33,876
You'd be so proud of him.

1568
02:10:35,596 --> 02:10:37,053
I am.

1569
02:10:38,099 --> 02:10:41,308
He wrote you a letter.

1570
02:10:42,895 --> 02:10:44,932
And he says I can't read it.

1571
02:10:45,064 --> 02:10:48,603
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1572
02:11:04,667 --> 02:11:05,999
Jenny,

1573
02:11:11,799 --> 02:11:15,008
I don't know if Mama was right,

1574
02:11:16,345 --> 02:11:17,836
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1575
02:11:17,972 --> 02:11:20,555
I don't know

1576
02:11:20,641 --> 02:11:25,136
if we each have a destiny,

1577
02:11:27,189 --> 02:11:32,309
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1578
02:11:36,824 --> 02:11:38,656
But I think

1579
02:11:40,536 --> 02:11:42,323
maybe it's both.

1580
02:11:46,667 --> 02:11:49,535
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1581
02:11:55,676 --> 02:11:57,668
But I miss you, Jenny.

1582
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:08,475
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1583
02:12:43,766 --> 02:12:46,725
Here's your bus. Okay.

1584
02:12:48,396 --> 02:12:51,730
Hey. I know this.

1585
02:12:51,857 --> 02:12:54,725
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1586
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:57,523
Grandma used to read it to you.

1587
02:12:57,613 --> 02:12:59,730
My favorite book.

1588
02:13:03,077 --> 02:13:04,568
Here we are.

1589
02:13:04,745 --> 02:13:06,202
Okay.

1590
02:13:07,915 --> 02:13:09,406
Here you go.

1591
02:13:14,296 --> 02:13:16,788
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1592
02:13:20,261 --> 02:13:23,971
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1593
02:13:25,975 --> 02:13:28,763
I'll be right here when you get back.

1594
02:13:33,315 --> 02:13:36,558
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1595
02:13:36,652 --> 02:13:40,191
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
