1
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:26,525
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,738
So, what do you wanna
hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:33,406
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:37,369
- There's porno theatres for that.
- Yeah, I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:43,667
So, what do you do now?

6
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:47,754
Now? Ride around nights
mostly. Subways, buses.

7
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,882
Figure I'm gonna do that, I
might as well get paid for it.

8
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:53,426
You wanna work uptown?
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:55,345
I'll work anytime, anywhere.

10
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,013
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,932
Anytime, anywhere.

12
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,560
All right. Let me see
your chauffeur's licence.

13
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:06,606
- How's your driving record?
- It's clean.

14
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,984
It's real clean,
like my conscience.

15
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:12,988
You gonna break my chops? I got
enough trouble with guys like you.

16
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:16,575
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches.

17
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:19,160
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.

18
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,539
- Physical?
- Clean.

19
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:24,541
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

20
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,459
Education?

21
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,128
Some.

22
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:30,422
Here, there, you know.

23
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,719
Military record?

24
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:38,138
Honourable discharge.

25
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,640
May 1973.

26
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:42,851
- Were you in the Army?
- Marines.

27
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:47,105
I was in the Marines too.

28
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:51,484
So, what is it?

29
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,778
You need an extra job?

30
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,281
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:00,285
Well, I just wanna
work long hours.

32
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:01,953
What's moonlighting?

33
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:05,290
Look, just fill out these forms
and check back tomorrow...

34
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,459
when the shift breaks.

35
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,294
O'Brien, please step up.

36
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:12,047
Take the car out through
58th Street, please.

37
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,090
Because it's crowded on 57th.

38
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:17,761
Hey, Rodriguez.

39
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:27,771
All right, all right,
I'm coming down there.

40
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,356
May 10th.

41
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,817
Thank God for the rain,
which has washed away...

42
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:17,320
the garbage and the trash
off the sidewalks.

43
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:20,115
I'm working long hours now.

44
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,468
Six in the afternoon
to 6 in the morning,

45
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,119
sometimes even 8 in the morning.

46
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,455
Six days a week, sometimes
seven days a week.

47
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:30,583
It's a long hustle, but
it keeps me real busy.

48
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:33,044
I can take in $300, $350 a week.

49
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:35,839
Sometimes even more when
I do it off the metre.

50
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,283
All the animals come out at night.

51
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:08,538
Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

52
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:11,708
Sick, venal.

53
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,939
Someday a real rain'll come and

54
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,299
wash all this scum
off the streets.

55
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,855
I go all over. I
take people to the

56
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,269
Bronx, Brooklyn. I
take them to Harlem.

57
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,439
I don't care. Don't make
no difference to me.

58
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:38,234
It does to some. Some
won't even take spooks.

59
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,028
Don't make no difference to me.

60
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,863
Driver, 48th and 6th, please.

61
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:46,159
Man, you are gorgeous.
Beautiful little girl.

62
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:50,955
I can't afford to get
stopped anywhere.

63
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,333
Oh, no. We wouldn't
want that to happen.

64
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:57,253
There'll be a big tip in it for
you, you do the right things.

65
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:01,049
You got a way.

66
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,719
Yeah. Now you're talking.

67
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:07,430
Driver, hurry up, will you?

68
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,137
Each night when I
return the cab...

69
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:50,181
I have to clean the
come off the back seat.

70
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,480
Some nights, I clean
off the blood.

71
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,348
Can I help you?

72
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,601
Yeah, what's your name?

73
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,186
My name is Travis.

74
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:39,189
That's nice. What
can I do for you?

75
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:43,234
I'd like to know what your
name is. What's your name?

76
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:45,486
Give me a break.

77
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,483
Look, you can tell me what your

78
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,616
name is. I'm not
gonna do anything.

79
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,660
Do you want me to
call the manager?

80
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,453
You don't have to
call the manager.

81
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:57,123
- Troy.
- All right. Okay, I mean...

82
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,502
Okay. Can I have a Chuckles there?

83
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,618
And do you have any
Jujubes? They last

84
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:06,799
longer. I'd like to
get some Jujubes.

85
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:09,219
What you see is what we got.

86
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:15,892
A Clark.

87
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,854
I'll take these.

88
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,691
Coca-Cola.

89
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:27,779
We don't have Coca-Cola. Royal
Crown Cola is all we got.

90
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,115
A dollar eighty-five.

91
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,557
Twelve hours of work and
I still can't sleep.

92
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:58,685
Damn.

93
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:02,981
The days go on and on.
And they don't end.

94
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:07,860
All my life needed was a
sense of some place to go.

95
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,397
I don't believe that
one should devote

96
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,448
his life to morbid self-attention.

97
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,994
I believe that someone should
become a person like other people.

98
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,193
I first saw her at
Palantine campaign

99
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,293
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.

100
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:27,255
She was wearing a white dress.

101
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,924
She appeared like an angel...

102
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:33,052
out of this filthy mass.

103
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:35,138
She is alone.

104
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:37,849
They...

105
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,726
cannot...

106
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:41,602
touch...

107
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,688
her.

108
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:58,077
Yes. Well, you
delivered two boxes.

109
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:01,039
I think it's a total of
5000 campaign buttons.

110
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,584
Now, all the ones we had
before and our slogan is:

111
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,503
We are the people, and
are is underlined.

112
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:10,214
These new buttons
have we underlined.

113
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:12,976
That reads, We are
the people. Well,

114
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:15,011
I think there's a difference.

115
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,140
We are the people is not the
same as we are the people.

116
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:21,434
Let's not fight.

117
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:24,354
Look, we'll make it real simple.

118
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,689
We don't pay for the buttons.

119
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,504
We throw the buttons
away, all right?

120
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,235
Tom, come here a minute.

121
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,155
What?

122
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:41,871
What is it?

123
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,459
If Andy okays this canvass report,
send a copy to all headquarters.

124
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:48,961
I got to get that New York
Times article xeroxed.

125
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:51,714
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget.

126
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:56,177
We have to emphasise mandatory
welfare. That's the issue to push.

127
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,262
First push the man,
then the issue.

128
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,473
Senator Palantine
is a dynamic man.

129
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:03,726
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

130
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,103
You forgot sexy.

131
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:06,687
I did not forget sexy.

132
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,524
Listen to you. You sound like
you're selling mouthwash.

133
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:10,900
We are selling mouthwash.

134
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:13,069
- Are we authorised to do that?
- Very funny.

135
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:14,651
You can get in trouble selling

136
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,489
pharmaceuticals in
a campaign office.

137
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:19,200
My uncle's in jail
because of that.

138
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:21,603
It's not really jail.
Of course, living

139
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:23,538
with his wife, anything
would be jail.

140
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,039
Look over there.

141
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,499
I love you.

142
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,834
Notice anything?

143
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,253
- No.
- Well, put your glasses on.

144
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:33,047
Okay, just a minute. All right.

145
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:35,550
That taxi driver's
been staring at us.

146
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,102
What taxi driver?

147
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,438
That one, the one
that's sitting there.

148
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,014
How long has he been there?

149
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:52,024
I don't know. It feels
like a long time.

150
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:55,069
- Does he bother you?
- No.

151
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:57,363
You mean yes, and
you're being sarcastic.

152
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,449
Oh, you're quick.
You're really quick.

153
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,200
Well, I try to be real quick.

154
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,661
I'll play the male in
this relationship...

155
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,121
Good luck.

156
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,666
And tell him to move. And I don't
need good luck. Thank you.

157
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:11,627
Oh, yes, you do. You
just think you don't.

158
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:23,639
Say, you're blocking our doorway.
You think you might move your cab?

159
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:07,076
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

160
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,786
lipstick, rouge.

161
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:11,872
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

162
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,460
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah, it's Blush-on.

163
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:19,338
Travis.

164
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:20,684
Hey, Wiz.

165
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:23,342
That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

166
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:25,636
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

167
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,264
A cup of coffee, please.

168
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:31,267
Anyway, whatever the fuck it
is, she uses a lot of it.

169
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:33,894
And then perfume. The spray kind.

170
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,606
Get this. In the middle of
the Triborough Bridge...

171
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:40,026
And this woman is beautiful.
She changes her pantyhose.

172
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:41,527
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

173
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:44,822
- What'd you do?
- I throw the metre, you know...

174
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,142
and I jump in the
back seat and whip

175
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:49,410
it out. I said, You
know what this is?

176
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,413
She says, it's love. I'm
gonna fuck her brains out.

177
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:54,248
She goes wild and she said:

178
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,168
That's the greatest single
experience of my life.

179
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:00,921
Then she gave me a $200 tip and
her phone number in Acapulco.

180
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,425
Travis, you know
Doughboy, Charlie T?

181
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:08,846
Hey, Travis. Got
change for a nickel?

182
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:11,432
Doughboy'll do
anything for a buck.

183
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:15,686
So how's it hanging?

184
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,317
What's that?

185
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,852
I turn on the radio. Some fleet

186
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,199
driver from Bell
just got all cut up.

187
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,492
Stickup?

188
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,412
No, he got cut up by some crazy
fucker. Cut half his ear off.

189
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:37,249
- Where?
- It was at 122nd Street.

190
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:39,835
Fucking Mau Mau land.

191
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:46,133
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

192
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:49,595
Travis?

193
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:55,351
Travis.

194
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:57,644
You run all over town, don't you?

195
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,688
Yeah.

196
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:01,065
You handle some pretty
rough customers, huh?

197
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:02,817
Yeah, I have.

198
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:06,278
- You carry a piece?
- No.

199
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:08,572
- You need one?
- No.

200
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:11,992
I know a fella who can get
you a real nice deal.

201
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,078
There's lots of shit around.

202
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,747
I never use mine. I'm
conservative, you know.

203
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,835
But it's a good thing to
have just as a threat.

204
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:34,098
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

205
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,976
Travis.

206
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:39,729
Look.

207
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:43,065
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

208
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,192
Dig the symbols.

209
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:49,238
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

210
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,241
And the watermark.

211
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,160
There's one person...

212
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:56,036
there's two persons...

213
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,747
and there's three persons.

214
00:17:57,914 --> 00:18:00,166
I got this at his
estate, The Pines.

215
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,626
Why don't you take it, and
if you can sell it...

216
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:05,305
you give me half of what you got.

217
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:06,630
I don't want to.

218
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,550
Hey, I'm gonna get in
my cab and boogie.

219
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:26,984
- Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.
- Well...

220
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:31,030
- Nothing.
- That's very cute. Thank you.

221
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,115
Hey, you wanna see something?

222
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:36,869
Wait, I just typed, You
wanna see something?

223
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,872
- What?
- If you had...

224
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,333
these three fingers
missing on this hand...

225
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:44,794
and that hand missing
on that hand...

226
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:48,672
- how would you light the match?
- I wouldn't.

227
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,050
Go ahead. Give it a try.

228
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:55,012
Well, I don't think I could do it.

229
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:56,514
No?

230
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:58,390
It's gonna be difficult.

231
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,434
I'll give it a try.

232
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:11,278
I got my thumb back for
a second. Thank God.

233
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:13,989
Just a minute.

234
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,040
I can't do it.

235
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,292
The guy at the news
stand can do it.

236
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:27,545
Well, I don't work
at a news stand.

237
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:30,798
- Anyway, he's probably Italian.
- No.

238
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,591
- You're sure?
- He's black.

239
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,541
If he had been
Italian, he might've

240
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,136
been a thief. The mob does that.

241
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:39,974
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

242
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:42,726
This sounds like a
joke, but it's true.

243
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:46,105
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

244
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,239
It's symbolic.

245
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,608
Why not a pigeon
instead of a canary?

246
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:52,528
I don't know why not a
pigeon. Wait a minute.

247
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:54,760
You got to catch a
pigeon. A canary,

248
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,615
you can walk into a pet store...

249
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:59,618
boom, kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want.

250
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:27,908
Hi. I'd like to volunteer.

251
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:29,940
Great. I'll take you
right over here.

252
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,818
I'd rather volunteer to
her, if you don't mind.

253
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:38,908
Why do you feel you have
to volunteer to me?

254
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:41,296
Because I think that
you are the most

255
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:43,245
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

256
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:47,041
Thanks.

257
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,501
But what do you
think of Palantine?

258
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:54,715
Well, I...

259
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:56,170
Palantine, the man you're

260
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,177
volunteering to help
elect president.

261
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:01,597
I'm sure he'll make
a good president.

262
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:03,475
I don't know what
his policies are,

263
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,184
but I'm sure he'll
make a good one.

264
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:09,271
- You wanna canvass?
- Yeah, I'll canvass.

265
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:12,066
How do you feel about the
senator's stand on welfare?

266
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,205
I don't really know his stand on

267
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,737
welfare, but I'm sure
it's a good stand.

268
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,865
- You're sure of that?
- Yeah.

269
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:24,536
We all work together
here, day and night...

270
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:27,915
so I'm sure the gentlemen
will sign you up over there.

271
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,161
The thing is, I drive a taxi at

272
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:32,670
night, so it's kind
of hard for me...

273
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,047
to work in the day.

274
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:38,300
Then what exactly do you want?

275
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,261
Would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me?

276
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:42,721
Why?

277
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:45,140
- Why? I'll tell you why.
- Yeah.

278
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:48,435
I think you're a lonely person.

279
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:51,271
I drive by a lot,
and I see you here.

280
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,482
I see a lot of
people around you...

281
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,777
and I see these phones and all
this stuff on your desk...

282
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:58,320
that means nothing.

283
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:00,656
And when I came
inside and met you...

284
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:03,617
I saw in your eyes and how
you carried yourself...

285
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,036
that you're not a happy person.

286
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:08,414
And I think you need something.

287
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:11,500
And if you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

288
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:15,796
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

289
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,180
What do you say?

290
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:33,022
It's a little hard standing
here and asking you, so...

291
00:22:37,318 --> 00:22:40,988
Five minutes, that's all. Just
outside. Right around here.

292
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:42,906
I'm there to protect you.

293
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:51,248
Come on. Just take a little break.

294
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,503
I have a break at 4:00.
And if you're here...

295
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:58,756
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

296
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:01,884
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

297
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:05,012
- All right, 4 p.m.
- Right.

298
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,056
- Outside in the front?
- Yes.

299
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:08,474
Okay.

300
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:11,101
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

301
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:13,937
Travis.

302
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:16,690
I appreciate this, Betsy.

303
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:33,624
May 26th, 4:00 p.m.

304
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:37,753
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee
Shop on Columbus Circle.

305
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:41,251
I had black coffee
and apple pie with

306
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,383
a slice of melted yellow cheese.

307
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:45,844
I think that was a good selection.

308
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:48,388
Betsy had coffee and
a fruit salad dish.

309
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:50,516
She could've had
anything she wanted.

310
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:53,435
Fifteen thousand volunteers
in New York alone's not bad.

311
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,479
But the organisational problems.

312
00:23:57,565 --> 00:24:00,609
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

313
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,487
I got to get organised.
Little things,

314
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:05,906
like my apartment, my possessions.

315
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:10,536
One of these days,
I'll get organis-ised.

316
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:12,412
You mean organised?

317
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:14,498
Organis-ised.

318
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:17,167
Organis-ised. It's a joke.

319
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:20,629
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-S-D.

320
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,179
You mean organis-ise.
Like those little

321
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,134
signs in offices that say, Think.

322
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:32,724
Do you like where you work?

323
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:35,966
We've got some good people. And I

324
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:38,063
think Palantine's
got a good chance.

325
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:44,278
You know you have beautiful eyes?

326
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,953
Do you like the guy you work with?

327
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:54,788
He's okay.

328
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:58,041
Yeah, I know. But do you like him?

329
00:24:58,543 --> 00:25:00,891
He's funny, good at
his job. He's okay.

330
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:03,005
Though he does have
a few problems.

331
00:25:03,214 --> 00:25:05,382
I would say he has
quite a few problems.

332
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:10,179
His energy seems to go
in the wrong places.

333
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:13,599
When I walked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

334
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:16,685
I could just tell that
there was no connection...

335
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,270
whatsoever.

336
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:21,732
And I felt when I walked in,
there was something between us.

337
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:24,651
There was an impulse that
we were both following.

338
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:27,571
So that gave me the
right to talk to you.

339
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,496
Otherwise, I never would've felt

340
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,533
that I had the right
to talk to you.

341
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:34,745
I never would've had the
courage to talk to you.

342
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:38,123
And with him, I felt
there was nothing.

343
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,418
When I walked in, I knew I was
right. Did you feel that way?

344
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:47,299
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

345
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:50,886
Where are you from?

346
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:52,596
Upstate.

347
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,310
That fellow, I don't like him.

348
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,521
Not that I don't like him,
I just think he's silly.

349
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:06,235
I don't think he respects you.

350
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:10,489
I don't believe I've ever
met anyone quite like you.

351
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,543
You wanna go to...

352
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,546
a movie with me?

353
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,051
- I have to go back to work now.
- I don't mean now. Another time?

354
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:40,018
Sure. You know what
you remind me of?

355
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:43,355
- What?
- That song...

356
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:47,609
by Kris Kristofferson.

357
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:53,198
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

358
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:54,950
He's a prophet...

359
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,910
He's a prophet and a pusher...

360
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,164
partly truth, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction.

361
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,251
You saying that about me?

362
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,169
Who else would I be talking about?

363
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,463
I'm no pusher. I've never pushed.

364
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:12,384
No, just the part about
the contradictions.

365
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:14,428
You are that.

366
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:46,914
I called Betsy again
at her office.

367
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,837
She said maybe we'd
go to a movie...

368
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:51,965
after work tomorrow.
That's my day off.

369
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:56,345
At first she hesitated, but I
called her again and she agreed.

370
00:27:57,847 --> 00:27:59,514
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

371
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,434
Betsy what? I forgot
to ask her last name.

372
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:05,937
Damn. I got to remember
stuff like that.

373
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,785
Don't worry about anyone
committing themselves...

374
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:22,662
until things start coming
in from California.

375
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:25,791
Listen, I think we should've
waited for the limo.

376
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:27,793
I don't mind the
cab, but I mind...

377
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,829
going to California
without the right

378
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,797
preparation. That'll
get us in trouble.

379
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,049
Are you Charles
Palantine, the candidate?

380
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:37,677
Yes, I am.

381
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:40,305
I'm a big supporter.

382
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:42,327
I tell everybody
that comes in this

383
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:43,975
taxi they have to vote for you.

384
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:45,769
Why, thank you...

385
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:48,897
Travis.

386
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:52,025
I'm sure you'll win. Everybody
I know's gonna vote for you.

387
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:54,653
I was gonna put one of your
stickers in my taxi...

388
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:57,781
but the company said it
was against their policy.

389
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,616
They're a bunch of jerks.

390
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:02,661
Let me tell you, I have
learnt more about America...

391
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,081
from riding in taxicabs than in
all the limos in the country.

392
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,794
- Oh, yeah?
- That's true.

393
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:13,839
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

394
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:17,217
What is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most?

395
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:21,224
Well, I don't know. I don't follow

396
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,723
political issues
that closely, sir.

397
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,435
Oh, well, there must be something.

398
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:30,814
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

399
00:29:31,023 --> 00:29:33,336
because this city
here's like an open

400
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:35,527
sewer. It's full
of filth and scum.

401
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,821
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

402
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:41,032
Whatever ever becomes the
president should just...

403
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:43,785
really clean it up.
Know what I mean?

404
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:47,664
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

405
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:50,959
And they just like... They
just never go away, you know?

406
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,545
I think that the
president should just...

407
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:56,362
clean up this mess.
He should flush

408
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,550
it right down the fucking toilet.

409
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:09,186
Well, I think I know
what you mean, Travis.

410
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:11,438
But it's not gonna be easy.

411
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:14,038
We'll have to make
radical changes.

412
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,108
Damn straight.

413
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:18,528
Here you go, Travis.
Keep the change.

414
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:20,030
Thank you.

415
00:30:23,534 --> 00:30:25,577
- Nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

416
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:28,163
You're a good man. I
know you're gonna win.

417
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,373
Thank you. Drive safe.

418
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:55,482
Come on, man. Get me out
of here, all right?

419
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:00,695
Come on.

420
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:03,198
Come on, baby. This
is a real drag.

421
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:06,034
Now, come on. Come on,
don't make no scene.

422
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:09,120
You wanna get busted?

423
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,622
Now, bitch, be cool.

424
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:21,591
Don't start no trouble.

425
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,761
Cabbie, forget about
this. It's nothing.

426
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:26,221
Be cool, bitch.

427
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:38,483
- Stop.
- Wanna hear something?

428
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:46,032
What's the matter, baby?

429
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:22,402
Get your ass out of here.

430
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,848
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

431
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:37,352
- Have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.

432
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:39,229
I got a present for you.

433
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:47,153
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

434
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:56,538
Why'd you do that?

435
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:59,666
What else am I gonna
do with my money?

436
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,168
I wish you'd have
listened to this.

437
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:05,755
I would have, except my record
player doesn't work now.

438
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:07,215
Your stereo's broken?

439
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:09,884
How can you stand it? I
can't live without music.

440
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:13,763
I don't follow music too much,
but I would really like to.

441
00:34:14,014 --> 00:34:15,890
Then you haven't played
this record yet?

442
00:34:16,058 --> 00:34:17,559
No.

443
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,551
But I was thinking maybe we could

444
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:23,064
listen to it on
your record player.

445
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:26,985
Now, going back to 40
years of Chick Webb.

446
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,753
You got to be kidding.

447
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:48,256
- What?
- This is a dirty movie.

448
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:52,677
No, no. This is a movie that
a lot of couples come to.

449
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:56,806
- All kinds of couples go here.
- You sure about that?

450
00:34:57,516 --> 00:34:59,726
Yeah, I see them all the time.

451
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:04,105
Come on.

452
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:46,314
Shut the fuck up.

453
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:48,775
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

454
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:51,277
- Why?
- I don't know why I came in here.

455
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:53,780
- I don't like these movies.
- Well, I mean...

456
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:56,908
I didn't know you'd feel
that way about this movie.

457
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,036
- If I had known...
- These the only movies you go to?

458
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:03,248
Yeah, I mean I come and...
This is not so bad.

459
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,328
Taking me to a place
like this is as

460
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,293
exciting to me as
saying, Let's fuck.

461
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:14,300
There are other places
I can take you.

462
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:17,637
I don't know much about them, but
I can take you other places.

463
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:19,639
We're just different.

464
00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:22,433
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

465
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:23,852
- I've got to go now.
- Wait.

466
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:26,359
Wait a second, I
wanna talk to you.

467
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,689
Look, I have to go.

468
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:29,399
Taxi.

469
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,714
Can I talk to you at
least? Won't you at

470
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:33,778
least talk to me? I
didn't know you'd...

471
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:35,321
Won't you take the record?

472
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,866
- I've already got it.
- But, please.

473
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:42,078
- I bought it for you, Betsy.
- Now I've got two. Let's go.

474
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:43,997
Can I call you?

475
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:47,333
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

476
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:54,799
Hello, Betsy.

477
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,718
Hi, it's Travis.

478
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:01,556
How you doing? Listen, I'm
sorry about the other night.

479
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:04,851
I didn't know that was the
way you felt about it.

480
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:09,452
Well, I didn't know. If I would

481
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:11,733
have taken you somewhere else.

482
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,069
Are you feeling better or?

483
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:18,085
Maybe you had a
virus or something.

484
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,657
A 24-hour virus, you know.

485
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:22,160
It can happen. Yeah.

486
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,459
You've been working
hard, huh? Yeah.

487
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:36,799
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

488
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:39,677
in the next few days or something?

489
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:44,307
How about just a cup of coffee?

490
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:48,645
I could come by the headquarters
or something, and we could...

491
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:51,356
Okay, okay.

492
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:56,569
Did you get my flowers in the?

493
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:02,825
You didn't get them? But
I sent some flowers.

494
00:38:06,538 --> 00:38:09,123
Yeah. Well... Okay, okay.

495
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,376
Can I call you again?

496
00:38:11,794 --> 00:38:14,337
Tomorrow or the next day? Okay.

497
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:17,423
No, I'm gonna... Okay,
yeah, sure. Okay.

498
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:19,092
So long.

499
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,346
I tried several times
to call her...

500
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:25,729
but after the first
call, she wouldn't

501
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,433
come to the phone any longer.

502
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:30,269
I also sent flowers,
but with no luck.

503
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:33,106
The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.

504
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:37,860
The headaches got worse. I
think I got stomach cancer.

505
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:40,571
I shouldn't complain, though.

506
00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:43,074
You're only as healthy...

507
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,411
You're only as
healthy as you feel.

508
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:49,122
You're only...

509
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,040
as healthy...

510
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,667
as...

511
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:54,460
you...

512
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,045
feel.

513
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,449
Let's not have any trouble, okay?

514
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,018
Why won't you talk to me?

515
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:12,687
You think I don't
know you're here?

516
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:14,939
You think I don't know?

517
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:16,816
- Please leave.
- Take your hands off.

518
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:19,193
I just want you to know...

519
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:21,863
Please, just leave. This
is no place to do this.

520
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:23,156
Take your hands off me.

521
00:39:23,323 --> 00:39:25,033
- Take your hands off.
- Just leave.

522
00:39:25,284 --> 00:39:28,369
- All right, just leave, then.
- I'm gonna tell you...

523
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,205
you're in a hell. You'll
die in hell like the rest.

524
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:34,167
- Come on. There's a cop.
- You're like the rest of them.

525
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:36,711
Look, I'm calling
the cop. Officer.

526
00:39:39,673 --> 00:39:41,090
Officer.

527
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:46,054
Look, don't come around here,
because I'll call the police.

528
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:51,976
I realise now how much she's just
like the others, cold and distant.

529
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:53,853
And many people are like that.

530
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:57,356
Women for sure.
They're like a union.

531
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,109
Yo, cab.

532
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,951
Okay, pull over to
the kerb over there.

533
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,788
Right over to the
kerb. Over there.

534
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,875
No, no, don't... Don't... Don't...

535
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:18,461
The fucking metre.
What are you doing?

536
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:20,838
What are you doing with the metre?

537
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:24,217
Did I tell you to put? Did I tell
you to do that with the metre?

538
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:26,469
Put the metre back. Let
the numbers go on.

539
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,346
I don't care what I have to pay.

540
00:40:28,555 --> 00:40:32,183
I'm not getting out.
Put the metre back on.

541
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:33,392
Put it down.

542
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:37,772
Put it... That's right.
Put it... Put it down.

543
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:40,900
That's right.

544
00:40:41,777 --> 00:40:44,278
Why are you writing? Don't write.

545
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:45,988
Put the thing down. Just sit.

546
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:52,578
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, Pull over.

547
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:55,289
We pulled over to the kerb.
We're gonna sit here.

548
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:58,876
We're gonna sit.

549
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:21,566
Cabbie, you see that light
up there? The window?

550
00:41:23,026 --> 00:41:25,403
The light? The window
in the second floor.

551
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,993
The one that's closest to
the edge of the building.

552
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,581
The light up in the
window. Second storey.

553
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,959
What are you, blind?

554
00:41:40,169 --> 00:41:41,794
Do you see the light?

555
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:45,548
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

556
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,843
You see the woman?

557
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,182
Do you see the woman
in the window?

558
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:59,353
- Yeah.
- You see the woman. Good.

559
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:02,440
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

560
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:06,819
But that's not my apartment.

561
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:12,450
It's not my apartment. You
know who lives there, huh?

562
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:17,038
No, I mean, you wouldn't know.
But you know who lives there?

563
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:19,957
A nigger lives there.

564
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,043
How do you like that?

565
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:31,219
And I'm g... I'm gonna kill her.

566
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:36,307
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

567
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:38,517
Well, what do you think of that?

568
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,480
I said, what do you think of that?

569
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,398
Don't answer.

570
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:46,859
You don't have to
answer everything.

571
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:53,783
I'm gonna kill her with
a .44 Magnum pistol.

572
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,537
I have a .44 Magnum pistol. I'm
gonna kill her with that gun.

573
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,541
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum
pistol can do to a woman's face?

574
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:06,671
I mean, it'd fucking destroy
it. Just blow it right apart.

575
00:43:06,922 --> 00:43:09,173
That's what it can do to her face.

576
00:43:09,508 --> 00:43:12,635
Did you ever see what it can do
to a woman's pussy? You should.

577
00:43:14,054 --> 00:43:17,723
You should see what a .44 Magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

578
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,023
What's that?

579
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:29,193
I know you must think
that I'm, you know...

580
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:33,155
You must think I'm pretty
sick or something.

581
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:36,534
Right? You must think
I'm pretty sick?

582
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:44,208
Right? I bet you really
think I'm sick, right?

583
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:52,758
You think I'm sick?

584
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:59,473
You don't have to answer.
I'm paying for the ride.

585
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:03,394
I picked up this midget, you know.

586
00:44:03,645 --> 00:44:06,147
He's very well-dressed,
Italian suit...

587
00:44:06,398 --> 00:44:08,816
good-looking, with a
beautiful tall blonde.

588
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:11,569
- Was it a lady midget?
- No, the guy was a midget.

589
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:14,071
- The blonde was a lady.
- I got you.

590
00:44:14,323 --> 00:44:16,324
Those midgets are funny.

591
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:19,660
Sometimes I like to hold a midget.

592
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,663
They're funny. They always
wanna sit in the front seat.

593
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:28,169
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

594
00:44:30,297 --> 00:44:32,555
They're wearing
rhinestone T-shirts.

595
00:44:32,556 --> 00:44:34,508
They start arguing and yelling.

596
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,720
The other one says, You bitch,
and starts beating him.

597
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:40,431
I say, I don't care what
you do in the privacy...

598
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:43,017
of your own home,
behind closed doors.

599
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:44,935
This is an American free country.

600
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:47,589
We got a pursuit of
happiness thing.

601
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,732
You're consenting, you're adult.

602
00:44:49,983 --> 00:44:54,528
But, you know, in my fucking
cab, don't go busting heads.

603
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,948
- God loves you, do what you want.
- Tell them to go to California.

604
00:44:58,158 --> 00:45:00,493
In California, when
two fags split up,

605
00:45:00,494 --> 00:45:02,828
one's got to pay the
other one alimony.

606
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:09,043
Not bad. They're way ahead out
there, you know? California.

607
00:45:09,252 --> 00:45:11,170
So I tell them to
get out of the cab.

608
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,006
One time, I saw a cop chase
this guy with one leg.

609
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:17,343
- He was on crutches, you know.
- The cop?

610
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:20,846
No, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

611
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:24,517
- Hey, Travis.
- Hey, you got that 5 you owe me?

612
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:29,939
My man is loaded. Loaded.

613
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:32,524
I'd be broke if I hadn't caught me

614
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:34,819
some people from
Ohio out at Kennedy.

615
00:45:35,028 --> 00:45:39,156
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

616
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:41,409
What's the action around?

617
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,202
It's pretty slow.

618
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:45,788
I'm shoving on.

619
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,332
Hey, Wiz, wait.

620
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:52,586
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Bye, Killer.

621
00:45:55,715 --> 00:45:57,716
Thank you. Night.

622
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:15,109
- You put it down.
- You can have them all you want.

623
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,695
Hey, don't be hitting my man.

624
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:21,991
You better take your ass out, boy.

625
00:46:26,913 --> 00:46:27,955
Yeah?

626
00:46:28,123 --> 00:46:30,624
I know you and I ain't
talked too much, you know.

627
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:33,711
But I figure you've been
around a lot, so you could...

628
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,422
Shoot, that's why they
call me the Wizard.

629
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:37,923
I got...

630
00:46:38,717 --> 00:46:42,636
It's just that I got
a... I got a...

631
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:44,096
Things got you down?

632
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,349
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

633
00:46:48,435 --> 00:46:51,061
Yeah, they got me
real down. Real...

634
00:46:56,735 --> 00:46:58,152
I just wanna go out...

635
00:46:58,361 --> 00:47:02,531
and you know, like, really...
Really... Really do something.

636
00:47:04,576 --> 00:47:06,494
Taxi life, you mean?

637
00:47:07,746 --> 00:47:10,039
Yeah, well...

638
00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:12,124
No, it's...

639
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:14,627
I don't know.

640
00:47:16,963 --> 00:47:19,006
I just wanna go out...

641
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:21,675
I really...

642
00:47:22,594 --> 00:47:24,261
I really wanna...

643
00:47:24,596 --> 00:47:27,556
I got some bad ideas
in my head. I just...

644
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:31,810
Look. Look at it this way.

645
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:36,941
A man... A man takes
a job, you know.

646
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:39,068
And that job...

647
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:43,614
you know, that becomes what he is.

648
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:45,699
You know, like...

649
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:49,870
You do a thing, and
that's what you are.

650
00:47:51,164 --> 00:47:54,917
I've been a cabbie for 17
years. Ten years at night.

651
00:47:55,168 --> 00:47:58,003
And I still don't own my
own cab, you know. Why?

652
00:47:58,797 --> 00:48:02,967
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

653
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:04,931
You know, to be on
the night shift,

654
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:06,345
driving somebody else's cab.

655
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:08,222
You understand?

656
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:12,226
You get a job, you become the job.

657
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:15,980
One guy lives in Brooklyn, one
guy lives in Sutton Place.

658
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:18,691
You get a lawyer,
another guy's a doctor.

659
00:48:18,942 --> 00:48:22,027
Another guy dies, another
guy gets well...

660
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,029
and people are born.

661
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,365
I envy you, your youth.

662
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:30,995
Go out and get laid. Get
drunk. You know, do anything.

663
00:48:33,623 --> 00:48:36,625
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

664
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,546
More or less, you know?

665
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:48,470
I don't know. That's about the
dumbest thing I ever heard.

666
00:48:50,098 --> 00:48:53,309
It's not Bertrand Russell, but
what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

667
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:54,768
What do I know?

668
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,855
I don't even know what the
fuck you're talking about.

669
00:48:58,064 --> 00:49:00,357
Maybe I don't know either.

670
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:04,237
Don't worry so much.
Relax, Killer,

671
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:06,239
you're gonna be all right.

672
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:09,366
I know. I've seen a
lot of people...

673
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:12,745
- and I know.
- Okay.

674
00:49:12,912 --> 00:49:14,330
Okay. Thanks, man.

675
00:49:14,497 --> 00:49:17,875
I'll see you. I guess...

676
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,297
Yeah, you know. You're all
right. You're all right.

677
00:49:41,316 --> 00:49:43,674
What do you think
of your opponent's

678
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:45,778
chances in the upcoming primary?

679
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:47,571
Mr Goodman is a fine man.

680
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:51,116
I would certainly, if it
came to it, prefer him...

681
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:53,911
to our opponent in
the other party.

682
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,748
I think that my programmes
are better defined than his.

683
00:49:57,999 --> 00:50:01,669
They're more imaginative. I have
a better chance of winning.

684
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,713
It's academic, though. He's not
gonna win the primary. I am.

685
00:50:04,964 --> 00:50:06,674
I see.

686
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:10,260
Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

687
00:50:10,512 --> 00:50:12,721
How do you feel your
campaign is going?

688
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:16,100
When we came up with our
slogan we are the people...

689
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:18,602
when I said Let the people rule...

690
00:50:19,145 --> 00:50:21,689
I felt I was being somewhat
overly optimistic.

691
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,484
I must tell you that I am more
optimistic now than ever before.

692
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:29,613
The people are rising to the
demands that I have made on them.

693
00:50:29,823 --> 00:50:32,282
The people are beginning to rule.

694
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:35,119
I feel it is a
groundswell. I know...

695
00:50:35,328 --> 00:50:38,288
it will continue through
the primary and in Miami.

696
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:41,250
And I know it will rise...

697
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:44,169
to an unprecedented
swell in November.

698
00:52:10,423 --> 00:52:12,674
That bitch, goddamn. I'll
blow her brains out.

699
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:14,998
I'll kill her, goddamn
it. I'm gonna

700
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:17,054
get my hands on
her, I'll kill her.

701
00:52:17,263 --> 00:52:18,555
Shoot, goddamn it. Fucker.

702
00:52:18,723 --> 00:52:22,476
I swear if I get my hands on her,
I'll kill that fucking bitch.

703
00:52:24,312 --> 00:52:25,771
- Hey, Sport.
- Hey, Sport.

704
00:52:25,939 --> 00:52:28,148
I'll kill her. Damn it.

705
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:31,401
- That guy keeps following us.
- Don't look at him.

706
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:49,127
Hey, guys.

707
00:52:51,965 --> 00:52:54,633
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

708
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:10,315
Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.

709
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:13,110
In bars, in cars...

710
00:53:13,486 --> 00:53:15,988
sidewalks, stores, everywhere.

711
00:53:17,115 --> 00:53:18,532
There's no escape.

712
00:53:18,992 --> 00:53:21,451
I'm God's lonely man.

713
00:53:25,498 --> 00:53:27,124
June 8th.

714
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:30,043
My life has taken
another turn again.

715
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:33,755
The days move along with
regularity, over and over...

716
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:36,508
one day indistinguishable
from the next.

717
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:39,219
A long, continuous chain.

718
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:41,263
And then suddenly...

719
00:53:41,514 --> 00:53:43,557
there is change.

720
00:53:58,156 --> 00:54:01,074
Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a travelling salesman.

721
00:54:01,284 --> 00:54:03,368
How you doing, Travis?

722
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:28,810
- You got a .44 Magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.

723
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,063
That's all right. I got money.

724
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:32,981
It's a real monster.

725
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:36,037
Stop a car at 100
yards, put a round

726
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:37,778
right through the engine block.

727
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,499
Here you go.

728
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:53,543
It's a premium,
high-resale weapon.

729
00:54:57,924 --> 00:54:59,257
Look at that.

730
00:55:00,885 --> 00:55:02,594
Look at that. That's a beauty.

731
00:55:07,392 --> 00:55:10,811
I could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

732
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:15,107
But I just deal high-quality
goods to the right people.

733
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:17,609
How about that?

734
00:55:18,403 --> 00:55:20,988
This might be a little too
big for practical purposes.

735
00:55:21,322 --> 00:55:23,448
In which case, for
you, I'd recommend...

736
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:25,659
38 snub-nosed.

737
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:29,079
Look at this.

738
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,750
Look at that. That's a
beautiful little gun.

739
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:36,169
It's nickel-plated
with a snub-nose...

740
00:55:36,337 --> 00:55:38,797
otherwise the same as
a service revolver.

741
00:55:39,048 --> 00:55:41,258
That'll stop anything that moves.

742
00:55:41,426 --> 00:55:44,845
The Magnum, they use that in
Africa for killing elephants.

743
00:55:45,013 --> 00:55:48,265
That .38, that's a funny gun.

744
00:55:53,354 --> 00:55:55,605
Some of these guns are like toys.

745
00:55:55,815 --> 00:55:58,942
That .38, you go out and hammer
nails with it all day...

746
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:02,446
come back and it'll cut dead
centre on target every time.

747
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:06,616
It's got a really nice action
to it and a heck of a wallop.

748
00:56:09,287 --> 00:56:11,038
You interested in an automatic?

749
00:56:11,706 --> 00:56:15,375
It's a Colt .25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.

750
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:16,793
It's a beautiful gun.

751
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:19,588
Holds six shots in the clip,
one shot in the chamber.

752
00:56:19,797 --> 00:56:21,882
If you're dumb enough
to put a round there.

753
00:56:23,384 --> 00:56:25,802
Here. Look at this.

754
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:27,512
.380 Walther.

755
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:29,973
Holds eight shots in the clip.

756
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:33,101
That's a nice gun.

757
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:35,812
That's a beautiful little
gun. Look at that.

758
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:43,528
During World War II, they used
this gun to replace the P 38.

759
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:46,573
Just given out to officers.

760
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,372
Ain't that a little honey?

761
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:06,134
- How much for everything?
- All together?

762
00:57:06,344 --> 00:57:08,531
Well, only a jackass
would carry that

763
00:57:08,532 --> 00:57:10,430
cannon in the streets like that.

764
00:57:11,516 --> 00:57:15,018
Here's a beautiful handmade
holster I had made in Mexico.

765
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,104
Forty dollars.

766
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,857
Three-fifty for the Magnum,
250 for the .38...

767
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:24,653
one and a quarter for the
.25, 150 for the .380.

768
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:28,073
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

769
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,952
How about dope? Grass? Hash? Coke?

770
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:36,123
Mescaline? Downers? Nembutal?
Tuinal? Chloral hydrates?

771
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:37,936
How about uppers, amphetamines?

772
00:57:37,937 --> 00:57:39,876
No, I'm not interested
in that stuff.

773
00:57:40,086 --> 00:57:42,754
I can get you crystal
meth, nitrous oxide.

774
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:45,382
How about a Cadillac? A
brand-new Cadillac...

775
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,425
with the pink slip, two grand.

776
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,561
June 29th.

777
00:57:58,396 --> 00:58:01,523
I got to get in shape now. Too
much sitting has ruined my body.

778
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:04,276
Too much abuse has
gone on for too long.

779
00:58:04,527 --> 00:58:06,945
From now on, it'll be 50
push-ups each morning.

780
00:58:07,405 --> 00:58:10,282
Fifty pull-ups. There
will be no more pills.

781
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:14,661
There will be no more bad food,
no more destroyers of my body.

782
00:58:15,246 --> 00:58:17,473
From now on, it'll be
total organisation.

783
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:18,957
Every muscle must be tight.

784
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:41,062
Look at the size of that.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

785
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,440
Oh, it looks so good.

786
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:53,241
It's getting harder and harder,
and it's throbbing now.

787
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:58,788
The idea had been growing
in my brain for some time.

788
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:01,124
True force.

789
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:05,962
All the king's men cannot
put it back together again.

790
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,242
Where do we get more of these?

791
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:10,420
Where do you think?
At headquarters.

792
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:12,797
All the way back there?

793
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:14,215
- Come on.
- They'll work.

794
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:17,135
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- I've done this 100 times.

795
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:19,637
- You've done this before?
- Yes, don't worry.

796
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:22,766
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.

797
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:24,476
Betsy.

798
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:26,895
- Betsy.
- What?

799
01:01:27,605 --> 01:01:30,648
Betsy. Come here, come here.

800
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,538
Hey.

801
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:31,334
Hey, you're a Secret
Service man, aren't you?

802
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:35,505
Just waiting for the senator.

803
01:02:36,382 --> 01:02:38,675
You're waiting for the senator?

804
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:44,722
That's a very good answer.

805
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:47,183
Shit, man.

806
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,771
I'm waiting for the
sun to shine. Yeah.

807
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:55,942
No, the reason I asked if you
were a Secret Service man...

808
01:02:56,193 --> 01:02:57,735
I won't say anything.

809
01:02:57,987 --> 01:02:59,487
Is because I...

810
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:05,785
I saw some suspicious-looking
people over there.

811
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:08,204
- You did?
- They were right over there.

812
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:15,962
They were just here.

813
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:21,468
They were very, very...

814
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:24,053
- Suspicious.
- Yeah.

815
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:29,058
Where'd he go?

816
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:32,061
Is it hard to get to be
in the Secret Service?

817
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:33,313
Why?

818
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:36,441
Well, I was just curious, because
I think I'd be good at it.

819
01:03:36,734 --> 01:03:38,485
I'm very observant.

820
01:03:38,736 --> 01:03:41,404
I was in the Marine
Corps, you know.

821
01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:43,740
I'm good with crowds.

822
01:03:46,076 --> 01:03:49,579
I noticed your little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

823
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,872
Sort of.

824
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,168
A signal. A secret signal
for a Secret Service.

825
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,590
Hey, what kind of
guns you guys carry?

826
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:05,845
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
Something bigger, maybe?

827
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:08,483
Look, if you're
really interested, if

828
01:04:08,484 --> 01:04:10,808
you give me your
name and address...

829
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,562
we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

830
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:18,233
- You will?
- Sure.

831
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,943
Okay.

832
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:21,861
Why not?

833
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:27,283
My name is Henry...

834
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:31,663
Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

835
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:38,962
154 Hopper Avenue.

836
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,297
- Hopper?
- Yeah.

837
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:46,302
You know, like a rabbit? Hip, hop.

838
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:51,307
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

839
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:55,144
Is there a zip code?

840
01:04:55,396 --> 01:04:58,356
Yeah, 6-1-0-4-5-2.

841
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:04,362
- Okay?
- That's six digits. 6, 1...

842
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:08,533
Oh, well, 6-1-0-4-5.

843
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:10,827
Okay.

844
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,122
I was thinking of my
telephone number.

845
01:05:14,373 --> 01:05:15,456
Well, I've got it all.

846
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:18,418
Henry, we'll get all the
stuff right out to you.

847
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:22,130
Thanks a lot. Hey, great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.

848
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:24,173
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

849
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:28,595
You have to be careful around
a place like this. Bye.

850
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,229
Damn it.

851
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,003
Yeah.

852
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:09,260
I'm faster than you,
you fucking sick...

853
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:12,180
I saw you coming, you fuck.

854
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:14,057
Shitheel.

855
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:20,396
I'm standing here.
You make the move.

856
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:22,273
You make the move.

857
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:24,400
It's your move.

858
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,656
Don't try it, you fuck.

859
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:37,705
You talking to me?

860
01:06:40,084 --> 01:06:41,584
You talking to me?

861
01:06:43,864 --> 01:06:45,364
You talking to me?

862
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:51,552
Well, then who the hell else are
you talking to? You talking to me?

863
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:54,055
Well, I'm the only one here.

864
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:59,268
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

865
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,145
Oh, yeah?

866
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:04,941
Okay.

867
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:14,617
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

868
01:07:14,827 --> 01:07:17,370
Here is a man who would
not take it any more.

869
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:19,747
Who would not let...

870
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:22,834
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

871
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:26,504
Here is a man who would
not take it any more.

872
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,798
A man who stood up
against the scum...

873
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:31,384
the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.

874
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:34,637
Here is someone who stood up.

875
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:42,979
You're dead.

876
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,215
Hey, Travis.

877
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:13,092
Hi, Melio.

878
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,438
Yeah, man?

879
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,786
Okay, shut your fucking
mouth and give

880
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:29,776
me the cash out the
drawer. Come on.

881
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:32,820
- Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
- Don't shoot.

882
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,239
Stop taking so long. Come on.

883
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:37,909
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

884
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:39,702
- This all you got?
- That's it.

885
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:42,205
I don't have any more money, man.

886
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,207
- That's all I got.
- You got more.

887
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:47,460
- I tell you, I got no money.
- Reach in your sock.

888
01:08:47,628 --> 01:08:49,629
- Give me the rest of the bread.
- Hey. Hey.

889
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:57,595
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

890
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:04,560
Shit, man.

891
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:07,264
Is he dead?

892
01:09:07,265 --> 01:09:09,315
I don't know. His eyes are moving.

893
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:17,239
I ain't got a permit
for this thing.

894
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,825
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

895
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:25,331
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

896
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:28,417
- Can I give you some money?
- No, man, just get out of here.

897
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:31,170
No, man. I'll take
care of it. Go ahead.

898
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:37,844
The fifth motherfucker this year.

899
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:26,118
Walt Whitman, that
great American poet...

900
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,371
spoke for all of us when he said:

901
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:31,374
I am the man. I suffered.

902
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:34,752
I was there. Today I say to you:

903
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:38,381
We are the people. We suffered.

904
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:40,883
We were there.

905
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,389
We, the people,
suffered in Vietnam.

906
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:49,725
We, the people, suffered.
We still suffer...

907
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:52,728
from unemployment, inflation...

908
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,981
crime and corruption.

909
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:00,194
Dear Father and Mother...

910
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:02,738
July is the month I remember...

911
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:06,158
which brings not only your
wedding anniversary...

912
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:09,578
but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.

913
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:12,707
I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates...

914
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:16,919
but I hope this card will
take care of them all.

915
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:20,339
I'm sorry, again, I cannot
send you my address...

916
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:23,009
like I promised to last year.

917
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:26,012
But the sensitive nature of
my work for the government...

918
01:12:26,179 --> 01:12:28,431
demands utmost secrecy.

919
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:31,767
I know you will understand.

920
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:35,104
I am healthy and well and
making lots of money.

921
01:12:35,313 --> 01:12:37,606
I've been going with a
girl for several months...

922
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:40,443
and I know you'd be proud
if you could see her.

923
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:44,780
Her name is Betsy, but I can
tell you no more than that.

924
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:47,324
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

925
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:52,413
Come on. Come on, let's
go. Let's go. Move it.

926
01:12:54,624 --> 01:12:58,252
Bear the burden of
suffering for the few.

927
01:12:58,462 --> 01:13:01,797
No more will we fight
the wars of the few...

928
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:04,300
through the heart of the many.

929
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:12,224
I hope this card finds you
all well, as it does me.

930
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:15,811
I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.

931
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:19,440
One day there will be a knock
on the door and it'll be me.

932
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:22,234
Love, Travis.

933
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,659
Don't you have some idea?

934
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:32,661
I'm not the one who wants to talk.

935
01:13:32,913 --> 01:13:36,916
But you must know that the reason
that I didn't marry him...

936
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:41,003
is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.

937
01:13:43,673 --> 01:13:47,134
Now he's getting a divorce anyway.

938
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:53,307
Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.

939
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:58,687
I do love him.

940
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:04,360
What about us, June?

941
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:07,696
Our marriage?

942
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:12,493
You got to know our
marriage wasn't legal.

943
01:14:12,702 --> 01:14:15,830
In the eyes of God,
we are married.

944
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:22,336
Brock, please don't do this to me.

945
01:14:24,714 --> 01:14:25,840
I love him so...

946
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:36,684
Damn.

947
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:40,229
Goddamn.

948
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:16,765
They trying to get in the picture.

949
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:23,606
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

950
01:15:26,776 --> 01:15:30,237
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

951
01:15:30,405 --> 01:15:32,573
You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

952
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:35,409
I'll be over there
waiting for you.

953
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,410
Okay.

954
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:43,209
Your name Matthew? I
want some action.

955
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,127
Officer.

956
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:50,299
I swear I'm clean. I'm just
waiting here for a friend.

957
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:52,801
You gonna bust me
for nothing, man?

958
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:55,387
I'm not a cop. I ain't a...

959
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:57,806
Then why are you
asking me for action?

960
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:02,394
Because she sent me over.

961
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:07,441
I suppose that ain't a .38
you've got in your sock.

962
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:09,276
A .38?

963
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,739
I'm clean, man.

964
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:16,659
- Shit, you're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

965
01:16:16,826 --> 01:16:20,329
That's nice, man. All
right. That's all right.

966
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:24,291
Fifteen dollars, 15 minutes.
Twenty-five dollars, half an hour.

967
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:27,419
Shit.

968
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,046
A cowboy, huh?

969
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:33,008
I once had a horse.
In Coney Island.

970
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,927
She got hit by a car.

971
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:39,306
Well, take it or leave it.

972
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:42,643
If you wanna save yourself
some money, don't fuck her.

973
01:16:42,811 --> 01:16:44,645
Because you'll be back for more.

974
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,670
She's 12 and a half years old. You

975
01:16:46,671 --> 01:16:48,691
ain't never had no
pussy like that.

976
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:51,610
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

977
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,697
fuck her in the mouth, in
the ass. Come on her face.

978
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:58,284
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

979
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,706
But no rough stuff. All right?

980
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:10,379
All right, I'll take it.

981
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:14,216
Hey, man. Don't take out
no money over here.

982
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:15,634
You wanna fuck me?

983
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:18,887
You're gonna fuck her,
you give her the money.

984
01:17:20,348 --> 01:17:21,890
Catch you later, copper.

985
01:17:23,184 --> 01:17:25,394
- What'd you say?
- I'll see you later, copper.

986
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:28,897
I'm no cop, man.

987
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,527
Well, if you are, it's
entrapment already.

988
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,865
I'm hip.

989
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:41,243
Funny, you don't look hip.

990
01:17:45,206 --> 01:17:47,708
Go ahead. Have yourself a
good time. Go ahead, man.

991
01:17:56,509 --> 01:17:58,552
You're a funny guy.

992
01:18:01,681 --> 01:18:03,766
But looks aren't everything.

993
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,060
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

994
01:18:11,232 --> 01:18:13,275
You're a funny guy.

995
01:18:53,316 --> 01:18:54,983
Hey.

996
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:57,444
The room'll cost you 10 bucks.

997
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:12,334
I'm timing you too.

998
01:19:31,354 --> 01:19:32,938
Come on.

999
01:19:42,365 --> 01:19:44,116
Are you really 12 and a half?

1000
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:50,247
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

1001
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:55,669
When that cigarette burns
out, your time is up.

1002
01:19:59,757 --> 01:20:01,300
How old are you?

1003
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:05,053
You won't tell me?

1004
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:08,557
- What's your name?
- Easy.

1005
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:11,685
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.

1006
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:14,354
Yeah, but what's your real name?

1007
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:16,064
I don't like my real name.

1008
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,400
But what's your real name?

1009
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:23,655
Iris.

1010
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,158
What's wrong with that?
It's a nice name.

1011
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,452
That's what you think.

1012
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:38,754
No, don't do that. Don't do
that. Don't you remember me?

1013
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:43,091
Remember when you got into a
taxi? It was a chequered taxi.

1014
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:45,427
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

1015
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:48,096
and he said he wanted
to take you away.

1016
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:49,431
He pulled you away.

1017
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:52,809
I don't remember that.

1018
01:20:54,395 --> 01:20:57,272
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

1019
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:00,150
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1020
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:02,653
Listen, we better make
it or Sport'll get mad.

1021
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:04,149
How do you wanna make it?

1022
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,948
I don't wanna make
it. Who's Sport?

1023
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:08,951
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

1024
01:21:13,998 --> 01:21:15,999
Wanna make it like this?

1025
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:23,298
Listen, I...

1026
01:21:23,466 --> 01:21:24,967
Can't you understand something?

1027
01:21:25,218 --> 01:21:26,881
You're the one that came into my

1028
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,804
cab. You wanted to
get out of here.

1029
01:21:29,013 --> 01:21:30,472
Well, I must've been stoned.

1030
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:34,309
- Why? They drug you?
- Oh, come off it, man.

1031
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,938
What are you doing?

1032
01:21:38,147 --> 01:21:40,148
Don't you wanna make it?

1033
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:45,487
No, I don't wanna make
it. I wanna help you.

1034
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:48,323
Well, I could help you.

1035
01:21:52,954 --> 01:21:54,204
Damn, man.

1036
01:21:54,872 --> 01:21:56,498
Goddamn it.

1037
01:22:00,503 --> 01:22:03,672
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

1038
01:22:04,549 --> 01:22:06,341
We don't have to make it, mister.

1039
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:08,594
Damn it. Don't you
wanna get out of here?

1040
01:22:11,347 --> 01:22:14,016
Can't you understand why I'm here?

1041
01:22:14,267 --> 01:22:16,518
I think I understand.

1042
01:22:18,187 --> 01:22:20,022
I tried to get into your cab...

1043
01:22:20,189 --> 01:22:22,733
and now you wanna come
and take me away.

1044
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:27,571
- Is that it?
- Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

1045
01:22:27,864 --> 01:22:31,700
- I can leave any time I want to.
- Then what about that one night?

1046
01:22:33,786 --> 01:22:35,871
Look, I was stoned.

1047
01:22:38,249 --> 01:22:40,500
That's why they stopped me.

1048
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:45,213
When I'm not stoned I got
no place else to go.

1049
01:22:46,549 --> 01:22:48,425
So they just...

1050
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:51,136
protect me from myself.

1051
01:22:58,603 --> 01:23:00,062
I don't know.

1052
01:23:02,565 --> 01:23:04,900
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

1053
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:08,111
Hey, look, I understand.

1054
01:23:08,404 --> 01:23:13,408
- And it means something, really.
- Yeah, well.

1055
01:23:14,035 --> 01:23:15,744
Well, look, can I see you again?

1056
01:23:15,912 --> 01:23:18,413
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

1057
01:23:18,623 --> 01:23:22,417
I mean, you know, regularly. This
is nothing for a person to do.

1058
01:23:22,919 --> 01:23:24,586
How about breakfast tomorrow?

1059
01:23:24,962 --> 01:23:26,797
- Tomorrow?
- I get up at 1:00.

1060
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:29,424
- One o'clock?
- One o'clock.

1061
01:23:31,969 --> 01:23:34,096
Well, I got a thing.
I don't know...

1062
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:35,597
Do you want to or not?

1063
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:37,808
Yeah, I want... Okay, all right.

1064
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:39,559
- Okay, 1:00.
- One o'clock.

1065
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:42,437
Okay. See you tomorrow.

1066
01:23:43,564 --> 01:23:46,608
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

1067
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:49,945
Thanks a lot, Travis.

1068
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:54,950
So long, Iris. See you tomorrow.

1069
01:23:56,285 --> 01:23:58,286
Sweet Iris.

1070
01:24:22,311 --> 01:24:24,146
This is yours.

1071
01:24:24,397 --> 01:24:25,981
Spend it right.

1072
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:33,196
Come back anytime, cowboy.

1073
01:24:33,906 --> 01:24:35,240
I will.

1074
01:24:53,843 --> 01:24:56,678
Why do you want me to
go back to my parents?

1075
01:24:56,929 --> 01:24:58,388
They hate me.

1076
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,892
Why do you think I split?
There ain't nothing there.

1077
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:05,645
Yeah, but you can't live
like this. It's a hell.

1078
01:25:05,855 --> 01:25:07,689
A girl should live at home.

1079
01:25:08,524 --> 01:25:10,358
Didn't you ever hear
of women's lib?

1080
01:25:10,568 --> 01:25:12,360
What do you mean, women's lib?

1081
01:25:12,528 --> 01:25:15,405
You're a young girl. You
should be at home now.

1082
01:25:15,573 --> 01:25:17,741
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

1083
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:19,534
You should be going to school.

1084
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:23,455
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- Oh, God, are you square.

1085
01:25:23,706 --> 01:25:25,707
Hey, I'm not square.
You're square.

1086
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:27,751
You're full of shit, man.

1087
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:30,212
What are you talking about?
You walk out with...

1088
01:25:30,379 --> 01:25:32,756
fucking creeps, lowlifes
and degenerates...

1089
01:25:33,049 --> 01:25:36,426
and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

1090
01:25:36,677 --> 01:25:38,553
For some lowlife pimp?

1091
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:40,889
Stands in a hall.

1092
01:25:42,183 --> 01:25:45,101
I'm the? I'm square? You're
the one that's square, man.

1093
01:25:45,394 --> 01:25:46,888
I don't go screw and fuck with

1094
01:25:46,889 --> 01:25:48,730
killers and junkies
the way you do.

1095
01:25:49,774 --> 01:25:51,733
You call that being hip?

1096
01:25:52,568 --> 01:25:54,402
What world you from?

1097
01:25:59,325 --> 01:26:02,410
- Who's a killer?
- That guy Sport's a killer.

1098
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,079
Sport never killed nobody.

1099
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,747
- He killed...
- He's a Libra.

1100
01:26:05,957 --> 01:26:07,123
He's a what?

1101
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:10,710
I'm a Libra too. That's
why we get along so well.

1102
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:15,757
He looks like a killer to me.

1103
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:19,636
I think that Cancers
make the best lovers...

1104
01:26:20,221 --> 01:26:22,097
but my whole family are air signs.

1105
01:26:22,265 --> 01:26:23,473
He's also a dope-shooter.

1106
01:26:24,433 --> 01:26:27,644
What makes you so high and
mighty? Will you tell me that?

1107
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:31,022
Did you ever try looking at your
own eyeballs in the mirror?

1108
01:26:37,113 --> 01:26:39,447
What'll you do about Sport
and that old bastard?

1109
01:26:39,657 --> 01:26:41,783
- When?
- When you leave.

1110
01:26:45,454 --> 01:26:46,621
I'll just leave them.

1111
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:48,665
- Just leave?
- They got other girls.

1112
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:51,793
You just can't do that.
What are you gonna do?

1113
01:26:54,755 --> 01:26:56,131
Want me to call the cops?

1114
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,842
The cops don't do
nothing. You know that.

1115
01:26:59,468 --> 01:27:03,179
Look, Sport never treated me
bad. He didn't beat me up once.

1116
01:27:03,472 --> 01:27:06,808
But you can't allow him to
do the same to other girls.

1117
01:27:06,976 --> 01:27:08,560
You can't allow him to do that.

1118
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:10,979
He is the lowest kind of person.

1119
01:27:11,272 --> 01:27:13,148
Somebody's got to do
something to him.

1120
01:27:13,357 --> 01:27:14,816
He's the scum of the earth.

1121
01:27:15,067 --> 01:27:16,568
He's the worst...

1122
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:20,363
sucking scum I have
ever, ever seen.

1123
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,535
You know what he
told me about you?

1124
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:31,583
He called you names. He called
you a little piece of chicken.

1125
01:27:33,085 --> 01:27:36,171
He does... He doesn't mean it.

1126
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:41,843
I'll move up to one of
them communes in Vermont.

1127
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:49,184
I never seen a commune
before, but I don't know.

1128
01:27:49,393 --> 01:27:51,519
I saw...

1129
01:27:51,854 --> 01:27:54,940
some photos once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

1130
01:27:55,524 --> 01:27:57,442
Why don't you come with me?

1131
01:27:57,693 --> 01:28:01,237
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1132
01:28:01,447 --> 01:28:02,864
Why not?

1133
01:28:04,742 --> 01:28:08,620
- I don't go to places like that.
- Oh, come on, why not?

1134
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:10,872
I don't get along with
people like that.

1135
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:13,249
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

1136
01:28:13,417 --> 01:28:16,878
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1137
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:20,048
Besides, I got to stay here.

1138
01:28:20,057 --> 01:28:21,105
Come on. Why?

1139
01:28:21,106 --> 01:28:23,051
I got something very
important to do.

1140
01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:24,844
So, what's so important?

1141
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,932
I'm doing something
for the government.

1142
01:28:29,767 --> 01:28:32,060
The cab thing is just part-time.

1143
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:34,729
Are you a narc?

1144
01:28:37,149 --> 01:28:38,358
Do I look like a narc?

1145
01:28:39,235 --> 01:28:40,902
Yeah.

1146
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,363
I am a narc.

1147
01:28:44,448 --> 01:28:47,909
God. I don't know who's
weirder, you or me.

1148
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,366
Sure you don't wanna come with me?

1149
01:28:56,367 --> 01:28:58,253
I'll give you the money to go.

1150
01:28:58,796 --> 01:29:01,464
- You don't have to do that.
- I want you to take it.

1151
01:29:01,757 --> 01:29:04,467
I don't want you to take
anything from them.

1152
01:29:04,802 --> 01:29:06,511
And I wanna do it.

1153
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:09,264
I don't have anything
better to do with my money.

1154
01:29:11,142 --> 01:29:13,435
I might be going away for a while.

1155
01:29:39,045 --> 01:29:42,464
You're just a little
tense, that's all.

1156
01:29:42,715 --> 01:29:45,175
I don't like what
I'm doing, Sport.

1157
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:48,428
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1158
01:29:48,637 --> 01:29:52,557
If you ever liked what you were
doing, you wouldn't be my woman.

1159
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:56,811
You never spend any
time with me any more.

1160
01:29:56,979 --> 01:30:00,065
Well, I got to attend
to business, baby.

1161
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:03,651
You miss your man, don't you?

1162
01:30:04,987 --> 01:30:08,364
I don't like to be
away from you either.

1163
01:30:08,574 --> 01:30:11,159
You know how I feel about you.

1164
01:30:12,244 --> 01:30:14,245
I depend on you.

1165
01:30:16,665 --> 01:30:17,832
I'd be lost without you.

1166
01:30:19,335 --> 01:30:21,753
Don't you ever forget that.

1167
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,473
How much I need you.

1168
01:30:35,559 --> 01:30:37,393
Come to me, baby.

1169
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:49,280
Let me hold you.

1170
01:30:55,871 --> 01:31:00,125
When you're close to me
like this, I feel so good.

1171
01:31:04,797 --> 01:31:09,300
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1172
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:17,225
That every woman, everywhere...

1173
01:31:18,936 --> 01:31:22,063
had a man who loves
her like I love you.

1174
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:29,320
God, it's good so close.

1175
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:43,293
You know, at times like this...

1176
01:31:43,794 --> 01:31:46,629
I know I'm a lucky man.

1177
01:31:49,425 --> 01:31:52,677
Touching a woman who
wants me and needs me.

1178
01:31:59,143 --> 01:32:02,103
It's only you that
keeps me together.

1179
01:33:34,196 --> 01:33:37,031
Now I see it clearly. My
whole life has pointed...

1180
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:39,534
in one direction. I see that now.

1181
01:33:41,203 --> 01:33:44,247
There never has been
any choice for me.

1182
01:34:19,366 --> 01:34:20,408
Ladies and gentlemen...

1183
01:34:20,617 --> 01:34:24,912
the next president of the United
States, Senator Charles Palantine.

1184
01:34:31,337 --> 01:34:32,628
Thank you, Tom.

1185
01:34:33,922 --> 01:34:35,089
Ladies and gentlemen...

1186
01:34:36,091 --> 01:34:40,428
we are met today at a
crossroads, Columbus Circle.

1187
01:34:40,596 --> 01:34:42,764
This is no ordinary place.

1188
01:34:42,973 --> 01:34:47,769
It is a place where many roads
and many lives intersect.

1189
01:34:48,937 --> 01:34:51,606
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1190
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:55,151
because these are
not ordinary times.

1191
01:34:55,444 --> 01:34:58,446
We meet at a
crossroads in history.

1192
01:35:00,115 --> 01:35:03,785
For far too long, the wrong
roads have been taken.

1193
01:35:04,078 --> 01:35:08,289
The wrong roads have led us
into war, into poverty...

1194
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:11,417
into unemployment and inflation.

1195
01:35:12,294 --> 01:35:15,963
Today I say to you, we have
reached the turning point.

1196
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,971
No longer will we, the
people, suffer for the few.

1197
01:35:32,147 --> 01:35:36,442
Now, I would lie to you if I told
you the new roads would be easy.

1198
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:39,153
They will not be easy.

1199
01:35:39,446 --> 01:35:42,949
Nothing that is right and
good has ever been easy.

1200
01:35:43,158 --> 01:35:45,159
We, the people, know that.

1201
01:35:49,206 --> 01:35:53,418
And we, the people, know the
right roads and the good.

1202
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:58,714
Today I say to you, we are
the people, you and I.

1203
01:35:58,966 --> 01:36:02,218
And it is time to let
the people rule.

1204
01:36:02,469 --> 01:36:03,678
Thank you.

1205
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,196
All right, let him
through. Pull back.

1206
01:36:26,952 --> 01:36:29,078
Palantine.

1207
01:36:36,837 --> 01:36:38,546
Thank you. Thank you.

1208
01:36:43,469 --> 01:36:44,844
Over there. Get that man.

1209
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:48,764
Give him some air.

1210
01:36:49,475 --> 01:36:51,392
Give him some air, will you?

1211
01:36:51,685 --> 01:36:53,561
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

1212
01:36:53,854 --> 01:36:55,730
- I saw him.
- Where was he?

1213
01:37:22,382 --> 01:37:23,549
What's happening?

1214
01:37:23,759 --> 01:37:25,092
Got the money?

1215
01:37:36,271 --> 01:37:37,438
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

1216
01:37:37,606 --> 01:37:39,106
Okay.

1217
01:38:14,851 --> 01:38:16,811
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1218
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:19,105
Okay, okay, my man. How?

1219
01:38:20,607 --> 01:38:23,484
- Where do I know you from, man?
- I don't know.

1220
01:38:23,694 --> 01:38:25,987
How's everything in
the pimp business?

1221
01:38:27,155 --> 01:38:29,323
- Do I know you?
- No.

1222
01:38:29,575 --> 01:38:30,992
Do I know you?

1223
01:38:31,285 --> 01:38:33,119
Get out of here.
Come on, get lost.

1224
01:38:33,328 --> 01:38:34,954
Do I know you?

1225
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:38,666
How's Iris?

1226
01:38:38,959 --> 01:38:40,334
You know Iris.

1227
01:38:40,586 --> 01:38:43,296
No, I don't know
nobody named Iris.

1228
01:38:43,505 --> 01:38:45,590
Iris? Come on, get
out of here, man.

1229
01:38:46,091 --> 01:38:48,547
You don't know anybody named Iris?

1230
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,803
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1231
01:38:51,305 --> 01:38:52,513
No?

1232
01:38:52,848 --> 01:38:55,391
Get back to your fucking
tribe before you get hurt.

1233
01:38:55,684 --> 01:38:58,102
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1234
01:38:59,605 --> 01:39:01,022
You got a gun?

1235
01:39:02,232 --> 01:39:05,359
Get the fuck out of here,
man. Get out of here.

1236
01:39:05,861 --> 01:39:07,486
Suck on this.

1237
01:39:42,564 --> 01:39:43,564
Hey.

1238
01:40:21,728 --> 01:40:23,771
You crazy son of a bitch.

1239
01:40:24,064 --> 01:40:25,439
Fucking son of a bitch.

1240
01:40:25,732 --> 01:40:30,319
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

1241
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:33,489
I'll kill you. I'll
fucking kill you.

1242
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:35,825
Crazy son of a bitch.
I'll kill you.

1243
01:40:53,468 --> 01:40:54,802
Crazy son of a bitch.

1244
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:58,431
You fucking bastard.
I'll kill you.

1245
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,767
You crazy son of a
bitch. I'll kill you.

1246
01:41:01,935 --> 01:41:05,980
I'll kill you. I'll kill
you. I'll kill you.

1247
01:41:08,942 --> 01:41:10,651
Stop.

1248
01:41:23,457 --> 01:41:24,540
Don't shoot him.

1249
01:46:04,112 --> 01:46:05,612
Dear Mr Bickle:

1250
01:46:05,822 --> 01:46:09,783
I can't say how happy Mrs
Steensma and I were...

1251
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:12,953
to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1252
01:46:13,163 --> 01:46:16,040
We tried to visit you
at the hospital...

1253
01:46:16,291 --> 01:46:18,959
when we were in New
York to pick up Iris...

1254
01:46:19,252 --> 01:46:21,795
but you were still in a coma.

1255
01:46:22,088 --> 01:46:24,131
There is no way we
can repay you...

1256
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:27,468
for returning our Iris to us.

1257
01:46:27,761 --> 01:46:29,428
We thought we had lost her...

1258
01:46:29,637 --> 01:46:32,806
and now our lives are full again.

1259
01:46:33,308 --> 01:46:34,641
Needless to say...

1260
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:39,354
you are something of a hero
around this household.

1261
01:46:40,106 --> 01:46:43,609
I'm sure you want
to know about Iris.

1262
01:46:43,818 --> 01:46:47,321
She's back in school
and working hard.

1263
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:50,657
The transition has been
very hard for her...

1264
01:46:50,825 --> 01:46:52,159
as you can well imagine.

1265
01:46:53,661 --> 01:46:55,204
But we have taken steps to see...

1266
01:46:55,455 --> 01:46:59,625
she has never cause
to run away again.

1267
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:01,627
In conclusion...

1268
01:47:01,836 --> 01:47:05,589
Mrs Steensma and I would
like to again thank you...

1269
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,509
from the bottom of our hearts.

1270
01:47:08,718 --> 01:47:12,805
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...

1271
01:47:13,014 --> 01:47:16,975
to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1272
01:47:17,185 --> 01:47:20,020
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...

1273
01:47:20,313 --> 01:47:24,858
you would find yourself a most
welcome guest in our home.

1274
01:47:25,151 --> 01:47:30,030
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma.

1275
01:47:31,241 --> 01:47:33,479
Eddie, the owner-operator,
comes up,

1276
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,536
he says, Hey, I wanna swap tyres.

1277
01:47:35,703 --> 01:47:37,329
I say, These are new tyres.

1278
01:47:37,872 --> 01:47:40,707
Why not throw in something
else, like your wife?

1279
01:47:40,917 --> 01:47:43,012
His wife was Miss
New Jersey of 1957.

1280
01:47:43,013 --> 01:47:45,003
That's why the fleet
has no spares.

1281
01:47:45,213 --> 01:47:47,631
- Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.
- Hey.

1282
01:47:47,841 --> 01:47:50,259
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1283
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,761
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1284
01:47:54,264 --> 01:47:55,556
Shit.

1285
01:47:56,391 --> 01:47:57,766
Well, see you later.

1286
01:47:58,059 --> 01:47:59,685
See you, Travis.

1287
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:22,583
Hello, Travis.

1288
01:48:24,043 --> 01:48:25,252
Hello.

1289
01:48:46,191 --> 01:48:48,901
I hear Palantine got
the nomination.

1290
01:48:50,195 --> 01:48:53,280
Yeah, won't be long
now. Seventeen days.

1291
01:48:54,324 --> 01:48:56,200
Well, I hope he wins.

1292
01:49:09,797 --> 01:49:12,925
I read about you in the
papers. How are you?

1293
01:49:15,762 --> 01:49:18,472
Oh, it was nothing,
really. I got over that.

1294
01:49:20,975 --> 01:49:23,477
The papers always
blow these things up.

1295
01:49:25,313 --> 01:49:28,607
Just a little
stiffness. That's all.

1296
01:50:04,852 --> 01:50:06,853
Travis.

1297
01:50:12,568 --> 01:50:14,278
How much was it?

1298
01:50:23,413 --> 01:50:24,788
So long.
