1
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,169
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:53,506
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:54,757
This is madness.

4
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,019
We're doomed.

5
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,815
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,444
What's that?

7
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,508
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:19,401
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,613
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:27,243
We'll be sent to the spice mines of
Kessel or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,954
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,969
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,721
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,599
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,310
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,648
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:02,278
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:09,326
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,288
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,385
There's one. Set for stun.

21
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,601
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,769
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,024
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:41,775
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,822
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,490
Come out, before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,828
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,539
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,085
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,680
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

31
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,057
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,102
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,773
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,252
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,588
The Imperial Senate
will not sit still for this.

36
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,298
When they hear you've attacked...

37
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,133
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

38
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,511
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

39
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:54,348
Several transmissions were beamed
to this ship by rebel spies.

40
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:57,309
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

41
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,353
I don't know what you're talking about.

42
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:02,523
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

43
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:05,484
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

44
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,987
Take her away!

45
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,117
Holding her is dangerous.

46
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,952
If word of this gets out,
it could generate

47
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,745
sympathy for the rebellion
in the senate.

48
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,498
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

49
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:22,376
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

50
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,253
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

51
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,921
Leave that to me.

52
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,508
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

53
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:32,803
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship

54
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,346
and no transmissions were made.

55
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,974
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting,

56
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,517
but no life-forms were aboard.

57
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,729
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

58
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,689
Send a detachment
down to retrieve them.

59
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,441
See to it personally, Commander.

60
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,443
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

61
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,111
Yes, sir.

62
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,711
How did we get into this mess?

63
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:08,255
I really don't know how.

64
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:12,760
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

65
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:19,058
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

66
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,524
What a desolate place this is.

67
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,739
Where do you think you're going?

68
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:35,324
Well, I'm not going that way.

69
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,035
It's much too rocky.

70
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:40,037
This way is much easier.

71
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,581
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

72
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,085
Don't get technical with me.

73
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,421
What mission?
What are you talking about?

74
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,510
I've just about had enough of you.

75
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,844
Go that way.

76
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,640
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

77
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,184
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help

78
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,644
because you won't get it.

79
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,118
No more adventures.

80
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,286
I'm not going that way.

81
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,323
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

82
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,410
He tricked me into going this way,

83
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,412
but he'll do no better.

84
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,917
Wait. What's that?

85
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,795
A transport. I'm saved.

86
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,589
Over here!

87
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,258
Hey! Hey!

88
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,845
Help! Please help!

89
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:51,973
R2?

90
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,481
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

91
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,935
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

92
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,937
Look, sir. Droids.

93
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,953
We stopped.

94
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,788
Wake up. Wake up!

95
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,380
We're doomed.

96
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,223
Do you think they'll melt us down?

97
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,655
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

98
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,908
Will this never end?

99
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,075
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

100
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:16,660
Luke!

101
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:25,210
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets
a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

102
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,796
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

103
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:41,059
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

104
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,144
No, not that one.

105
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,941
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

106
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,777
Protocol?
Why, it's my primary function, sir.

107
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,529
I am well-versed in all the customs...

108
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:55,448
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

109
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,535
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

110
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,287
What I need is a droid who understands

111
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,330
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.

112
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,750
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters,

113
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,961
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

114
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,045
Can you speak Bocce?

115
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,548
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me.

116
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:14,050
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

117
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,302
Luke!

118
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,847
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

119
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,473
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

120
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,310
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

121
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,979
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

122
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:27,522
Now come on. Get to it.

123
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:30,609
All right. Come on.

124
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,739
And the red one. Come on.

125
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:38,491
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

126
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:00,096
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

127
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,891
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

128
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:05,393
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

129
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:13,318
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

130
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,987
- Uncle Owen? What about that one?
- Yeah?

131
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,282
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

132
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:20,533
Take this away.

133
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,160
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

134
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:25,664
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

135
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,248
Here he comes.

136
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,170
Okay. Let's go.

137
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,713
Now, don't you forget this.

138
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,300
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

139
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,810
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

140
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:51,856
I've got such a bad case of
dust contamination, I can barely move.

141
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,525
It just isn't fair.

142
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,736
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

143
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,030
Is there anything I might do to help?

144
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,534
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest,

145
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,077
or teleport me off this rock.

146
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,704
I don't think so, sir.

147
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,873
I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

148
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,875
Not on this planet, anyway.

149
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,379
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

150
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,548
Well, if there's a bright center
to the universe,

151
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,883
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

152
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,386
I see, sir.

153
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:24,305
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

154
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,891
Just Luke.

155
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,729
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

156
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,481
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

157
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,858
Hello.

158
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,861
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.

159
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,821
Looks like you boys
have seen a lot of action.

160
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:41,072
With all we've been through,

161
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,533
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are,

162
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:44,951
what with the rebellion and all.

163
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,995
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

164
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,747
That's how we came to be
in your service,

165
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,665
if you take my meaning, sir.

166
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,084
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

167
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,086
Actually, there's not much to tell.

168
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

169
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:02,010
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

170
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:04,012
Well, my little friend,

171
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:06,181
you got something jammed
in here real good.

172
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,766
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

173
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,686
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

174
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,438
What's this?

175
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,649
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

176
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,695
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

177
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:28,036
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

178
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,707
Oh. He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

179
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,667
Old data. Pay it no mind.

180
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,128
Who is she? She's beautiful.

181
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,632
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

182
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,926
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

183
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,011
A person of some importance, I believe.

184
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:47,494
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

185
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,811
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

186
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,647
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

187
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,398
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

188
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,820
He says he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi,

189
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,446
a resident of these parts,

190
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,240
and it's a private message for him.

191
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,659
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know
what he's talking about.

192
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,494
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

193
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,246
But with all we've been through,

194
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,165
this little R2 unit
has become a bit eccentric.

195
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:17,627
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

196
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,421
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

197
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,966
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan,

198
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,718
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

199
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,637
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

200
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,807
I wonder who she is.

201
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,935
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

202
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:40,859
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

203
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,319
He suggests that if you remove the bolt,

204
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,322
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

205
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,741
Oh, yeah. Well...

206
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,370
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

207
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:53,621
Okay.

208
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,001
There you go.

209
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:03,214
Wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her
back. Play back the entire message.

210
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,299
"What message"?

211
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:06,551
The one you've just been playing.

212
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:08,761
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

213
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,222
Luke! Luke!

214
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,516
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

215
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:16,769
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

216
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,315
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

217
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,486
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

218
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,324
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

219
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,659
No, I don't like you either.

220
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,254
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought
might have been stolen.

221
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,422
What makes you think that?

222
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:47,133
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

223
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,969
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

224
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:55,892
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

225
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,188
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

226
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:02,065
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

227
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:05,526
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead

228
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,028
and have its memory erased.

229
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:09,280
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

230
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,077
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

231
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,912
He won't.

232
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:17,956
I don't think he exists anymore.

233
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,874
He died about the same time
as your father.

234
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,961
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

235
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,674
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

236
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,093
In the morning,
I want them up there on the south ridge,

237
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:31,469
working on those condensers.

238
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:33,054
Yes, sir.

239
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,975
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

240
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,645
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement,

241
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:42,480
about me staying on another season.

242
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,025
And if these new droids do work out,

243
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,611
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

244
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,072
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

245
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,074
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

246
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,159
Harvest is when I need you the most.

247
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,245
It's only one season more.

248
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,038
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest

249
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,873
that I'll be able to hire
some more hands

250
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,917
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

251
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,837
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

252
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,840
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

253
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:11,009
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

254
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,553
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

255
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,513
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

256
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:19,017
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

257
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:21,519
It means so much to him.

258
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:24,147
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

259
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:29,819
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

260
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,071
That's what I'm afraid of.

261
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,415
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

262
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,250
Please don't deactivate me.

263
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,087
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

264
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,423
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

265
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:43,267
That R2 unit has
always been a problem.

266
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:45,937
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

267
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,231
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

268
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:51,025
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

269
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,485
Blast it!

270
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:54,821
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

271
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,781
It's too dangerous
with the Sandpeople around.

272
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:58,144
We'll have to wait till morning.

273
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,159
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

274
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,787
All right.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

275
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,289
Boy, am I gonna get it.

276
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,226
You know, that little droid's gonna
cause me a lot of trouble.

277
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,085
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

278
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:11,671
Come on.

279
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,556
Luke?

280
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,808
Luke?

281
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:26,060
Luke!

282
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,152
Have you seen Luke this morning?

283
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,655
He said he had some things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

284
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:41,367
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

285
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,328
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday

286
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,955
or there'll be hell to pay.

287
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:49,667
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

288
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,753
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

289
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,986
Hey, whoa!
Just where do you think you're going?

290
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:20,031
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

291
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:23,117
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

292
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,037
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

293
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,207
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

294
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,168
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

295
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,545
What's wrong with him now?

296
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:37,715
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

297
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,259
Sandpeople. Or worse.

298
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,221
Come on. Let's go have a look.

299
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,430
Come on.

300
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:50,895
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

301
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:52,772
Wait a second.

302
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:55,316
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

303
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,559
Hello there.

304
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:17,898
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

305
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,736
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

306
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:30,411
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

307
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:34,165
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

308
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,712
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

309
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:41,839
Boy, am I glad to see you.

310
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:44,967
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

311
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:52,266
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

312
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,893
This little droid.

313
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,605
I think he's searching
for his former master,

314
00:30:57,688 --> 00:30:59,899
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

315
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,945
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

316
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,656
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

317
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,785
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

318
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:15,206
Obi-Wan.

319
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:19,877
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

320
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,296
A long time.

321
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,384
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

322
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,302
Oh, he's not dead.

323
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,512
Not yet.

324
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,099
- You know him?
- Well, of course I know him.

325
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,558
He's me.

326
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:40,022
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan

327
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,733
since, oh, before you were born.

328
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,485
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

329
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,196
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

330
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:51,200
Very interesting.

331
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,079
I think we better get indoors.

332
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:57,832
The Sandpeople are easily startled,

333
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:00,751
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

334
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:05,005
3PO.

335
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:17,017
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

336
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,772
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

337
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,567
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

338
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,779
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

339
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:31,657
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?

340
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,701
Quickly. They're on the move.

341
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:42,334
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

342
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,253
That's what your uncle told you.

343
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,172
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

344
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,383
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

345
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:52,470
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

346
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:56,599
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

347
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,311
I wish I'd known him.

348
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,147
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy

349
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:06,066
and a cunning warrior.

350
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,069
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

351
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,240
And he was a good friend.

352
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,034
Which reminds me...

353
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:18,120
I have something here for you.

354
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:22,833
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough,

355
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,461
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

356
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,547
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan

357
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:32,134
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

358
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,095
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

359
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,764
Sure. Go ahead.

360
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:42,853
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

361
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,272
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

362
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,485
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

363
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:52,404
An elegant weapon

364
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,491
for a more civilized age.

365
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,745
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights

366
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:03,916
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic

367
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,835
before the dark times,

368
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,462
before the Empire.

369
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,384
How did my father die?

370
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:18,389
A young Jedi named Darth Vader,

371
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,975
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil,

372
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,145
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

373
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,400
He betrayed and murdered your father.

374
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:33,487
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

375
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,450
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

376
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,287
The Force?

377
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,415
The Force is
what gives a Jedi his power.

378
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:47,084
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

379
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,712
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

380
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,922
It binds the galaxy together.

381
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:01,974
Now, let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend,

382
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,810
and where you come from.

383
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:08,105
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

384
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:12,526
<i>General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

385
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:16,030
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

386
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:19,450
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.</i>

387
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,201
<i>But my ship has fallen under attack</i>

388
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,954
<i>and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

389
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,124
<i>I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion</i>

390
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:29,418
<i>into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.</i>

391
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,420
<i>My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>

392
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,633
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

393
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,384
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

394
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,430
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

395
00:35:56,403 --> 00:36:00,574
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

396
00:36:01,283 --> 00:36:02,660
Alderaan?

397
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,994
I'm not going to Alderaan.

398
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,497
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

399
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,041
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

400
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,211
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

401
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,177
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.

402
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,846
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

403
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,516
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

404
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:30,604
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

405
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,525
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

406
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:36,318
Learn about the Force, Luke.

407
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,203
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

408
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:49,623
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

409
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,961
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

410
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,139
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

411
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,683
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

412
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,435
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

413
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,396
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander,

414
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,231
not to this battle station.

415
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:17,901
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

416
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:22,322
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

417
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,577
I've just received word that the Emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

418
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,664
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

419
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,416
That's impossible.

420
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,127
How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

421
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:40,007
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

422
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,844
Fear will keep
the local systems in line.

423
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:46,054
Fear of this battle station.

424
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,264
And what of the rebellion?

425
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:50,601
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station,

426
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:52,603
it is possible, however unlikely,

427
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:54,855
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

428
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,193
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

429
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:03,530
Any attack made by the rebels against
this station would be a useless gesture,

430
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,699
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

431
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,411
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

432
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:11,789
I suggest we use it.

433
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:16,126
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

434
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,630
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant

435
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:21,548
next to the power of the Force.

436
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,135
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

437
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,055
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion

438
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,724
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes

439
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,228
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

440
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,488
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

441
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,534
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

442
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,077
As you wish.

443
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,414
This bickering is pointless.

444
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:59,336
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress

445
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:02,005
by the time this station is operational.

446
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:06,093
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

447
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,060
It looks like the Sandpeople did this,
all right.

448
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:16,770
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

449
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,690
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

450
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:22,693
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

451
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:24,695
These tracks are side-by-side.

452
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:28,907
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

453
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,869
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

454
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:36,748
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

455
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,752
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

456
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,463
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

457
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:50,220
If they traced the robots here,

458
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,097
they may have learned
who they sold them to

459
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,057
and that would lead them back home.

460
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,183
Wait, Luke.

461
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,436
It's too dangerous.

462
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,337
Uncle Owen.

463
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,255
Aunt Beru.

464
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,757
Uncle Owen.

465
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:22,562
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

466
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:07,899
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

467
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:10,694
You'd have been killed too,

468
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:13,572
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

469
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,909
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

470
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,037
There's nothing for me here now.

471
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,123
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

472
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:41,224
Mos Eisley spaceport.

473
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:46,897
You will never find a more wretched
hive of scum and villainy.

474
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,482
We must be cautious.

475
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:31,775
How long have you had these droids?

476
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,028
- About three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

477
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:37,030
Let me see your identification.

478
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:40,450
You don't need
to see his identification.

479
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:42,869
We don't need to see his identification.

480
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,789
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

481
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:47,791
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

482
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,044
He can go about his business.

483
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,381
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

484
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:57,300
Move along. Move along.

485
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,570
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

486
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,447
Go on, go on.

487
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,659
I can't understand
how we got by those troops.

488
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:24,077
I thought we were dead.

489
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:28,540
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

490
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,104
You really think we're gonna find

491
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,130
a pilot here that'll
take us to Alderaan?

492
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:37,966
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

493
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:41,845
Only watch your step,
this place can be a little rough.

494
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:43,638
I'm ready for anything.

495
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,394
Come along, R2.

496
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:43,031
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

497
00:45:43,114 --> 00:45:45,033
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.

498
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:46,117
We don't want them here.

499
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,912
Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.

500
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:50,664
I heartily agree with you, sir.

501
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,758
Uh... I'll have one of those.

502
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,547
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,218
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

504
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:49,973
We're wanted men. I have the
death sentence on 12 systems.

505
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:52,851
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

506
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,894
This little one's not worth the effort.

507
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:57,522
Come, let me get you something.

508
00:46:57,772 --> 00:46:58,815
Aah!

509
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,593
I'm all right.

510
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:32,724
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

511
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,189
I don't like the look of this.

512
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:57,582
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

513
00:47:57,665 --> 00:48:00,919
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

514
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:03,380
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

515
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:07,759
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

516
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:08,927
Should I have?

517
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,180
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

518
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,434
I've outrun imperial starships.

519
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,520
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

520
00:48:18,603 --> 00:48:20,772
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

521
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,568
She's fast enough for you, old man.

522
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,571
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers.

523
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,491
Myself, the boy, two droids...

524
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,577
And no questions asked.

525
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:37,747
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

526
00:48:38,164 --> 00:48:43,002
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

527
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,632
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

528
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:49,717
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

529
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,846
Ten thousand, all in advance.

530
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,849
Ten thousand?

531
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,935
We could almost
buy our own ship for that.

532
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,021
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

533
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,190
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot, myself.

534
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,776
We don't have to sit here and listen...

535
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,612
We can pay you 2,000 now,

536
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:13,032
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

537
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,160
Seventeen?

538
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,957
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

539
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,877
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

540
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,503
Ninety-four.

541
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:30,467
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

542
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,553
All right. We'll check it out.

543
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:48,985
Seventeen thousand. Those guys
must really be desperate.

544
00:49:49,068 --> 00:49:53,448
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

545
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:55,742
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

546
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:58,453
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

547
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:01,056
Going somewhere, Solo?

548
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,081
Yes, Greedo.

549
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,375
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

550
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,669
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

551
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:11,174
It's too late. You should have
paid him when you had the chance.

552
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:17,764
Jabba's put a price on your head so large every
bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you...

553
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:19,766
I'm lucky I found you first.

554
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,185
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.

555
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,813
If you give it to me, I
might forget I found you.

556
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:29,192
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba...

557
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,985
Jabba's through with you.

558
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:34,447
He has no time for smugglers...

559
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,426
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

560
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,868
Even I get boarded sometimes.

561
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,204
Do you think I had a choice?

562
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:45,250
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

563
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,544
Over my dead body.

564
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,795
That's the idea.

565
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,882
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

566
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,300
I'll bet you have.

567
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:10,400
Sorry about the mess.

568
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,704
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

569
00:51:22,787 --> 00:51:26,165
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

570
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,836
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

571
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,130
What course shall we set?

572
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:36,009
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

573
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,343
What do you mean?

574
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,388
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

575
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:42,974
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

576
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,185
Lock the door, R2.

577
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,273
All right.
Check this side of the street.

578
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,113
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

579
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:06,914
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

580
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:10,960
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

581
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,129
You watch your language.

582
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,551
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

583
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,221
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

584
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,307
It'll be enough.

585
00:52:42,408 --> 00:52:46,829
Solo, come out of there, Solo!

586
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,040
Right here, Jabba.

587
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:51,834
I've been waitin' for you.

588
00:52:52,126 --> 00:52:54,003
Have you now.

589
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,400
You didn't think
I was gonna run, did you?

590
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:02,136
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

591
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,889
Why haven't you paid me...

592
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,809
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

593
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,248
Jabba, next time
you wanna talk to me,

594
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:11,479
come see me yourself.

595
00:53:11,562 --> 00:53:12,915
Don't send one of these twerps.

596
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:16,317
Han, I can't make exceptions.

597
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,320
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

598
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:21,906
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

599
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,617
of an Imperial starship?

600
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,036
It's not good business.

601
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,790
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

602
00:53:31,624 --> 00:53:34,127
You think I had a choice?

603
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,129
But I got a nice, easy charter.

604
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:40,275
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

605
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:45,096
Han, my boy, you're the best.

606
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,224
So, for an extra twenty percent...

607
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,685
Fifteen, Jabba.
Don't push it.

608
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,437
Okay, fifteen percent.

609
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,439
But, if you fail me again...

610
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:57,608
I'll put a price on your head so big...

611
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:01,696
you won't be able to go
near a civilized system.

612
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,158
Jabba, you're a
wonderful human being.

613
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:07,659
Come on!

614
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:17,754
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

615
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,070
What a piece of junk.

616
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,698
She'll make .5 past light speed.

617
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,534
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

618
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,621
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

619
00:54:51,704 --> 00:54:55,625
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

620
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,298
Hello, sir.

621
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,016
Which way?

622
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,895
All right, men, load your weapons.

623
00:55:18,147 --> 00:55:20,107
Stop that ship. Blast them.

624
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,911
Chewie, get us out of here!

625
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,916
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

626
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,103
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

627
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:59,105
Our passengers
must be hotter than I thought.

628
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:00,982
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields

629
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:03,442
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

630
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,289
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

631
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,749
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

632
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,377
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

633
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,880
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

634
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,090
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

635
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,013
Here's where the fun begins.

636
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:33,931
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

637
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,976
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

638
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,978
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

639
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,647
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like Dustin' crops, boy.

640
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,233
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star

641
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:48,237
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

642
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,698
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

643
00:56:50,781 --> 00:56:53,576
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

644
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,683
We've entered the Alderaan system.

645
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,060
Governor Tarkin.

646
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:21,812
I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

647
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:25,524
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

648
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:28,986
Charming to the last.

649
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,614
You don't know how hard I found it

650
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,574
signing the order
to terminate your life.

651
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,619
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

652
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,789
Princess Leia, before your execution,

653
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:42,333
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony

654
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:45,378
that will make
this battle station operational.

655
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:48,714
No star system will dare
oppose the Emperor now.

656
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,050
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin,

657
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,719
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

658
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:57,098
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

659
00:57:57,181 --> 00:58:00,643
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet

660
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:02,895
that'll be destroyed first.

661
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:07,483
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base,

662
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:10,403
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power

663
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:13,364
on your home planet of Alderaan.

664
00:58:13,447 --> 00:58:16,242
No. Alderaan is peaceful. We have
no weapons. You can't possibly...

665
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:18,744
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

666
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,997
Then name the system.

667
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,335
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

668
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,005
Where is the rebel base?

669
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,677
Dantooine.

670
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:36,679
They're on Dantooine.

671
00:58:36,762 --> 00:58:40,182
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

672
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,019
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

673
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,354
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

674
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,274
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

675
00:58:48,357 --> 00:58:52,445
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

676
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:53,779
No!

677
00:58:55,656 --> 00:58:57,074
Commence primary ignition.

678
00:59:20,347 --> 00:59:22,933
Are you all right? What's wrong?

679
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:26,395
I felt a great disturbance in the Force

680
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,607
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror

681
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:32,026
and were suddenly silenced.

682
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:34,195
I fear something terrible has happened.

683
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,157
You'd better get on with your exercises.

684
00:59:40,951 --> 00:59:43,496
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

685
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:46,040
I told you I'd outrun them.

686
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:51,295
Don't everybody thank me at once.

687
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,549
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

688
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,351
Now be careful, R2.

689
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:17,279
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

690
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,615
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

691
01:00:19,698 --> 01:00:22,034
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

692
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:24,578
That's 'cause a droid
don't pull people's arms

693
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,705
out of their sockets when they lose.

694
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:29,375
Wookiees are known to do that.

695
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,920
I see your point, sir.

696
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:36,257
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

697
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:58,362
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

698
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,448
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

699
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,450
But it also obeys your commands.

700
01:01:06,036 --> 01:01:07,538
Oh!

701
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,666
Hokey religions and ancient weapons

702
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:12,960
are no match
for a blaster at your side, kid.

703
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:15,546
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

704
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,883
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

705
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,551
I've seen a lot of strange stuff,

706
01:01:20,634 --> 01:01:22,887
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe

707
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,432
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

708
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:30,603
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

709
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,689
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

710
01:01:33,772 --> 01:01:36,650
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

711
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,863
This time, let go your conscious self

712
01:01:42,948 --> 01:01:45,159
and act on instinct.

713
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,663
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

714
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,957
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

715
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,719
Stretch out with your feelings.

716
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,361
You see? You can do it.

717
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,112
I call it luck.

718
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,823
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

719
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,451
Look, good against remotes is one thing.

720
01:02:27,534 --> 01:02:30,704
Good against the living,
that's something else.

721
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,374
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

722
01:02:36,877 --> 01:02:39,630
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

723
01:02:39,713 --> 01:02:44,510
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

724
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:50,933
Yes?

725
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:52,768
Our scout ships
have reached Dantooine.

726
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:54,728
They found the remains of a rebel base,

727
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,231
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

728
01:02:57,314 --> 01:03:01,026
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

729
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,238
She lied. She lied to us.

730
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:08,033
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

731
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:11,537
Terminate her immediately.

732
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,084
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

733
01:03:19,878 --> 01:03:21,046
What the...

734
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:26,719
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower,

735
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:28,137
some kind of asteroid collision.

736
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,306
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

737
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,433
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

738
01:03:32,516 --> 01:03:35,394
- What do you mean? Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

739
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:36,979
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

740
01:03:37,062 --> 01:03:39,398
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

741
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:41,859
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

742
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:44,737
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

743
01:03:46,238 --> 01:03:49,033
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

744
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,451
It's an imperial fighter.

745
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,913
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

746
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,458
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

747
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,796
Sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

748
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,049
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

749
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:08,552
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

750
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:15,642
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

751
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,395
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

752
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,273
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

753
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,694
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

754
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,614
I think I can get him before he
gets there. He's almost in range.

755
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:31,992
That's no moon.

756
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,454
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

757
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:41,251
I have a very bad feeling about this.

758
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,170
Turn the ship around.

759
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:45,839
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.

760
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,591
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

761
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:54,598
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

762
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,268
Why are we still moving towards it?

763
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,437
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

764
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,189
There's gotta be something you can do.

765
01:05:02,272 --> 01:05:05,033
There's nothing I can do, kid.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

766
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,819
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

767
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:14,701
You can't win,
but there are alternatives to fighting.

768
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,470
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

769
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,931
<i>We are opening the magnetic field.</i>

770
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,865
To your stations. Come with me.

771
01:05:57,369 --> 01:06:00,998
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

772
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,167
Yes?

773
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,420
<i>We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.</i>

774
01:06:06,503 --> 01:06:10,466
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

775
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:14,261
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

776
01:06:14,344 --> 01:06:17,139
She may yet be of some use to us.

777
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:26,273
<i>Unlock one, five, seven and nine.
Release charge.</i>

778
01:06:27,774 --> 01:06:29,943
<i>Three-one-six, report to control.</i>

779
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:34,907
There's no one on board, sir.

780
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,784
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

781
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,497
It must be a decoy, sir. Several escape
pods have been jettisoned.

782
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,457
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

783
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,626
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

784
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:49,046
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

785
01:06:49,129 --> 01:06:50,255
Yes, sir.

786
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,924
I sense something,

787
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:54,843
a presence I've not felt since...

788
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:58,931
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

789
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:00,641
I want every part of this ship checked.

790
01:07:09,399 --> 01:07:11,401
There's no one here.

791
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,579
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

792
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,791
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

793
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:27,084
This is ridiculous.

794
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,920
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

795
01:07:30,003 --> 01:07:31,129
Leave that to me.

796
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:34,424
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.

797
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:38,178
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

798
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:51,984
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

799
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:54,861
All right. Let's go.

800
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:11,086
Hey, down there.

801
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,840
Could you give us a hand with this?

802
01:08:23,223 --> 01:08:26,268
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

803
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,562
TK-421, do you copy?

804
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:44,244
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

805
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:03,513
Between his howling
and your blasting everything,

806
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,891
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

807
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:09,269
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

808
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,146
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

809
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:14,274
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

810
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:29,039
He says he's found the controls to the
power beam that's holding the ship here.

811
01:09:29,122 --> 01:09:31,708
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

812
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:36,296
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

813
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,716
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

814
01:09:42,135 --> 01:09:45,389
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

815
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,934
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

816
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,185
I want to go with you.

817
01:09:50,268 --> 01:09:53,105
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

818
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:54,606
They must be delivered safely

819
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,402
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

820
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:01,822
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

821
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,244
The Force will be with you...

822
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:09,037
Always.

823
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:20,465
You said it, Chewie.

824
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,968
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

825
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:25,721
Ben is a great man.

826
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:28,890
- Yeah. Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

827
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,102
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

828
01:10:32,185 --> 01:10:34,187
Who do you think...

829
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,524
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

830
01:10:37,607 --> 01:10:40,444
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

831
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:43,071
Who? Who has he found?

832
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,782
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

833
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,534
- Princess?
- Where? Where is she?

834
01:10:47,617 --> 01:10:49,536
Princess? What's going on?

835
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:57,753
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

836
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:05,218
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

837
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:08,305
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

838
01:11:08,388 --> 01:11:10,849
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

839
01:11:10,932 --> 01:11:12,976
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

840
01:11:13,059 --> 01:11:15,812
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

841
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:19,191
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

842
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:22,152
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

843
01:11:22,235 --> 01:11:25,447
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

844
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,575
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

845
01:11:28,658 --> 01:11:31,495
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

846
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:40,587
She's rich.

847
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:45,175
Rich?

848
01:11:45,258 --> 01:11:49,596
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

849
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,182
- What?
- Well, more wealth than you can imagine.

850
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:54,392
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

851
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,436
- You'll get it.
- I better.

852
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,230
You will.

853
01:11:58,313 --> 01:12:00,565
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

854
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,651
- All right.
- What's your plan?

855
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,154
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

856
01:12:07,697 --> 01:12:09,115
Okay.

857
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:11,785
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

858
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:16,414
Okay, Han, you put those on.

859
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:19,626
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

860
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,504
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking,

861
01:12:22,587 --> 01:12:25,423
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

862
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:29,427
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

863
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,555
That isn't very reassuring.

864
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:56,454
<i>517 to scan control.
517 to scan control.</i>

865
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,751
<i>316, report to control.</i>

866
01:13:05,505 --> 01:13:10,343
<i>5-3 to upper bay door.
5-3 to upper bay door.</i>

867
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,358
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

868
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,309
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

869
01:13:59,392 --> 01:14:01,394
I did say so before.

870
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:19,621
Where are you taking this thing?

871
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:22,457
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

872
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,669
I wasn't notified.

873
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,754
I'll have to clear it.

874
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,805
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

875
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,122
Look out.

876
01:15:12,298 --> 01:15:14,759
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

877
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,053
Here it is. 2187. You go and get her.

878
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:19,139
I'll hold them here.

879
01:15:23,476 --> 01:15:25,687
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

880
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:26,855
<i>What happened?</i>

881
01:15:26,938 --> 01:15:28,982
Had a slight weapons malfunction,

882
01:15:29,065 --> 01:15:31,484
but everything's
perfectly all right now.

883
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:34,738
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

884
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,490
- How are you?
<i>- We're sending a squad up.</i>

885
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:41,870
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

886
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:45,665
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

887
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,877
<i>Who is this?
What's your operating number?</i>

888
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:54,466
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

889
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:10,482
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

890
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:13,109
Huh? Oh, the uniform.

891
01:16:14,986 --> 01:16:16,863
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

892
01:16:16,946 --> 01:16:17,947
You're who?

893
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:19,908
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

894
01:16:19,991 --> 01:16:22,160
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

895
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:23,536
Come on.

896
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:28,958
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

897
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:32,420
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

898
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:36,382
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

899
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:38,885
Surely he must be dead by now.

900
01:16:38,968 --> 01:16:41,805
Don't underestimate the Force.

901
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,476
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

902
01:16:46,559 --> 01:16:49,854
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

903
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,147
Yes.

904
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:54,734
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

905
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:58,029
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

906
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:01,741
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

907
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:04,661
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

908
01:17:04,744 --> 01:17:08,248
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

909
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,384
Get behind me. Get behind me.

910
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:33,273
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

911
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:37,277
Can't get out that way.

912
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,779
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

913
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:42,323
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

914
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:46,536
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

915
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:50,123
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

916
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,460
What was that? I didn't copy.

917
01:17:54,752 --> 01:17:58,089
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

918
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,717
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

919
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,052
All other information on your level
is restricted.

920
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:06,139
Open up in there. Open up in there.

921
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,433
Oh, no.

922
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,143
There isn't any other way out.

923
01:18:15,648 --> 01:18:17,984
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

924
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:19,152
This is some rescue.

925
01:18:19,235 --> 01:18:21,946
When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

926
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,656
He's the brains, sweetheart.

927
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,408
Well, I didn't...

928
01:18:26,826 --> 01:18:29,996
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

929
01:18:32,248 --> 01:18:34,042
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

930
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,718
Get in there!

931
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:46,804
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

932
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:50,141
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

933
01:18:52,852 --> 01:18:53,853
Wonderful girl.

934
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:58,316
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

935
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:01,736
Get in there.

936
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,076
Wa-hoo!

937
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,795
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

938
01:19:18,878 --> 01:19:21,339
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

939
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,177
Let's get out of here.

940
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,721
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

941
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:37,772
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

942
01:19:37,855 --> 01:19:40,149
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

943
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:41,985
Absolutely, Your Worship.

944
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:44,904
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

945
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:47,615
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

946
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:48,992
It could be worse.

947
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:54,872
It's worse.

948
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:58,001
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

949
01:19:58,918 --> 01:20:00,753
Something just moved past my leg.

950
01:20:02,588 --> 01:20:05,633
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

951
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,032
Kid! Luke!

952
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,659
Luke!

953
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:33,953
Luke!

954
01:20:41,627 --> 01:20:43,338
Grab hold of this!

955
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,798
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

956
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:48,634
- Where?
- Anywhere!

957
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:57,602
Luke! Luke!

958
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,919
Help him!

959
01:21:23,002 --> 01:21:24,962
- What happened?
- I don't know.

960
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,882
It just let go of me and disappeared.

961
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,349
I got a bad feeling about this.

962
01:21:42,021 --> 01:21:43,022
The walls are moving!

963
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:45,483
Don't just stand there.
Try and brace it with something.

964
01:21:53,866 --> 01:21:55,451
Help me.

965
01:22:08,339 --> 01:22:10,091
Wait a minute.

966
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,721
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

967
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:17,974
<i>3PO!</i>

968
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:20,101
<i>Where could he be?</i>

969
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,441
Take over. See to him.

970
01:22:28,901 --> 01:22:30,403
Look, there.

971
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,199
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

972
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,201
If you hurry, you might catch them.

973
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,786
Follow me.

974
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,584
You stand guard.

975
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:50,590
Come on.

976
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:55,595
Oh.

977
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:01,684
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

978
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:04,896
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

979
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:06,564
All right.

980
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:21,496
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

981
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:23,039
3PO.

982
01:23:23,122 --> 01:23:25,791
- Get on top.
- I can't.

983
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,793
Where could he be? 3PO.

984
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,005
3PO, will you come in?

985
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:34,008
They aren't here. Something must have
happened to them.

986
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:36,719
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

987
01:23:40,556 --> 01:23:43,476
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

988
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:48,648
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

989
01:23:54,028 --> 01:23:57,990
Thank goodness they haven't
found them. Where could they be?

990
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:02,078
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

991
01:24:02,161 --> 01:24:03,746
I forgot. I turned it off.

992
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,711
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

993
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,714
- We've had some problems.
<i>- Will you shut up and listen to me?</i>

994
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:17,552
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?

995
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:20,638
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

996
01:24:21,764 --> 01:24:24,433
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

997
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:27,270
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

998
01:24:38,864 --> 01:24:40,366
What?

999
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,202
You did great, 3PO!

1000
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:45,663
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

1001
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:47,957
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.

1002
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,127
It's all my fault. My poor master.

1003
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:52,795
We're all right. You did great!

1004
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:56,090
Hey! Open the pressure
maintenance hatch

1005
01:24:56,173 --> 01:24:57,592
on unit number... Where are we?

1006
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:00,928
<i>3263827.</i>

1007
01:25:47,099 --> 01:25:50,519
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

1008
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,271
Let's get moving.

1009
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:56,150
Where you goin'?

1010
01:25:56,233 --> 01:25:58,069
Wait! They'll hear!

1011
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:01,238
Come here, you big coward.

1012
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,990
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

1013
01:26:03,866 --> 01:26:06,619
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

1014
01:26:06,702 --> 01:26:09,538
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

1015
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:13,376
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

1016
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:16,754
I take orders from just one person. Me.

1017
01:26:16,837 --> 01:26:18,756
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1018
01:26:18,839 --> 01:26:22,051
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

1019
01:26:22,134 --> 01:26:24,428
No reward is worth this.

1020
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:36,565
Give me regular reports, please.

1021
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:37,733
Right.

1022
01:26:39,902 --> 01:26:43,197
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

1023
01:26:48,202 --> 01:26:50,121
You seen that new VT-16?

1024
01:26:50,204 --> 01:26:52,498
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1025
01:26:52,581 --> 01:26:54,583
They say it's quite a thing to see.

1026
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:56,877
What was that?

1027
01:26:56,961 --> 01:27:00,214
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

1028
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:07,179
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

1029
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,431
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1030
01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:10,391
- Are you safe?
<i>- For the moment.</i>

1031
01:27:10,891 --> 01:27:12,810
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

1032
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:16,856
We're right above you. Stand by.

1033
01:27:16,939 --> 01:27:19,525
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

1034
01:27:19,608 --> 01:27:21,610
Nice. Come on.

1035
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:26,699
It's them. Blast them.

1036
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,452
Get back to the ship!

1037
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:31,746
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

1038
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:34,957
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

1039
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,214
Aaaah!

1040
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,443
I think we took a wrong turn.

1041
01:28:07,406 --> 01:28:08,407
There's no lock.

1042
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:15,331
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

1043
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:18,751
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

1044
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:20,461
They're coming through.

1045
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,485
Here, hold this.

1046
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:02,419
Here they come.

1047
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:14,807
For luck.

1048
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:25,651
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1049
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:41,792
Where could they be?

1050
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,423
Close the blast doors.

1051
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,849
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1052
01:30:15,367 --> 01:30:20,831
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1053
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,625
The circle is now complete.

1054
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,919
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1055
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,379
Now I am the master.

1056
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:29,798
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1057
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,071
Your powers are weak, old man.

1058
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:55,908
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down,

1059
01:30:55,991 --> 01:30:59,411
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1060
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:08,796
You should not have come back.

1061
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,156
Didn't we just leave this party?

1062
01:31:38,909 --> 01:31:41,412
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1063
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:43,789
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1064
01:31:43,914 --> 01:31:45,874
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1065
01:32:01,223 --> 01:32:02,474
Look.

1066
01:32:05,394 --> 01:32:07,354
Come on, R2. We're going.

1067
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,149
Now's our chance. Go!

1068
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:15,279
Ben?

1069
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,462
No!

1070
01:32:40,262 --> 01:32:41,430
- Come on!
- Luke, come on!

1071
01:32:42,389 --> 01:32:43,974
Come on!

1072
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:47,186
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1073
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,363
<i>Run, Luke, run.</i>

1074
01:33:01,533 --> 01:33:03,952
I hope that old man got
the tractor beam out of commission,

1075
01:33:04,036 --> 01:33:06,163
or this is gonna be a short trip.
Okay, hit it!

1076
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,239
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1077
01:33:40,322 --> 01:33:42,116
Hold them off.
Angle the deflector shields

1078
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:43,826
while I charge up the main guns.

1079
01:33:52,918 --> 01:33:54,920
I can't believe he's gone.

1080
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:00,634
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1081
01:34:01,343 --> 01:34:03,303
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1082
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,531
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1083
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:34,501
Here they come.

1084
01:34:52,519 --> 01:34:54,354
They're coming in too fast!

1085
01:35:02,362 --> 01:35:06,200
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1086
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:09,786
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1087
01:35:26,511 --> 01:35:27,846
Ha ha!

1088
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:33,435
Got him. I got him!

1089
01:35:33,727 --> 01:35:35,896
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1090
01:35:37,105 --> 01:35:38,899
There's still two more of them
out there.

1091
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:15,602
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1092
01:36:16,561 --> 01:36:19,106
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1093
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:28,532
Are they away?

1094
01:36:28,615 --> 01:36:31,576
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1095
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:35,080
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1096
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,834
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1097
01:36:38,917 --> 01:36:40,585
This had better work.

1098
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:43,630
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1099
01:36:43,714 --> 01:36:46,758
You know,
sometimes I amaze even myself.

1100
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:49,219
That doesn't sound too hard.

1101
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:53,307
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1102
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,184
- Easy? You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1103
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:57,686
Not this ship, sister.

1104
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:01,523
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1105
01:37:01,773 --> 01:37:04,026
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1106
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:07,279
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1107
01:37:07,362 --> 01:37:10,657
I only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.

1108
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:14,119
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1109
01:37:14,202 --> 01:37:15,912
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution,

1110
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:17,706
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1111
01:37:17,789 --> 01:37:20,542
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1112
01:37:20,792 --> 01:37:22,836
You needn't worry about your reward.

1113
01:37:22,919 --> 01:37:25,839
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1114
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:30,927
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1115
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:34,264
I wonder if he really cares
about anything or anybody.

1116
01:37:35,515 --> 01:37:37,017
I care.

1117
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:45,108
So...

1118
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,402
What do you think of her, Han?

1119
01:37:47,486 --> 01:37:49,071
I'm trying not to, kid.

1120
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:51,198
Good.

1121
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:57,454
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1122
01:38:00,123 --> 01:38:02,709
What do you think? You think
a princess and a guy like me...

1123
01:38:02,793 --> 01:38:03,794
No.

1124
01:38:51,216 --> 01:38:54,261
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1125
01:38:54,344 --> 01:38:56,263
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.

1126
01:38:56,346 --> 01:38:59,349
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1127
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:01,435
It's our only hope.

1128
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:23,540
Yes.

1129
01:39:23,623 --> 01:39:25,250
<i>We're approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

1130
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:27,669
<i>The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.</i>

1131
01:39:27,752 --> 01:39:29,754
<i>We are preparing to orbit the planet.</i>

1132
01:39:38,763 --> 01:39:40,849
The battle station is heavily shielded

1133
01:39:40,932 --> 01:39:44,394
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1134
01:39:45,103 --> 01:39:49,191
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1135
01:39:49,816 --> 01:39:54,488
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1136
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:57,365
Pardon me for asking, sir,

1137
01:39:57,449 --> 01:40:00,076
but what good are snub fighters
against that?

1138
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:04,748
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat

1139
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:07,501
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1140
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:10,962
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia

1141
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:14,132
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1142
01:40:14,966 --> 01:40:16,968
The approach will not be easy.

1143
01:40:17,594 --> 01:40:20,180
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench

1144
01:40:20,263 --> 01:40:22,891
and skim the surface to this point.

1145
01:40:23,725 --> 01:40:26,478
The target area is only two meters wide.

1146
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:30,232
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1147
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:34,653
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1148
01:40:34,736 --> 01:40:37,489
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction

1149
01:40:37,572 --> 01:40:39,783
which should destroy the station.

1150
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:43,411
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1151
01:40:43,495 --> 01:40:46,665
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1152
01:40:47,165 --> 01:40:48,917
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1153
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,210
But it's not impossible.

1154
01:40:50,293 --> 01:40:52,796
I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1155
01:40:52,879 --> 01:40:55,298
They're not much bigger
than two meters.

1156
01:40:55,382 --> 01:40:58,552
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1157
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:09,396
<i>Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.</i>

1158
01:41:10,063 --> 01:41:13,775
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1159
01:41:14,025 --> 01:41:16,486
This will be a day long remembered.

1160
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,572
It has seen the end of Kenobi

1161
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:21,700
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1162
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:30,250
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1163
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:33,128
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

1164
01:41:35,714 --> 01:41:38,842
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1165
01:41:38,925 --> 01:41:40,927
That's right. Yeah.

1166
01:41:42,012 --> 01:41:44,639
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1167
01:41:44,723 --> 01:41:46,891
Even if I didn't,
you don't think I'd be fool enough

1168
01:41:46,975 --> 01:41:49,185
to stick around here, do ya?

1169
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:50,604
Why don't you come with us?

1170
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:52,647
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1171
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:55,609
Come on.
Why don't you take a look around?

1172
01:41:55,692 --> 01:41:58,361
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1173
01:41:58,445 --> 01:42:01,573
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1174
01:42:01,865 --> 01:42:04,034
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1175
01:42:04,242 --> 01:42:07,078
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1176
01:42:07,162 --> 01:42:09,748
It's more like suicide.

1177
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:14,419
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1178
01:42:14,502 --> 01:42:17,172
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1179
01:42:17,547 --> 01:42:18,590
Hey, Luke.

1180
01:42:21,926 --> 01:42:24,304
May the Force be with you.

1181
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:34,439
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1182
01:42:38,526 --> 01:42:40,904
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1183
01:42:42,072 --> 01:42:44,032
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1184
01:42:49,537 --> 01:42:52,082
- What's wrong?
- Oh, it's Han.

1185
01:42:52,165 --> 01:42:54,668
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1186
01:42:54,751 --> 01:42:58,296
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1187
01:42:59,297 --> 01:43:02,092
I only wish Ben were here.

1188
01:43:09,766 --> 01:43:12,686
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1189
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:14,688
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1190
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:16,439
Hey, Luke!

1191
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:19,734
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1192
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:21,903
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1193
01:43:21,986 --> 01:43:24,531
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1194
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:27,575
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1195
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:31,496
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1196
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:34,624
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1197
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:38,628
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1198
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:41,464
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1199
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:44,551
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1200
01:43:45,051 --> 01:43:46,052
<i>Stand clear.</i>

1201
01:43:47,429 --> 01:43:50,348
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1202
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:53,601
Not on your life. That little droid
and I have been through a lot.

1203
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:54,728
You okay, R2?

1204
01:43:56,354 --> 01:43:57,772
Good.

1205
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:02,152
<i>Gold squadron,
begin takeoff procedure.</i>

1206
01:44:02,235 --> 01:44:05,238
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1207
01:44:06,906 --> 01:44:09,117
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1208
01:44:57,916 --> 01:45:00,919
<i>Luke,
the Force will be with you.</i>

1209
01:45:12,722 --> 01:45:16,017
<i>Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.</i>

1210
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:19,270
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1211
01:45:32,367 --> 01:45:34,619
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1212
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:36,955
<i>- Red Seven standing by.</i>
- Red Three standing by.

1213
01:45:37,038 --> 01:45:39,791
- Red Six standing by.
<i>- Red Nine standing by.</i>

1214
01:45:39,874 --> 01:45:41,918
- Red Two standing by.
<i>- Red 11 standing by.</i>

1215
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:43,962
Red Five standing by.

1216
01:45:45,296 --> 01:45:47,215
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1217
01:45:51,469 --> 01:45:53,471
<i>We're passing
through the magnetic field.</i>

1218
01:45:53,555 --> 01:45:56,349
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

1219
01:45:56,432 --> 01:45:57,892
<i>Double front.</i>

1220
01:46:00,895 --> 01:46:02,397
Look at the size of that thing.

1221
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,316
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1222
01:46:08,778 --> 01:46:11,531
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1223
01:46:11,614 --> 01:46:14,492
<i>- I copy, Gold Leader.</i>
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1224
01:46:14,576 --> 01:46:18,037
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1225
01:46:32,468 --> 01:46:35,763
<i>- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.</i>

1226
01:46:43,187 --> 01:46:44,731
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1227
01:46:49,277 --> 01:46:50,278
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1228
01:46:52,196 --> 01:46:54,282
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1229
01:47:00,246 --> 01:47:01,956
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader,

1230
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,292
but they're so small
they're evading our turbo lasers.

1231
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:06,169
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1232
01:47:06,252 --> 01:47:08,379
Get the crews to their fighters.

1233
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:12,800
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire

1234
01:47:12,884 --> 01:47:15,136
coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.

1235
01:47:15,219 --> 01:47:16,220
I'm on it.

1236
01:47:16,304 --> 01:47:19,724
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1237
01:47:26,064 --> 01:47:27,857
I've got a problem here.

1238
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:29,359
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1239
01:47:29,442 --> 01:47:31,611
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1240
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:39,410
<i>The rebel base will be in
firing range in seven minutes.</i>

1241
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:45,541
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1242
01:47:53,424 --> 01:47:55,051
Squad leaders,

1243
01:47:55,134 --> 01:47:57,261
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1244
01:47:57,345 --> 01:47:58,930
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1245
01:47:59,013 --> 01:48:00,723
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1246
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:03,017
- Pick up your visual scanning.
<i>- Here they come.</i>

1247
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:07,981
Watch it! You've got one on your tail.

1248
01:48:13,319 --> 01:48:14,404
I'm hit!

1249
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:18,199
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1250
01:48:20,201 --> 01:48:21,953
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1251
01:48:23,871 --> 01:48:25,957
I'll be right there.

1252
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:41,305
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1253
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:47,854
<i>- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.</i>

1254
01:48:47,937 --> 01:48:50,148
<i>Watch your back!
Fighters above you, coming in.</i>

1255
01:48:56,529 --> 01:48:59,282
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1256
01:48:59,365 --> 01:49:01,534
<i>Hang on back there.</i>

1257
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,287
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1258
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:06,831
<i>There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1259
01:49:07,206 --> 01:49:08,666
I can't shake him.

1260
01:49:12,336 --> 01:49:13,880
I'm on him, Luke.

1261
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:18,718
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1262
01:49:25,975 --> 01:49:28,519
- Thanks, Wedge.
<i>- Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1263
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:31,731
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.

1264
01:49:33,566 --> 01:49:35,943
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.</i>

1265
01:49:38,362 --> 01:49:40,656
Stay in attack formation.

1266
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,493
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1267
01:49:49,457 --> 01:49:55,922
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1268
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:02,386
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1269
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:05,723
<i>Say about 20 guns, some on
the surface, some on the towers.</i>

1270
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:08,643
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1271
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,815
Switch to targeting computer.

1272
01:50:16,275 --> 01:50:18,277
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1273
01:50:20,613 --> 01:50:22,782
The guns. They've stopped.

1274
01:50:24,492 --> 01:50:27,245
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1275
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:29,580
They're coming in. Three marks at 210.

1276
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:33,751
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1277
01:50:33,835 --> 01:50:35,128
Yes, sir.

1278
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,103
- It's no good. I can't maneuver.
- Stay on target.

1279
01:50:52,186 --> 01:50:54,105
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1280
01:50:55,857 --> 01:50:56,858
Loosen up!

1281
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:02,697
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1282
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:05,158
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1283
01:51:11,497 --> 01:51:14,125
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1284
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:16,127
Should I have your ship standing by?

1285
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:19,088
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1286
01:51:19,172 --> 01:51:21,674
I think you overestimate their chances.

1287
01:51:22,341 --> 01:51:24,385
<i>Rebel base,
three minutes and closing.</i>

1288
01:51:25,386 --> 01:51:27,013
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1289
01:51:27,096 --> 01:51:28,806
<i>Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.</i>

1290
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,641
<i>This is Red Two
flying toward you.</i>

1291
01:51:30,725 --> 01:51:32,685
<i>Red Three standing by.</i>

1292
01:51:32,768 --> 01:51:34,478
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1293
01:51:34,562 --> 01:51:37,231
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1294
01:51:37,315 --> 01:51:39,942
<i>Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.</i>

1295
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:43,362
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1296
01:51:51,996 --> 01:51:53,247
This is it.

1297
01:51:57,585 --> 01:51:59,086
We should be able to see it by now.

1298
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:03,174
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1299
01:52:04,926 --> 01:52:07,345
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1300
01:52:07,428 --> 01:52:10,431
- No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.

1301
01:52:11,974 --> 01:52:13,059
I'm in range.

1302
01:52:14,352 --> 01:52:15,353
Target's coming up.

1303
01:52:18,648 --> 01:52:20,775
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1304
01:52:21,609 --> 01:52:23,236
Close up formation.

1305
01:52:24,987 --> 01:52:26,572
Almost there.

1306
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:39,085
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1307
01:52:40,461 --> 01:52:42,129
I can't hold them.

1308
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:51,138
It's away!

1309
01:52:55,601 --> 01:52:57,228
<i>- It's a hit!
- Negative.</i>

1310
01:52:57,311 --> 01:52:59,397
Negative. It didn't go in.

1311
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,149
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1312
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:09,699
<i>Red Leader, we're right above you.</i>

1313
01:53:09,782 --> 01:53:12,535
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

1314
01:53:12,618 --> 01:53:15,579
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1315
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:18,624
Get set up for your attack run.

1316
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:34,598
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1317
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:36,892
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.</i>

1318
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:40,354
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.

1319
01:53:40,438 --> 01:53:41,439
Right with you, boss.

1320
01:53:42,481 --> 01:53:44,942
Luke, at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1321
01:53:45,026 --> 01:53:47,028
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1322
01:53:54,368 --> 01:53:56,662
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1323
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:59,457
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.</i>

1324
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:01,125
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1325
01:54:04,337 --> 01:54:06,339
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1326
01:54:06,422 --> 01:54:07,715
What about that tower?

1327
01:54:07,798 --> 01:54:10,217
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1328
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:20,227
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1329
01:54:29,403 --> 01:54:31,197
Fighters coming in .3.

1330
01:54:40,122 --> 01:54:42,625
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
<i>- Get clear, Wedge.</i>

1331
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:44,293
You can't do any more good back there.

1332
01:54:44,377 --> 01:54:45,628
Sorry.

1333
01:54:46,253 --> 01:54:48,214
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1334
01:54:51,175 --> 01:54:53,386
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1335
01:54:57,556 --> 01:54:59,016
R2, try and increase the power.

1336
01:55:05,648 --> 01:55:06,899
<i>Hurry up, Luke. Quick.</i>

1337
01:55:07,817 --> 01:55:08,943
Quick.

1338
01:55:15,991 --> 01:55:18,536
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1339
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:19,620
I'm on the leader.

1340
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:24,708
Hang on, R2.

1341
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:43,102
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1342
01:55:45,896 --> 01:55:47,898
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1343
01:55:49,567 --> 01:55:51,777
The Force is strong with this one.

1344
01:55:51,861 --> 01:55:53,821
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1345
01:55:58,993 --> 01:56:00,828
<i>His computer's off</i>

1346
01:56:00,911 --> 01:56:03,497
<i>Luke, you switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?</i>

1347
01:56:03,581 --> 01:56:06,250
<i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>

1348
01:56:18,971 --> 01:56:20,264
<i>I've lost R2.</i>

1349
01:56:21,682 --> 01:56:23,934
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1350
01:56:24,018 --> 01:56:26,353
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1351
01:56:27,396 --> 01:56:29,023
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1352
01:56:29,106 --> 01:56:31,025
You may fire when ready.

1353
01:56:31,734 --> 01:56:33,194
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1354
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:48,626
I have you now.

1355
01:56:51,045 --> 01:56:52,213
What?

1356
01:56:52,296 --> 01:56:53,464
Ya-hoo!

1357
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:55,883
Look out.

1358
01:57:02,515 --> 01:57:05,351
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1359
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:13,817
<i>Stand by.</i>

1360
01:57:17,196 --> 01:57:18,906
<i>Stand by.</i>

1361
01:57:28,707 --> 01:57:30,668
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1362
01:57:32,044 --> 01:57:36,549
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1363
01:57:56,193 --> 01:57:57,486
- Luke!
- Leia!

1364
01:58:00,573 --> 01:58:01,824
- Hey!
- Hey!

1365
01:58:01,907 --> 01:58:03,784
I just knew you'd come back.
I just knew it!

1366
01:58:03,867 --> 01:58:06,579
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1367
01:58:06,662 --> 01:58:09,039
I knew there was more to you
than money.

1368
01:58:09,373 --> 01:58:10,416
Oh, no.

1369
01:58:10,499 --> 01:58:12,960
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1370
01:58:13,627 --> 01:58:16,505
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1371
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:19,842
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1372
01:58:19,925 --> 01:58:22,845
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1373
01:58:22,928 --> 01:58:24,930
He'll be all right.
