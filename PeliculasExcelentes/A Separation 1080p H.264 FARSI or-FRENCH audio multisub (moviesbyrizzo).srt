19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,265
What you are saying
are not good reasons for a divorce.

20
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,018
- If there is something else let me know.
- Like what?

21
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:45,355
Like if he is an addict, beats you
or does not give you an allowance.

22
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,859
Nothing like that.
He is a good, decent person.

23
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,944
Then why do you want a divorce?

24
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,696
He won't come with me.

25
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,950
If he does I'll cancel my request for a divorce.

26
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,454
- Will you come?
- No, I won't.

27
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,373
- Why not, Your Honor?
- You know why.

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,959
No, I don't. Please explain again why.

29
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,962
Let her explain why we should
move abroad in these circumstances.

30
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,465
- You give me one reason to stay.
- I'll give you a thousand.

31
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,302
- Just one.
- My father. I can't leave him.

32
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,470
But you can leave your wife?

33
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,222
- When did I leave you?
- You brought me here.

34
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,307
You filed for a divorce.

35
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,435
When you tell your wife and child to leave,
isn't that leaving them?

36
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,979
Your Honor, didn't he just say
leave if you want?

37
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,439
Yes, and I'll say it again.

38
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,067
If you don't want to stay
I can't keep you by force.

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
Keep your voice down. Calm down.

40
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,405
One day you came to live with me.
Today you don't.

41
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,158
- When you prefer...
- What does "you prefer" mean?

42
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,910
This was something we both started.

43
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,498
Your Honor, after 18 months of running
around and expenses, we got our visa.

44
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,335
It has been six months now
and it will expire in 40 days.

45
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,170
Why should we lose this opportunity?

46
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,841
You don't want to lose this opportunity,
then make a suggestion.

47
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,009
You know my situation.

48
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,136
Tell us what to do, Your Honor.

49
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,765
- His father is his excuse...
- He is not my excuse. He's the reason.

50
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,684
- Let me speak.
- Calm down.

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,895
His father has Alzheimer's.
He doesn't even know that he's his son.

52
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:11,400
- What difference does it make to him?
- Why are you saying that?

53
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,402
Does he even realize you are his son?

54
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,445
I know he is my father.

55
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,740
Your daughter or her future is
not important to you?

56
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,619
Who said anything about our daughter?
Why do you think only you care?

57
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,373
So the children living in this country
don't have a future?

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,793
As a mother, I'd rather she didn't grow up
in these circumstances.

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,212
What circumstances?

60
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:38,301
Is she better off here with both her parents
or there without a father?

61
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,138
That's why I want him to come.

62
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,306
I can't leave.

63
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,767
How many times do I have to say it?

64
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,312
He can't come. So what happens to me?

65
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,648
Nothing. Go back to your life.

66
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,068
If I could I wouldn't file for a divorce.

67
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,947
Consent has to be mutual.

68
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,991
He just gave his.

69
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,492
What circumstances?

70
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,413
If she prefers to leave her family
to go live abroad, yes, I do.

71
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,415
He agrees.

72
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,292
What about my daughter?

73
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,670
You have to agree on everything.
How old is your daughter?

74
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,922
Eleven in two weeks.

75
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,134
She can't leave
without her father's permission.

76
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,011
He won't give permission.

77
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,971
That's between you two.

78
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,974
Please sign here and good day.

79
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,934
Your Honor, I came here
for you to solve my problem.

80
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,519
Please sign here.

81
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,604
You, too.

82
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,315
- Where should I sign?
- Here.

83
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,610
He can have everything,
I just want my daughter.

84
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,530
Our daughter is attached to me.
She doesn't even want to go with you.

85
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,033
- She doesn't know better.
- Why not?

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,494
She is 11 years old.

87
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,622
Please sign here
and don't take the court's time.

88
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,042
- No one knows better except you.
- No, you're the one who knows better.

89
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,296
Your Honor, what should I do?
I only have 40 days.

90
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,381
You can't file for a divorce
over every little problem.

91
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,883
A little problem?

92
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,219
My problem is not little.

93
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,388
It is my daughter.

94
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,642
She is his daughter, too. He has rights, too.

95
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,394
My finding is that your problem is
a small problem.

96
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,647
Please sign here and good day.

97
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:23,031
A Separation

98
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,534
Producer, Writer, Director
Asghar Farhadi

99
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,607
You said the second floor.

100
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,276
This is the second floor.

101
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
Then what's that?

102
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,364
That's the ground floor, that's the first.
This is the second.

103
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,117
The price we gave was for two floors.

104
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,244
But the buyer will pay you.

105
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,704
Only for two floors.

106
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,456
I don't understand what you're saying.

107
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,000
Call the buyer.

108
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,794
This is three floors.

109
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,340
I'll pay for one floor. Let me pass.

110
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,130
Excuse me, ma'am?

111
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,262
Go tell your dad they want to leave.

112
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,597
Why don't you tell him?

113
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,350
What did I say?

114
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,893
Didn't we agree?

115
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm studying.

116
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,575
Hello.

117
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,660
Hello, ma'am.

118
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,121
I'll be right there.

119
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,377
I don't know how much you know.

120
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,006
Excuse me, ma'am?

121
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,175
There is some housework, too,

122
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,221
but the main work is giving him
his medication on time,

123
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,892
keeping him away from the stove,
from leaving the house.

124
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,062
Termeh, get your laundry.

125
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:04,150
You have to be here at 7:30
so I can go to work.

126
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,695
7:30 is too early.

127
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,240
I'll have to leave my house at 5:00
to get here by then.

128
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,866
Can you make it by 8:00?

129
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,660
I don't know.

130
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,830
8:00 is good too.

131
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,207
Ring the upstairs bell.

132
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,544
I'll leave the house keys up here.

133
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,753
- Okay?
- Yes.

134
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,006
Can you pay us, please?

135
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,924
What's the pay per month?

136
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,384
She'll be right there.

137
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,844
300,000 a month.

138
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,512
That's too little.

139
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,347
No, that's the rate.

140
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,224
Ask around. The commute is far.

141
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,351
Several bus lines.

142
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,061
It's what I can afford.

143
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,565
If you agree you can start tomorrow.

144
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,941
Can I let you know tomorrow?

145
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,110
They might need this, too.

146
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,403
I don't have change.

147
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,738
You have till the afternoon.

148
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,074
There is someone else
I can hire if you can't come.

149
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,242
Okay.

150
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,620
Termeh! Your laundry!

151
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,807
Aren't you coming?

152
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,026
- Why are you taking your books?
- I want them.

153
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,321
All these for just two weeks?

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,499
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

155
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,506
They might need this, too.

156
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,591
Should I go ask her?

157
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,345
You want to make me look bad?

158
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,602
- Simin, where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

159
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,648
Just to the corner. I'll be right back.

160
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,694
I'll come back.

161
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,447
I have an appointment.

162
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,157
<i>Four.</i>

163
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,617
Why four?

164
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,036
'Cause it has faded.

165
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:24,457
She must've used it the most.

166
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,961
Four it is.

167
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,881
From now on we'll set everything on four.

168
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,384
She is really leaving.

169
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,386
She'll be back.

170
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,470
Termeh!

171
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,557
Come stay with your grandfather.

172
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,527
Dad?

173
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,905
Termeh, honey, go to your room.

174
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,075
Dad, ge'! UP-

175
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,910
Let go of her hand.

176
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,081
Get up. I want to take you to the bathroom.

177
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,881
Where are you taking me?

178
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,259
The bathroom and then to get the paper.

179
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,928
Darling, I said go to your room...

180
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,434
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

181
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,273
Don't put your hand there.

182
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,427
I'm taking this CD.

183
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,263
Take whichever you want.

184
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,890
No, just this one.

185
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:23,785
Bye.

186
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,321
I thought you lived there, too.

187
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,865
No, I've moved to my mom's.

188
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,995
This is a bit difficult.

189
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,872
No, you can trust him.

190
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,875
Don't worry about these things.

191
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,712
Besides, he won't be around.

192
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:20,717
He leaves early and comes back
when you leave.

193
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,055
Do bring your daughter.
She'll keep my daughter company

194
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,558
and I'll feel better.

195
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,190
Tell your decision to your sister-in-law.

196
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,300
Where are you going?

197
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,735
What's this?

198
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,489
Oxygen.

199
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,116
What's oxygen?

200
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,076
Get away. You'll wake him.

201
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,192
I can't hear anything.

202
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,620
What is it doing?

203
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,384
Hello.

204
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,470
Where do you want to go?

205
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,513
- The paper.
- What?

206
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,682
I want the paper.

207
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,643
The paper is in your room.

208
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,063
Come, I'll take you to your room.

209
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,572
I'll take you to your room and get your meal.

210
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,415
Mommy,

211
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,834
he's peed in his pants.

212
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,884
Sit on the bed.

213
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,932
What's that?

214
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,606
What are you doing here?

215
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,777
Go get your shoes.
You can see the floor is soiled.

216
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,740
He'd say when he needed to go...

217
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,620
Take him to the bathroom...

218
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,752
I can't come till 12:00. I have class.

219
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,215
Call my husband.

220
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,092
Do you have his number?

221
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,469
Write it down.

222
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,430
There's a pen by the phone.

223
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,404
If I bring you some pants can you change?

224
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,116
Your clothes, can you change them?

225
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,326
Simin?

226
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,078
Can you wash yourself?

227
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,162
Simin?

228
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,592
Here are your clothes.

229
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,597
Wash yourself and put them on.

230
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,766
I put your towel here.

231
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,852
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

232
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,771
Clean yourself up.

233
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,358
Put your pants in there.

234
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,865
Will you manage?

235
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,670
Your pants.

236
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,881
Take them off.

237
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,717
Wear the ones I gave you.

238
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,177
Okay?

239
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,352
Simin...

240
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,926
Hello. I had a religious question.

241
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,011
I am working in a house.

242
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,349
There is an old man
I am supposed to care for.

243
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,017
I wanted to ask...

244
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,020
Pardon me, but he has wet his pants.

245
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,858
I wanted to know if I change him,
will it count as a sin?

246
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,695
No one is here.

247
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:02,284
He's 70 or 80 years old and he's senile...

248
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,960
The urgency is that the poor guy has been
sitting like this for half an hour.

249
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,670
Loan...

250
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,390
I won't tell Dad.

251
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,476
My angel.

252
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,647
Get up.

253
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,609
Open your legs.

254
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,739
Okay, now take off your pants.

255
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
Card!

256
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,520
Everyone's staring.

257
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,189
Let them.

258
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,399
- How much?
-37.5.

259
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,651
- Any change?
- He didn't give it.

260
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,154
- You asked?
- It's his tip.

261
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,072
Tip? Sir, wait one sec.

262
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,160
A tip is for when he pumps the gas. Go get it.

263
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,703
- Dad!
- Quick!

264
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,206
Wait.

265
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,230
Here.

266
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,107
Keep it.

267
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,275
Really?

268
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,668
Hello.

269
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,961
- Any change?
- He didn't give it.

270
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,128
Hello.

271
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,258
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

272
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,469
I'll get my books.

273
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,471
And your test results.

274
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,807
- How are you, Ms. Qahraei?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

275
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,767
Fine, thanks.

276
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,310
Sorry we're late.

277
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,229
It's okay. How's your wife?

278
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,898
- Good, thank you.
- We'll get started.

279
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,277
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

280
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,654
How are you, Dad?

281
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,282
- Hi, young lady.
- Hello.

282
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,576
Here's the paper.

283
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,748
Did you read the paper for him
or did he read it for you?

284
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,626
Son...

285
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,296
Ali is married.

286
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,506
- Who's Ali?
- Ali.

287
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,009
Yeah, Ali's married. Termeh, hurry.

288
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,761
His oxygen valve wasn't shut.

289
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,097
He must've opened it.

290
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,309
From tomorrow tighten it a bit more
so he can't open it.

291
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,518
- Hi, young lady.
- Hello.

292
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,147
I can't come anymore.

293
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,191
Didn't we say every day?

294
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,860
The commute is too much.

295
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,322
I turned someone else away. It's 4:00.

296
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,867
How can I find someone now
for tomorrow morning?

297
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,493
It's too much work.

298
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,955
Really I can't. The work is heavy, I can't.

299
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,501
Come to the other room, please.

300
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,380
- Somayeh, where's your scarf?
- It's here.

301
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,177
Maybe you're tired 'cause it's your first day.

302
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,553
No.

303
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,057
You were here for a few minutes. You saw.

304
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,060
Somayeh, come get your bag.

305
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,521
Can you please give me that number?

306
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,652
They also do ultrasounds.

307
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,154
It moved a lot today.

308
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,697
Then it's a boy.

309
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,909
It was kicking in Mommy's tummy.

310
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,329
'Cause he wants to come out...

311
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,039
To play with me.

312
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,381
Can you write it in here, please?

313
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,884
Tell them Qahraei sent you.

314
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,886
They know me.

315
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,932
- Is it a man or a woman?
- A woman.

316
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,850
Call first.

317
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,436
You had to tell me yesterday.

318
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,398
How can I leave him
at home alone tomorrow?

319
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,902
- Where does your mom keep the tea?
- I don't know.

320
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,738
You should've told me I'd have to clean him.

321
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,115
Clean him?

322
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,701
He soiled his pants today.

323
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,208
It's not right for me to clean him.

324
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,259
Please pay me for today so I can go.

325
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,147
He always said when he had to go.

326
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:29,069
There are companies you can call
for a male helper.

327
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,656
I can't just let anyone into my home.

328
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,325
How can I leave him
at home alone tomorrow?

329
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,995
Count it, please.

330
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,955
Sorry, but it's a religious issue.

331
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,165
It's okay.

332
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,292
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

333
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,460
Bye.

334
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,794
Good bye.

335
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,013
Yes?

336
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,931
I wanted to know if it is okay for me

337
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,809
to give your number to my husband

338
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,936
and tell him I got it out of the paper.

339
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,314
For the housework and your father.

340
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,276
Give him the job description
and if he agrees tell him to come...

341
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,487
I don't want to tell him I know you.

342
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,155
I didn't tell him I was coming here.

343
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,118
Then tell him to call me
or tell him to come here tonight.

344
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,454
It's late for tonight.

345
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,206
I'll come tomorrow.

346
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,209
Just don't give the job to anyone else.

347
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,461
You'll see with him for the money.

348
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,839
That's not a problem. Tell him to call me.
I will arrange to meet him.

349
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,467
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

350
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,177
And thank you.

351
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,189
Mr. Lavasani?

352
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,150
Go ahead.

353
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,713
Hello. I am Samadi.

354
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,757
- I called about the job.
- Yes, how are you?

355
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:14,925
Sorry I'm late.

356
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,511
It's okay. Where did you work before?

357
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,388
I was a cobbler.

358
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,723
And you're okay with cleaning him?

359
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,058
With what?

360
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,561
Since yesterday he's been soiling himself.

361
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,064
I'll treat him like my own father.

362
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,609
But you'll be alone with him
and you have to really watch him.

363
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,944
Your wife won't be there?

364
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,363
No, I am single for now.

365
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,077
Excuse me but isn't 300,000
too little for this work?

366
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,246
How much did you have in mind?

367
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,248
Maybe if you could pay 400,000...

368
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,083
I really can't pay that.

369
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,918
I'll come for a few days.

370
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,088
If you like my work,
add something to the 300,000.

371
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,465
I'll treat him like my own father.

372
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,967
I can even start today.

373
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,096
No, there's someone there today.
Start tomorrow and bring an ID.

374
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,723
Like what?

375
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,893
Any legal ID will do.

376
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,853
Pious?

377
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,521
Worshipper.

378
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,939
Barren?

379
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,274
<i>Sandbar .</i>

380
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,859
Desert!

381
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,943
Desert.

382
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,153
Insurrection?

383
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,654
Rebellion.

384
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,407
Doorbell?

385
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,950
- Razieh.
- No!

386
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,202
Her husband.

387
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,328
Yes.

388
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,919
Give the Persian version of
the following words...

389
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,129
-"Maquette"?
- Nemunak.

390
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,757
<i>-"Compote"?
- Khoshaab.</i>

391
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,010
<i>-"Guarantee"?
- Tazmin, zemanat.</i>

392
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,970
That's Arabic, not Persian.

393
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,014
That's what my teacher said.

394
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,766
Don't give me that.

395
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,312
What's wrong is wrong,
no matter who says what.

396
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,317
- For "guarantee" write...
- She'll deduct points.

397
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,526
That's okay, let her.

398
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,488
<i>Write poshtvaneh.</i>

399
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,657
<i>Poshtvaneh.</i>

400
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,541
Hello.

401
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,844
What happened?
Your husband was supposed to come today.

402
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,513
Sorry, he couldn't make it.

403
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,807
What about tomorrow?

404
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,393
I don't know. If he doesn't I'll come.

405
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,312
I hope he won't change his mind every day.

406
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,564
No, poor guy wanted to come.

407
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,986
Last night, one of his creditors came
with an officer and took him away.

408
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,072
Yes, but if something comes up
and he can't make it,

409
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,657
I need to know in advance.

410
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,826
No, he will definitely come.

411
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,706
I'll go see the creditor and beg him

412
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,416
to release him.

413
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,210
Please lock the door behind me.

414
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,586
Good bye.

415
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,627
Hi.

416
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,888
Don't step on it. It is dirty.

417
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,309
Go take the garbage out.

418
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,313
Can you?

419
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,774
Yes.

420
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,629
Where will I get you a clean dress?

421
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,299
Take it off!

422
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,510
Take it off!

423
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,182
Mommy,

424
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,142
he's not in his room.

425
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,603
- What?
- He's not in his room.

426
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,981
Go look in the bathroom.

427
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,484
Like that.

428
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,111
Block the ball. Okay?

429
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,589
Give me five.

430
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,761
- Grandpa, whose side are you on?
- He's the manager.

431
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:41,770
Did you see that?

432
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,586
What's wrong?

433
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
Sit here.

434
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,976
You Okay?

435
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,829
Where've you been?

436
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:44,040
Poor thing has been waiting for half an hour.

437
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,334
It's a long commute.

438
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,544
Hello.

439
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,382
Also, take the garbage outwith the bin.

440
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,385
The bags tear and dirty the stairs.

441
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:59,055
Yesterday I got dizzy.
I dropped the bag and it tore.

442
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,682
I'll mop the stairs.

443
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,560
Go in.

444
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,186
Let us in.

445
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,694
Let me close the door.

446
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,225
- Mrs...
- She's not there?

447
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,896
- What's her kid's name?
- Somayeh.

448
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,776
Don't sit there. It's wet.

449
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,736
Somayeh!

450
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,031
Somayeh!

451
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,753
Mrs. Kalani!

452
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,047
Knock.

453
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,717
Grandpa!

454
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,761
Mrs. Kalani!

455
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,889
Yes.

456
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,766
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

457
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,227
Did you see the lady that works for us?

458
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,270
She was mopping the stairs.

459
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,648
- When?
- Before noon.

460
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,651
- She's not there?
- No. Thanks.

461
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,904
Wait here. I'll get the keys from the car.

462
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,128
What's wrong?

463
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,338
Dad?

464
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,154
Get his feet.

465
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,997
Dad, get up, look at Termeh.

466
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,457
Dad!

467
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,514
He's breathing.

468
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,849
Don't worry.

469
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,572
Does your arm hurt?
Help me take his shirt off.

470
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,076
Move your arm.

471
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,412
Does it hurt?

472
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,417
Take a step.

473
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,253
Walk.

474
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,714
Let's get the paper, Dad.

475
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,549
Move your leg.

476
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,764
Does it hurt? Let me see what's happened.

477
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,683
Who did this to you?

478
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,355
I want to see if your legs are okay.

479
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,401
Let me... Honey, go to your room.

480
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,238
- Has something happened?
- No. Go out.

481
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,908
She's gone, Dad.

482
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,577
Let me see your legs.

483
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,248
Take them off.

484
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,561
Scum!

485
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,900
- Honey, did you take money from the drawer?
- No.

486
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,735
Okay, go to the kitchen.

487
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,659
I told you to go to the kitchen.

488
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,245
You saw that nothing happened.

489
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,832
Go on... Close the door.

490
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,156
Hello.

491
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,118
Come here.

492
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,496
Mommy, I'm thirsty.

493
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,672
Watch him.

494
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,134
Hello.

495
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,345
Where were you?

496
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,850
Something came up. I had to go out.

497
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,353
You had no right to go.

498
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,731
- He was asleep.
- So you lock the door and leave?

499
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,693
I was gone briefly.

500
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,738
Briefly? You're lying.

501
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,074
He was dying when I got here!

502
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,493
He always naps at this time so I...

503
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,912
So you do this every day?

504
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,539
Look the door and run your errands?

505
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,541
No. I swear to God, today I had to.

506
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,711
- Why did you tie his hand?
- Go wait outside.

507
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,216
Was this our agreement?

508
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,592
I had to go.

509
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,011
I had no choice.

510
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,554
Thanks a lot!

511
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,932
You tie his hand every day

512
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,725
and go do your own stuff.

513
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,893
Is he okay?

514
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,562
Thanks a lot!

515
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,399
Wait outside, sweetie.

516
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,567
Go check on Grandpa.

517
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,780
Why did you go in that room?

518
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,156
Which room?

519
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,743
Which room?
The one you took the money from.

520
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,454
I took money from that room?

521
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,915
- Don't I pay you?
- I took money?

522
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,125
You didn't take it?

523
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,419
I swear I didn't take any money.

524
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,586
Get out.

525
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,257
Sir, I'm swearing on our martyrs.

526
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,595
You say I took money.

527
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,933
Here, look in my bag.
If I took it, it should be here.

528
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,268
Here, take this.

529
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,937
Give me my bag.

530
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,441
I am swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't go there.

531
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,942
Here's my bag.

532
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,652
What are you doing?

533
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,903
I didn't go there.

534
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,449
I'm swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't step into that room.

535
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,617
- Get out.
- You're saying...

536
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,121
What did I do? Don't touch me!

537
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,623
I won't touch you. Get out.

538
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,754
I won't leave till I get what I deserve!

539
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,631
What you deserve is for me to kick you out.

540
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,760
Because of her I won't.

541
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,764
Get out!
I'm doing you a favor by throwing you out.

542
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,516
Tell me what's happened to him.

543
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,685
It's my house, I want you out.

544
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,313
Fine, but it's not right.

545
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,774
- It displeases God.
- Out!

546
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,318
That's it.

547
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,655
Dad.

548
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,960
Open the door. It's me. I want to come in...

549
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,672
This is how you watch him?

550
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,053
Open the door.

551
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,556
Go check what's behind you.

552
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,183
Have a look.

553
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,811
Open the door!

554
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,188
It's no use shouting.

555
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,858
This is why I asked you to watch him.

556
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,653
Maybe his leg hurts and he can't get up.

557
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,572
Grandpa...

558
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,077
Dad, open the door.

559
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,996
Open the door, please.

560
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,167
I'm going to push the door open.

561
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,879
It'll hit you, Dad. Move aside.

562
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,843
I'm going to push the door open.

563
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,390
Why do you do this to yourself?

564
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,571
Who told you to come in?

565
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,532
- What happened to him?
- Give me the key. Get out!

566
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,908
I didn't steal from you.

567
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,785
You are pissing me off!

568
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:23,828
I didn't.

569
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,707
- Don't give me that!
- I wouldn't be here now if I had.

570
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,875
Get out.

571
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,459
Pay me for today.

572
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,588
You already took your pay, didn't you?

573
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:38,426
Since 5:30 this morning
with my daughter... Somayeh!

574
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:39,927
Sir, wait!

575
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,429
Get out.

576
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:45,099
I swear I didn't steal.

577
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,767
Get out!

578
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:00,573
What happened?

579
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,746
What happened?

580
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,456
Sit.

581
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,506
What happened?

582
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,803
Mommy, be careful.

583
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,544
Tell her to work with you on your English.

584
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:37,837
Bye, Grandpa.

585
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,756
Dad, Termeh said bye.

586
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,594
Careful!

587
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,435
Okay.

588
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,605
What is it?

589
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,107
Mom says come in.

590
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,943
Tell her Grandpa's in the car.

591
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,361
She says it's important.

592
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,951
Not divorced yet and already ignoring us!

593
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,578
I'm busy.

594
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,081
People divorce their wives to get less busy.

595
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,126
Ma'am, these channels have too much static.

596
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,253
Okay, set the ones you can.

597
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,590
- Come and sit.
- Thank you. Simin...

598
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,929
Hi.

599
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,267
Where's Termeh?

600
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,269
In the car with dad.

601
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,104
Then bring him in, too.

602
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,939
No, he is tired.

603
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,399
It's his nap time.

604
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,277
What is it?

605
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,613
Did you have a fight with that woman?

606
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,907
Did she come see you?

607
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,158
Her sister-in-law called.

608
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,619
Shameless!

609
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:52,953
What did she do?

610
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,499
Tied the old man to the bed
and locked the door.

611
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,334
Went after her own errands.

612
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,337
If I'd gotten there 10 minutes later,
I would've lost him.

613
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,713
Is he okay?

614
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,006
He had fallen off the bed.

615
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,634
I don't know for how long he was like that.

616
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,052
Where had she gone?

617
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,136
How should I know?

618
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,971
She said you hit her.

619
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,556
I hit her?

620
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,601
- Nonsense.
- Then why is she in the hospital?

621
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,814
Hospital? Why?

622
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,024
You're asking me?

623
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,776
I just pushed her out of the house.

624
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,195
The sister-in-law called and told me off.

625
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:27,988
Saying what?

626
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,950
That if she dies,
her blood will be on your hands.

627
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:33,994
Stuff like that.

628
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:40,543
- She didn't say what happened?
- I hung up. She started cursing.

629
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:46,632
That's what you get
for hiring people off the streets.

630
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:51,053
Don't blame me.
I told you I only know her sister-in-law.

631
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,013
Did she say which hospital?

632
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,687
- Hello.
- Yes?

633
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:01,856
Hold, please.

634
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,901
A woman by the name of Razieh was
brought in tonight.

635
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:09,697
- What's her family name?
- I don't know. She was admitted earlier.

636
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,031
Why was she brought in?

637
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,993
- They just told us...
- That she was taken to hospital.

638
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,871
I'll call you back. Bye.

639
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:20,166
Her husband's last name is Samadi.

640
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,005
Razieh Asnaqi?

641
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,716
Is she in her thirties?

642
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,720
She had surgery. She's in post-op.

643
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,305
Why surgery?

644
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,599
She had a miscarriage.

645
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,604
Is she okay now?

646
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,938
Hello? Hold.

647
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,023
Yes.

648
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,942
Is her family here?

649
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,360
If they are, they are downstairs.

650
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,196
Thank you.

651
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,246
What did you do to her?

652
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,625
What did I do to her?

653
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,230
Why surgery?

654
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,610
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

655
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,945
Hello, ma'am.

656
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,321
How is she?

657
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:33,948
Who?

658
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,824
Your wife.

659
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,827
They took her to the ward.

660
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,622
Do you know her?

661
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,958
- I know her.
- My wife.

662
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,794
- They didn't have sandwiches.
- Hello.

663
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,927
Can we see her?

664
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,012
Where do you know her from?

665
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:01,308
Your sister introduced her to us
for housework.

666
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,102
Thanks a lot!

667
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,981
She was coming to your house to work?

668
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,816
She came for a few days.

669
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,486
Apparently you couldn't come
so she came in your place.

670
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,363
Come sit and eat something.

671
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,658
You mean she took care of your father?

672
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,618
Just for a few days.

673
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,495
Two or three days.

674
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,331
Why didn't you tell me this at the bank?

675
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,711
I thought she would tell you.

676
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,714
Why have you come here now?

677
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,799
To see if we can do something.

678
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:34,967
Do what?

679
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,636
Help. We were worried.

680
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,346
Did she fall?

681
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,474
Come with me. I'll explain.

682
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,853
I'll explain to you... Come with me.

683
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,522
I understand your situation.

684
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,692
You kill her child
and now you've come to do what?

685
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:52,985
I'm really sorry.

686
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,654
I'm sorry won't be a child to her.

687
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,364
Just tell me one thing.

688
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,991
I'll explain outside.

689
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,869
Wait! Why didn't you tell me that day?

690
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,079
I told you. I thought she...

691
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,918
You live alone in that house.

692
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,547
Let him go.

693
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,883
Calm down.

694
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,219
This is a hospital.

695
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,181
Don't!

696
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,349
Stop!

697
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,855
Why the hell did you come here?

698
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,860
Let me see.

699
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,655
- My own sister?
- I'm sorry.

700
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,781
Forgive me.

701
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:39,865
Let me see.

702
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,704
Come out here.

703
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,415
I want to talk to you.

704
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,587
Please, I beg you. Hojjat!

705
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,098
Do you want your seat down?

706
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,432
No.

707
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:10,104
I'll take you home
then I'll get Dad and Termeh.

708
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:12,981
Let me see.

709
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,776
No?

710
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,738
You want to go to your parents' like this?

711
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,159
It's over. You're coming home tonight.

712
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,288
I don't want to.

713
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,134
Where are you going?

714
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,517
Cell phone.

715
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,478
Hand it in.

716
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,883
Did you hear his complaint?

717
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,259
It was the 13th.

718
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,930
I'm sorry. I was really upset when I heard.

719
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,682
- I went to the hospital.
- Then you admit it.

720
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,977
Is this the medical examiner's report?

721
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:18,524
It is the hospital report that we took

722
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,692
to the medical examiner.

723
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,486
Four and half months, male.

724
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,904
Please explain.

725
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:26,573
I accept that I was a bit rough.

726
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,408
By rough you mean you pushed her?

727
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,620
No. I tried to get her out of my house.

728
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,290
Be clear. Your charge is murder.

729
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,127
It was 19 weeks old. A full human being.

730
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,131
I didn't intend to push her.

731
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,592
I wanted her to leave
so I could close the door.

732
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,719
- You didn't push me?
- Ma'am, please.

733
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,138
If I knew she were pregnant,

734
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,767
I wouldn't even have tried to get
her out of the house.

735
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,270
I just wanted to close the door.

736
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,272
Do you accept his explanation?

737
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,317
He didn't push. He grabbed me here
and threw me and I fell on the stairs.

738
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,611
I didn't throw you.

739
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,447
I wanted to get you out of my house.

740
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,576
- Who throws out a pregnant woman?
- I didn't know.

741
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,827
Why are you lying?

742
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,121
I found out in the hospital.

743
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,291
Your Honor, can't everyone tell

744
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,627
from the body of a woman
that she is pregnant?

745
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,129
Four to five months pregnant.

746
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,006
When would I even see you?

747
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:27,259
I was already gone
or leaving when she'd come.

748
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,345
When I'd come, she looked like this.

749
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,848
Always with the chador.

750
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,766
How can anyone tell she was pregnant?

751
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,102
He can claim that he couldn't guess.

752
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:41,481
I didn't think a pregnant woman
would come for this kind of work.

753
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,861
Your Honor, I spoke of my pregnancy

754
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,323
in front of him, his daughter and her tutor.

755
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,617
They all heard it.

756
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,660
When? I don't remember.

757
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,704
No, of course you wouldn't remember.

758
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,665
The issue isn't that I knew or not.

759
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,375
Yes.

760
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,294
If it's proven that you knew,

761
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,838
the court can request
a prison term of one to three years.

762
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,509
- Well?
- What?

763
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,179
No, I didn't know.

764
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,390
His daughter's tutor can testify.

765
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,975
Can she come in tomorrow?

766
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,519
I don't want her or the school involved.

767
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,022
It's not good for my daughter.

768
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,858
You trash. You've killed my child.

769
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,360
It's bad for your child?

770
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,113
She matters but ours was an animal?

771
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:34,868
- Don't insult...
- Am I insulting? He took my pregnant wife...

772
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,370
Quiet or I'll put you in prison.

773
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,373
Please, he's a bit hot-tempered.

774
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,542
Hot-tempered?

775
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:47,506
I should sue you for working for
a single man we don't even know.

776
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,551
I wanted to help with the bills.
He hasn't worked for months.

777
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,888
The tutor has to come in as a witness.

778
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,724
Call her to come in tomorrow.

779
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:03,689
Your Honor, I'm here today for one thing.

780
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,067
I lost my child but it didn't hurt as much

781
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,070
as when he accused me of being a thief.

782
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,321
We're thieves?

783
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,823
If we were thieves,

784
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,243
we wouldn't come to wipe your father's ass.

785
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,912
Do you have proof that she stole?

786
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,414
I didn't say she stole.

787
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,083
Money was missing

788
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,044
and it was the same amount that I pay her.

789
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,254
Is that why you fought?

790
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,047
He accused her of stealing.

791
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:32,092
Your Honor, my father has Alzheimer's.

792
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,388
She tied his hand to the bed
and left the house.

793
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,265
That day I came home early.

794
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,143
I saw him on the floor with his hand tied.

795
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,769
I thought he had died.

796
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:47,774
She came back
and I'm not saying I wasn't angry,

797
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:48,859
I was.

798
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,611
I told her to leave and she wouldn't.

799
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,780
Where should I have gone?

800
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,449
He accused me of stealing.

801
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,243
If I hadn't asked for the money and left,

802
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,579
he would've thought I had stolen.

803
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,122
Sit down.

804
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,624
- Was your father hurt?
- Yes, he was.

805
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,462
How hurt?
If he had been, he would've filed a complaint.

806
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,963
Yes, he was hurt.

807
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,590
Where are you going?

808
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:15,010
I'm going to check on my child.

809
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,386
Come back quick.

810
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,971
Close the door.

811
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,682
What's taking so long?

812
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,853
I'm not well. You go, I'll come.

813
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,855
He says you locked up his father and left.

814
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:11,858
What should I say?

815
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,611
Say? If he complains you'll be charged.

816
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,281
Where's Somayeh?

817
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,950
Over there.

818
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,035
Go. I'll get her and come.

819
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,870
Let's go.

820
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:42,389
Yes?

821
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,477
He was sleeping.
I locked the door to keep him in.

822
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:52,107
Even he would look the door
and leave me the key.

823
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,650
I saw that he does it so I...

824
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,819
He says you tied him to the bed.

825
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,450
I was afraid he would wake up
and do something to himself.

826
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,662
I was afraid for him.

827
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,123
Why did you leave?

828
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,333
- So you should hit her?
- Quiet!

829
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,419
Who said you could touch my wife?

830
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,587
Sir, get out.

831
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,089
They don't care about honor, I do.

832
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,967
- Don't be offensive.
- Leave the room.

833
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,347
I want to file a complaint against this woman.

834
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,515
Write your complaint.

835
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:29,352
Take your father to the medical examiner.
If he's hurt get a report.

836
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,271
What happens to our complaint?

837
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,356
Sign this and leave.

838
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,358
You have to post bail.

839
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,776
What for?

840
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,821
You're charged with murder.

841
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,990
I can't let you leave.

842
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,701
The blood money is 40 million.

843
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,995
How am I going to post bail?

844
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,124
I live at my dad's. He has Alzheimer's.

845
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,376
If you don't you'll go to jail.

846
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,713
My father can't even come here.

847
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,381
He's sick.

848
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,799
Please don't.

849
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,385
I can't go to jail.

850
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,888
I've left him at home to come here.

851
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,307
I can't go to jail.

852
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:08,808
I can't post bail.

853
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,602
It's not in my hands. It's the law.

854
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:11,895
Wait one second.

855
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,689
What should I do with my dad?

856
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,151
I left him at home
and locked the door to come here.

857
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,903
My child will come home from school.

858
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,363
Please. What are you writing?

859
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:24,324
Don't waste time. Go make your call.

860
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,534
I can't go to jail. I won't go.

861
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,495
Write what you want!

862
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:29,746
Go get an officer.

863
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,873
What for? Don't.

864
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,501
I'm begging you.

865
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,503
Please don't write it.

866
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,090
My life will be ruined.

867
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,676
Don't waste time. Go make your call.

868
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:49,391
<i>Hello, Termeh. I'm stuck here.
They're keeping me tonight.</i>

869
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:53,561
<i>Don't worry. It's nothing.
But you'll be alone tonight.</i>

870
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,691
<i>Take care of the house.
Take Grandpa to the bathroom regularly.</i>

871
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,026
<i>Take care of yourself. I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

872
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:36,396
If you hadn't left, Dad wouldn't be in jail.

873
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,940
Your dad's not in jail because of me.

874
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,735
He hit a pregnant woman.

875
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,486
She came 'cause you left.

876
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,448
How upset he was that I left.

877
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,576
He knew you weren't really leaving.

878
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,495
Did you tell him?

879
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:53,955
No, he knew.

880
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,166
Tell me the truth.

881
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,751
You told him?

882
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,345
Get your stuff. We're going to Grandma's.

883
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:09,679
What about Grandpa?

884
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,056
We'll take him, 1100.

885
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,183
I have homework. I'm not coming.

886
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,519
- You'll be on your own...
- Fine.

887
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,440
You'd better not call.

888
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,662
He doesn't even ask me to stay.

889
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,123
He doesn't refuse to divorce.

890
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:41,294
After having lived together for 14 years.

891
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,254
Dad!

892
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,008
What are you doing here?

893
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,678
Who are you with?

894
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,348
Didn't you have an exam?

895
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,183
No, it's tomorrow.

896
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,519
Who are you with?

897
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,191
Hello.

898
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,528
Shouldn't you tell us you're in trouble

899
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,363
so we can bail you out?

900
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,198
I didn't want to trouble you.

901
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,908
Silly man.

902
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,119
- Sit.
- No, ma'am, he has a hearing.

903
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,583
Who are you with?

904
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,209
He's safe.

905
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,254
What are they saying?

906
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,216
"My child" as if their 18-year old son

907
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,218
was stabbed to death.

908
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,720
Did you speak to them?

909
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,556
You can't even speak to the man.

910
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,267
I told the wife, "You're young.

911
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,311
"You can try next year."

912
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:25,899
What happened?

913
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,985
- I have to appraise the house.
- Okay, go.

914
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,445
Hi.

915
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,072
- I'll be back.
- We'll be here.

916
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,954
Thanks.

917
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,584
- Hi, Mrs. Lavasani.
- Hi, how are you?

918
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:45,835
Good, you?

919
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,297
- Sorry we're troubling you.
- No, what trouble?

920
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:53,009
Is it true what they're saying?

921
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,429
Yes, unfortunately he pushed her
and she fell and lost her baby.

922
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,348
So what should I tell them?

923
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,476
I don't know what they'll ask.

924
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,687
What if he asks something
to his disadvantage?

925
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,608
I think you should tell the truth.

926
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,859
Please don't stand there.

927
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:11,694
Where was he?

928
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,863
Mr. Lavasani was in the kitchen.

929
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,325
He didn't have a reaction
to your conversation?

930
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:18,618
If he did I didn't notice.

931
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,204
How did you realize she was pregnant?

932
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,998
I think she told me.

933
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,334
You asked. Why should I tell you?

934
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:32,173
Her daughter was drawing
a man and a woman.

935
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,633
She said this is my mommy and daddy.

936
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,136
I said your mommy's not that fat.
She said she was pregnant.

937
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,222
So it wasn't from her appearance?

938
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,473
No.

939
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:41,724
Why are you lying?

940
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,476
You're a woman.

941
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:47,021
You can't tell if a woman is pregnant?

942
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,482
Even if I could tell,

943
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,652
what difference does it make
for Mr. Lavasani?

944
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,488
This woman is his daughter's tutor.

945
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,407
They've fixed their story.

946
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,158
Why are you insulting this lady?

947
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,994
No one's talking to you.

948
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,162
When did I have the opportunity
to fix my story?

949
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,706
I was here last night.

950
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,001
One thing is clear. Now that we are speaking,

951
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,921
that man over there can hear us, can't he?

952
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,506
I didn't hear you.

953
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,344
My mind is on other things.

954
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,265
Why would I listen to your conversation?

955
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,933
Do I have to swear to God?

956
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,768
Like you believe in God!

957
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,854
No, God is for your type only!

958
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,939
Open that window.

959
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,776
He is an honorable man.

960
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,362
I've been going there for a year
to teach his daughter.

961
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,198
He's not like that.

962
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,785
Why should she hide her pregnancy?

963
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,872
If I knew I wouldn't have hired her.

964
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:49,417
Why did you hire her
without her husband's permission?

965
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,044
Thank you.

966
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,962
You may go.

967
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,213
Thank you.

968
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:03,723
"During the Sassanid period,
people were divided into two classes,

969
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,225
"the royalty,

970
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,480
"the upper class and the normal people."

971
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,231
"The ordinary people."

972
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,446
What did they ask you?

973
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:22,492
Whether your dad knew she was pregnant.

974
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,495
Forgive us for taking your time.

975
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,956
There's nothing to forgive.

976
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,085
Sweetie, how did mommy lose her baby?

977
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,128
She got a tummy ache.

978
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,423
Why?

979
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,426
Did Daddy fight With her?

980
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,638
Why should he fight with her?

981
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:47,850
Maybe because she didn't tell him
she was working in people's homes?

982
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,270
- Did he hit her?
- My mom and dad never fight.

983
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:56,526
Then why were they fighting
in your drawing that day?

984
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,152
You showed me.

985
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,154
They don't fight anymore.

986
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,948
No?

987
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,325
You're sure?

988
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,541
Yesterday he said
he didn't know she was pregnant.

989
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,960
Now he says he didn't push her.

990
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,546
And you just stand there in silence!

991
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,298
Honestly, didn't you push me?

992
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,467
- I didn't say I...
- Listen...

993
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,845
Don't repeat everything.

994
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,723
How far is the door from the stairs?

995
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:27,932
2 meters?

996
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,810
What else can have happened to her?

997
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,228
The corridor in our house...

998
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,855
- Look...
- I am talking!

999
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,648
Don't talk. Just answer.

1000
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:37,024
Quiet!

1001
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:41,654
You've come here to answer.

1002
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,323
I've a question for you to answer.

1003
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,491
I want to ask him...

1004
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,743
Ask me.

1005
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:50,204
If you hadn't done anything wrong,
Why'd you come to the hospital

1006
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,331
to see what was wrong with her?

1007
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,041
I came out of decency.

1008
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,335
Where was your decency when you hit her?

1009
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,171
Was anyone there during the fight?

1010
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,006
Their neighbor was there.

1011
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:01,716
I'll order questionings.

1012
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,927
They're in it too just like the teacher.

1013
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,221
He's been insulting me from the start!

1014
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,182
Am I lying?

1015
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,267
I'll determine who's lying or not.

1016
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,769
You be quiet.

1017
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,397
Sir, do you realize
his ex-wife has posted his bail?

1018
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:17,857
Oh, my God!

1019
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,400
Can someone vouch for you?

1020
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:20,735
What do you mean?

1021
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:23,863
A government employee
or business-owner to vouch for you.

1022
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,782
- No one.
- Why vouch?

1023
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,742
Because she's been accused.

1024
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,202
Accused of what?

1025
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,038
According to the complaint he filed...

1026
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,372
Which he had no right...

1027
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,959
She admitted that she tied his father
to the bed and locked him up.

1028
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,127
I explained to you why.

1029
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,587
Her child just died.

1030
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,297
Keep your voice down.

1031
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,802
Aren't you ashamed?
You call yourself a man?

1032
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,054
I said quiet.

1033
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:54,894
For God's sake, listen to us for a change.

1034
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,146
He is twisting everything.

1035
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:00,650
He beat my wife and she had a miscarriage.

1036
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,778
What could be clearer?
Why are you being unjust?

1037
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,071
Listen to us for a change.

1038
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,407
If you disturb the peace,
I'll send you to jail for three clays.

1039
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,577
I've lost everything. You think I fear jail?

1040
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,329
You should fear God.

1041
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:17,333
Mr. lzadi, call an officer to arrest him.

1042
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,627
Sir, for the sake of the Quran, don't.

1043
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,422
- No, let them come and take me.
- Go out. Be quiet.

1044
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,592
Why be quiet?
So they can trample my rights?

1045
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:27,927
Go out.

1046
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,013
- Fine, I'm leaving.
- Sir, come out.

1047
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,933
Let me get my helmet.

1048
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,101
Get out.

1049
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,272
I worked for ten years with a cobbler.

1050
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,859
They fired me and said getjustice if you can.

1051
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:48,197
I sued and went back and forth for a year.
In the end, nothing.

1052
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,116
They said go sit at home.

1053
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,035
But this time I won't let it go.

1054
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:55,872
This time it's different.

1055
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,833
I have nothing to lose.

1056
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,961
The problem is I can't talk like this guy.

1057
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,796
I am hot-tempered.

1058
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,506
Don't!

1059
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,808
H ojj at?

1060
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,020
I don't feel well.

1061
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,314
Go sit there.

1062
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,398
Let's go)!

1063
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,318
- What do you want? He's calm.
- I have to take him.

1064
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,820
I'm going to talk to the judge.

1065
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,031
Stay there and don't move.

1066
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,997
Sir...

1067
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,498
I beg you...

1068
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,000
Please let me speak.

1069
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,669
Sir, he's stressed out.

1070
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,422
I've been patient for the past two days.

1071
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,717
I swear, he's been
in and out of prison the past month.

1072
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,011
His creditors put him in prison.

1073
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,888
I begged them to let him come out.

1074
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,432
I beg you to forgive him.

1075
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,851
Sir, look.

1076
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:00,519
Look at these.

1077
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,192
Sir, can I ask you to please
forgive him this time?

1078
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,778
Sir, every day he has to take these.

1079
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,030
I swear I'm not lying.

1080
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,577
Sir, since he was fired, he's been depressed.

1081
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:18,037
He can't help it.

1082
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,706
Sir, you're his elder.

1083
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,124
Please forgive him.

1084
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,422
Go tell him to find someone to vouch for you.

1085
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,299
God bless you.

1086
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,385
Don't leave the building.

1087
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,762
No, I'll wait for him to come back.

1088
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:39,809
Will you ask her?

1089
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:44,397
She'll think it's 'cause she bailed me out.

1090
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,232
So let her...

1091
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,236
Dad... Please.

1092
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,031
Okay.

1093
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,825
Promise.

1094
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:00,913
Why do you promise?

1095
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:07,920
Dad...

1096
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,256
Yes?

1097
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,468
No, I'll wait for him to come back.

1098
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:17,805
No.

1099
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,642
Why?

1100
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,477
Nothing.

1101
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:25,646
So why did you ask?

1102
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,607
Last night, Mom said you knew.

1103
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,361
Where was she to see if I knew?

1104
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:37,116
She said when you were told that
Razieh's baby had died,

1105
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,868
you didn't say anything.

1106
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,287
You didn't ask if she was pregnant.

1107
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,456
You didn't get surprised.

1108
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,669
At times like this, people usually ask
if she was carrying a child.

1109
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,629
It was like you knew.

1110
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,011
Your mom wants to turn you against me.

1111
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,571
Will you ask her?

1112
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,881
I can't.

1113
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,759
Didn't you promise?

1114
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:22,930
I'm sorry.

1115
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,401
Which step was she on?

1116
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:37,319
This one.

1117
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,071
- This?
- This one.

1118
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:52,501
Take Grandpa in. I'll be right back.

1119
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,954
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

1120
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,336
You went upstairs?

1121
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,088
Yes, I went to see Mrs. Kalani.

1122
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:40,424
What for?

1123
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,886
I told her they are coming to investigate.
To beware.

1124
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:46,055
Beware of what?

1125
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:50,434
Beware of...

1126
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,938
That they are coming to investigate.

1127
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,023
Is that not okay?

1128
01:18:56,899 --> 01:19:00,402
If she is to tell the truth,
why should she beware?

1129
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,579
- Termeh. ..
- Yes?

1130
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,830
Come with me.

1131
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:14,833
- I have homework.
- Leave it for now.

1132
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:18,128
Look, imagine that I am her.

1133
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:23,592
Is this right?

1134
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:28,389
When someone is thrown they'll fall straight.

1135
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,849
They don't hit here and bounce off

1136
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:34,603
and hit here and then turn
and hit here and fall here.

1137
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:35,896
Right?

1138
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:38,649
If I'd thrown her from there,

1139
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,402
she should've fallen there on those steps

1140
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:44,863
or she would fall straight on the railing.

1141
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,199
She wouldn't fall like this.

1142
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,660
Imagine you were thrown.
Follow the direction.

1143
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,955
- Then how had she fallen there?
- I don't know.

1144
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:55,708
I'm just saying
she wasn't thrown on these steps.

1145
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,376
Come and stand here.

1146
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,921
And hit here and then turn
and hit here and fall here.

1147
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,757
I want you to know. Go on.

1148
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,357
Did he throw you in this direction?

1149
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,568
No, towards the lower level.

1150
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,944
You look.

1151
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:27,364
This door doesn't allow me to
even if I want to. It's not possible.

1152
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:28,866
Where did you fall down?

1153
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,327
- On these stairs.
- Which step?

1154
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,662
I think it was this one.

1155
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,080
You think or you're sure?

1156
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,541
I'm not sure.

1157
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,543
Ma'am, this is where you found her?

1158
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,837
I didn't see her fall.

1159
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,465
When I got here, she was on that lower step.

1160
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,383
Why don't you say anything?

1161
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,135
Go show them how he threw you.

1162
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:50,596
I was so sick
I didn't know what happened to me.

1163
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,557
Look, I'll stand in her place.

1164
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:57,978
You in the doorway
and push me as hard as you want.

1165
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,897
I'm saying it's not possible to fall there.

1166
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,565
Of course you won't fall.

1167
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,401
A pregnant woman falls easily.

1168
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,529
Then you come here.
You choose who pushes you.

1169
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,448
I'm saying it's not possible.

1170
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,576
I'm saying if you push from here,
she won't fall on the stairs.

1171
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,537
What stairs?
She says she fell on that step up there.

1172
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,749
They all say they saw her on that one.

1173
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,043
Ma'am, did you see her get thrown?

1174
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,796
From up there I couldn't see the door,

1175
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,964
but I saw the stairs when she fell.

1176
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:28,592
Can you show me where you were?

1177
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,386
Maybe she got dizzy and fell.

1178
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,888
How often did you use these stairs?

1179
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,681
Why hadn't she gotten dizzy?

1180
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,058
Excuse me.

1181
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:39,561
That morning when I saw her here I asked her

1182
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,147
why there was garbage on the steps.

1183
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:45,859
She said she had gotten dizzy
and dropped the bag.

1184
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,069
Right?

1185
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:51,156
- She took the garbage down.
- You told me you got dizzy.

1186
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,618
Mrs. Kalani, hadn't she mopped
the stairs that day?

1187
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,870
The stairs were wet. Maybe she slipped.

1188
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:58,872
You jerk! You made her slip.

1189
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,290
Be respectful!

1190
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,251
I'm polite in front of your family.

1191
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,461
You'd better be polite, you shit!

1192
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:06,255
Don't cuss.

1193
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,673
Take him outside.

1194
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,551
Would his neighbors say anything
against him?

1195
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,387
If you can prove they're lying...

1196
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:16,098
So you think they're telling the truth?

1197
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:19,017
To hell with me for wasting my time here.

1198
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:22,229
Excuse me.

1199
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,856
Give us her backpack.

1200
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,660
Here it is...

1201
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,798
Don't you want your drawing book?

1202
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,261
Sweetie, don't be upset

1203
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,139
that I am fighting with your mom and dad...

1204
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,183
Let me put it in your bag.

1205
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:09,067
My mommy didn't take your money.

1206
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:11,528
I know.

1207
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,199
That's not why I was fighting with her.

1208
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,077
Then for what?

1209
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:23,081
I was upset because she left my dad.

1210
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,295
She went to the doctor's.

1211
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,760
Go on.

1212
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,096
Take care.

1213
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:42,100
According to the court's request,
I'll examine him and write what I see.

1214
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:46,021
Well, Doctor, you can see
he doesn't talk anymore.

1215
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,981
Didn't you say he has Alzheimer's?

1216
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:51,527
Yes, but before this happened,
he would speak a bit.

1217
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,988
This is a doctor's office. Prove that in court.

1218
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,074
Does he have any bruising?

1219
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,660
Yes, some.

1220
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,489
What happened?

1221
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:42,244
I'm not sure the bruising has to do
with when he fell off the bed.

1222
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,137
Don't run.

1223
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,223
Mom, pull the window down.
They're fighting.

1224
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,684
Don't you see this is a girls' school?

1225
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,061
I just have one question for this lady.

1226
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,230
You're not allowed to stand here.

1227
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,569
Take your fight to the police.

1228
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,821
I don't want to fight.
I just want to speak to her.

1229
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,950
I have nothing to say to you.
I don't know you or her husband.

1230
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,661
- Then why did you lie in court?
- What lie?

1231
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:25,954
She knows what lie.

1232
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:27,205
Ms. Safaei, call the police.

1233
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,334
Don't scare me with the police.

1234
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,252
She's not involved.

1235
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:35,130
Then why does she try to get
my daughter to speak?

1236
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,214
I did no such thing.

1237
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:39,801
You are a teacher. Aren't you ashamed?

1238
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,472
Why did you ask her if I hit her mom
and she lost the baby?

1239
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,598
I never did.

1240
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,892
You pick on a 4-year-old's drawing

1241
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:50,187
and tell her her dad hit her mom
and she lost the baby?

1242
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:51,480
I didn't say that!

1243
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,734
Why do you think we beat our wives
and children like animals?

1244
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:59,071
I swear on this Quran,
we're humans just like you.

1245
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,164
I have nothing to lose.

1246
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:13,043
Tell your husband
not to make me do something crazy.

1247
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,420
I'll wait by the door.

1248
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,925
I'm unemployed.

1249
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,636
I'll stand out there all clay.
Eventually you'll come out.

1250
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,346
Come to the court and say you lied

1251
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,557
or I'll get to the bottom of what's between
you and her husband.

1252
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:30,686
Shame on you. I've been patient so far.

1253
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,938
So why are you defending him?

1254
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,273
I told the truth.

1255
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,525
- The truth?
- Yes!

1256
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,569
Place your hand on this and swear.

1257
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,655
Why swear?
What does this have to do with her?

1258
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:43,949
I'm not scared. What do I have to say?

1259
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:47,577
You said her husband didn't know
my wife was pregnant.

1260
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:48,745
- Yes.
- Swear it.

1261
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:52,124
I swear on this Quran that day at their house,

1262
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:56,211
her husband was in the kitchen
and didn't hear what your wife and I said.

1263
01:26:57,337 --> 01:27:00,132
Okay? Anything else I should say?

1264
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,304
He's crazy.

1265
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,810
Call your husband. Don't go alone.

1266
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:14,563
No, I don't want him to know. I'm sorry.

1267
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,065
Why are you all standing here?

1268
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:19,651
Hello?

1269
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,530
Hello, Ms. Qahraei.

1270
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:27,492
I had left you a message.

1271
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,745
Can you please pick up?

1272
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,336
The lady that took care of my dad,

1273
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:42,466
apparently that day you gave her
the number for a gynecologist.

1274
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:45,886
I wanted to ask you for that number to call

1275
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:49,514
and see if she went
to see the doctor that week

1276
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,975
and what her problem was.

1277
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:55,228
I would appreciate you calling me back.
Thank you.

1278
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,913
What do you want to do?

1279
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,707
With what?

1280
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,252
You want to keep this up?
Every day a new fight?

1281
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,129
Why? What happened?

1282
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:25,175
He went to her school today
and embarrassed her in front of everyone.

1283
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,346
What did he say?

1284
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:34,059
He screamed, "Her dad killed my child."

1285
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,647
How can she go back to that school?

1286
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,775
Do you know what you are doing?

1287
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,652
What I am doing?

1288
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,074
He's making threats.

1289
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,617
He wouldn't dare!

1290
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,287
Termeh, go to your room.

1291
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:03,171
What if he kills your child
on her way to school?

1292
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,091
What do you want me to do?

1293
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,759
Run off abroad with you?

1294
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:11,263
To hell with abroad.
Why can't you talk normally?

1295
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:15,392
This is about Termeh
and the situation you've put her in.

1296
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,185
I've put her in?

1297
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,188
You have some nerve accusing me!

1298
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,857
Who left home?

1299
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:23,650
Who filed for a divorce?

1300
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,151
You said leave whenever you want.

1301
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:26,987
Why did you come back?

1302
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,281
I didn't. I'm here because of her situation.

1303
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:30,532
Her situation's fine.

1304
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,702
- You have two choices...
- Don't try to intimidate me.

1305
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,120
What intimidation?

1306
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,248
Either you clear up the situation...

1307
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,417
- No, I know what to do.
- Didn't you hit her?

1308
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,044
Didn't she fall? Didn't her baby die?

1309
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,338
Yes! I killed her child.

1310
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:48,466
Why are you so stubborn?
Pay the blood money and end it.

1311
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,760
- I won't be forced into paying.
- Why forced?

1312
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,178
Put yourself in their place.

1313
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,348
- I'm not responsible for their troubles.
- Their child died!

1314
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:59,895
And my dad has been hurt.
He doesn't even speak anymore.

1315
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,731
He didn't speak much before.

1316
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,609
I was happy with the few words he spoke.

1317
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:07,527
Is it as bad as losing a baby?

1318
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:10,113
Where were you to see I caused it?

1319
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:14,117
- Then how did she lose it?
- I don't know.

1320
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:18,246
There might be a chance that
her husband did something

1321
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,166
and now she wants to blame me.

1322
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,002
Her child said that day
she had gone to the doctor.

1323
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:27,839
Why couldn't she wait two hours
to go to the doctor?

1324
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,508
Why did she tie the old man
to his bed and leave?

1325
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,844
The examiner said
her child died due to a blow.

1326
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:36,056
How do we know it was a blow from me?

1327
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:39,684
I won't accept it till it's been proven to me.

1328
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,564
Fine, let me take Termeh.

1329
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:48,193
Shame on you
for putting pressure on me now.

1330
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,486
I am worried about her.

1331
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:52,614
Your child wants to live here.
She has to stay here and learn.

1332
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:55,116
Learn what? Fighting and obstinacy?

1333
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,661
To learn not to be a coward like you

1334
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,372
who gives in so easily.

1335
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:03,833
He knows who to frighten.
Why doesn't he threaten me?

1336
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:05,043
Yes, I'm a coward.

1337
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:09,089
Your whole life,

1338
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,633
instead of solving problems,

1339
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:16,554
you've either run away or
raised your hands and given in.

1340
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:20,350
Just say why you want to leave this country.

1341
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:21,810
You're afraid to stay.

1342
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:25,313
I was gone one week
and you couldn't manage.

1343
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,399
I couldn't manage and I'm responsible.

1344
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:31,945
Give me Termeh and you do what you want.

1345
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:37,242
Termeh, sweetie, you don't have to stay.

1346
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,035
Go wherever you like.

1347
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,501
You still don't want to come?

1348
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,431
"He sells it for 20 a kilo.

1349
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:03,601
"If every day he sells 270 kilos..." Write 270.

1350
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:10,025
Then, how much profit
does he make in one day?

1351
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:12,736
How do you solve this?

1352
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:14,946
Did you lie?

1353
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:17,866
What?

1354
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,493
Did you lie?

1355
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,329
About what?

1356
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,668
When you said
you didn't know she was pregnant.

1357
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:31,129
Why?

1358
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:37,802
You said that you didn't hear Ms. Qahraei
and Razieh speaking.

1359
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:38,887
Yes.

1360
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:44,267
Then how did you know that
Ms. Qahraei gave her the number?

1361
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,771
Didn't she say it at the same time?

1362
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,822
Okay.

1363
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:01,993
If we want to calculate the profit...

1364
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,042
Yes, I knew.

1365
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,630
Your mom was telling the truth.

1366
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:21,054
When they were talking in the hall,
I heard everything from the kitchen.

1367
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:24,390
Then why did you say you didn't?

1368
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,939
Do you know what would happen
if I said I knew?

1369
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,861
One and a half to three years in prison.

1370
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:41,825
I only thought of what would happen to you,

1371
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,119
who you'd stay with.

1372
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,913
I said I didn't know.

1373
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,751
If you knew, why did you hit her?

1374
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:55,672
I knew she was pregnant
but at that moment I didn't.

1375
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:58,716
I had forgotten it- I wasn't paying attention-.

1376
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,933
So tell them this.

1377
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,148
The law doesn't care about this.

1378
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,234
Either I knew or I didn't...

1379
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:24,659
Look at me.

1380
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:28,413
If you want me to I'll tell them.

1381
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:22,967
Hi.

1382
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,017
Didn't I say not to come to the front?

1383
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:53,206
Ms. Qahraei!

1384
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,094
What are you doing?

1385
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:09,013
Ms. Qahraei, wait...

1386
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:13,851
if you pull over
I'll just explain something to you.

1387
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:15,561
Please let me...

1388
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,189
Dad!

1389
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,486
Who's responsible for my child's safety now?

1390
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:25,321
Without a witness there's no case.

1391
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:28,741
Hi.

1392
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:30,285
And then come to you?

1393
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,912
How should I know you are telling the truth?

1394
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:34,789
Why should I lie?

1395
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:38,084
Bring my daughter and father here
just to lie?

1396
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,545
- Is she here now?
- Yes, outside.

1397
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,672
Ask her yourself.

1398
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:47,260
I'm afraid to leave her at school.
I'm afraid to leave my dad at home.

1399
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,387
Is the plaintiff here?

1400
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:52,056
Did you finish writing?

1401
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,308
Almost.

1402
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:56,185
You didn't know his wife was pregnant?

1403
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:57,603
No, I didn't.

1404
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:01,274
When she was speaking to the tutor,
you didn't hear them?

1405
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:02,525
No, I didn't.

1406
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:05,069
You didn't, huh?

1407
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:07,780
What I'm saying is...

1408
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:10,450
The tutor came and revoked her testimony.

1409
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,785
She says you knew.

1410
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:15,663
- She said I knew?
- Yes, she came yesterday.

1411
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,415
He threatened her...

1412
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,751
Answer me. Did you hear her or not?

1413
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,419
I said no.

1414
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,629
How did you know
about the doctor's number?

1415
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,048
My daughter told me.

1416
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:26,466
What did she tell you?

1417
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,843
That she got the number from her teacher.

1418
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,888
Go tell her to come in.

1419
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,515
Now?

1420
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,851
And wait outside.

1421
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:39,228
What question?

1422
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:45,735
What does he want to ask?

1423
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:50,615
I don't know. Give me that.

1424
01:37:58,331 --> 01:38:00,124
So what do you have to say?

1425
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,001
You haven't asked me anything.

1426
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:05,338
Didn't your dad tell you
what I want to ask you?

1427
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:06,631
No.

1428
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:08,132
What grade are you in school?

1429
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,884
Sixth.

1430
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:13,471
The day your tutor came to your house

1431
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:16,474
and asked the lady about her pregnancy,

1432
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,726
were you there?

1433
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:22,688
Not then, I had gone to get my books.

1434
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:27,652
Then how did you know
she got the doctor's number from your tutor?

1435
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:32,407
She gave her the number later,
when she was leaving.

1436
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:33,866
In front of you?

1437
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:35,410
Yes.

1438
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:36,994
Why didn't you tell your dad sooner?

1439
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,371
What?

1440
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:42,166
That she got the doctor's number
from your tutor.

1441
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,336
I didn't think it was important
for my dad to know.

1442
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:50,341
And did you tell your dad or did he hear it?

1443
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:54,887
That she gave the number? I told him.

1444
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,515
- You told him?
- Yes.

1445
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,518
Okay.

1446
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,488
What crime did I commit?

1447
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:54,739
Nothing. You're right.

1448
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,658
He's not accepting his responsibility.

1449
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,912
I admit that he's to blame,
but in the end what will happen?

1450
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:05,625
One or two years in court
for a payment plan of the blood money.

1451
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,085
But why? That's what upsets me.

1452
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,171
Why do you think it's for the money?

1453
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:11,672
When did I say such a thing?

1454
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:16,344
You think I am a bum and my kid died
and I don't understand anything.

1455
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:18,179
I never said anything like that.

1456
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:19,931
Let's see what she's saying.

1457
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:21,474
There's no other way.

1458
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:24,435
Your child won't come back.

1459
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:26,604
I admit that he's to blame,
but in the end what will happen?

1460
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:29,148
Her husband didn't do it on purpose.

1461
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:32,985
They're good people
for giving you a solution.

1462
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:36,656
Take the money and settle it.
You can use it in your situation.

1463
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:40,993
Right now we'll decide on an amount
and I'll get my husband's approval.

1464
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:46,165
Now we have to get his approval?
For God's sake leave us alone.

1465
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,462
You act like you don't need the money.

1466
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:52,838
Take a look at yourself.

1467
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,632
Don't let him go.

1468
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,972
Wait a second. I want to talk to you.

1469
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:52,940
Will you stay?

1470
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:56,694
Mom...

1471
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:01,365
Let me speak to him.

1472
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:13,044
Come sit. I want to talk to you.

1473
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:16,589
I can hear you.

1474
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:22,470
I went and spoke to her husband today.

1475
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,555
Sit down.

1476
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:36,776
I managed

1477
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,778
to get him to agree

1478
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:42,239
to take 15 million instead of 40 million.

1479
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:45,493
Three five-million checks
in exchange for his consent.

1480
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:47,578
How dare you speak to him about money?

1481
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:50,247
I can't handle the stress of my child's safety.

1482
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:51,957
You don't get it.

1483
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:54,960
Just now when you were late,
I was worried sick.

1484
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:57,755
Why are you interfering?

1485
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,424
I didn't come here to fight.

1486
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:02,760
Oh, God, why can't I make her understand?

1487
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:06,514
Didn't you say it was my fault,
that I introduced her,

1488
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:09,767
that if I hadn't left,
none of this would've happened?

1489
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,435
So let me fix it, then.

1490
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:15,106
If I pay, it means
I have accepted it was my fault.

1491
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:16,357
But he has consented.

1492
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,858
He won't let us be.

1493
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:20,695
- He won't, anyway.
- Why should I bribe him?

1494
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:22,446
Think of it as my dower money.

1495
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:26,492
If I had to I would beg and borrow

1496
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:28,661
to get your dower money.

1497
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:31,622
But I don't have the money
to pay for extortion.

1498
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:35,459
Our child is going through adolescence.
She is suffering.

1499
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:41,882
So you understand
the sensitivity of her adolescence.

1500
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:43,968
If she was suffering
she wouldn't have stayed.

1501
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:46,470
Why do you think she stayed?

1502
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:48,806
Did she choose you?

1503
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,560
To keep us from separating.

1504
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:56,564
She knows I won't go anywhere without her.

1505
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:01,986
She is suffering but she doesn't show it.

1506
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,993
Call them now and say I won't pay

1507
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,996
until it's been proved to me
that I am responsible.

1508
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:13,748
I'll sell my car.

1509
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:16,500
Don't sell it for my sake.

1510
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:18,085
It's not for you.

1511
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,504
If your child is not worth...

1512
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:23,674
Why are you talking nonsense?
Money's not the issue.

1513
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:27,094
I won't rest till my child's safety
is guaranteed.

1514
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:29,930
You don't have the right to do anything.

1515
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:31,348
Understand?

1516
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:34,769
If I had done nothing you would be in prison.

1517
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:41,442
Come to court and get back the bail.

1518
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:44,278
I don't want to be out because of it.

1519
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:04,256
Get up, Termeh.

1520
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:06,550
Get up, let's go.

1521
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,052
Get up, I tell you.

1522
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:09,386
Mom, please.

1523
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,599
I don't want you to stay here.

1524
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:15,142
No, Mom, I won't let you.

1525
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:19,146
Is 15 million more important
than your child's life?

1526
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,731
I won't let you do this.

1527
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:22,733
If your child is not important...

1528
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,611
Mom, please listen, why are you doing this?

1529
01:45:25,778 --> 01:45:27,112
You said you would stay.

1530
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,405
I was stupid!

1531
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,034
Mom, please...

1532
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:33,452
I'll wait in the car.

1533
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:48,592
Go there for a few days
till your exams are finished.

1534
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:50,970
Your grandparents are there.

1535
01:45:51,846 --> 01:45:53,472
You'll have more fun.

1536
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:55,516
Didn't you say it's not serious?

1537
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:58,143
It got serious.

1538
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:00,938
Termeh...

1539
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,940
Honey...

1540
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:06,861
If you cry I'll cry, too.

1541
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:09,446
Why won't you pay them
so she'll come back?

1542
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:12,449
This has nothing to do with her coming back.

1543
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:14,994
It does. She had come to stay.

1544
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,621
Her stuff was in the car, I saw it.

1545
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:01,332
If you think I am guilty, go get your mom.

1546
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:04,001
We'll call them and go pay them.

1547
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,287
I have doubts.

1548
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:24,039
Didn't he throw you?

1549
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:25,791
Yes.

1550
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:28,919
Did something happen at home?

1551
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:32,423
No. Even before, my child wasn't moving.

1552
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,634
Before he threw you?

1553
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:43,976
You mean your child had already died?

1554
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:47,146
I don't know. Maybe.

1555
01:48:47,312 --> 01:48:48,939
Had something happened?

1556
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:54,945
I'm not sure, but the night before, I had pain.

1557
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:58,949
- Have you ever lost a baby before?
- No.

1558
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:03,662
I was hit by a car.

1559
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:14,465
Your father-in-law had gone into the street.

1560
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:16,008
I went after him.

1561
01:49:17,301 --> 01:49:19,762
He was crossing the street to come back.

1562
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:23,974
I ran to stop him but I got hit instead.

1563
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:26,643
The pain started that night.

1564
01:49:29,855 --> 01:49:31,190
Does your husband know this?

1565
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:35,611
Why don't you come say this in court?

1566
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:42,117
My husband will kill me
if he finds out I told you this.

1567
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:46,830
Since yesterday
when he promised his creditors,

1568
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:48,165
he's been waiting.

1569
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:53,045
What do we have to do with all this?

1570
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:57,883
It's my fault.

1571
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:05,849
Yesterday when he said
you'd promised him this money,

1572
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,519
I got really scared. I called a few people.

1573
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:11,855
They say if I have doubts
then it's a sin to take it.

1574
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:16,193
If we don't pay
my husband's innocence must be proved.

1575
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:20,197
Why don't you come say this in court?

1576
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:22,491
But your husband won't leave us alone.

1577
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:24,409
I fear for my child.

1578
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:29,164
I'm afraid that if I take this money,
something will happen to my child.

1579
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:31,041
What do you want me to do?

1580
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:34,169
Don't pay this money.

1581
01:50:35,587 --> 01:50:36,588
Don't.

1582
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:46,557
Will your husband leave us alone?

1583
01:51:19,798 --> 01:51:22,551
Give me that. Bring some plates.

1584
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:25,929
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

1585
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:50,078
When you revoke your complaint,

1586
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:53,415
we'll give you these three checks.

1587
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:54,917
God bless you.

1588
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,922
Hojjat, get a pen and paper
so we can write everything down and sign it.

1589
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:02,466
I want to say something first...

1590
01:52:02,633 --> 01:52:04,468
Say a prayer and finish it.

1591
01:52:04,635 --> 01:52:07,804
I have already agreed
and will honor my word.

1592
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:13,268
I just want his wife
and my daughter to be here when I speak.

1593
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,105
Where is she?

1594
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:20,859
Thank you.

1595
01:52:21,777 --> 01:52:23,320
Please, also call my daughter.

1596
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:29,785
Come in. Your father wants you.

1597
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:41,672
Termeh, come and sit here.

1598
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,674
Excuse me, sir.

1599
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,186
Look...

1600
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:59,564
I wrote the checks and I'll give them to you.

1601
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:01,483
There's no problem.

1602
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,193
I need to ask a favor.

1603
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:07,030
Ma'am, you are a devout person.

1604
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:11,702
Swear on the Quran
that I caused your miscarriage.

1605
01:53:20,836 --> 01:53:21,837
Bring a Quran.

1606
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:24,339
Go get it.

1607
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:44,359
Come quickly or they'll suspect something.

1608
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:48,113
His creditors are here for the money.

1609
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,282
You'll ruin our reputation.

1610
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:54,286
I won't swear.

1611
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:59,750
Didn't you say you went to get his father
and a car hit you?

1612
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:03,086
Why aren't you coming?

1613
01:54:04,212 --> 01:54:05,922
She's afraid to swear.

1614
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:08,258
Why?

1615
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:12,054
I... I have doubts.

1616
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,269
Oh, God...

1617
01:54:20,937 --> 01:54:22,731
Azam, go sit with them.

1618
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:30,322
Why are you saying this now?

1619
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:33,283
I swear I told Azam.

1620
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:37,162
Tell me exactly what happened.

1621
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:43,126
The day before, a car hit me.

1622
01:54:43,752 --> 01:54:46,421
And that night I had a lot of pain.

1623
01:54:56,306 --> 01:54:58,809
- Let's go, it'll be my sin.
- No.

1624
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:00,852
It's a sin. I asked.

1625
01:55:01,019 --> 01:55:03,980
What sin? He's consented. Let's go.

1626
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:07,109
I am scared we'll be punished.

1627
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:10,487
More punished than this?
Look at my situation.

1628
01:55:10,654 --> 01:55:14,199
Have mercy on me. On our child.

1629
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:17,953
I'm afraid of something happening
to our child.

1630
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:19,621
Let's go.

1631
01:55:19,788 --> 01:55:20,872
I can't.

1632
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:22,332
Let's go.

1633
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:26,795
I can't.

1634
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:33,343
Don't hit yourself!

1635
01:55:52,821 --> 01:55:56,700
Why did you come here tonight?
Didn't I tell you not to come?

1636
01:55:57,492 --> 01:55:59,703
Didn't I say we don't want your money?

1637
01:56:00,162 --> 01:56:02,539
How will I live in this house?

1638
01:56:03,707 --> 01:56:06,209
Why did you do this to me?

1639
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:34,673
Come on.

1640
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:41,471
Let's go.

1641
01:57:57,529 --> 01:57:58,989
Hello. Come in.

1642
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,834
So what's your decision?

1643
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:16,798
Your parents have left it up to you to decide
who you want to live with.

1644
01:58:16,965 --> 01:58:19,509
With your father or your mother?

1645
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:22,387
Have you decided?

1646
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:23,555
Yes.

1647
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:25,849
- Have you?
- Yes.

1648
01:58:36,693 --> 01:58:38,361
Have you decided or not?

1649
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:39,529
Yes.

1650
01:58:42,032 --> 01:58:43,658
And what is it?

1651
01:58:45,493 --> 01:58:47,329
Do I have to say it now?

1652
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:51,374
- If you haven't decided...
- Yes, I have.

1653
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,465
- If you haven't decided yet...
-l have.

1654
01:58:58,548 --> 01:58:59,549
And?

1655
01:59:00,884 --> 01:59:03,720
Would you prefer them to wait outside?

1656
01:59:05,055 --> 01:59:06,514
Can they?

1657
01:59:07,557 --> 01:59:09,684
Sir, wait outside for a minute.

1658
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:12,854
You, too, ma'am.
