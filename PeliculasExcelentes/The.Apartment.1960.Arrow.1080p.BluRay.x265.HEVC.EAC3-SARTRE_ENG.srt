00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:32,873
<i>On November 1, 1959, the population
of New York City was 8,042,783.</i>

2
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:38,132
<i>If you laid them all end to end, figuring
an average height of 5 feet 6½ inches...</i>

3
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:42,299
<i>they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.</i>

4
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:46,845
<i>I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.</i>

5
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:49,514
<i>We're one of the top five companies
in the country.</i>

6
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:53,435
<i>Our home office has 31,259 employees...</i>

7
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:57,902
<i>which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.</i>

8
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:01,033
<i>I work on the 19th floor.
Ordinary Policy Department...</i>

9
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:05,367
<i>Premium Accounting Division,
Section W, desk number 861.</i>

10
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:10,460
<i>My name is C. C. Baxter: C for Calvin, C
for Clifford. But most people call me Bud.</i>

11
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:15,841
<i>I've worked here three years, ten months,
and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.</i>

12
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:29,183
<i>The hours in our department
are 8.50 to 5.20.</i>

13
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:39,110
<i>They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees...</i>

14
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:41,695
<i>without a serious traffic jam.</i>

15
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:46,988
<i>As for myself, I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour or two...</i>

16
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,202
<i>especially when the weather is bad.</i>

17
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:52,915
<i>It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It's just a way of killing time...</i>

18
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,751
<i>until it's all right for me to go home.</i>

19
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:59,417
<i>You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.</i>

20
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,179
<i>I live in the West 60s,
just half a block from Central Park.</i>

21
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,467
<i>My rent is $85 a month.
It used to be $80 until last July...</i>

22
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:11,513
<i>when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,
put in a second-hand air conditioner.</i>

23
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,311
<i>It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,
but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.</i>

24
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:20,901
<i>The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to.</i>

25
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:38,002
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.

26
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:41,167
What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.

27
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,461
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

28
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:46,927
First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.

29
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,264
- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.

30
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:53,180
But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.

31
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:58,943
- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.

32
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,826
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Mrs. Lieberman.

33
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:19,998
Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.

34
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:26,046
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

35
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:29,970
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.

36
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,486
- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.

37
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:53,827
- Where does she live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,961
- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

39
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,999
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?

40
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:06,089
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

41
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:48,469
- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?

42
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:52,678
Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

43
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,309
Such a racket I heard in your place.

44
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:57,561
Maybe you had burglars?

45
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,225
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

46
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:45,477
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

47
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:49,112
Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

48
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,826
I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

49
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:56,612
I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

50
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,406
- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

51
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,667
Oh!

52
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:05,121
I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

53
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:06,755
- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.

54
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,922
We discussed manpower promotionwise.
I told him you're a bright boy.

55
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:15,180
They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.

56
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,185
- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

57
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:23,769
- Last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

58
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:28,186
- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.

59
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:33,654
Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?

60
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:37,911
Cheese crackers?

61
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:18,035
Cheers.

62
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,846
- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

63
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:42,594
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich... including the toothpick.

64
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:47,310
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

65
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:51,277
The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

66
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:55,611
That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

67
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:58,780
As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

68
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,162
From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.

69
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:06,826
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.

70
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:10,955
- A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

71
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:14,842
You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.

72
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,253
- Could you do us a favor?
- Me?

73
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,174
When you make out your will...
and the way you're going, you should...

74
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,435
would you mind leaving
your body to the university?

75
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:29,895
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

76
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:33,360
Slow down, kid.

77
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,896
Oh, for heaven...

78
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:25,909
<i>From the world's greatest library

<i>If you smoke the modern way,

85
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,293

<i>Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery

87

88
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:32,096
<i>Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?</i>

89
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,919
- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.

90
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:03,881
I'm in this bar on 61st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

91
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,593
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

92
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,140
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

93
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:13,103
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.

94
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:17,858
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61st and I think I got lucky.

95
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:22,980
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

96
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:27,447
- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

97
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,328
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

98
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,783
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

99
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:39,338
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.

100
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,715
You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?

101
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:46,587
No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

102
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:50,925
It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.

103
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:56,013
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?

104
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,184
- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

105
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,482
Ooh!

106
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:06,691
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?

107
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:10,535
I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...

108
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:14,324
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.

109
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,288
Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.

110
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:19,544
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

111
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:23,127
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch!

112
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:27,719
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch!
Be my guest!

113
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,552
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

114
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,346
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

115
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:23,609
- This the place?
- Yeah.

116
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:25,735
- How much?
- 70 cents.

117
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,942
Get the money, will you?

118
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,734
Watch those stingers!

119
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,116
- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.

120
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,124
Put it back, honey!

121
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:42,957
Attagirl.

122
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,248
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.

123
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,633
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

124
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:53,468
Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.

125
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:11,649
Get the key, will you?

126
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,492
Not there! Under the mat.

127
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:17,450
- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.

128
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,657
Open up. We haven't got all night.

129
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:27,588
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.

130
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:43,851
Mildred! He's at it again!

131
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:36,950
- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?

132
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,988
- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.

133
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:44,784
Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.

134
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,794
Good morning, Mr. McKellway,
Mrs. Schubert, Mr. Davis.

135
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:50,580
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

136
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:53,546
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.

137
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:56,211
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

138
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:03,051
- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

139
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,472
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it.

140
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:09,312
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

141
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,351
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

142
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,317
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

143
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,076
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

144
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:21,658
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

145
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,040
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

146
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,749
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

147
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:32,414
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

148
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,757
19!

149
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,675
Watch your step.

150
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:42,340
- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

151
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:46,057
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

152
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:49,981
20 next!

153
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:54,437
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!

154
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:58,197
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

155
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,360
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

156
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:05,281
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

157
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:09,576
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

158
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,291
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

159
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:41,533
Hello. Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

160
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,367
Oh, Buddy-boy!

161
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:48,407
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

162
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:52,749
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

163
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:55,296
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

164
00:18:55,466 --> 00:19:00,177
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

165
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,467
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

166
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,683
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

167
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:13,064
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

168
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,605
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

169
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:19,772
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

170
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:23,071
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

171
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:25,109
And about your promotion.

172
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:28,451
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

173
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:31,116
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

174
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,288
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

175
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,237
From Mr. Dobisch.

176
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,491
Wait.

177
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,166
For Mr. Dobisch.

178
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:25,963
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

179
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,441
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

180
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,571
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

181
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:48,110
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

182
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:52,955
Look, I've got you down for tonight...

183
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,368
but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

184
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:59,500
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

185
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:04,717
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

186
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:08,547
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

187
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:12,885
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

188
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:17,396
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

189
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:23,233
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

190
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,073
I got somebody penciled in.

191
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:30,155
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

192
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:44,587
- Mr. Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

193
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:51,514
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

194
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:55,017
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

195
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:59,598
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

196
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,770
Friday.

197
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:05,437
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

198
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:15,952
Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18
percent ahead of last year Octoberwise.

199
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:21,836
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

200
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:25,128
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

201
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,134
You'd be doing me a great favor.

202
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:31,050
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

203
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:35,266
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

204
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,301
Sylvia, it's for you.

205
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,266
Yeah?

206
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:41,055
Oh, hello.

207
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:44,476
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

208
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:48,405
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

209
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:53,777
Thursday?! Well, that's
"The Untouchables" with Bob Stack!

210
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,158
Bob who?

211
00:22:56,623 --> 00:23:00,333
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

212
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:07,123
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

213
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,838
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

214
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:22,017
Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

215
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:32,357
Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

216
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:45,169
All right. I'll tell him.

217
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:49,128
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

218
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:54,296
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

219
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:59,968
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

220
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:04,264
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

221
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,103
It's a bet!

222
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:22,369
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

223
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:27,754
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.

224
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,001
27.

225
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:34,089
You may not realize it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiencywise...

226
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:37,005
and this may be the day promotionwise.

227
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:39,765
You're beginning to sound
like Mr. Kirkeby already.

228
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:43,929
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

229
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:47,770
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

230
00:24:47,943 --> 00:24:50,230
Something happens to men in elevators.

231
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:53,363
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

232
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:56,696
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

233
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:59,406
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

234
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:01,445
Or some evening, after work?

235
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:04,161
- 27.
- Oh.

236
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:06,909
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

237
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:09,795
They would call me today,
what with my cold.

238
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:12,457
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

239
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:14,792
Thank you.

240
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,806
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

241
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:22,467
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

242
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:41,535
C. C. Baxter, Ordinary Premium
Accounting. Mr. Sheldrake called me.

243
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,413
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

244
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,700
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

245
00:25:58,388 --> 00:25:59,924
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:02,181
Come in, come in.

247
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:06,014
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

248
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,726
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

249
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:12,900
Been hearing some nice things about you.

250
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,108
Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

251
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:20,616
- Mr. Dobisch said that?
- Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

252
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:24,112
- without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

253
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,374
Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

254
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:31,411
would both like you
transferred to their departments.

255
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:33,545
Very flattering.

256
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:38,801
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

257
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,429
- I don't know.
- Think.

258
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:51,640
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

259
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:56,312
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

260
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:57,945
You do?

261
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:02,610
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

262
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:05,449
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint...

263
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:09,115
tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

264
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:13,502
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

265
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:15,664
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

266
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:19,130
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

267
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:22,761
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

268
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:27,972
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

269
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,057
It's the key to a certain apartment.

270
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,723
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

271
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:37,235
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative
C. C. Baxter.

272
00:27:39,698 --> 00:27:42,190
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

273
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:47,240
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

274
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:49,618
You'd better.

275
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,874
Well...

276
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:57,213
about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

277
00:27:57,382 --> 00:28:02,377
One of the guys in our department... lives
in Jersey... had to go to a banquet in town.

278
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:06,889
He needed some place to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

279
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:13,020
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

280
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,060
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

281
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:24,406
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

282
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:27,865
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

283
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:31,031
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

284
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,918
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

285
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:39,171
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentagewise.

286
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:43,927
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

287
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:47,259
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

288
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:52,427
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

289
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:55,221
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

290
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:00,814
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbors, the landlady and the key.

291
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,979
How do you work it with the key?

292
00:29:03,156 --> 00:29:08,026
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

293
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,750
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

294
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:22,377
Yes, dear. Where were you?

295
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:27,879
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

296
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:31,049
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

297
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:34,469
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

298
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:36,808
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

299
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:40,976
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theater.

300
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:42,939
"Music Man." What else?

301
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,651
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

302
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:50,239
Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen "Music Man"?

303
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,995
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

304
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:55,326
How would you like to go tonight?

305
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,790
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

306
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:03,164
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

307
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:05,333
Well... that's very kind of you.

308
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,504
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

309
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:13,348
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

310
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:16,849
So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

311
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,355
So give the tickets to somebody else.

312
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:24,356
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

313
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,737
Swap 'em? For what?

314
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:33,862
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

315
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,032
Oh?

316
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:44,130
Oh...

317
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:57,556
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

318
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:01,564
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

319
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,225
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

320
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,442
And put down the address.

321
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:16,621
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

322
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:19,536
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

323
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,746
Yes, thank you, sir.

324
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:26,839
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

325
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, and about the liquor.

326
00:31:29,177 --> 00:31:33,797
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

327
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:37,759
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

328
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,599
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

329
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:44,436
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

330
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:48,444
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

331
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,605
Percentagewise.

332
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:53,320
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

333
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:55,610
You too, sir.

334
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,479
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.

335
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:36,276
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

336
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,283
- Good night.
- Good night.

337
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:47,540
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

338
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:50,832
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognize you.

339
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:54,173
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

340
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:56,553
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

341
00:32:56,723 --> 00:32:59,136
- Look, have you seen "The Music Man"?
- No.

342
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:00,845
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

343
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,352
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

344
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,012
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

345
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,274
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

346
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:11,982
- You mean... like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

347
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:16,695
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

348
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,780
You tell 'em now and then.

349
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:23,197
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

350
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:26,833
Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.

351
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:29,336
So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.

352
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:32,044
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

353
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:36,382
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

354
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:39,217
I understand.

355
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,885
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theater ticket go to waste.

356
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:47,146
- What time does the show go on?
- 8:30.

357
00:33:47,315 --> 00:33:49,648
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

358
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:53,857
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

359
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,862
I'll meet you in the lobby.

360
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:59,491
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

361
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:03,075
Now along comes my promotion
and us... 11th row center.

362
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:05,205
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

363
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,492
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

364
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:11,663
After the show we could go out
on the town.

365
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,582
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

366
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:17,718
There's a great band
at El Chico, in the Village.

367
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:21,380
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

368
00:34:21,558 --> 00:34:26,098
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.

369
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:28,263
Your sister and brother-in-law.

370
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:32,399
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

371
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:33,935
How come?

372
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:38,777
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

373
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,785
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

374
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:46,948
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

375
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:50,959
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

376
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:55,965
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

377
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,303
8:30!

378
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:54,273
- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

379
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:56,855
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

380
00:35:57,028 --> 00:36:00,692
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

381
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:05,200
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

382
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:09,701
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

383
00:36:09,874 --> 00:36:13,163
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

384
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:16,204
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

385
00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:20,548
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

386
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:23,878
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

387
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:26,718
Six weeks. But who's counting?

388
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:29,892
I missed you.

389
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:34,389
Like old times.

390
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:37,308
Same booth. Same song.

391
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:42,317
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

392
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:47,944
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

393
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:51,330
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

394
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,991
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

395
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:59,709
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

396
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:03,500
I don't believe you.

397
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:07,592
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

398
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:10,599
But that was it. Happens all the time.

399
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:14,887
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary...

400
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:17,772
or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

401
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:21,276
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

402
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:25,440
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife...

403
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:27,733
and the girl...

404
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:32,074
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

405
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,917
I never said goodbye, Fran.

406
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:44,759
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

407
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,635
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

408
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:50,422
and asks you if any lipstick's showing...

409
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,139
then rushes out to catch
the 7:14 to White Plains.

410
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:58,806
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

411
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:02,818
and you sit there
by yourself and you think...

412
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,114
and it all begins to look so... ugly.

413
00:38:10,578 --> 00:38:14,322
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7:14 train?

414
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:18,664
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

415
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:20,828
I want you back, Fran.

416
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:24,919
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

417
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:28,961
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

418
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:32,973
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go some place else?

419
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:36,010
- No. I have a date at 8:30.
- Oh?

420
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:40,143
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

421
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:42,933
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

422
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,648
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

423
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,384
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

424
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:13,389
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

425
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:15,891
Do you remember what we talked about?

426
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,644
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

427
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:22,147
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

428
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,308
You didn't believe me, did you?

429
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:28,900
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

430
00:39:29,073 --> 00:39:33,864
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

431
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:37,325
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

432
00:39:37,498 --> 00:39:40,241
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

433
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:44,711
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

434
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:49,922
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

435
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:52,586
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

436
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:58,555
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

437
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:01,428
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

438
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,561
Are you sure that's what you want?

439
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:10,233
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

440
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,446
You know I do.

441
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:20,285
Fran.

442
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,957
Jeff, darling...

443
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:35,470
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

444
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:09,329
Taxi!

445
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:13,091
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

446
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,843
Where are we going?

447
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:18,847
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

448
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:25,846
51 West 67th.

449
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:11,729
Congratulations.

450
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:30,168
Would you mind? C. C. Baxter... that's me.

451
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:35,708
Thank you.

452
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:54,400
Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

453
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,029
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

454
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:01,363
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

455
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:06,200
Teamwork: that's what counts in this
organization. All for one and one for all.

456
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,365
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

457
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,410
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitudewise.

458
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:15,255
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

459
00:43:15,424 --> 00:43:20,965
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... like that.

460
00:43:21,222 --> 00:43:23,930
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

461
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,390
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

462
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:32,772
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

463
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:34,649
How selfish can you get?

464
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:38,563
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

465
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:41,732
I'm too old for that sort of thing...
I mean in a Volkswagen.

466
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:45,156
I sympathize with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

467
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:48,576
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

468
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:51,833
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

469
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:55,955
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

470
00:43:56,132 --> 00:44:00,217
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

471
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:03,254
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

472
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,174
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

473
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:12,142
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

474
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:15,019
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

475
00:44:15,192 --> 00:44:17,730
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

476
00:44:17,903 --> 00:44:21,692
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

477
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:26,611
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

478
00:44:26,787 --> 00:44:29,074
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

479
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:32,119
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?
- Oh, no, no.

480
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:37,542
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

481
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:40,298
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

482
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:43,460
Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.

483
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,137
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

484
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:49,015
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

485
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:52,724
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

486
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:57,186
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

487
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,817
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

488
00:44:59,987 --> 00:45:01,023
Yeah, I know how it is.

489
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:05,908
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

490
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:09,240
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

491
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:11,450
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

492
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:16,372
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

493
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:18,081
That's the life all right.

494
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:20,497
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

495
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:22,966
And I'll get that other key.

496
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:38,940
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

497
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:41,101
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

498
00:45:41,278 --> 00:45:43,270
Yeah? Yeah?!

499
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:44,528
Where?

500
00:45:44,698 --> 00:45:45,905
You bet!

501
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:50,445
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

502
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:55,665
<i>♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

503
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:59,578
<i>♪ Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way</i>

504
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:02,964
<i>♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ♪</i>

505
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:24,646
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

506
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:27,572
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

507
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:29,945
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

508
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,157
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

509
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,869
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

510
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:40,665
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

511
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:42,830
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

512
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:44,589
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

513
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,168
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

514
00:46:48,345 --> 00:46:50,553
because you have a date
with another man.

515
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:53,090
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

516
00:46:53,267 --> 00:46:56,681
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

517
00:46:56,854 --> 00:47:01,599
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

518
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:04,188
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

519
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:09,026
I mean decencywise and... otherwisewise.

520
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,316
Cheers.

521
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:15,324
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

522
00:47:15,497 --> 00:47:20,538
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

523
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:23,044
Shall we join the natives?

524
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:26,706
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it.

525
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:31,003
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

526
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,388
and punched full of little square holes.

527
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:35,719
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

528
00:47:35,893 --> 00:47:39,057
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

529
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:41,846
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

530
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:44,895
Hi!

531
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:47,652
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

532
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:49,483
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

533
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:51,568
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

534
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:54,075
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

535
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:58,238
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

536
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:02,705
four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

537
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:07,706
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

538
00:48:07,883 --> 00:48:10,500
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

539
00:48:10,677 --> 00:48:13,010
And right before you was a Miss, um...

540
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,513
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

541
00:48:15,682 --> 00:48:19,175
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

542
00:48:19,436 --> 00:48:22,600
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

543
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:25,520
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

544
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:28,810
and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

545
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:35,276
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

546
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:37,569
Miss Kubelik!

547
00:48:39,623 --> 00:48:41,364
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

548
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:45,707
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

549
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,963
Are you all right? What's the matter?

550
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,716
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

551
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:55,799
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

552
00:48:55,973 --> 00:49:00,718
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

553
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:04,638
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

554
00:49:05,816 --> 00:49:07,933
Do you mind?

555
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:15,573
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

556
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:18,985
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.

557
00:49:19,163 --> 00:49:22,497
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

558
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,125
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

559
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:39,426
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

560
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,808
- I like it.
- Really?

561
00:49:41,977 --> 00:49:44,845
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

562
00:49:45,022 --> 00:49:48,982
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

563
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:51,859
- Is that better?
- Much better.

564
00:49:52,112 --> 00:49:54,695
Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me...

565
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:57,949
how about goin' out tonight...
you, me and the bowler?

566
00:49:58,118 --> 00:50:00,861
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.

567
00:50:01,038 --> 00:50:04,873
- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.

568
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:07,375
I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.

569
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:11,379
Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

570
00:50:11,548 --> 00:50:13,631
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

571
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:17,385
- Why?
- He and I are like that.

572
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:20,297
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

573
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:28,722
Makes a cute picture.

574
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:32,354
I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.

575
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:38,274
- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

576
00:50:38,617 --> 00:50:41,701
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

577
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:46,240
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

578
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,533
I think so. Here.

579
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,703
It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.

580
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,998
I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.

581
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:01,512
What's the matter?

582
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:06,764
- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.

583
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:10,764
I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.

584
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:17,229
Your phone.

585
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:24,945
Yes?

586
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:27,287
Uh, just a minute.

587
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:32,043
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.

588
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,797
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

589
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:47,134
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

590
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:49,428
Yes, sir. Same to you.

591
00:52:16,673 --> 00:52:19,131
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

592
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:21,509
The party's just starting.

593
00:52:21,678 --> 00:52:25,012
Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

594
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:30,769
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

595
00:53:06,973 --> 00:53:12,560
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

596
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,044
You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.

597
00:54:23,216 --> 00:54:25,299
Rum Collins.

598
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:36,636
Uh...

599
00:54:36,813 --> 00:54:40,477
Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.

600
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:54,487
You like Castro?

601
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:57,498
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

602
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:01,456
- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

603
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,747
- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?

604
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:07,167
Cause as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

605
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:10,678
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

606
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,803
That so?

607
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:15,717
All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.

608
00:55:15,894 --> 00:55:17,931
- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.

609
00:55:18,104 --> 00:55:20,642
He's in Havana, in jail.

610
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:24,309
- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.

611
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:28,196
He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.

612
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:30,698
Well, you can't win 'em all.

613
00:55:35,831 --> 00:55:39,450
<i>Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house</i>

614
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:41,709
Not a creature was stirrin'...

615
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,538
Nothin'. No action.

616
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:47,961
Dullsville.

617
00:55:48,134 --> 00:55:50,217
- You married?
- No.

618
00:55:50,387 --> 00:55:52,470
- Family?
- No.

619
00:55:53,223 --> 00:55:57,843
A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.

620
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:03,561
I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.

621
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,897
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

622
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:14,534
Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?

623
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:18,037
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?

624
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:24,744
I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years...

625
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:29,507
you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

626
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:32,259
It's not that easy.

627
00:56:33,513 --> 00:56:38,258
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

628
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:40,427
I can't bring it up now.

629
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:47,438
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

630
00:56:49,738 --> 00:56:54,108
That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.

631
00:56:55,076 --> 00:56:59,366
Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

632
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,704
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

633
00:57:03,877 --> 00:57:06,369
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

634
00:57:07,297 --> 00:57:09,414
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

635
00:57:10,467 --> 00:57:13,301
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

636
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:18,056
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

637
00:57:18,224 --> 00:57:21,308
Well, I never was very good at history.

638
00:57:21,978 --> 00:57:26,222
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

639
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:29,483
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

640
00:57:29,653 --> 00:57:31,986
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

641
00:57:32,155 --> 00:57:35,990
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

642
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:38,902
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

643
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:43,164
But ask yourself: why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

644
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:47,077
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

645
00:57:47,253 --> 00:57:50,496
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

646
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:56,127
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

647
00:57:56,304 --> 00:58:00,844
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

648
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:04,719
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

649
00:58:07,023 --> 00:58:09,515
- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?

650
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,698
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

651
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:24,205
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.

652
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:27,041
Oh, I have a present for you.

653
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:31,545
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

654
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:35,208
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

655
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:43,390
They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

656
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:59,240
I didn't realize it was so late. It's quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

657
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:03,995
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

658
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:08,374
OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

659
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:10,580
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

660
00:59:10,754 --> 00:59:14,873
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

661
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:19,090
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

662
00:59:19,262 --> 00:59:21,379
Stop it, Fran.

663
00:59:22,432 --> 00:59:24,515
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

664
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:34,691
Are you coming?

665
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:37,444
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

666
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:40,106
Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.

667
00:59:40,283 --> 00:59:43,867
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

668
00:59:44,037 --> 00:59:47,280
and Monday again, and Thursday again.

669
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,118
It won't always be like this, Fran.

670
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:54,412
I love you.

671
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:56,876
Careful. Lipstick.

672
00:59:58,134 --> 01:00:00,251
Merry Christmas.

673
01:02:27,492 --> 01:02:31,031
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.

674
01:02:31,204 --> 01:02:34,743
- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.

675
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,999
I work for the outfit.

676
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:45,336
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

677
01:02:53,518 --> 01:02:55,760
O- U-T. Out!

678
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:03,355
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

679
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:09,357
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.

680
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:26,382
Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...

681
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:28,713
Would you like to see his picture?

682
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:30,969
Not particularly.

683
01:03:32,348 --> 01:03:37,093
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

684
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,387
Like a little Chihuahua.

685
01:03:52,118 --> 01:03:55,282
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

686
01:03:55,455 --> 01:03:57,412
You got a girlfriend?

687
01:03:57,582 --> 01:04:00,416
She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.

688
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:04,750
- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.

689
01:04:04,922 --> 01:04:07,630
- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.

690
01:04:08,092 --> 01:04:14,464
C. C. Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

691
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,099
I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.

692
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:21,474
This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

693
01:04:31,949 --> 01:04:34,737
Say! This is snugsville!

694
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:37,449
Mrs. MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you...

695
01:04:37,622 --> 01:04:40,956
you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.

696
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:43,788
- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.

697
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:47,955
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go... and I may go just like that...

698
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:51,000
I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.

699
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:54,136
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.

700
01:04:54,305 --> 01:04:57,594
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

701
01:04:57,767 --> 01:05:00,635
Let's not waste any more time
preliminarywise.

702
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:02,849
I'm with you, lover.

703
01:06:19,432 --> 01:06:21,924
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

704
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:24,889
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

705
01:06:25,062 --> 01:06:29,432
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

706
01:06:32,236 --> 01:06:37,573
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

707
01:06:38,242 --> 01:06:40,279
O- U-T, out!

708
01:06:41,412 --> 01:06:43,529
Come on, wake up.

709
01:06:50,004 --> 01:06:51,996
Oh my God.

710
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:54,256
Miss Kubelik?

711
01:06:54,926 --> 01:06:57,043
Miss Kubelik?

712
01:07:06,771 --> 01:07:09,639
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

713
01:07:09,815 --> 01:07:12,933
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

714
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:17,233
I didn't mean right now!

715
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:22,276
Dr. Dreyfuss.

716
01:07:22,787 --> 01:07:24,870
Doc!

717
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:29,825
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

718
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:32,119
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

719
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,583
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

720
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,468
You're gonna wear yourself out.

721
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:43,805
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

722
01:07:43,975 --> 01:07:45,967
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

723
01:07:46,143 --> 01:07:48,305
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

724
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:51,768
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

725
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:53,978
Not this one. In there, Doc.

726
01:07:54,986 --> 01:07:58,650
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

727
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:00,314
My shoes!

728
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:03,484
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

729
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:06,324
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

730
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:11,959
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

731
01:08:12,128 --> 01:08:14,165
You fink!

732
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:31,679
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

733
01:08:31,856 --> 01:08:35,850
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

734
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:39,020
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

735
01:08:39,196 --> 01:08:41,779
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

736
01:08:41,949 --> 01:08:44,692
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

737
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:47,577
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

738
01:09:42,468 --> 01:09:44,585
Bring my bag.

739
01:09:54,397 --> 01:09:56,434
Roll up her right sleeve.

740
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,283
Hold that.

741
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,329
Nice veins.

742
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:31,841
Wanna tell me what happened?

743
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:34,725
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

744
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:41,476
You see, we had... some words earlier.

745
01:10:41,652 --> 01:10:45,817
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

746
01:10:46,949 --> 01:10:49,657
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

747
01:10:49,827 --> 01:10:54,618
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

748
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,326
Yes, you are.

749
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:09,674
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

750
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:30,524
Get the coffee.

751
01:11:54,058 --> 01:11:56,926
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

752
01:12:12,243 --> 01:12:14,235
What's her name?

753
01:12:14,411 --> 01:12:17,119
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

754
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:25,671
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

755
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,048
Do you understand what I'm saying?

756
01:12:29,802 --> 01:12:33,261
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

757
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:36,389
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

758
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,179
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

759
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:44,894
- Doctor?
- Dr. Dreyfuss.

760
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:48,901
Dreyfuss.

761
01:12:49,071 --> 01:12:51,108
Get more coffee.

762
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:54,483
Now tell me again. What's my name?

763
01:12:57,663 --> 01:12:59,996
Dr... Dreyfuss.

764
01:13:00,165 --> 01:13:02,282
And what happened to you?

765
01:13:02,793 --> 01:13:04,455
I...

766
01:13:04,628 --> 01:13:06,745
I took sleeping pills.

767
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:09,790
Do you know where you are?

768
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,049
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

769
01:13:16,974 --> 01:13:19,011
I don't know.

770
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:21,977
Do you know who that is?

771
01:13:28,694 --> 01:13:30,811
Look at him.

772
01:13:31,822 --> 01:13:34,781
Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.

773
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:37,488
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

774
01:13:37,953 --> 01:13:40,536
Mr? Miss? Such politeness!

775
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:45,834
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

776
01:13:47,463 --> 01:13:50,171
What are you doing here?

777
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:55,385
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

778
01:13:55,554 --> 01:13:57,921
Oh, yes. The office party.

779
01:13:58,098 --> 01:14:00,681
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

780
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:03,719
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

781
01:14:03,896 --> 01:14:07,310
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

782
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:11,522
I don't understand.

783
01:14:11,695 --> 01:14:16,941
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

784
01:14:17,993 --> 01:14:20,201
I'm so tired.

785
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:22,454
Come on. Drink this.

786
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,453
Please... just let me sleep.

787
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:29,336
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

788
01:14:29,922 --> 01:14:32,039
Let's get her walking.

789
01:14:34,677 --> 01:14:39,217
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

790
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,928
One, two, three, four!

791
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:44,388
One, two, three, four!

792
01:14:44,561 --> 01:14:46,723
Left, right, left, right...

793
01:14:46,897 --> 01:14:49,059
left, right and return!

794
01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:52,397
And... one, two, three, four!

795
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:55,937
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

796
01:14:56,115 --> 01:14:59,324
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

797
01:14:59,493 --> 01:15:02,110
One, two... And return again.

798
01:15:02,287 --> 01:15:05,451
And... left, right, left, right.

799
01:15:12,631 --> 01:15:15,920
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

800
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:19,757
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

801
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,047
Just as long as she's OK.

802
01:15:22,182 --> 01:15:27,598
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

803
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:30,889
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

804
01:15:31,817 --> 01:15:34,275
How do you spell her last name?

805
01:15:34,445 --> 01:15:36,903
Kubelik. Two k's.

806
01:15:37,072 --> 01:15:39,109
What's her address?

807
01:15:39,825 --> 01:15:41,942
Where does she live?

808
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:45,408
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

809
01:15:46,457 --> 01:15:49,575
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

810
01:15:49,752 --> 01:15:54,668
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

811
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,957
There was no suicide note or anything.

812
01:15:57,134 --> 01:16:00,252
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

813
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:03,843
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

814
01:16:04,016 --> 01:16:07,885
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbor?

815
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:10,930
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

816
01:16:11,106 --> 01:16:14,224
But as your neighbor,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

817
01:16:14,401 --> 01:16:16,939
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

818
01:16:17,112 --> 01:16:19,479
I don't know what you did to that girl...

819
01:16:19,656 --> 01:16:22,148
but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

820
01:16:22,326 --> 01:16:24,818
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

821
01:16:26,705 --> 01:16:29,664
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.

822
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:32,166
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

823
01:16:32,336 --> 01:16:34,453
A mensch! A human being!

824
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,373
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

825
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:43,261
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

826
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:46,881
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

827
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:01,715
Mr. Baxter! Open up already.

828
01:18:04,928 --> 01:18:06,885
Oh.

829
01:18:07,055 --> 01:18:10,423
- Mrs. Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

830
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:12,638
What was going on here last night?

831
01:18:12,811 --> 01:18:16,145
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

832
01:18:16,315 --> 01:18:19,808
- Army maneuvers maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

833
01:18:20,068 --> 01:18:24,233
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

834
01:18:24,406 --> 01:18:29,822
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

835
01:18:30,078 --> 01:18:35,164
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

836
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:37,417
Come on, Oscar.

837
01:19:04,363 --> 01:19:08,983
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr. J. D. Sheldrake.

838
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:11,242
Make that person-to-person.

839
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:18,992
Five, four, three, two, one...

840
01:19:19,169 --> 01:19:21,707
Let her rip!

841
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,462
I'll get the phone.

842
01:19:23,632 --> 01:19:26,545
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

843
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:29,586
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

844
01:19:29,763 --> 01:19:33,803
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

845
01:19:33,976 --> 01:19:38,095
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

846
01:19:38,272 --> 01:19:42,016
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

847
01:19:42,818 --> 01:19:45,356
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

848
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:48,693
A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.

849
01:19:48,865 --> 01:19:51,448
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

850
01:19:51,618 --> 01:19:57,205
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

851
01:19:57,374 --> 01:20:00,617
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

852
01:20:00,877 --> 01:20:04,541
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

853
01:20:04,715 --> 01:20:09,801
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

854
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:13,134
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

855
01:20:14,474 --> 01:20:18,434
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

856
01:20:18,603 --> 01:20:21,971
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

857
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:23,936
Yes, Baxter.

858
01:20:24,109 --> 01:20:26,317
Just how serious is it?

859
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:30,189
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

860
01:20:30,365 --> 01:20:33,233
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

861
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:38,872
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

862
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:43,411
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

863
01:20:43,587 --> 01:20:47,922
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

864
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:50,754
Well, it was just a suggestion.

865
01:20:50,927 --> 01:20:54,796
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble...

866
01:20:54,973 --> 01:20:57,511
policewise or newspaperwise.

867
01:20:58,727 --> 01:21:03,062
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

868
01:21:03,231 --> 01:21:05,723
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

869
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:08,776
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

870
01:21:08,945 --> 01:21:11,733
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

871
01:21:11,907 --> 01:21:16,117
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

872
01:21:16,286 --> 01:21:20,121
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

873
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,624
and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

874
01:21:24,294 --> 01:21:27,753
OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

875
01:21:27,923 --> 01:21:31,462
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

876
01:21:31,927 --> 01:21:34,135
Well, I'll... think of something.

877
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:36,841
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

878
01:21:39,684 --> 01:21:41,801
I'm sorry.

879
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:46,098
- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

880
01:21:46,274 --> 01:21:49,438
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

881
01:21:49,611 --> 01:21:52,194
Here. Let me help you.

882
01:21:52,823 --> 01:21:54,815
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

883
01:21:54,991 --> 01:21:56,983
Why didn't you just let me die?

884
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:02,656
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

885
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:04,290
Oh!

886
01:22:04,459 --> 01:22:08,703
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

887
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,623
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

888
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,008
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

889
01:22:14,177 --> 01:22:16,590
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

890
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:19,176
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

891
01:22:19,349 --> 01:22:22,467
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

892
01:22:22,644 --> 01:22:26,137
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

893
01:22:26,314 --> 01:22:29,807
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

894
01:22:29,985 --> 01:22:32,693
Here. Put that on.

895
01:23:01,349 --> 01:23:05,059
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

896
01:23:05,228 --> 01:23:07,220
I'll fix you some coffee.

897
01:23:07,397 --> 01:23:11,687
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

898
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,897
Back in a minute.

899
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,572
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

900
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:29,538
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

901
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:34,172
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

902
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:36,549
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

903
01:23:36,718 --> 01:23:39,711
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

904
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:46,017
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriagewise.

905
01:23:46,186 --> 01:23:49,600
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

906
01:23:49,773 --> 01:23:52,937
But for her, I'll fix a
little something to eat.

907
01:24:01,451 --> 01:24:03,113
Who are you calling?

908
01:24:03,286 --> 01:24:05,403
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

909
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:10,575
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

910
01:24:11,294 --> 01:24:15,254
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

911
01:24:15,423 --> 01:24:18,461
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

912
01:24:18,635 --> 01:24:20,547
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

913
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,712
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

914
01:24:22,889 --> 01:24:24,630
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

915
01:24:24,808 --> 01:24:27,141
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

916
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,472
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

917
01:24:29,646 --> 01:24:32,730
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

918
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:35,642
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

919
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:37,811
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

920
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:40,776
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

921
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:45,819
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

922
01:24:45,996 --> 01:24:49,114
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

923
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:52,455
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

924
01:24:52,627 --> 01:24:55,711
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

925
01:24:56,506 --> 01:24:58,623
Thanks for reminding me!

926
01:25:02,345 --> 01:25:04,337
I didn't mean it that way.

927
01:25:04,514 --> 01:25:08,633
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

928
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:11,518
He doesn't give a damn about me.

929
01:25:11,688 --> 01:25:15,352
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

930
01:25:15,525 --> 01:25:17,767
But that's not the worst part.

931
01:25:17,944 --> 01:25:20,186
The worst part is I still love him.

932
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:26,529
Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

933
01:25:26,703 --> 01:25:30,196
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

934
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:33,958
So where's the victim?

935
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:37,044
Max the Knife!

936
01:25:39,633 --> 01:25:43,843
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

937
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:49,349
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

938
01:25:49,517 --> 01:25:53,887
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

939
01:25:54,064 --> 01:25:56,977
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

940
01:25:57,150 --> 01:26:00,314
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

941
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:03,901
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

942
01:26:04,074 --> 01:26:05,406
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

943
01:26:05,575 --> 01:26:08,192
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

944
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:10,362
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

945
01:26:10,538 --> 01:26:13,622
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

946
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:17,081
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

947
01:26:17,253 --> 01:26:20,212
Clean and cut, a regular Ivy Leaguer.

948
01:26:20,382 --> 01:26:24,752
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

949
01:26:24,928 --> 01:26:26,920
With the no napkins.

950
01:26:27,097 --> 01:26:31,091
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

951
01:26:31,267 --> 01:26:33,850
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

952
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:38,105
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man... a widower, maybe...

953
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:41,938
and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.

954
01:26:42,112 --> 01:26:45,230
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

955
01:26:45,407 --> 01:26:47,194
Shh.

956
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:51,444
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

957
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:54,739
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

958
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:58,785
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

959
01:26:58,962 --> 01:27:01,545
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

960
01:27:02,799 --> 01:27:06,634
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

961
01:27:06,803 --> 01:27:09,295
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

962
01:27:09,472 --> 01:27:14,684
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

963
01:27:15,895 --> 01:27:18,933
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

964
01:27:19,107 --> 01:27:20,643
Yes. I've got it.

965
01:27:20,817 --> 01:27:25,152
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

966
01:27:25,321 --> 01:27:27,404
Open it.

967
01:27:30,994 --> 01:27:33,577
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

968
01:27:33,747 --> 01:27:37,161
That's right. Will you see
that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?

969
01:27:38,293 --> 01:27:40,330
Sure.

970
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:43,921
Take this away, will you?

971
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:47,379
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

972
01:27:47,552 --> 01:27:50,295
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

973
01:27:50,472 --> 01:27:54,432
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

974
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:58,311
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

975
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:03,145
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo...

976
01:28:03,318 --> 01:28:06,026
then came home and cleaned up
after Mr. Eichelberger.

977
01:28:06,196 --> 01:28:08,529
He had a little eggnog party here.

978
01:28:08,698 --> 01:28:10,985
So I'm way ahead this year.

979
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:13,867
Three across. Spades double?

980
01:28:14,037 --> 01:28:16,074
High deals.

981
01:28:16,706 --> 01:28:18,823
Six? Eight.

982
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,713
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

983
01:28:30,887 --> 01:28:32,719
Give what up?

984
01:28:35,725 --> 01:28:38,763
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

985
01:28:40,146 --> 01:28:42,229
I know what you mean.

986
01:28:45,401 --> 01:28:47,518
Queen.

987
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,732
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

988
01:28:57,539 --> 01:29:01,874
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

989
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:05,377
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

990
01:29:07,006 --> 01:29:11,751
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

991
01:29:11,928 --> 01:29:14,011
A cemetery?

992
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:16,888
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

993
01:29:17,058 --> 01:29:21,223
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

994
01:29:22,605 --> 01:29:24,722
Uh, gin.

995
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:33,357
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

996
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:35,570
I have this talent for falling in love...

997
01:29:35,743 --> 01:29:39,236
with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

998
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:42,164
Well, how many guys were there?

999
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:45,125
Three.

1000
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:49,209
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

1001
01:29:49,382 --> 01:29:51,374
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1002
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:55,340
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1003
01:29:56,806 --> 01:29:58,923
Cut.

1004
01:29:59,559 --> 01:30:04,600
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1005
01:30:04,772 --> 01:30:09,608
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1006
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:11,939
But I flunked the typing test.

1007
01:30:12,113 --> 01:30:14,821
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1008
01:30:14,991 --> 01:30:17,108
I just can't spell.

1009
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:23,160
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1010
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:25,825
And that's how I met Jeff.

1011
01:30:27,003 --> 01:30:29,620
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1012
01:30:29,797 --> 01:30:32,255
What am I gonna do now?

1013
01:30:34,385 --> 01:30:36,672
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1014
01:30:38,264 --> 01:30:41,098
Was he very upset when you told him?

1015
01:30:41,267 --> 01:30:43,350
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1016
01:30:44,604 --> 01:30:48,268
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1017
01:30:48,441 --> 01:30:49,852
I'm sure that's it.

1018
01:30:50,026 --> 01:30:53,440
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1019
01:30:54,822 --> 01:30:57,030
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1020
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,193
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1021
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,703
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1022
01:31:02,872 --> 01:31:06,786
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1023
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,328
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1024
01:31:10,505 --> 01:31:14,670
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1025
01:31:15,802 --> 01:31:18,510
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1026
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:22,803
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1027
01:31:22,976 --> 01:31:26,060
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1028
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:35,653
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1029
01:31:35,822 --> 01:31:37,688
Gin.

1030
01:31:41,995 --> 01:31:46,990
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1031
01:31:47,709 --> 01:31:51,202
Spades are double... 154.

1032
01:31:56,342 --> 01:31:58,425
Blitzed. Two games.

1033
01:33:28,518 --> 01:33:31,852
All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1034
01:33:39,695 --> 01:33:41,482
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?

1035
01:33:41,656 --> 01:33:43,648
What do I want? Just a minute.

1036
01:33:43,825 --> 01:33:46,442
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1037
01:33:46,619 --> 01:33:48,656
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1038
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:51,072
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1039
01:33:51,249 --> 01:33:54,742
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1040
01:33:54,919 --> 01:33:58,708
Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1041
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:02,333
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?

1042
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:05,594
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1043
01:34:11,352 --> 01:34:14,686
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1044
01:34:14,856 --> 01:34:16,893
Mildred!

1045
01:34:18,484 --> 01:34:22,899
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1046
01:34:23,072 --> 01:34:25,155
No!

1047
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:31,570
Well, I don't blame you.

1048
01:34:31,747 --> 01:34:34,740
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelikwise.

1049
01:34:34,917 --> 01:34:37,409
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1050
01:34:37,753 --> 01:34:39,836
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1051
01:34:54,896 --> 01:34:56,933
Who was that?

1052
01:34:57,607 --> 01:35:01,191
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1053
01:35:01,986 --> 01:35:04,729
Would you mind opening that window?

1054
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:12,787
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1055
01:35:12,955 --> 01:35:16,289
It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1056
01:35:16,459 --> 01:35:19,042
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1057
01:35:19,462 --> 01:35:22,796
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1058
01:35:22,965 --> 01:35:25,457
- Who'd care?
- I would.

1059
01:35:31,224 --> 01:35:35,013
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1060
01:35:36,062 --> 01:35:38,145
Yeah. Well...

1061
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:41,766
That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1062
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:45,443
Go to sleep.

1063
01:36:19,689 --> 01:36:24,525
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1064
01:36:33,869 --> 01:36:37,829
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!

1065
01:36:37,999 --> 01:36:40,616
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1066
01:36:40,793 --> 01:36:45,379
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1067
01:36:45,548 --> 01:36:48,040
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1068
01:36:48,217 --> 01:36:51,130
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1069
01:36:51,304 --> 01:36:54,342
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1070
01:36:55,057 --> 01:36:57,549
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1071
01:36:57,727 --> 01:37:02,142
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1072
01:37:02,315 --> 01:37:05,399
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1073
01:37:05,568 --> 01:37:07,685
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1074
01:37:16,412 --> 01:37:20,577
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.

1075
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:23,584
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1076
01:37:39,935 --> 01:37:43,394
- Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1077
01:37:44,273 --> 01:37:46,105
Yes. She's in the shower.

1078
01:37:46,275 --> 01:37:48,938
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1079
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:52,695
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

1080
01:37:52,865 --> 01:37:55,983
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1081
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,526
Oh.

1082
01:37:57,703 --> 01:38:01,492
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1083
01:38:01,665 --> 01:38:04,282
But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.

1084
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:08,044
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1085
01:38:08,214 --> 01:38:10,297
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1086
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:14,209
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1087
01:38:15,304 --> 01:38:18,923
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1088
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,058
There's a call for you!

1089
01:38:22,228 --> 01:38:24,720
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

1090
01:38:26,649 --> 01:38:28,641
I don't wanna talk to him.

1091
01:38:28,818 --> 01:38:30,730
I think you should.

1092
01:38:30,903 --> 01:38:36,274
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1093
01:38:37,076 --> 01:38:39,159
I'll be right back. OK?

1094
01:38:59,598 --> 01:39:01,681
Hello, Jeff.

1095
01:39:03,102 --> 01:39:06,220
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1096
01:39:06,397 --> 01:39:08,855
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1097
01:39:09,024 --> 01:39:11,687
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1098
01:39:11,861 --> 01:39:16,572
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1099
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:18,652
Fran?

1100
01:39:19,243 --> 01:39:21,860
Are you there, Fran?

1101
01:39:23,289 --> 01:39:27,750
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1102
01:39:27,918 --> 01:39:31,753
I never took those pills,
I never loved you...

1103
01:39:31,922 --> 01:39:34,209
we never even met.

1104
01:39:35,384 --> 01:39:39,378
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1105
01:39:39,555 --> 01:39:42,298
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1106
01:39:42,475 --> 01:39:45,593
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1107
01:40:03,913 --> 01:40:06,451
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1108
01:40:06,624 --> 01:40:10,834
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1109
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:15,334
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1110
01:40:15,508 --> 01:40:18,171
It concerns your husband.

1111
01:40:18,344 --> 01:40:22,088
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1112
01:40:28,354 --> 01:40:30,596
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1113
01:40:30,773 --> 01:40:32,810
Just making a personal call.

1114
01:40:34,485 --> 01:40:36,568
Here's a dime.

1115
01:40:39,323 --> 01:40:40,939
Going down.

1116
01:40:53,295 --> 01:40:55,833
Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1117
01:40:56,006 --> 01:40:58,623
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1118
01:40:58,801 --> 01:41:01,544
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1119
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,803
Gas?!

1120
01:41:12,856 --> 01:41:14,973
Miss Kubelik?

1121
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:18,856
Miss Kubelik!

1122
01:41:21,532 --> 01:41:23,649
- You all right?
- Sure!

1123
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:27,657
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1124
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:30,743
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1125
01:41:30,916 --> 01:41:34,330
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1126
01:41:34,503 --> 01:41:38,247
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1127
01:41:38,424 --> 01:41:41,838
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1128
01:41:42,011 --> 01:41:46,130
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3½ pair.

1129
01:41:46,307 --> 01:41:48,720
Things are a little disorganized
around here.

1130
01:41:48,976 --> 01:41:52,765
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1131
01:41:52,938 --> 01:41:57,854
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

1132
01:41:58,027 --> 01:42:00,690
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1133
01:42:00,863 --> 01:42:03,401
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1134
01:42:03,574 --> 01:42:06,362
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1135
01:42:06,535 --> 01:42:10,870
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick...

1136
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,704
a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1137
01:42:14,877 --> 01:42:18,120
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1138
01:42:18,297 --> 01:42:22,382
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1139
01:42:22,551 --> 01:42:25,635
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1140
01:42:27,306 --> 01:42:29,798
- He's a taker.
- What?

1141
01:42:30,392 --> 01:42:32,554
Some people take, some people get took.

1142
01:42:32,728 --> 01:42:36,722
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1143
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:38,982
I wouldn't say that.

1144
01:42:39,735 --> 01:42:41,727
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1145
01:42:41,904 --> 01:42:45,068
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1146
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,106
I really should be getting home.

1147
01:42:47,368 --> 01:42:50,327
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1148
01:42:50,496 --> 01:42:54,911
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1149
01:42:55,959 --> 01:43:00,203
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1150
01:43:00,381 --> 01:43:03,294
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1151
01:43:03,467 --> 01:43:09,088
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think
it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1152
01:43:09,264 --> 01:43:11,756
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1153
01:43:11,934 --> 01:43:13,846
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1154
01:43:14,019 --> 01:43:15,760
I tried to do it with a gun.

1155
01:43:15,938 --> 01:43:18,976
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1156
01:43:19,149 --> 01:43:24,144
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1157
01:43:24,321 --> 01:43:28,440
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a.45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1158
01:43:28,617 --> 01:43:30,654
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1159
01:43:30,828 --> 01:43:33,445
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1160
01:43:33,622 --> 01:43:37,957
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1161
01:43:38,127 --> 01:43:41,791
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1162
01:43:43,132 --> 01:43:45,795
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1163
01:43:45,968 --> 01:43:47,800
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1164
01:43:47,970 --> 01:43:50,462
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1165
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,972
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1166
01:43:53,142 --> 01:43:56,476
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1167
01:43:56,645 --> 01:44:00,264
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1168
01:44:00,441 --> 01:44:03,605
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1169
01:44:05,154 --> 01:44:08,864
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1170
01:44:09,032 --> 01:44:11,399
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1171
01:44:11,577 --> 01:44:13,990
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1172
01:44:14,163 --> 01:44:16,155
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1173
01:44:16,331 --> 01:44:18,493
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1174
01:44:18,667 --> 01:44:21,910
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1175
01:44:22,087 --> 01:44:26,172
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1176
01:44:26,341 --> 01:44:29,550
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1177
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:33,009
Yes, Nurse.

1178
01:44:47,112 --> 01:44:50,355
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1179
01:44:50,532 --> 01:44:55,698
- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1180
01:44:55,871 --> 01:45:00,161
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21st floor.

1181
01:45:00,334 --> 01:45:02,121
Thanks.

1182
01:45:04,505 --> 01:45:09,045
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1183
01:45:09,218 --> 01:45:10,459
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1184
01:45:10,636 --> 01:45:13,720
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1185
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:18,384
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1186
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,142
AWOL, hm?

1187
01:45:20,312 --> 01:45:22,850
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1188
01:45:23,023 --> 01:45:26,607
while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1189
01:45:28,237 --> 01:45:30,320
- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1190
01:45:31,323 --> 01:45:35,488
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1191
01:45:35,661 --> 01:45:37,118
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1192
01:45:37,287 --> 01:45:41,122
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1193
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:43,658
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous

1194
01:45:43,836 --> 01:45:46,419
cause Fran hasn't been home
for two days.

1195
01:45:46,588 --> 01:45:47,920
That so?

1196
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:51,083
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1197
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,671
I see.

1198
01:45:52,845 --> 01:45:56,429
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1199
01:45:56,598 --> 01:45:59,966
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1200
01:46:00,143 --> 01:46:03,682
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1201
01:46:05,816 --> 01:46:08,229
Who is Buddy-boy?

1202
01:46:32,384 --> 01:46:36,219
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1203
01:46:36,388 --> 01:46:40,553
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1204
01:46:42,561 --> 01:46:45,520
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1205
01:46:45,689 --> 01:46:49,729
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious livingwise.

1206
01:46:52,988 --> 01:46:54,354
<i>♪ Meatball</i>

1207
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,696
<i>♪ Meatball</i>

1208
01:47:08,837 --> 01:47:11,830
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1209
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,627
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1210
01:47:17,804 --> 01:47:20,012
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1211
01:47:20,182 --> 01:47:23,346
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1212
01:47:23,518 --> 01:47:25,555
and there you were.

1213
01:47:26,438 --> 01:47:28,680
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1214
01:47:28,857 --> 01:47:32,692
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1215
01:47:32,861 --> 01:47:35,604
Or sometimes Dinah Shore or Perry Como.

1216
01:47:35,781 --> 01:47:39,741
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1217
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:42,744
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1218
01:47:42,913 --> 01:47:44,950
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1219
01:47:45,123 --> 01:47:47,365
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1220
01:47:47,542 --> 01:47:49,909
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1221
01:47:50,087 --> 01:47:52,795
So keep a clear head.

1222
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:57,584
Cause I don't wanna take advantage of
you, the way I did yesterday in bed.

1223
01:47:57,761 --> 01:47:59,923
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1224
01:48:09,064 --> 01:48:11,727
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1225
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:15,564
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...

1226
01:48:15,737 --> 01:48:20,072
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1227
01:48:20,242 --> 01:48:22,985
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.

1228
01:48:23,161 --> 01:48:26,745
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1229
01:48:26,915 --> 01:48:29,373
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1230
01:48:29,543 --> 01:48:32,456
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1231
01:48:41,638 --> 01:48:43,550
Want a martini?

1232
01:48:47,686 --> 01:48:51,430
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1233
01:48:57,112 --> 01:48:59,729
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1234
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:07,613
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1235
01:49:12,127 --> 01:49:14,119
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1236
01:49:14,296 --> 01:49:16,288
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1237
01:49:16,465 --> 01:49:18,502
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1238
01:49:19,217 --> 01:49:24,133
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1239
01:49:24,306 --> 01:49:26,719
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1240
01:49:26,892 --> 01:49:30,806
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1241
01:49:30,979 --> 01:49:33,096
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1242
01:49:33,273 --> 01:49:36,437
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1243
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:39,819
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1244
01:49:39,988 --> 01:49:42,480
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1245
01:49:42,657 --> 01:49:44,649
You?

1246
01:49:44,826 --> 01:49:46,658
Who else?

1247
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,583
Leave him alone!

1248
01:49:55,921 --> 01:49:59,085
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1249
01:50:01,343 --> 01:50:04,507
- Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1250
01:50:10,393 --> 01:50:12,510
Goodbye, Doctor.

1251
01:50:14,356 --> 01:50:19,192
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1252
01:50:21,404 --> 01:50:24,272
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1253
01:50:24,449 --> 01:50:26,156
Let me get my bag.

1254
01:50:28,411 --> 01:50:30,403
Don't bother, Doc.

1255
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:32,663
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1256
01:50:54,437 --> 01:50:56,724
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C. C. Baxter.

1257
01:50:56,898 --> 01:51:00,107
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1258
01:51:00,277 --> 01:51:02,394
Will you call me back, please?

1259
01:51:05,115 --> 01:51:08,233
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1260
01:51:09,411 --> 01:51:11,448
All your troubles are over.

1261
01:51:12,622 --> 01:51:15,490
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1262
01:51:16,293 --> 01:51:18,785
The plain fact is, I love her.

1263
01:51:19,671 --> 01:51:22,254
I thought you should be the first to know.

1264
01:51:22,424 --> 01:51:25,258
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1265
01:51:25,427 --> 01:51:29,512
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1266
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:33,095
So I think it would be best all around.

1267
01:51:33,268 --> 01:51:34,679
Solutionwise.

1268
01:51:34,853 --> 01:51:36,094
Yes?

1269
01:51:36,271 --> 01:51:38,388
I'll be right up.

1270
01:51:38,565 --> 01:51:41,933
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1271
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:44,147
All your troubles are over.

1272
01:51:48,450 --> 01:51:50,612
19.

1273
01:51:50,785 --> 01:51:54,449
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1274
01:51:54,623 --> 01:51:57,491
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1275
01:51:57,667 --> 01:52:00,751
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1276
01:52:00,879 --> 01:52:02,461
27.

1277
01:52:02,631 --> 01:52:05,044
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1278
01:52:05,217 --> 01:52:08,176
made me realize
how lonely I'd been before.

1279
01:52:08,345 --> 01:52:11,838
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1280
01:52:12,015 --> 01:52:15,008
If I can ever square things with her family.

1281
01:52:15,185 --> 01:52:17,472
Good morning. C. C. Baxter.

1282
01:52:21,566 --> 01:52:23,649
- 'Mr. Baxter is here.'
- Send him in.

1283
01:52:25,862 --> 01:52:28,730
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1284
01:52:28,907 --> 01:52:30,990
And I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1285
01:52:31,159 --> 01:52:33,321
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1286
01:52:33,828 --> 01:52:36,992
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1287
01:52:37,165 --> 01:52:39,999
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1288
01:52:40,168 --> 01:52:43,002
- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.

1289
01:52:43,171 --> 01:52:45,663
I've moved out of the house.

1290
01:52:46,591 --> 01:52:49,550
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1291
01:52:49,719 --> 01:52:52,678
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1292
01:52:52,847 --> 01:52:57,638
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1293
01:52:57,811 --> 01:52:59,347
Yeah.

1294
01:52:59,521 --> 01:53:01,262
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1295
01:53:03,566 --> 01:53:07,185
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1296
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:10,529
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1297
01:53:10,699 --> 01:53:12,736
This way, Baxter.

1298
01:53:15,996 --> 01:53:18,409
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1299
01:53:19,416 --> 01:53:21,908
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1300
01:53:22,085 --> 01:53:27,251
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1301
01:53:27,424 --> 01:53:29,837
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1302
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:34,254
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1303
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:37,139
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1304
01:53:37,309 --> 01:53:42,270
I think she's the kind of girl that
definitely ought to be married to... someone.

1305
01:53:42,439 --> 01:53:47,935
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1306
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:50,945
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1307
01:53:51,114 --> 01:53:54,528
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1308
01:53:54,701 --> 01:53:57,318
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1309
01:53:57,495 --> 01:54:02,081
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1310
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:04,617
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1311
01:54:04,794 --> 01:54:07,537
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1312
01:54:28,651 --> 01:54:30,688
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1313
01:54:30,862 --> 01:54:32,319
Oh.

1314
01:54:32,489 --> 01:54:35,232
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1315
01:54:35,408 --> 01:54:38,071
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1316
01:54:38,244 --> 01:54:41,032
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1317
01:54:41,206 --> 01:54:44,199
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1318
01:54:45,877 --> 01:54:48,210
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1319
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:50,918
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1320
01:54:51,091 --> 01:54:53,674
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1321
01:54:53,843 --> 01:54:57,302
- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1322
01:54:57,472 --> 01:54:59,464
You were wrong about me too.

1323
01:54:59,641 --> 01:55:02,759
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1324
01:55:02,936 --> 01:55:06,100
Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?

1325
01:55:06,272 --> 01:55:10,733
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1326
01:55:10,902 --> 01:55:12,894
A paneled office, three windows.

1327
01:55:13,071 --> 01:55:16,064
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1328
01:55:16,241 --> 01:55:19,109
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1329
01:55:19,285 --> 01:55:25,031
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1330
01:55:28,461 --> 01:55:31,795
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1331
01:55:31,965 --> 01:55:37,211
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorcewise.

1332
01:55:37,387 --> 01:55:39,470
That's very wise.

1333
01:55:40,557 --> 01:55:43,049
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

1334
01:56:19,053 --> 01:56:22,421
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1335
01:56:22,599 --> 01:56:24,636
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1336
01:56:26,478 --> 01:56:32,270
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1337
01:56:32,442 --> 01:56:35,355
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1338
01:56:35,528 --> 01:56:38,487
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1339
01:56:38,656 --> 01:56:40,864
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1340
01:56:40,992 --> 01:56:42,984
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1341
01:56:43,161 --> 01:56:47,496
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1342
01:56:47,665 --> 01:56:49,827
If you don't mind?

1343
01:56:50,627 --> 01:56:54,120
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1344
01:56:54,297 --> 01:56:57,461
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik...

1345
01:56:57,634 --> 01:57:01,674
- ...I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1346
01:57:01,804 --> 01:57:04,091
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1347
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:08,388
- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1348
01:57:08,561 --> 01:57:10,928
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1349
01:57:11,105 --> 01:57:15,440
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1350
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:18,819
- How's that again?
- No key.

1351
01:57:20,698 --> 01:57:25,284
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1352
01:57:25,453 --> 01:57:28,867
Do you realize what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1353
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:32,374
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1354
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:35,537
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1355
01:57:35,713 --> 01:57:38,330
- You dig?
- I dig.

1356
01:57:39,467 --> 01:57:41,550
So what's it going to be?

1357
01:57:48,309 --> 01:57:51,427
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1358
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:11,493
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1359
01:58:11,666 --> 01:58:14,283
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1360
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:18,204
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1361
01:58:18,381 --> 01:58:21,749
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1362
01:58:21,926 --> 01:58:26,136
I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.

1363
01:58:26,306 --> 01:58:30,220
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.

1364
01:58:30,393 --> 01:58:32,476
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1365
01:59:08,056 --> 01:59:11,970
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1366
01:59:12,143 --> 01:59:14,226
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1367
01:59:14,395 --> 01:59:16,307
Well, I got things to do.

1368
01:59:16,481 --> 01:59:20,646
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1369
01:59:20,818 --> 01:59:22,650
Where are you moving to?

1370
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:25,813
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1371
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:27,982
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1372
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:32,870
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1373
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:36,203
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1374
01:59:36,376 --> 01:59:38,163
Say, why don't you join us?

1375
01:59:38,336 --> 01:59:43,297
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1376
01:59:43,466 --> 01:59:45,378
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1377
01:59:45,551 --> 01:59:49,761
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1378
01:59:49,931 --> 01:59:53,766
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbor.

1379
01:59:53,935 --> 01:59:56,643
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1380
01:59:57,897 --> 02:00:00,856
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1381
02:00:01,025 --> 02:00:03,733
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1382
02:00:47,155 --> 02:00:49,522
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1383
02:00:49,699 --> 02:00:52,112
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1384
02:00:52,285 --> 02:00:55,119
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1385
02:00:55,288 --> 02:00:59,874
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1386
02:01:00,877 --> 02:01:03,711
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1387
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:05,963
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1388
02:01:06,591 --> 02:01:09,925
I didn't plan it this way.
It's Baxter's fault.

1389
02:01:10,094 --> 02:01:11,050
Baxter?

1390
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:14,713
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1391
02:01:14,891 --> 02:01:17,429
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1392
02:01:17,602 --> 02:01:20,686
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1393
02:01:22,064 --> 02:01:26,104
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1394
02:01:26,277 --> 02:01:30,567
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1395
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:33,528
What's he got against you, anyway?

1396
02:01:33,701 --> 02:01:39,618
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookiewise.

1397
02:01:41,626 --> 02:01:44,084
What are you talking about?

1398
02:01:45,087 --> 02:01:48,376
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1399
02:01:53,513 --> 02:01:58,554
<i>♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

02:02:47,525 --> 02:02:49,608
Fran?

1408
02:02:50,862 --> 02:02:52,945
Where are you, Fran?

1409
02:03:11,048 --> 02:03:13,131
Mr. Baxter!

1410
02:03:13,384 --> 02:03:14,465
Mr. Baxter!

1411
02:03:14,927 --> 02:03:17,965
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1412
02:03:20,933 --> 02:03:22,219
Oh!

1413
02:03:22,393 --> 02:03:25,477
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1414
02:03:25,646 --> 02:03:28,138
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1415
02:03:28,858 --> 02:03:30,941
I'm fine all over.

1416
02:03:32,945 --> 02:03:36,279
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1417
02:03:40,119 --> 02:03:42,202
Let me get another glass.

1418
02:03:45,124 --> 02:03:47,207
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1419
02:03:47,376 --> 02:03:50,665
Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

1420
02:03:50,838 --> 02:03:53,125
I'm on my own.

1421
02:03:53,299 --> 02:03:55,382
That's funny. So am I.

1422
02:03:56,552 --> 02:03:58,794
What'd you do with the cards?

1423
02:03:58,971 --> 02:04:01,054
In there.

1424
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,352
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

1425
02:04:14,528 --> 02:04:17,646
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

1426
02:04:20,076 --> 02:04:22,159
Cut.

1427
02:04:23,788 --> 02:04:25,871
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1428
02:04:26,374 --> 02:04:28,161
Three.

1429
02:04:28,334 --> 02:04:29,495
Queen.

1430
02:04:29,669 --> 02:04:33,709
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1431
02:04:36,342 --> 02:04:38,425
Shut up and deal.
