1
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,820
Are you here to kill me?

2
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,020
I know what this is.

3
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,220
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

4
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,720
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

5
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,820
A man possessed of
some radical notions.

6
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,620
What is the most
resilient parasite?

7
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,220
A bacteria? A virus?

8
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,120
An intestinal worm?

9
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,419
What Mr Cobb is trying to say...

10
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,820
An idea.

11
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,619
Resilient. Highly contagious.

12
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,882
Once an idea has taken
hold of the brain,

13
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:07,820
it's almost impossible
to eradicate.

14
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,419
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

15
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,819
Right in there somewhere.

16
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,619
For someone like you to steal?

17
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,719
Yes. In the dream state, your
conscious defences are lowered...

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,319
and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

19
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,719
It's called extraction.

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,419
Mr Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself...

21
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,119
from even the most
skilled extractor.

22
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,419
How can you do that?

23
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,520
Because I am the most
skilled extractor.

24
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,420
I know how to search your mind and

25
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,319
find your secrets.
I know the tricks.

26
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,419
And I can teach them to you, so
that even when you're asleep...

27
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,920
your defence is never down.

28
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,806
Look, if you want my
help, you're gonna

29
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,719
have to be completely
open with me.

30
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,219
I need to know my way around your
thoughts better than your wife...

31
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,720
better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

32
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,819
If this is a dream, and you
have a safe full of secrets...

33
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,319
I need to know
what's in that safe.

34
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,020
In order for this all to work, you
need to completely let me in.

35
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

36
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,020
He knows.

37
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,520
What's going on up there?

38
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,420
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

39
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,119
Doesn't matter. I can
get it here. Trust me.

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,719
The information is in the safe.

41
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,120
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

42
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
What's she doing here?

43
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,319
Just head back to the room. All
right? I'll take care of this.

44
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

45
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,620
If I jumped, would I survive?

46
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,419
With a clean dive, perhaps.

47
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,219
Mal, what are you doing here?

48
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,620
I thought you might be missing me.

49
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,020
You know that I am.

50
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,120
But I can't trust you any more.

51
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,220
So what?

52
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,919
Looks like Arthur's taste.

53
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

54
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,120
Please, have a seat.

55
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
Tell me...

56
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
do the children miss me?

57
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,320
You can't imagine.

58
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,619
What are you doing?

59
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,320
Just getting some fresh air.

60
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Stay where you are, Mal.

61
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Goddamn it.

62
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,419
Turn around.

63
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,720
The gun, Dom.

64
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
Please.

65
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,620
Now the envelope, Mr Cobb.

66
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,420
Did she tell you? Or have
you known all along?

67
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,820
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

68
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,320
I want to know the
name of your employer.

69
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,119
Ah, there's no use threatening
him in a dream, right, Mal?

70
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,820
That depends on what
you're threatening.

71
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,820
Killing him would
just wake him up.

72
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,820
But pain...

73
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,620
Pain is in the mind.

74
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,520
And judging by the decor, we're
in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

75
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,542
What are you doing? It's too soon.

76
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:19,019
But the dream's collapsing.

77
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,771
I'm gonna try to
keep Saito under a

78
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:22,620
little bit longer.
We're almost there.

79
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,820
He was close. Very close.

80
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,720
Stop him.

81
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
This isn't gonna
work. Wake him up.

82
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,520
He won't wake.

83
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,220
- Give him the kick.
- What?

84
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
Dunk him.

85
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
He's out.

86
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,119
You came prepared?

87
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,035
Not even my head of security knows

88
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,120
this apartment. How
did you find it?

89
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,542
It's difficult for a
man of your position

90
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,419
to keep a love nest
like this secret...

91
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,119
particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

92
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,320
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

93
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,419
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

94
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,419
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.

95
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,219
You left out a key piece of
information, didn't you?

96
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,619
You held something back because
you knew what we were up to.

97
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,844
Question is, why'd you
let us in at all?

98
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:16,845
An audition.

99
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,819
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

100
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,720
We extracted every bit of
information you had in there.

101
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,420
But your deception was obvious.

102
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,529
So leave me and go.

103
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,619
You don't seem to
understand, Mr Saito.

104
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,019
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

105
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,420
We won't last two days.

106
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,519
Cobb?

107
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,819
Looks like I'm gonna have to
do this a little more simply.

108
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Tell us what you know. Tell
us what you know, now.

109
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,020
I've always hated this carpet.

110
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,520
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

111
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,420
But very definitely made of wool.

112
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,920
Right now...

113
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,420
I'm lying on polyester.

114
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,120
Which means I'm not lying on
my carpet, in my apartment.

115
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,220
You have lived up to your
reputation, Mr Cobb.

116
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm still dreaming.

117
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,220
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

118
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,720
Dream within a dream,
huh? I'm impressed.

119
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,519
But in my dream, you
play by my rules.

120
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,919
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr Saito...

121
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,519
We're not in your dream.

122
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,220
We're in mine.

123
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,219
Asshole. How do you
mess up the carpet?

124
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,719
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

125
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,019
I didn't know he was gonna
rub his cheek on it.

126
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,320
That's enough.

127
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,920
You. What the hell was all that?

128
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,460
I have it under control.

129
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,319
I'd hate to see you
out of control.

130
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,219
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

131
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,219
He's not gonna check
every compartment.

132
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,019
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

133
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Listen. Every man for himself.

134
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,419
Yes, hello?

135
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,220
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.

136
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,319
Hey, guys. Hey. How are
you? How you doing, huh?

137
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,719
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.

138
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,619
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

139
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,720
Yeah. When are you
coming home, Dad?

140
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,319
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I
can't. Not for a while, remember?

141
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,820
Why?

142
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,720
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

143
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,920
Grandma says you're
never coming back.

144
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,420
Phillipa, is that you?

145
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,719
Put Grandma on the phone
for me, will you?

146
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,620
She's shaking her head.

147
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,220
Well, just hope she's
wrong about that.

148
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,320
Daddy?

149
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,019
Yeah, James?

150
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,920
Is Mommy with you?

151
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,720
James, we talked about this.

152
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,420
Mommy's not here any more.

153
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,720
Where?

154
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,019
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

155
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,219
Listen, I'm gonna send some
presents with Grandpa, all right?

156
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,462
And you be good, you be...

157
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

158
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,520
Hey, are you okay?

159
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,519
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

160
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,119
Well, down in the
dream, Mal showing up.

161
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,519
Look, I'm, sorry about your
leg. Won't happen again.

162
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,852
It's getting worse, isn't it?

163
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:08,319
One apology's all you're
getting, all right?

164
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,919
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

165
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,519
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

166
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,519
to COBOL Engineering
two hours ago.

167
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,920
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

168
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,919
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

169
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,265
I can lie low there,
maybe sniff out

170
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,419
a job when things quiet down. You?

171
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,720
Stateside.

172
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,420
Send my regards.

173
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,420
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

174
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
So I offer you the satisfaction.

175
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,820
It's not the way I
deal with things.

176
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,020
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

177
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,920
But I can't speak for
COBOL Engineering.

178
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,420
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

179
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,419
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

180
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,719
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

181
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,819
why can't you plant
one there instead?

182
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,019
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

183
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,035
I say, "Don't think
about elephants."

184
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:39,519
What are you thinking about?

185
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,719
Elephants.

186
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,119
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

187
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,219
The subject's mind can always
trace the genesis of the idea.

188
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,543
True inspiration's
impossible to fake.

189
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:50,620
That's not true.

190
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,219
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

191
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,019
Because I can find my own way
to square things with COBOL.

192
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,319
Then you do have a choice.

193
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,220
Then I choose to leave, sir.

194
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,820
Tell the crew where
you want to go.

195
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,220
Hey, Mr Cobb.

196
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,420
How would you like to go home?

197
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,520
To America. To your children.

198
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,219
You can't fix that. No one can.

199
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,720
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

200
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,319
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

201
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,020
No idea is simple when you need to
plant it in somebody else's mind.

202
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,919
My main competitor is an
old man in poor health.

203
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,920
His son will soon inherit
control of the corporation.

204
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,320
I need him to decide to break
up his father's empire.

205
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,995
Cobb, we should walk
away from this.

206
00:20:57,996 --> 00:20:58,996
Hold on.

207
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,019
If I were to do this, if
I even could do it...

208
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,119
I'd need a guarantee.

209
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,520
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

210
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,620
But I can.

211
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,820
So do you want to take
a leap of faith...

212
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,019
or become an old man,
filled with regret...

213
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,820
waiting to die alone?

214
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,220
Assemble your team, Mr Cobb. And
choose your people more wisely.

215
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

216
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,719
This can't be done.

217
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,119
Yes, it can. Just have
to go deep enough.

218
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,820
You don't know that.

219
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,020
I've done it before.

220
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,420
Who'd you do it to?

221
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,620
Why are we going to Paris?

222
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,920
We're gonna need a new architect.

223
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,920
You never did like
your office, did you?

224
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,820
No space to think in
that broom cupboard.

225
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,920
Is it safe for you to be here?

226
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,519
Extradition between France
and the United States...

227
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,919
is a bureaucratic
nightmare, you know that.

228
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,819
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

229
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,297
Look, I, brought these
for you to give

230
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,519
to the kids when
you have a chance.

231
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,219
It'll take more than the
occasional stuffed animal...

232
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,419
to convince those children
they still have a father.

233
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,419
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

234
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,119
I never taught you to be a thief.

235
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,419
No, you taught me to
navigate people's minds.

236
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,919
But after what happened...

237
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,091
there weren't a whole
lot of legitimate

238
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,720
ways for me to use that skill.

239
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,320
What are you doing here, Dom?

240
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,819
I think I found a way home.

241
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,520
It's a job for some very,
very powerful people.

242
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,220
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

243
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,320
But I need your help.

244
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,219
You're here to corrupt one
of my brightest and best.

245
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,319
You know what I'm offering. Let
them decide for themselves.

246
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,919
- Money.
- Not just money.

247
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,419
You remember.

248
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,819
It's the chance to build
cathedrals, entire cities...

249
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,819
things that never existed...

250
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,119
things that couldn't
exist in the real world.

251
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,519
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

252
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,619
They don't actually
come into the dream.

253
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,493
They just design the
levels and teach

254
00:23:56,494 --> 00:23:58,119
them to the dreamers. That's all.

255
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,520
Design it yourself.

256
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,620
Mal won't let me.

257
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,020
Come back to reality, Dom.

258
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,920
- Please.
- Reality.

259
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,819
Those kids, your grandchildren...

260
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,841
they're waiting for
their father to

261
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,919
come back home.
That's their reality.

262
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,320
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

263
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,520
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

264
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,620
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

265
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,819
I've got somebody better.

266
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,020
Ariadne?

267
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,120
I'd like you to meet Mr Cobb.

268
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,619
Pleased to meet you.

269
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,049
If you have a few
moments, Mr Cobb has a

270
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,419
job offer he'd like
to discuss with you.

271
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,720
A work placement?

272
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,319
Not exactly.

273
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,920
I have a test for you.

274
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,719
You're not gonna tell
me anything first?

275
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,519
Before I describe the job, I
have to know you can do it.

276
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,570
Why?

277
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,920
It's not, strictly
speaking, legal.

278
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,353
You have two minutes
to design a maze

279
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,620
that it takes one minute to solve.

280
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,720
Stop.

281
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,320
Again.

282
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,820
Stop.

283
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,020
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

284
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
That's more like it.

285
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,419
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

286
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,319
Now, that's when we're awake.

287
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,419
When we're asleep, our mind
can do almost anything.

288
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,619
Such as?

289
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,778
Imagine you're
designing a building.

290
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,819
You consciously
create each aspect.

291
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,820
But sometimes, it feels
like it's almost

292
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,819
creating itself, if
you know what I mean.

293
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,919
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

294
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,319
Genuine inspiration, right?

295
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,819
Now, in a dream, our mind
continuously does this.

296
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,619
We create and perceive our
world simultaneously.

297
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,471
And our mind does
this so well that

298
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,219
we don't even know it's happening.

299
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,819
That allows us to get right in
the middle of that process.

300
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,821
How?

301
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:45,719
By taking over the creating part.

302
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,519
Now, this is where I need you.

303
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,019
You create the world of the dream.

304
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,944
We bring the subject
into that dream, and

305
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,519
they fill it with
their subconscious.

306
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,034
How could I ever
acquire enough detail

307
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:00,419
to make them think
that it's reality?

308
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,019
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

309
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,783
It's only when we wake up that we

310
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:07,920
realise something was
actually strange.

311
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,719
Let me ask you a question.

312
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,319
You never really remember the
beginning of a dream, do you?

313
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,519
You always wind up right in the
middle of what's going on.

314
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,719
I guess, yeah.

315
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,520
So how did we end up here?

316
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,920
Well, we just came from the...

317
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,620
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

318
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,120
Where are you right now?

319
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,519
We're dreaming?

320
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,119
You're in the middle of
the workshop, sleeping.

321
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,320
This is your first lesson in
shared dreaming. Stay calm.

322
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,820
If it's just a dream,
then why are you...?

323
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,119
Because it's never
just a dream, is it?

324
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,800
And a face full of
glass hurts like

325
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,619
hell. When you're in
it, it feels real.

326
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,019
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

327
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,014
It was a training
program for soldiers to

328
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:31,819
shoot, stab and
strangle each other...

329
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,220
and then wake up.

330
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,219
How did architects
become involved?

331
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Well, someone had to
design the dreams, right?

332
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,619
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

333
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,920
Five minutes?

334
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,619
What...? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

335
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,019
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

336
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,019
therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

337
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,520
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

338
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,320
Why don't you see what you can
get up to in five minutes?

339
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,219
You've got the basic
layout. Bookshop, cafe.

340
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,019
Almost everything
else is here too.

341
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,119
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

342
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,419
- Yours?
- Yes.

343
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,119
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

344
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,019
I am the subject. My
mind populates it.

345
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,019
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

346
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,119
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

347
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,619
How else do you do it?

348
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,719
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

349
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,724
The mind automatically
fills it with

350
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:34,619
information it's
trying to protect.

351
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,619
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

352
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,819
Well...

353
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,346
I guess I thought
that the dream space

354
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,419
would be all about the visual...

355
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,520
but it's more about
the feel of it.

356
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,191
My question is what
happens when you start

357
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:50,120
messing with the
physics of it all?

358
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,020
It's something, isn't it?

359
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,420
Yes, it is.

360
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,819
Why are they all looking at me?

361
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,591
Because my subconscious feels that

362
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:04,519
someone else is
creating this world.

363
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,742
The more you change
things, the quicker

364
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:09,019
the projections start
to converge on you.

365
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,219
Converge?

366
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,519
They sense the foreign
nature of the dreamer.

367
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,319
They attack, like white blood
cells fighting an infection.

368
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,320
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

369
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
Just you.

370
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,478
This is great, but
I'm telling you, if

371
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,620
you keep changing
things like this...

372
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,119
Jeez, mind telling your
subconscious to take it easy?

373
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,920
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

374
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,020
Very impressive.

375
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,219
I know this bridge. This
place is real, isn't it?

376
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,719
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

377
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,319
Never re-create places from your
memory. Always imagine new places.

378
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,319
You draw from stuff
you know, right?

379
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,649
Only use details.
A streetlamp or a

380
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,419
phone booth. Never entire areas.

381
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,495
Why not?

382
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,019
Building a dream
from your memory...

383
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,946
is the easiest way
to lose your grasp

384
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:06,719
on what's real and
what is a dream.

385
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,919
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

386
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,119
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

387
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,219
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

388
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,919
Hey, get off her.
Back up. Back up.

389
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,719
- Cobb. Cobb.
- Get off her.

390
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,820
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Mal.

391
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,419
- Mal.
- Cobb. Wake me up.

392
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,419
- Wake me up. Wake me up.
- No.

393
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,120
- Mal, no. No.
- Wake me up.

394
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,719
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

395
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,120
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

396
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,019
There was still time on the clock.

397
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,719
You can't wake up from within
the dream unless you die.

398
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,419
- She'll need a totem.
- What?

399
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,119
A totem, it's a small personal...

400
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,819
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb.

401
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,819
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.

402
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,619
- I see you met Mrs Cobb.
- She's his wife?

403
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,519
Yeah. So a totem. You need a
small object, potentially heavy.

404
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,119
Something you can have on
you that no one else knows.

405
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,619
- Like a coin?
- No.

406
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,420
It needs to be more unique than
that. Like, this is a loaded die.

407
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,419
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

408
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,570
See, only I know the
balance and the

409
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:11,719
weight of this
particular loaded die.

410
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,719
That way, when you
look at your totem...

411
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,576
you know beyond a
doubt that you're

412
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:17,020
not in someone else's dream.

413
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,745
I don't know if you
can't see what's going

414
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,719
on, or if you just
don't want to...

415
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,517
but Cobb has some serious problems

416
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,419
that he's tried to
bury down there.

417
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:32,620
And I'm not about to just open
my mind to someone like that.

418
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,526
She'll be back. I've
never seen anyone

419
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:42,120
pick it up that quickly before.

420
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,524
Reality's not gonna be enough for

421
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:46,820
her now, and when
she comes back...

422
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,119
When she comes back, you're
gonna have her building mazes.

423
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,519
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

424
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,819
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

425
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,620
It's a necessary risk.

426
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Well, there's plenty
of good thieves.

427
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,320
We don't just need a thief.

428
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,420
We need a forger.

429
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,720
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

430
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
You never know.

431
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,320
I'm gonna get you a drink.

432
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,820
You're buying.

433
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,663
Your spelling hasn't improved.

434
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:31,670
Piss off.

435
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,719
How's your handwriting?

436
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,719
- It's versatile.
- Good.

437
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,120
Thank you very much.

438
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,219
Inception.

439
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,219
Now, before you bother telling
me it's impossible, let me...

440
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,719
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

441
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,220
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

442
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,519
Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

443
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,419
He is good at what he does, right?

444
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,619
Oh, he's the best, but
he has no imagination.

445
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,819
Not like you.

446
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,019
Listen, if you're gonna perform
inception, you need imagination.

447
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,719
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

448
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,519
We tried it. We got the idea
in place, but it didn't take.

449
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,019
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

450
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,219
You need the simplest
version of the idea...

451
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,070
in order for it to
grow naturally in

452
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:18,019
your subject's mind.
It's a subtle art.

453
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,719
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

454
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,164
We need the heir of
a major corporation

455
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:25,119
to dissolve his father's empire.

456
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,719
Right there you have various
political motivations...

457
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,919
and anti-monopolistic
sentiments and so forth.

458
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,919
But all of that stuff, it's...

459
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,919
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

460
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,619
What you have to do is start
at the absolute basic.

461
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,320
Which is what?

462
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,720
The relationship with the father.

463
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,619
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

464
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,819
Right. Okay, well, there's
a man here, Yusuf.

465
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,419
He, formulates his own
versions of the compounds.

466
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,919
Why don't you take me there?

467
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,119
Once you've lost your
tail. The man at the bar.

468
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,819
COBOL Engineering.

469
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,319
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

470
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,019
Don't remember. Let's see
if he starts shooting.

471
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,169
Run interference. I'll
meet you downstairs

472
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,619
in the bar in, say, half an hour?

473
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,712
Back here?

474
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:10,187
This is the last place
they'd suspect.

475
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,820
All right.

476
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,819
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

477
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,520
My God, it's you, isn't it?

478
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,119
No, it isn't you.

479
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,720
Not dreaming now, are you?

480
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,520
Get him.

481
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,120
There.

482
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
One cafe.

483
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,020
One cafe.

484
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,520
One cafe.

485
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,620
Care for a lift, Mr Cobb?

486
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,986
What are you doing in Mombasa?

487
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,320
I'm here to protect my investment.

488
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,719
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

489
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,920
Different tail.

490
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Cobb said you'd be back.

491
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,921
I tried not to come, but...

492
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:46,019
But there's nothing quite like it.

493
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,920
It's just...

494
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,719
pure creation.

495
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,319
Shall we take a look at some
paradoxical architecture?

496
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,519
You're gonna have to
master a few tricks...

497
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,219
if you're gonna build three
complete dream levels. Excuse me.

498
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,819
What kind of tricks?

499
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,312
In a dream, you can cheat

500
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:04,519
architecture into
impossible shapes.

501
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,620
That lets you create closed
loops, like the Penrose Steps.

502
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,420
The infinite staircase.

503
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,620
See?

504
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,819
Paradox.

505
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,419
So a closed loop like that...

506
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,762
will help you disguise the

507
00:40:23,763 --> 00:40:25,619
boundaries of the
dream you create.

508
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,819
But how big do these
levels have to be?

509
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,567
It could be anything
from the floor

510
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:31,119
of a building to an entire city.

511
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,796
They have to be complicated enough

512
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,719
that we can hide from
the projections.

513
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,319
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

514
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,819
And the better the maze...

515
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,619
Then the longer we have before
the projections catch us?

516
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,120
Exactly.

517
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,520
My subconscious seems
polite enough.

518
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:46,419
Ha, ha. You wait,
they'll turn ugly.

519
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,419
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

520
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,720
Cobb can't build any more, can he?

521
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,419
I don't know if he
can't, but he won't.

522
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,919
He thinks it's safer if he
doesn't know the layouts.

523
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,219
Why?

524
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,620
He won't tell me. But
I think it's Mal.

525
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,319
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

526
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,720
- They're still together?
- No.

527
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,420
No, she's dead.

528
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,120
What you see in there is
just his projection of her.

529
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,220
What was she like in real life?

530
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,420
She was lovely.

531
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,419
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

532
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,720
To formulate compounds for a job?

533
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,219
And to go into the field with us.

534
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,619
No, I rarely go into
the field, Mr Cobb.

535
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,684
Well, we'd need you
there to tailor

536
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:39,519
compounds specific to our needs.

537
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,819
- Which are?
- Great depth.

538
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,320
A dream within a
dream? Two levels?

539
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,119
Three.

540
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,819
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

541
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,919
It is possible. You just
have to add a sedative.

542
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,820
A powerful sedative.

543
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,819
- How many team members?
- Five.

544
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,720
Six.

545
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,619
The only way to know you've done
the job is if I go in with you.

546
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,919
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr Saito.

547
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,420
This time, it seems there is.

548
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,119
This, I think, is a good place
to start. I use it every day.

549
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,420
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

550
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Perhaps you will not want to see.

551
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,020
After you.

552
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,319
Ten. Twelve. All
connected. Bloody hell.

553
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,220
They come every day
to share the dream.

554
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,820
You see? Very stable.

555
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,620
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

556
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,919
In dream time?

557
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,719
With this compound? About 40
hours, each and every day.

558
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,220
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr Cobb.

559
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,219
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

560
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,320
Do you still dream, Mr Cobb?

561
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,420
They come here every day to sleep?

562
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:22,421
No.

563
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,820
They come to be woken up.

564
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,120
The dream has become
their reality.

565
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,420
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

566
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,320
Let's see what you can do.

567
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,920
You know how to find me.

568
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,520
You know what you have to do.

569
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,820
Sharp, no?

570
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Are you all right, Mr Cobb?

571
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,520
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's just fine.

572
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,048
Robert Fischer,
heir to the Fischer

573
00:44:35,049 --> 00:44:36,719
Morrow energy conglomerate.

574
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,719
What's your problem
with this Mr Fischer?

575
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,520
That's not your concern.

576
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,319
Mr Saito, this isn't your
typical corporate espionage.

577
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,019
You asked me for inception.

578
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,619
I do hope you understand the
gravity of that request.

579
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,728
Now, the seed that
we plant in this

580
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:54,719
man's mind will grow into an idea.

581
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,719
This idea will define him.

582
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,719
It may come to change...

583
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,219
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

584
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,719
We're the last company
standing between

585
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,719
them and total energy dominance.

586
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,019
And we can no longer compete.

587
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,619
Soon, they'll control the energy
supply of half the world.

588
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,220
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

589
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,919
The world needs Robert
Fischer to change his mind.

590
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,619
That's where we come in.

591
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,019
How is Robert Fischer's
relationship with his father?

592
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,919
Rumour is the relationship
is quite complicated.

593
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,619
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumour, can we?

594
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:33,019
Can you get me access to
this man here? Browning.

595
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,319
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

596
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,819
It should be possible, if you
can get the right references.

597
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,420
References are something of a
speciality for me, Mr Saito.

598
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,019
I'm not smelling settlement
here. Take them down.

599
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,219
Mr Browning...

600
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,320
Maurice Fischer's policy is always
one of avoiding litigation.

601
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,319
Well, shall we voice your
concerns with Maurice directly?

602
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,819
Not sure that's necessary.

603
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,720
No, no, no. I think we should.

604
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,620
How is he?

605
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,119
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but...

606
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,820
Robert, I told you keep out the
damn... Wait. So do it. Get...

607
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,220
- Mr Fischer.
- Put it through.

608
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,120
Never, never. Never do
the same as I asked.

609
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,120
Leave that.

610
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,220
Here.

611
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,920
Must be a cherished memory of his.

612
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,519
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

613
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,320
Robert...

614
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,119
we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

615
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,187
I know this is hard,
but it's imperative...

616
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:13,630
Not now, Uncle Peter.

617
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,419
The vultures are circling.

618
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,642
And the sicker Maurice
Fischer becomes,

619
00:47:21,643 --> 00:47:23,919
the more powerful Peter
Browning becomes.

620
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,520
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

621
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,270
and adopt his physical
presence, study

622
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:31,519
his mannerisms, and
so on and so forth.

623
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,519
So now in the first layer of the
dream, I can impersonate Browning.

624
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,919
And suggest concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind.

625
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,919
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

626
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,601
his own projection of Browning

627
00:47:42,602 --> 00:47:44,619
should feed that
right back to him.

628
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,719
So he gives himself the idea.

629
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,239
Precisely. That's the
only way it will stick.

630
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,119
It has to seem self-generated.

631
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,719
Eames, I am impressed.

632
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,464
Your condescension, as always, is

633
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:58,420
much appreciated,
Arthur, thank you.

634
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,819
Were you going under on your own?

635
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,519
No, no, I was just,
running some experiments.

636
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,619
I didn't realise
anyone was here, so...

637
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,419
Yeah, I was just... I was
working on my totem, actually.

638
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,820
Here, let me take a look.

639
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,219
So you're learning, huh?

640
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,920
An elegant solution for
keeping track of reality.

641
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,019
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was...

642
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,320
It was Mal's, actually. This...

643
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,872
This one was hers.
She would spin it in

644
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:48,719
the dream and it
would never topple.

645
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,820
Just spin and spin.

646
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,320
Arthur told me she passed away.

647
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,319
How are the mazes coming along?

648
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,319
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

649
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,019
that we are trying to access.

650
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,188
So I'm making the bottom
level a hospital,

651
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:09,620
so Fischer will bring his father.

652
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,719
You know, I... Actually, I have
a question about this layout.

653
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,074
No, no, no. Don't
show me specifics.

654
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:17,619
Only the dreamer should
know the layout.

655
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,919
Why is that so important?

656
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,119
In case one of us brings
in our projections.

657
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,620
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

658
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,519
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

659
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,120
You can't keep her out, can you?

660
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,519
- Right.
- You can't build...

661
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,019
because if you know the
maze, then she knows it.

662
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,319
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

663
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,319
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

664
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,719
You've gotta warn them if
this is getting worse.

665
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,820
No one said it's getting worse.

666
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,320
I need to get home. That's
all I care about right now.

667
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,320
Why can't you go home?

668
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,420
Because they think I killed her.

669
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,919
- Thank you.
- For what?

670
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,419
For not asking whether I did.

671
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,719
"I will split up my
father's empire."

672
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,804
Now, this is obviously
an idea that

673
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:13,119
Robert himself would
choose to reject...

674
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,019
which is why we need to plant
it deep in his subconscious.

675
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,719
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

676
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,719
We need to find a way to translate
this into an emotional concept.

677
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,319
How do you translate business
strategy into emotion?

678
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,122
That's what we're
here to figure out.

679
00:50:28,123 --> 00:50:30,019
Robert's relationship
with his father...

680
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,919
- is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

681
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,720
We suggest breaking
up his father's

682
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:36,719
company as a "screw
you" to the old man.

683
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,621
No, because I think
positive emotion

684
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:40,420
trumps negative
emotion every time.

685
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,519
We all yearn for
reconciliation, for catharsis.

686
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,229
We need Robert Fischer to have a

687
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,419
positive emotional
reaction to all this.

688
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,419
All right, well, try this.

689
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,870
"My father accepts
that I want to create

690
00:50:52,871 --> 00:50:55,320
for myself, not follow
in his footsteps."

691
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,819
That might work.

692
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,119
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

693
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,219
Thank you for your
contribution, Arthur.

694
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,419
Forgive me for wanting a
little specificity, Eames.

695
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,619
Specificity?

696
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,619
Inception's not about
being specific.

697
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,603
When we get inside his mind, we're

698
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:12,820
gonna have to work
with what we find.

699
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,119
On the top level, we open up his
relationship with his father...

700
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,319
and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

701
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,834
Then the next level
down, we feed him,

702
00:51:22,835 --> 00:51:25,219
"I will create
something for myself."

703
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,046
Then, by the time
we hit the bottom

704
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:28,719
level, we bring out the big guns.

705
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,670
"My father doesn't
want me to be him."

706
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,671
Exactly.

707
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,520
Three layers down,
the dreams are gonna

708
00:51:34,521 --> 00:51:36,619
collapse with the
slightest disturbance.

709
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,919
Sedation.

710
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,919
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

711
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,020
we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

712
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,620
Good night.

713
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,319
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

714
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,419
creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

715
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,484
whilst accelerating
brain function.

716
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:06,819
In other words, more
time on each level.

717
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,219
Brain function in the dream
will be about 20 times normal.

718
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,893
And when you enter a dream within

719
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:13,819
that dream, the
effect is compounded.

720
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,119
It's three dreams, that's
10 hours times 20...

721
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,219
Maths was never my strong
subject. How much time is that?

722
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,020
It's a week, the first level down.

723
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:25,619
Six months the second level
down, and the third level...

724
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,220
That's 10 years.

725
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,020
Who'd wanna be stuck in
a dream for 10 years?

726
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,519
Depends on the dream.

727
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,019
So once we've made the
plant, how do we get out?

728
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,672
I'm hoping you have something more

729
00:52:37,673 --> 00:52:39,519
elegant than shooting
me in the head.

730
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,419
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

731
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,320
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

732
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,219
It's that feeling of falling
you get that jolts you awake.

733
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,570
Snaps you out of the dream.

734
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:53,619
We gonna feel a kick
with this sedation?

735
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,919
That's the clever part.

736
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,319
I customised the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

737
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,319
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

738
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,920
Or tipping.

739
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,427
The trick is to synchronise a kick

740
00:53:08,428 --> 00:53:10,720
that can penetrate
all three levels.

741
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,032
We could use a
musical countdown to

742
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:14,820
synchronise the different kicks.

743
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,119
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

744
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,319
Wasn't he supposed to
have a knee operation?

745
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,139
Nothing. Nothing
that they'll put him

746
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,719
under for, anyway. And we need...

747
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,819
We need at least a good 10 hours.

748
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,320
Sydney to Los Angeles.

749
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,624
One of the longest flights in the

750
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,919
world. He makes it
every two weeks.

751
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,320
He must be flying private, then.

752
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,919
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

753
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,319
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

754
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,919
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

755
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,826
the first-class
cabin's in the nose,

756
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:54,319
so no one would walk through.

757
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,218
You'd have to buy out
the entire cabin

758
00:53:56,219 --> 00:53:58,019
and the first-class
flight attendant.

759
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,720
I bought the airline.

760
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,120
It seemed neater.

761
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Well, looks like we
have our 10 hours.

762
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,320
Ariadne? Terrific
work, by the way.

763
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,520
You know how to find me.

764
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,420
You know what you have to do.

765
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,720
You remember when you
asked me to marry you?

766
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,620
Of course I do.

767
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,220
You said you had a dream.

768
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,920
That we'd grow old together.

769
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,120
And we can.

770
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,720
You shouldn't be here.

771
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,143
Just wanted to see
what kind of tests

772
00:55:41,144 --> 00:55:42,919
you're doing on your
own every night.

773
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,525
This has nothing to do with you.

774
00:55:44,526 --> 00:55:46,319
This has everything to do with me.

775
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,453
You've asked me to
share dreams with you.

776
00:55:49,454 --> 00:55:52,330
Not these. These are my dreams.

777
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,519
Why do you do this to yourself?

778
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,620
It's the only way I
can still dream.

779
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,620
Why is it so important to dream?

780
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,820
In my dreams, we're
still together.

781
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,920
These aren't just dreams.

782
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,719
These are memories. And you
said never to use memories.

783
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,920
I know I did.

784
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:43,119
You're trying to keep her
alive. You can't let her go.

785
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,319
You don't understand. These
are moments I regret.

786
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,020
They're memories that
I have to change.

787
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,720
Well, what's down there
that you regret?

788
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,320
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

789
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,320
This is your house?

790
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,419
Mine and Mal's, yes.

791
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,320
Where is she?

792
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,020
She's already gone.

793
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,319
That's my son, James.

794
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,520
He's digging for
something, maybe a worm.

795
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,120
That's Phillipa.

796
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,419
I thought about calling
out to them...

797
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,420
so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

798
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,219
those beautiful faces of
theirs, but it's all too late.

799
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,220
Right now or never, Cobb.

800
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,519
Then I start to panic.

801
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,420
I realise I'm gonna
regret this moment...

802
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,519
that I need to see their
faces one last time.

803
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,219
James. Phillipa. Come on in.

804
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,420
But the moment's past.

805
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,020
And whatever I do, I can't
change this moment.

806
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,120
As I'm about to
call out to them...

807
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,220
they run away.

808
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,220
If I'm ever gonna see their faces
again, I've gotta get back home.

809
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,720
The real world.

810
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,820
What are you doing here?

811
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,719
My name is...

812
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,220
I know who you are. What
are you doing here?

813
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,819
I'm just trying to understand.

814
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,120
How could you understand?

815
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,420
Do you know what it
is to be a lover?

816
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,620
To be half of a whole?

817
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,420
No.

818
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,820
I'll tell you a riddle.

819
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,620
You're waiting for a train.

820
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,820
A train that will
take you far away.

821
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,220
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

822
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,419
but you don't know for sure.

823
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,520
But it doesn't matter.

824
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,919
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

825
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,820
Because you'll be together.

826
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,789
How could you bring her here, Dom?

827
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,020
What is this place?

828
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,519
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

829
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,020
What happened here?

830
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,820
You promised. You promised
we'd be together.

831
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,319
Please, I need you to
stay here just for now.

832
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,719
You said we'd be together. You
said we'd grow old together.

833
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,320
I'll come back for you. I promise.

834
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:41,920
Do you think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in?

835
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,920
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

836
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,120
It's time.

837
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,619
Maurice Fischer just
died in Sydney.

838
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,019
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

839
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,743
Robert should
accompany the body no

840
01:00:54,744 --> 01:00:56,419
later than Tuesday.
We should move.

841
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,120
All right.

842
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,719
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

843
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,641
The team needs someone
who understands

844
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:05,020
what you're struggling with.

845
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,719
And it doesn't have to be me...

846
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,220
but then you have to show
Arthur what I just saw.

847
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,720
Get us another seat on the plane.

848
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,819
If I get on this plane and you
don't honour our agreement...

849
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,620
when we land, I go to jail
for the rest of my life.

850
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,519
Complete the job en route...

851
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,119
I make one phone call
from the plane...

852
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,220
you have no trouble getting
through Immigration.

853
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,419
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

854
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,220
Thank you.

855
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,119
Excuse me, I think this is
yours? You must have dropped it.

856
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,119
Would you care for a drink?

857
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,619
Oh. Water, please.

858
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,120
Oh, same, please.

859
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,219
Thank you.

860
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,219
You know, I couldn't
help but notice...

861
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,225
but you wouldn't
happen to be related

862
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:51,019
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

863
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,720
Yes, he...

864
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,620
He was my father.

865
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,120
Well, he was a very inspiring
figure. I'm sorry for your loss.

866
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,719
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

867
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,220
Hey.

868
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,320
To your father.

869
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,120
May he rest in peace, huh?

870
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,155
Couldn't have peed
before you went under?

871
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:22,219
Sorry.

872
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,119
Bit too much free champagne
before take-off?

873
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,319
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

874
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,520
We know he's gonna be looking
for a taxi in this weather.

875
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,170
Asshole. Hey, man, why
don't you try...?

876
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,220
Walk away.

877
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,519
- Just have him ca...
- I gotta go.

878
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,820
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

879
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,620
All right, Third and
Market. Snappy.

880
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,519
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

881
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,219
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

882
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,220
Maybe not. Can you pull
over and get this...?

883
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,520
Great.

884
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,920
Come on.

885
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,619
There's $500 in there. The
wallet's worth more than that.

886
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,519
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

887
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,887
I'm afraid that it doesn't...

888
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,319
- Cover him.
- Down. Down now.

889
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,120
What the hell is going on?

890
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,120
This wasn't in the design.

891
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,419
Cobb?

892
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,620
Cobb?

893
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,820
Get him.

894
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,919
Are you all right?

895
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,219
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

896
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,319
Fischer's okay, unless
he gets carsick.

897
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,720
Saito?

898
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,820
Get Fischer in the back room now.

899
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,820
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?

900
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,619
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

901
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,519
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

902
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,119
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

903
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,319
Why put a train in a
downtown intersection?

904
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,019
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?

905
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,919
Why the hell were we ambushed?

906
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,620
Those were not normal projections.

907
01:07:51,621 --> 01:07:53,519
They'd been trained,
for God's sakes.

908
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,219
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

909
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,540
teach his subconscious
to defend itself,

910
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,619
so his subconscious
is militarised.

911
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,419
It should've shown
in the research.

912
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:04,319
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

913
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,819
Don't tell me to calm down.

914
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,919
This was your job, goddamn it.
This was your responsibility.

915
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,219
You were meant to check
Fischer's background.

916
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,686
We are not prepared for this.

917
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:14,719
We have dealt with
sub-security before.

918
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,919
We'll be more careful and
we're gonna be fine.

919
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,919
This was not a part of
the plan. He's dying.

920
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,119
Put him out his misery.

921
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,119
No, don't do that. Don't do that.

922
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
Cobb, hey, hey.

923
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:25,419
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

924
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,519
No. It won't wake him up.

925
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,546
What do you mean, it
won't wake him up?

926
01:08:29,547 --> 01:08:31,319
When we die in a
dream, we wake up.

927
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,719
Not from this.

928
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,420
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

929
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,719
Right. So, what
happens when we die?

930
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,719
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

931
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,419
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.

932
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,167
Well, what the hell is down there?

933
01:08:44,168 --> 01:08:45,819
Just raw, infinite subconscious.

934
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,446
Nothing is down there, except for

935
01:08:47,447 --> 01:08:49,219
what might have
been left behind...

936
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,319
by anyone sharing the dream who's
been trapped there before.

937
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,319
Which, in our case, is just you.

938
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,219
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...

939
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,069
trying to escape until
the sedation...

940
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:00,070
How long?

941
01:09:00,071 --> 01:09:01,471
Decades. It could be infinite. Ask

942
01:09:01,472 --> 01:09:03,219
him, he's the one
who's been there.

943
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,620
Let's get him upstairs.

944
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:07,720
Great.

945
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,120
Thank you.

946
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,222
So now we're trapped in Fischer's

947
01:09:12,223 --> 01:09:14,019
mind, battling his
own private army.

948
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,719
And if we get killed...

949
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,120
we'll be lost in limbo till our
brains turn to scrambled egg?

950
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,820
Someone got first aid?

951
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,959
You knew these risks
and didn't tell us?

952
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,619
There weren't meant to be risks.

953
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,563
I didn't know we'd be
dealing with gunfire.

954
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:36,719
You had no right.

955
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,219
This was the only way to
go three layers deep.

956
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,419
You knew about this and
went along with it?

957
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,619
I trusted him.

958
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,619
When? When he promised
you half his share?

959
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,119
No. His whole share. Besides,
he said he'd done it before.

960
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,319
What, with Mal? Because
that worked so good?

961
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,168
That has nothing to
do with it. I did

962
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:53,919
what I had to to get
to my children.

963
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,019
You led us into a war
zone with no way out?

964
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,336
There is a way out. We
continue on with the job,

965
01:09:58,337 --> 01:10:00,219
and we do it as
fast as possible...

966
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,719
and we get out using the
kick, just like before.

967
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,319
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

968
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,419
I am sitting this one
out on this level.

969
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,019
Fischer's security is
surrounding this place.

970
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:12,419
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

971
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,497
That means each and
every one of us will

972
01:10:14,498 --> 01:10:16,320
be killed. That I
can guarantee you.

973
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,912
We have no other
choice but to continue

974
01:10:18,913 --> 01:10:20,720
on and do it as fast as possible.

975
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,720
Downwards is the
only way forwards.

976
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,419
Get ready.

977
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,820
You, come on. Let's
go shake him up.

978
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,719
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

979
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,819
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up. It won't be.

980
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,219
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

981
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,420
is his personal safe. We
need the combination.

982
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,219
I don't know any safe.

983
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,320
That doesn't mean you don't
know the combination.

984
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,320
Tell us what it is.

985
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,920
I don't know.

986
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,919
We have it on good
authority you do know.

987
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,420
Yeah? Whose authority?

988
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,420
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?

989
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,520
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

990
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,020
Useful?

991
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,820
Maybe.

992
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,120
You're on. You've got an hour.

993
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,520
An hour?

994
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,019
I was supposed to have
all night to crack this.

995
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,819
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

996
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:37,220
You've got one hour, now get
us something useful, please.

997
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,120
- What's that?
- Good authority.

998
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,120
Uncle Peter.

999
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,920
Just make them stop.

1000
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,519
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

1001
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,419
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

1002
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,020
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

1003
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:04,120
You have one hour. Start talking.

1004
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,320
You all right?

1005
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,520
You okay?

1006
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:17,920
Those bastards have had
at me for two days.

1007
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,019
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

1008
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,019
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

1009
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,919
They thought I'd know the
combination, but I don't know it.

1010
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,920
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

1011
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,097
Maurice told me that
when he passed,

1012
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:32,819
you were the only one
able to open it.

1013
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,620
No, he never gave
me any combination.

1014
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,392
Maybe he did. I mean,
maybe you just

1015
01:12:38,393 --> 01:12:40,419
didn't know it was a combination.

1016
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,819
Well, what, then?

1017
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,519
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

1018
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,620
based on your experiences
with Maurice.

1019
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,320
We didn't have very many,
meaningful experiences together.

1020
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,520
Perhaps after your mother died.

1021
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,320
After my mother died, you
know what he told me?

1022
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:08,519
"Robert, there's really
nothing to be said."

1023
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,019
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

1024
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,920
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

1025
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,919
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

1026
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,987
When we get down to
the lower levels,

1027
01:13:19,988 --> 01:13:21,619
the pain will be less intense.

1028
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,120
And if he dies?

1029
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,719
Worst-case scenario?

1030
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,619
When he wakes up, his
mind is completely gone.

1031
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,819
Cobb, I'll still honour
the arrangement.

1032
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,719
I appreciate that, Saito.

1033
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,848
But when you wake
up, you won't even

1034
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:38,919
remember that we had
an arrangement.

1035
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,119
Limbo is gonna
become your reality.

1036
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,225
You're gonna be lost
down there so long

1037
01:13:43,226 --> 01:13:45,120
that you're gonna
become an old man.

1038
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,920
Filled with regret?

1039
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,420
Waiting to die alone.

1040
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,220
No.

1041
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,420
I'll come back.

1042
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,820
And we'll be young
men together again.

1043
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,919
Breathe.

1044
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,450
These people are gonna kill us if

1045
01:14:05,451 --> 01:14:07,119
we don't give them
the combination.

1046
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,119
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

1047
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,219
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

1048
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,920
All right. What is in the safe?

1049
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,120
Something for you.

1050
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,920
Maurice always said it was his
most precious gift to you.

1051
01:14:22,245 --> 01:14:23,245
A will.

1052
01:14:23,246 --> 01:14:25,719
Maurice's will is
with Port and Dunn.

1053
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,119
That's an alternate.

1054
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,619
This would supersede the
other if you want it to.

1055
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,419
It splits up the component
businesses of Fischer Morrow.

1056
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,319
It'd be the end of the
entire empire as we know it.

1057
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,020
Destroying my whole inheritance?

1058
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,589
Why would he suggest such a thing?

1059
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:43,820
I just don't know.

1060
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,620
He loved you, Robert.

1061
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,819
In his own way.

1062
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,820
In his own way.

1063
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,620
At the end...

1064
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,120
he called me in to his deathbed.

1065
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,420
He could barely speak.

1066
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,720
But he took the trouble to
tell me one last thing.

1067
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,920
He pulled me close.

1068
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,620
And I could only make out...

1069
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,020
one word.

1070
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,620
"Disappointed."

1071
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,520
When were you in limbo?

1072
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,670
You might have the
rest of the team

1073
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:35,519
convinced to carry
on with this job.

1074
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,119
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

1075
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,323
The truth that, at any
minute, you might

1076
01:15:40,324 --> 01:15:42,419
bring a freight train
through the wall.

1077
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:46,619
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

1078
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,219
And the truth that, as we
go deeper into Fischer...

1079
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,220
we're also going deeper into you.

1080
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:55,320
And I'm not sure we're
gonna like what we find.

1081
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,719
We were working together.

1082
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,619
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

1083
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,019
I kept pushing things.

1084
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,920
I wanted to go deeper and
deeper. I wanted to go further.

1085
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:12,800
I just didn't understand
the concept that

1086
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:15,319
hours could turn into
years down there...

1087
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,220
that we could get
trapped so deep...

1088
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:22,320
that when we wound up on the
shore of our own subconscious...

1089
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,520
we lost sight of what was real.

1090
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,120
We created. We built the
world for ourselves.

1091
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,720
We did that for years.

1092
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,820
We built our own world.

1093
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,920
How long were you stuck there?

1094
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,220
Something like 50 years.

1095
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,720
Jesus.

1096
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,419
How could you stand it?

1097
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,320
It wasn't so bad at
first, feeling like gods.

1098
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,918
Eventually, it just became

1099
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:05,619
impossible for me
to live like that.

1100
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,220
And what about for her?

1101
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,620
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

1102
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:21,220
A truth that she had once
known, but chose to forget.

1103
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,620
Limbo became her reality.

1104
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,820
What happened when you woke up?

1105
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:34,020
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

1106
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,520
to become old souls thrown
back into youth like that?

1107
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,220
I knew something was wrong with
her. She just wouldn't admit it.

1108
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,920
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1109
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:51,619
She was possessed by an idea.

1110
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:57,520
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

1111
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,120
That our world wasn't real.

1112
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,320
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

1113
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,220
that in order to get back home...

1114
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,320
we had to kill ourselves.

1115
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,211
What about your children?

1116
01:18:20,212 --> 01:18:22,419
She thought they
were projections...

1117
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,219
that our real
children were waiting

1118
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,519
for us up there somewhere.

1119
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,419
- I'm their mother.
- Calm down.

1120
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,819
I can tell the difference.

1121
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,319
If this is my dream, why
can't I control this?

1122
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,219
You don't know you're dreaming.

1123
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,619
She was certain there was
nothing I could do...

1124
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:39,620
no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

1125
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,619
She wanted to do it, but
she could not do it alone.

1126
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:51,920
She loved me too much, so she came
up with a plan on our anniversary.

1127
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,119
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

1128
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,543
Just... Just step back
inside. All right?

1129
01:19:23,544 --> 01:19:25,619
Just step back
inside now, come on.

1130
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:30,219
No. I'm going to jump, and
you're coming with me.

1131
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,019
No, I'm not.

1132
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,320
Now, you listen to me.

1133
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:39,119
If you jump, you're not gonna wake
up, remember? You're gonna die.

1134
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,219
Now, just step back inside.

1135
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,119
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1136
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,320
We've talked enough.

1137
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,019
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1138
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,920
- or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1139
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,020
We're gonna talk about this.

1140
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,019
All right?

1141
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,920
I'm asking you to
take a leap of faith.

1142
01:20:04,921 --> 01:20:06,220
No, honey.

1143
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,219
No, I can't. You know
I can't do that.

1144
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,119
Take a second, think
about our children.

1145
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,020
Think about James.

1146
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,419
Think about Phillipa, now.

1147
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,519
If I go without you, they'll
take them away anyway.

1148
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,742
What does that mean?

1149
01:20:21,743 --> 01:20:24,020
I filed a letter
with our attorney...

1150
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,820
explaining how I'm
fearful for my safety.

1151
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,120
How you've threatened to kill me.

1152
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,519
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1153
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,519
Why did...? Why would
you do this to me?

1154
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,519
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1155
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,719
We're going home to
our real children.

1156
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,722
Oh, no, no, no, Mal,
you listen to me,

1157
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:49,519
all right? Mal,
look at me, please?

1158
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,020
You're waiting for a train.

1159
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,037
Mal, goddamn it, don't do this.

1160
01:20:53,038 --> 01:20:55,119
A train that will
take you far away.

1161
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,219
James and Phillipa
are waiting for you.

1162
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,698
You know where you hope
this train will take you,

1163
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:01,219
but you can't know for sure.

1164
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,619
- Mal, look at me.
- But it doesn't matter.

1165
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,519
Mal, goddamn it.
Mal, listen to me.

1166
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,019
Because you'll be together.

1167
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:11,019
Sweetheart. Look at me. Mal, no.

1168
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,620
Jesus Christ.

1169
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,819
She had herself declared sane by
three different psychiatrists.

1170
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,989
It made it impossible
for me to try

1171
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,219
to explain the nature
of her madness.

1172
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:25,620
So I ran.

1173
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,720
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1174
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,720
James. Phillipa.
Come on in. Come on.

1175
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,020
All right, let's go.

1176
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,498
I left my children
behind and I've been

1177
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:46,420
trying to buy my way
back ever since.

1178
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,819
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1179
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,320
But you are not responsible for
the idea that destroyed her.

1180
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:58,019
And if we are gonna
succeed in this...

1181
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:03,219
you have to forgive yourself, and
you're gonna have to confront her.

1182
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,219
But you don't have
to do that alone.

1183
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,720
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1184
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,523
Because they have no idea the risk

1185
01:22:10,524 --> 01:22:13,420
they've taken coming
down here with you.

1186
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,019
We have to move.

1187
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,619
Time's up.

1188
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,519
All right. I don't
know any combination.

1189
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,719
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

1190
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,694
I got somebody in
your father's office

1191
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,819
right now ready to tap
in the combination.

1192
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:34,919
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1193
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,319
- I have no idea.
- Right now.

1194
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,719
I said, right now. Right now.

1195
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,820
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1196
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,719
You'll have to do
better than that.

1197
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,220
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1198
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,720
We're worth more to you
alive. You hear me?

1199
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,520
What'd you get?

1200
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,419
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1201
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,619
This helps us how?

1202
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,920
The stronger the issues, the
more powerful the catharsis.

1203
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,219
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1204
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:23,919
Work faster. The projections
are closing in quick.

1205
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,620
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1206
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,719
Damn it.

1207
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,920
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1208
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,719
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1209
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,463
Destroy his one
positive relationship?

1210
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,919
No, repair his relationship
with his father...

1211
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,319
whilst exposing his
godfather's true nature.

1212
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,519
We should charge Fischer a lot
more than Saito for this job.

1213
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,019
His security is gonna get
worse as we go deeper.

1214
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,720
- I think we run with Mr Charles.
- No.

1215
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,519
- Who's Mr Charles?
- Bad idea.

1216
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,582
The second we get
into that hotel his

1217
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:47,319
security's gonna be all over us.

1218
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,519
We run with Mr Charles
like on the Stein job.

1219
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,019
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

1220
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,016
The subject realised
he was dreaming and

1221
01:24:54,017 --> 01:24:55,719
his subconscious
tore us to pieces.

1222
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,919
Excellent. But you
learned a lot, right?

1223
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,219
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

1224
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,519
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1225
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,819
Listen to me. You drive
carefully, all right?

1226
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:07,420
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1227
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,593
Don't jump too soon.
We only got one

1228
01:25:13,594 --> 01:25:15,319
shot at that kick.
We gotta make it.

1229
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,172
I'll play the music
to let you know

1230
01:25:17,173 --> 01:25:18,819
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1231
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,820
- You ready?
- Ready.

1232
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,119
Sweet dreams.

1233
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,220
Am I boring you?

1234
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,720
I was telling you my story. I
guess it wasn't to your liking.

1235
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,220
I have a lot on my mind.

1236
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,320
There goes Mr Charles.

1237
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:44,619
Mr Fischer, right?

1238
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:48,319
Pleasure to see you again. Rod
Green from marketing. I...

1239
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:52,520
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1240
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,820
In case you get bored.

1241
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,419
Must've blown you off.

1242
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:06,420
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1243
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:13,020
Funny way to make friends, someone
stealing your wallet like that.

1244
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,219
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500...

1245
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,519
About $500, right?

1246
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,619
Don't worry about it. My people
are already on it as we speak.

1247
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,819
Who or what is Mr Charles?

1248
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:28,056
It's a gambit designed
to turn Fischer

1249
01:26:28,057 --> 01:26:29,719
against his own subconscious.

1250
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,219
And why don't you approve?

1251
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,319
It involves telling the
mark that he's dreaming...

1252
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,619
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1253
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:38,719
Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

1254
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,719
So now you've noticed
how much time...

1255
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,520
Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1256
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:47,019
Mr Saito, can I have a moment?

1257
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,620
- I'm sorry, but...
- Hold on. Wait.

1258
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,219
You look a bit perkier.

1259
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,720
Very amusing, Mr Eames.

1260
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,519
Turbulence on the plane?

1261
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,319
No, it's much closer.

1262
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,220
That's Yusuf's driving.

1263
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,019
I'm sorry. Who did
you say you were?

1264
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:19,219
Rod Green from marketing.

1265
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,020
But that's not true at all, is it?

1266
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,619
My name is Mr Charles. You
remember me, don't you?

1267
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,820
I'm the head of your
security down here.

1268
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,919
Get out on a different
floor, keep moving.

1269
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,519
Dump the wallet. Security
will be looking for that.

1270
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,520
Okay.

1271
01:27:35,521 --> 01:27:38,120
We need to buy Cobb
a little more time.

1272
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,420
Security, huh?

1273
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,019
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1274
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:52,820
I specialise in a very
specific type of security.

1275
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,919
Subconscious security.

1276
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,119
You're talking about dreams?

1277
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,220
Are you talking about, extraction?

1278
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,620
I am here to protect you.

1279
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,619
Mr Fischer, I'm here to
protect you in the event...

1280
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:22,119
that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1281
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,020
You're not safe here.

1282
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,420
They're coming for you.

1283
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,820
Strange weather, isn't it?

1284
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,820
You feel that?

1285
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,919
What's happening?

1286
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,319
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1287
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,319
which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1288
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,620
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1289
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:15,520
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1290
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,220
We should probably
get out of here.

1291
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:37,019
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr Fischer.

1292
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,179
Pay attention to
the strangeness of

1293
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:41,219
the weather, the shift in gravity.

1294
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:44,520
None of this is real.
You're in a dream.

1295
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:51,619
Now, the easiest way for
you to test yourself...

1296
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,960
is to try and remember
how you arrived

1297
01:29:53,961 --> 01:29:55,820
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1298
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,019
Yeah, I...

1299
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,719
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1300
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,547
Accept the fact that
you're in a dream,

1301
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:06,020
and I'm here to
protect you. Go on.

1302
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,019
- You're not real?
- No.

1303
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:17,519
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1304
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,819
I was sent here to protect
you in the event...

1305
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,919
that extractors tried to
pull you into a dream.

1306
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,320
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr Fischer.

1307
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,419
Yeah.

1308
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,720
Okay.

1309
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,920
Okay.

1310
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,720
Can you get me out of here?

1311
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:40,220
Right away. Follow me.

1312
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:55,720
Hold on a second.

1313
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,519
Jesus Christ. What are you doing?

1314
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,919
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1315
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,720
If you want my help, you
have to remain calm.

1316
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,720
I need you to work
with me, Mr Fischer.

1317
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:27,019
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1318
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,319
I wouldn't do that if I
were you, Mr Fischer.

1319
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:33,019
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1320
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,320
you may not wake up.

1321
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,629
You may go into a
further dream state.

1322
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,820
Now, you know what
I'm talking about.

1323
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,820
You remember the training.

1324
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,320
Remember what I said to you.

1325
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,320
Give me the gun.

1326
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,020
This room should be
directly below 528?

1327
01:32:02,021 --> 01:32:03,021
Yeah.

1328
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,619
Think, Mr Fischer, think.

1329
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:17,620
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1330
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,619
There was, a lot of gunfire.

1331
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,420
There was rain.

1332
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,520
Uncle Peter.

1333
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,662
Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.

1334
01:32:27,663 --> 01:32:29,420
Where were they holding you?

1335
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,020
They had us in the back of a van.

1336
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:35,720
That explains the gravity shifts.

1337
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:38,019
You're in the back of
a van. Keep going.

1338
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,520
It had something to do with...

1339
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,020
Something to do with a safe.

1340
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,219
God, why is it so
hard to remember?

1341
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,119
It's like trying to remember a
dream after you've woken up.

1342
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,019
Listen, it takes
years of practise.

1343
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,519
You and Browning have been
pulled into this dream...

1344
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,519
because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1345
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,219
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1346
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:02,019
What is it, Mr Fischer? Think.

1347
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:05,919
A combination. They demanded the
first numbers to pop into my head.

1348
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,819
They're trying to extract a
number from your subconscious.

1349
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:12,820
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1350
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:16,719
We should try hotel rooms. What
was the number, Mr Fischer?

1351
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,719
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1352
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,220
Five.

1353
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:24,619
Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.

1354
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,919
That's good. We can start
there. Fifth floor.

1355
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,119
Yep.

1356
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,745
So do you use a timer?

1357
01:33:29,746 --> 01:33:32,319
No, I have to judge it for myself.

1358
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,719
While you're all asleep in
528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1359
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,019
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1360
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,632
And then when the van hits
the barrier of the bridge,

1361
01:33:40,633 --> 01:33:42,219
that should be unmistakable.

1362
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:45,519
So we get a nice
synchronised kick.

1363
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,119
If it's too soon, we
won't get pulled out.

1364
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,519
But if it's too late, I
won't be able to drop us.

1365
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,663
Well, why not?

1366
01:33:52,664 --> 01:33:55,520
Because the van will
be in freefall.

1367
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,920
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1368
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,820
They're with me. Go on.

1369
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,119
Mr Charles.

1370
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,186
Do you know what
that is, Mr Fischer?

1371
01:34:34,187 --> 01:34:35,219
Yeah, I think so.

1372
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:37,520
They were trying to put you under.

1373
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,019
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1374
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:42,720
What do you mean, a
dream within a dream?

1375
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,819
Hey. I see you've changed.

1376
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,620
I'm sorry?

1377
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,019
Oh, I'm sorry. I mistook
you for a friend.

1378
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,419
Oh.

1379
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,720
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1380
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:59,319
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1381
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,268
Let's follow him and
see how he behaves.

1382
01:35:01,269 --> 01:35:02,269
Why?

1383
01:35:02,271 --> 01:35:03,519
Because how he acts
will tell us...

1384
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,193
if Fischer is starting to suspect

1385
01:35:05,194 --> 01:35:07,019
his motives the way
we want him to.

1386
01:35:12,282 --> 01:35:13,282
Uncle Peter.

1387
01:35:13,283 --> 01:35:15,219
You said you were
kidnapped together?

1388
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:18,819
Well, not exactly. They already
had him. They were torturing him.

1389
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,520
And you saw them torture him?

1390
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,920
The kidnappers are
working for you?

1391
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,319
Robert.

1392
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:36,320
You're trying to get that safe
open? To get the alternate will?

1393
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,919
Fischer Morrow has been my entire
life. I can't let you destroy it.

1394
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,519
I'm not gonna throw
away my inheritance.

1395
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,820
I couldn't let you rise to
your father's last taunt.

1396
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:51,619
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1397
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,719
That's his last insult.

1398
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,619
A challenge for you to build
something for yourself...

1399
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:01,620
by telling you you're not
worthy of his accomplishments.

1400
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:11,220
What, but that he
was, disappointed?

1401
01:36:11,221 --> 01:36:12,620
I'm sorry.

1402
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:17,120
But he's wrong.

1403
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:20,419
You can build a better
company than he ever did.

1404
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:23,019
Mr Fischer? He's lying.

1405
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,319
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1406
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:28,220
He's hiding something, and we
need to find out what that is.

1407
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,069
I need you to do the same thing to

1408
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:32,920
him that he was
going to do to you.

1409
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:37,399
We'll enter his
subconscious and find

1410
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,520
out what he doesn't
want you to know.

1411
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,220
All right.

1412
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,419
- He's out.
- Wait.

1413
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:51,719
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1414
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,219
We're going into Fischer's.

1415
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:56,019
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1416
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,519
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1417
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,319
That's right.

1418
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,519
Security's gonna
run you down hard.

1419
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,120
And I will lead them
on a merry chase.

1420
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,220
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr Eames.

1421
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,720
You good?

1422
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:19,119
Hey. You ready?

1423
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:22,920
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1424
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,820
Cobb?

1425
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,920
Cobb? What's down there?

1426
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,919
Hopefully, the truth we
want Fischer to learn.

1427
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,020
I mean, what's down there for you?

1428
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,420
Did you see that?

1429
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,719
Eames, this is your dream.

1430
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,019
I need you to draw the security
away from the complex, understand?

1431
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:51,919
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

1432
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,619
If I know the route, everything
could be compromised.

1433
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:57,319
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1434
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,020
I could do it.

1435
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,919
All right. Brief him on the
route into the complex.

1436
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,330
Fischer, you'll be going with him.

1437
01:41:04,331 --> 01:41:06,219
All right. What about you?

1438
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:09,219
You keep this live. I'll be
listening in the whole time.

1439
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,292
The windows on that
upper floor are big

1440
01:41:11,293 --> 01:41:13,519
enough for me to cover
you from that tower.

1441
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,019
You're not coming in?

1442
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,519
In order to find out the
truth about your father...

1443
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,720
you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1444
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,120
Come on, Fischer.

1445
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:20,755
Sound the alarm. Sound the alarm.

1446
01:42:20,756 --> 01:42:21,819
Go, go, go.

1447
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:23,520
Move.

1448
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,120
Go.

1449
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,420
Sod it.

1450
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:55,220
I hope you're ready.

1451
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:05,720
No, it's too soon.

1452
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,419
Cobb, do you hear that?

1453
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,244
I first noticed it
about 20 minutes

1454
01:43:15,245 --> 01:43:17,220
ago, I thought it was
the wind up here.

1455
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,219
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1456
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,819
So, what do we do?

1457
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,420
We move fast.

1458
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,120
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1459
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:35,320
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1460
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,420
- Hey.
- That's him.

1461
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,719
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1462
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,516
Can they make that
route in an hour?

1463
01:43:42,517 --> 01:43:44,219
They have to climb to the terrace.

1464
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:47,320
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1465
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,119
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1466
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:02,719
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1467
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,520
Eames?

1468
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:28,819
Did Eames add any features?

1469
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:30,519
I don't think I should tell you.

1470
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,020
We don't have time for
this. Did he add anything?

1471
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:36,119
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1472
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,519
Good. Explain it to them.

1473
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,920
- Saito?
- Go ahead.

1474
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,820
Paradox.

1475
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,820
- What was that?
- The kick.

1476
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,319
Cobb. Cobb, did we miss it?

1477
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,119
Yeah, we missed it.

1478
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,519
Man.

1479
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,019
Couldn't someone have dreamt
up a goddamn beach? Huh?

1480
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,420
Huh.

1481
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:40,319
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1482
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,319
We finish the job
before the next kick.

1483
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,620
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1484
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:10,919
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

1485
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,919
If you need help, hang up...

1486
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,420
How do I drop you without gravity?

1487
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,620
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1488
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,720
You okay?

1489
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:55,019
Run. Turn around. Move
to base. Move to base.

1490
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,720
Go, go, go.

1491
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,019
There's something wrong.

1492
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:02,620
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1493
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:06,019
Just buy us more time, all right?

1494
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:08,019
- Come on.
- On my way.

1495
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:09,920
Come on. Move.

1496
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:35,720
All right.

1497
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,719
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1498
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,497
Does the strong room have windows?

1499
01:49:52,498 --> 01:49:54,419
It wouldn't be very
strong if it did.

1500
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,820
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1501
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:00,844
Are those projections
his subconscious?

1502
01:50:00,845 --> 01:50:01,919
Yes.

1503
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,720
Are you destroying
parts of his mind?

1504
01:50:03,721 --> 01:50:05,320
No. They're just projections.

1505
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,319
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1506
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,320
There's an entire
army headed your way.

1507
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:03,520
I'm in.

1508
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,020
There he is.

1509
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,220
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1510
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:59,020
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1511
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,920
Cobb.

1512
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,020
No, she is not real.

1513
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,919
How do you know that?

1514
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:14,720
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1515
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,220
Hello.

1516
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,120
Eames. Eames, get to
the antechamber now.

1517
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:14,920
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1518
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:19,220
I couldn't shoot her.

1519
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,519
There's no use in
reviving him. His

1520
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,219
mind's already trapped down there.

1521
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,520
It's all over.

1522
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,820
So that's it, then? We failed?

1523
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,620
We're done. I'm sorry.

1524
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:37,120
It's not me that doesn't get
back to my family, is it?

1525
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:39,723
Shame. I wanted to
know what was gonna

1526
01:53:39,724 --> 01:53:41,719
happen in there. I
swear we had this.

1527
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:44,020
Let's set the charges.

1528
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:47,320
No, there's still another way.

1529
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:50,860
We have to follow
Fischer down there.

1530
01:53:50,861 --> 01:53:52,019
Not enough time.

1531
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:55,020
No, but there will be
enough time down there.

1532
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:57,219
And we will find him.

1533
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:59,294
Okay, as soon as
Arthur's music kicks in,

1534
01:53:59,295 --> 01:54:01,319
just use the defibrillator
to revive him.

1535
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:04,420
We can give him his
own kick down below.

1536
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,119
Look, you get him in there.

1537
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:10,219
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1538
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,220
and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1539
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:16,863
It's worth a shot, if
Saito can hold the

1540
01:54:16,864 --> 01:54:19,119
guards off while I
set the charges.

1541
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,420
Saito will never make it, will he?

1542
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:24,869
Cobb, come on. We've
gotta try this.

1543
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:25,919
Go for it.

1544
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,631
If you are not back
before the kick,

1545
01:54:27,632 --> 01:54:29,019
I am gone with or without you.

1546
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,420
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1547
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,819
Can I trust you to do what
needs to happen here?

1548
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:40,219
Mal's gonna be down there.

1549
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:42,819
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1550
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,030
How do you know?

1551
01:54:44,031 --> 01:54:46,919
Because she wants me
to come after him.

1552
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,220
She wants me back
down there with her.

1553
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,020
All right?

1554
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:26,920
- This is your world?
- It was.

1555
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,720
And this is where she'll be.

1556
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,020
Come on.

1557
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,920
Saito. Saito.

1558
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:25,319
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1559
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,920
No room for tourists
on these jobs.

1560
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:32,720
Don't be silly.

1561
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:07,320
You built all this?
This is incredible.

1562
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,820
We built for years.

1563
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,820
Then we started in
on the memories.

1564
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,320
This way.

1565
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:05,019
This was our neighbourhood.

1566
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:07,519
Places from our past.

1567
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,519
That was our first apartment.

1568
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:11,919
Then we moved to that
building right there.

1569
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,619
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1570
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:17,619
You reconstructed all
of this from memory?

1571
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:20,019
Like I told you, we
had lots of time.

1572
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:21,820
What is that?

1573
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:25,119
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1574
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:27,720
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1575
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:29,019
Come on.

1576
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:30,720
We both wanted to live in a house,

1577
01:58:30,721 --> 01:58:32,519
but we loved this
type of building.

1578
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,720
In the real world, we'd have
to choose, but not here.

1579
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:18,320
How are we gonna
bring Fischer back?

1580
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:21,119
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1581
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:22,720
What?

1582
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:24,919
I'm gonna improvise.

1583
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,532
Listen, there's
something you should

1584
01:59:27,533 --> 01:59:29,720
know about me. About inception.

1585
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:46,720
An idea is like a
virus. Resilient.

1586
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,119
Highly contagious.

1587
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:52,620
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1588
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,620
It can grow to define...

1589
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,220
or destroy you.

1590
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:04,120
The smallest idea, such as:

1591
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,120
"Your world is not real."

1592
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:11,120
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1593
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:16,819
So certain of your
world. Of what's real.

1594
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:18,820
Do you think he is?

1595
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:23,520
Or do you think he's
as lost as I was?

1596
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,220
I know what's real, Mal.

1597
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:30,620
No creeping doubts?

1598
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,920
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1599
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:35,519
Chased around the globe...

1600
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,319
by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1601
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,220
the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1602
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:44,320
Admit it.

1603
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:48,419
You don't believe in
one reality any more.

1604
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:50,119
So choose.

1605
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:52,520
Choose to be here.

1606
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:54,520
Choose me.

1607
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:21,619
You know what I have to do.

1608
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:24,520
I have to get back to our
children because you left them.

1609
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:27,319
Because you left us.

1610
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:29,319
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1611
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,520
You're confused.

1612
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:34,720
Our children are here.

1613
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:38,719
And you'd like to see their
faces again, wouldn't you?

1614
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:42,020
Yes, but I'm gonna see
them up above, Mal.

1615
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:57,620
Up above?

1616
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:02,220
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1617
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,120
Watch.

1618
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:06,319
James? Phillipa?

1619
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,919
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1620
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:11,519
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1621
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,620
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1622
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:16,320
What if I'm what's real?

1623
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:19,720
You keep telling
yourself what you know.

1624
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:23,520
But what do you believe?

1625
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,720
What do you feel?

1626
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:29,320
Guilt.

1627
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,720
I feel guilt, Mal.

1628
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:37,219
And no matter what I do, no
matter how hopeless I am...

1629
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:41,619
no matter how confused, that
guilt is always there...

1630
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:44,320
reminding me of the truth.

1631
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,220
What truth?

1632
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:50,961
That the idea that caused you to

1633
02:02:50,962 --> 02:02:53,820
question your reality
came from me.

1634
02:02:57,020 --> 02:03:00,320
You planted the idea in my mind?

1635
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:03,320
What is she talking about?

1636
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:07,027
The reason I knew
inception was possible

1637
02:03:07,028 --> 02:03:09,520
was because I did it to her first.

1638
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:13,520
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1639
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,720
We were lost in here.

1640
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,320
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1641
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:30,220
She had locked something
away, something deep inside.

1642
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,120
A truth that she had once
known, but chose to forget.

1643
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,220
And she couldn't break free.

1644
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:43,620
So I decided to search for it.

1645
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:49,119
I went deep into the recess of her
mind and found that secret place.

1646
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,220
And I broke in...

1647
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,920
and I planted an idea.

1648
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:58,420
A simple little idea that
would change everything.

1649
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:06,020
That her world wasn't real.

1650
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:22,020
That death was the only escape.

1651
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,220
You're waiting for a train.

1652
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:36,220
A train that'll take you far away.

1653
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:40,420
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1654
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:43,520
but you can't know for sure.

1655
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,220
Yet it doesn't matter.

1656
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,820
- Now, tell me why.
- Because you'll be together.

1657
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:57,267
But I never knew
that that idea would

1658
02:04:57,268 --> 02:04:59,219
grow in her mind like a cancer...

1659
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:01,820
that even after she woke...

1660
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:07,220
That even after you
came back to reality...

1661
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,120
that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1662
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:18,219
That death was the only escape.

1663
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:21,119
Mal, no. Jesus.

1664
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:25,019
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1665
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,620
You betrayed me.

1666
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:31,119
But you can make amends. You
can still keep your promise.

1667
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:34,319
We can still be
together, right here...

1668
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,920
in the world we built together.

1669
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:00,120
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1670
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:02,220
You can't have him.

1671
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:05,155
If I stay here, will
you let him go?

1672
02:07:05,156 --> 02:07:06,720
What are you talking about?

1673
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:13,020
Fischer is on the porch.

1674
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:16,219
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1675
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:19,020
Go check he's alive
right now. Do it.

1676
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:37,719
He's here. And it's time,
but you have to come now.

1677
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,720
You take Fischer
with you, all right?

1678
02:07:39,721 --> 02:07:41,620
You can't stay here
to be with her.

1679
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:46,819
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1680
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:48,863
That means he's down
here somewhere.

1681
02:07:48,864 --> 02:07:50,520
That means I have to find him.

1682
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,619
I can't stay with her any more,
because she doesn't exist.

1683
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:59,219
I'm the only thing you
do believe in any more.

1684
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,720
No.

1685
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:03,320
I wish.

1686
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:07,420
I wish more than anything, but...

1687
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:11,219
I can't imagine you with
all your complexity...

1688
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,920
all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1689
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,119
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1690
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:18,120
Look at you.

1691
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:24,320
You're just a shade. You're
just a shade of my real wife.

1692
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,320
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1693
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:30,619
I'm sorry, you're
just not good enough.

1694
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:32,420
Does this feel real?

1695
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:37,420
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1696
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:47,720
No, no, no.

1697
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,120
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1698
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,820
I was dis...

1699
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:41,920
I was dis... disa...

1700
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,320
- I know, Dad.
- Dis...

1701
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:53,420
I know you were disappointed...

1702
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:55,620
I couldn't be you.

1703
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,420
No.

1704
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,320
No, no, no.

1705
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,320
I was disappointed...

1706
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:06,020
that you tried.

1707
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,920
What?

1708
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:41,520
Come on, come on.

1709
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,220
Dad?

1710
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:54,620
That's the kick, Ariadne.
You have to go now.

1711
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:10,919
Don't lose yourself. Find
Saito and bring him back.

1712
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,820
I will.

1713
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:55,619
You remember when you
asked me to marry you?

1714
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:56,919
Yes.

1715
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:00,220
You said you dreamt that
we'd grow old together.

1716
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:04,420
But we did.

1717
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:08,720
We did. You don't remember?

1718
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:16,220
I miss you more than I can bear...

1719
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:20,520
but we had our time together.

1720
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:24,020
And I have to let you go.

1721
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:27,920
I have to let you go.

1722
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,420
I'm sorry, Robert.

1723
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:51,720
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1724
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:54,820
not just to live for him.

1725
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:59,020
That's what I'm gonna
do, Uncle Peter.

1726
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:10,020
What happened?

1727
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,119
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1728
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:13,620
No, to find Saito.

1729
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:17,620
He'll be lost.

1730
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:22,020
No, he'll be all right.

1731
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:40,020
Have you come to kill me?

1732
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:46,720
I'm waiting for someone.

1733
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:54,020
Someone from a
half-remembered dream.

1734
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:58,120
Cobb?

1735
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:01,820
Impossible.

1736
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:04,920
We were young men together.

1737
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:08,920
I'm an old man.

1738
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:12,220
Filled with regret.

1739
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:18,020
Waiting to die alone.

1740
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:23,420
I've come back for you.

1741
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:30,520
To remind you of something.

1742
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:36,220
Something you once knew.

1743
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:41,320
That this world is not real.

1744
02:16:46,020 --> 02:16:50,720
To convince me to
honour our arrangement?

1745
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:54,320
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1746
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:01,720
Come back...

1747
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:07,620
so we can be young
men together again.

1748
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:13,420
Come back with me.

1749
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,920
Come back.

1750
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:29,320
Hot towel, sir?

1751
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:32,819
We'll be landing in Los
Angeles in about 20 minutes.

1752
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:35,320
Do you need immigration forms?

1753
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:38,720
Thank you.

1754
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:40,820
Hot towel, sir?

1755
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:44,820
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1756
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:57,320
Welcome home, Mr Cobb.

1757
02:18:58,220 --> 02:19:00,120
Thank you, sir.

1758
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:45,520
Welcome.

1759
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:47,320
This way.

1760
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:12,020
James? Phillipa?

1761
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:17,020
Look who's here.

1762
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:23,720
Hey.

1763
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:27,519
- Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
- Daddy. Daddy.

1764
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:29,920
- Daddy.
- How are you?

1765
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:32,620
Look what I've been building.

1766
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:34,182
What are you building?

1767
02:20:34,183 --> 02:20:36,619
We're building a
house on the cliff.

1768
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:39,619
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1769
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:42,420
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy.
