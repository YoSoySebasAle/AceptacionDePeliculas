1
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,754
I owe everything to George Bailey.

2
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,048
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,468
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

4
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,179
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

5
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:40,266
Help my son George tonight.

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,977
He never thinks about himself, God.

7
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,812
That's why he's in trouble.

8
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,022
George is a good guy.

9
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,482
Give him a break, God.

10
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,693
I love him, dear Lord.

11
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:52,653
Watch over him tonight.

12
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,447
Please, God.

13
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,824
Something's the matter with Daddy.

14
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:59,201
Please bring Daddy back.

15
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,329
Please bring Daddy home.

16
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,623
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,292
Please bring Daddy back.

18
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,214
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

19
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,884
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

20
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,054
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.

21
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,680
George Bailey?

22
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,224
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.

23
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,186
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

24
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,605
That's why I came to see you, sir.

25
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,274
It's that clockmaker's turn again.

26
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,611
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

27
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,571
We've passed him up right along.

28
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,116
Because, you know, sir,
he's got the IQ of a rabbit.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,662
Yes, but he's got
the faith of a child. Simple.

30
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,789
Joseph, send for Clarence.

31
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,460
You sent for me, sir?

32
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:52,588
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.

33
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,256
Splendid. Is he sick?

34
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,550
No, worse. He's discouraged.

35
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,220
At exactly 10:45 p.m. Earth time,

36
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,347
that man will be thinking seriously

37
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,391
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

38
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:07,061
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.

39
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,396
What are they wearing now?

40
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,607
You will spend that hour
getting acquainted with George Bailey.

41
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,694
Sir, if I should
accomplish this mission,

42
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,239
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

43
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,741
I've been waiting
for over 200 years now, sir,

44
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,410
and people are beginning to talk.

45
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,953
What's that book you've got there?

46
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,205
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

47
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,666
Clarence, you do a good job
with George Bailey

48
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,084
and you'll get your wings.

49
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,919
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

50
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,755
Poor George. Sit down.

51
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,965
Sit down? What are we...

52
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,758
If you're going to help a man,

53
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,177
you want to know something about him,
don't you?

54
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,762
Well, naturally, of course. I...

55
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,139
Now, keep your eyes open.

56
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,099
See the town?

57
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,893
Where? I don't see a thing.

58
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,813
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.

59
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,858
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.

60
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,318
Begin to see something?

61
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,113
Why, yes. This is amazing.

62
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,782
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

63
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,617
Oh, wonderful.

64
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,412
Yay! Yippee!

65
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,456
Okay, boys, let's go.

66
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,249
Hey, who's that?

67
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,168
That's your problem. George Bailey.

68
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,294
A boy?

69
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,464
That's him when he was 12
back in 1919.

70
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,884
Something happens here
you'll have to remember later on.

71
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,303
Come on, Marty.

72
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,263
Let's go, Marty!

73
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,557
Attaboy, Marty.

74
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,101
Hee-haw!

75
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,145
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

76
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:36,317
Here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother Harry Bailey.

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,152
I'm not scared.

78
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,654
Come on, Harry.

79
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,698
Let's go, Harry!

80
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,116
Come on, Harry!

81
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,326
Come on, Harry!

82
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,453
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,538
Help, George, help!

84
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,748
Help!

85
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:54,335
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!

86
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,712
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

87
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,256
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.

88
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,842
George saved
his brother's life that day,

89
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,596
but he caught a bad cold
which infected his left ear.

90
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:08,265
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

91
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,643
It was weeks
before he was able to go back

92
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:14,104
to his after-school job
at old man Gower's drugstore.

93
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:15,981
Mr. Potter.

94
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,359
Who's that, a king?

95
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,361
That's Henry F. Potter,

96
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:23,781
the richest and meanest man
in the county.

97
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,287
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

98
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:32,289
Go to work, slave.

99
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,960
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

100
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,380
Wish I had a million dollars.

101
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,257
Hot dog!

102
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,012
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

103
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,097
You're late.

104
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,473
Yes, sir.

105
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,149
Hello, George.

106
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:00,776
Hello, Mary.

107
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:02,403
Hello, Violet.

108
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,071
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

109
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,531
She was here first.

110
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,449
I'm still thinking.

111
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,576
Shoelaces?

112
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,286
Please, Georgie.

113
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:11,912
I like him.

114
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,747
You like every boy.

115
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,499
What's wrong with that?

116
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,084
Here you are.

117
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,086
Help me down?

118
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,088
Help you down?

119
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,597
Made up your mind yet?

120
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,473
I'll take chocolate.

121
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,268
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.

122
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,312
You don't like coconuts?

123
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,815
Say, brainless, don't you know
where coconuts come from?

124
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,817
Lookit here.

125
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,112
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands,
the Coral Sea.

126
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,657
A new magazine. I never saw it before.

127
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,368
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.

128
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,831
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

129
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,251
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

130
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,922
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.

131
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,008
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.

132
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,345
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems
and maybe three or four wives.

133
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,679
Wait and see.

134
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,061
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?

135
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,605
You're not paid to be a canary.

136
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,231
No, sir.

137
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,595
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?

138
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,805
No.

139
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,141
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.

140
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,060
I'll get them, sir.

141
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:00,938
Quick, take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine.

142
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,357
She's waiting for them.

143
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,775
Yes, sir.

144
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,466
They have the diphtheria there,
haven't they, sir?

145
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,634
Yeah.

146
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,469
Is it a charge, sir?

147
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,138
Yes, George.

148
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,848
Mr. Gower, ll...

149
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,350
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?

151
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,590
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.

152
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,425
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.

153
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,052
It's shaping up into a storm.

154
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,262
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?

155
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,598
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?

156
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,892
I should have called him yesterday.

157
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,602
Switch it inside.

158
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,272
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

159
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,232
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.

160
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,109
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.

161
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,444
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.

162
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:33,238
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

163
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,740
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.

164
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,617
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure

165
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,161
on these people of yours
to pay those mortgages?

166
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,580
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.

167
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:42,748
Well, then, foreclose.

168
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,458
I can't do that.
These families have children.

169
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,126
- Pop.
- They're not my children.

170
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,128
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.

171
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,756
Are you running a business
or a charity ward?

172
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,966
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

173
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,636
Mr. Potter, what makes you
such a hard-skulled character?

174
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,554
You have no family, no children.

175
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,473
You can't begin
to spend all the money you've got.

176
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:02,810
I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures

177
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,146
like you and that idiot brother
of yours to spend for me.

178
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,439
He's not a failure!

179
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,317
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.

180
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,777
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...

181
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,362
- Run along, run along.
- ...bigger than him,

182
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,614
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

183
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,449
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

184
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,159
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

185
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,994
I'll talk to you tonight.

186
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,378
What?

187
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,798
Why, that medicine should have
been there an hour ago.

188
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,843
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.

189
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,015
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

190
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,767
I... You...

191
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,936
Didn't you hear what I said?

192
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,104
Yes, sir...

193
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,690
What kind of tricks
are you playing anyway?

194
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,444
Why didn't you deliver them
right away?

195
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,029
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

196
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,614
You're hurting my sore ear.

197
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,283
You lazy loafer.

198
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,285
Mr. Gower,
you don't know what you're doing.

199
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:03,245
You put something wrong
in those capsules.

200
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:04,580
I know you're unhappy.

201
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,373
You got the telegram,
and you're upset.

202
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,292
You put something bad
in those capsules.

203
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,711
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

204
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,172
Just look and see what you did.

205
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,841
The bottle you took the powder from,
it's poison.

206
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,634
I tell you, it's poison.

207
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,553
I know you feel bad.

208
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,643
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!

209
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,772
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

210
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,692
Oh, Mr. Gower,
I won't ever tell anyone.

211
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:35,152
I know how you're feeling.

212
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:37,905
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.

213
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh, George. George.

214
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,784
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.

215
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,036
Combination lock.

216
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:47,414
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

217
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,541
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

218
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,169
I want a big one.

219
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,004
What did you stop it for?

220
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:57,341
I want you to take a good look
at that face.

221
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,467
Who is it?

222
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,593
George Bailey.

223
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:02,679
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears
slapped back by the druggist?

224
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,056
That's the kid.

225
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,143
It's a good face. I like it.

226
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,020
! like George Bailey.

227
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,148
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone
about the pills?

228
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,399
Not a soul.

229
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,486
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

230
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,321
Well wait and see.

231
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:22,157
Big, see?
I don't want one for one night.

232
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,243
I want something for 1,001 nights

233
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,789
with plenty of room here for labels
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.

234
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,040
Great big thing, about...

235
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,292
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

236
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,795
I don't suppose you'd like
this old secondhand job, would you?

237
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:36,088
Now you're talking.

238
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:39,049
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft
in case the boat sunk.

239
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,385
- How much this cost?
- No charge.

240
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,137
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."

241
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,222
That's right.

242
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:48,141
Well, what's my name doing on it?

243
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,270
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

244
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,731
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?

245
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,066
What boat are you sailing on?

246
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,651
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

247
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,903
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

248
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:04,157
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

249
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,660
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.

250
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:07,828
Forget it.

251
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,497
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.

252
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,374
<i>1 wish I had a million dollars.</i>

253
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:13,709
Hot dog!

254
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,044
Avast there, Captain Cook!

255
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,338
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous francais, mister?

256
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,716
Hey, send us some of those
picture postcards, will you, George?

257
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,551
Hey, George,
don't take any plug nickels.

258
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,303
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

259
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,595
Hey, Ernie!

260
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,140
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.

261
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,017
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.

262
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,518
How about driving me home in style?

263
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:33,312
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.

264
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,273
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.

265
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,110
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

266
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:41,403
Hello, Violet.

267
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,780
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.

268
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,365
This old thing?

269
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,951
Why, I only wear it
when I don't care how I look.

270
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,886
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.

271
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,972
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

272
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,140
No, thanks.

273
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:13,477
I think I'll go home
and see what the wife's doing.

274
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,646
Family man.

275
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,901
George, Harry,
you're shaking the house down.

276
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,069
Stop it.

277
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,821
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.

278
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,866
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!

279
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,868
That's why
all children should be girls.

280
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,162
Well, if they were all girls
there wouldn't be any...

281
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,622
Oh, never mind.

282
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:36,249
George, Harry,
come down to dinner this minute.

283
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,376
Everything's getting cold,

284
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,378
and you know how long
we've been waiting for you.

285
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,171
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.

286
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,508
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

287
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,638
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.

288
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,517
Oh, you two idiots.

289
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,519
George, sit down and have dinner.

290
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:56,603
- Fine.
- I've eaten.

291
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,355
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing
for your graduating party?

292
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,439
Look at you!

293
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,941
I don't care. It's George's tux.

294
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,859
Annie, my sweet,
have you got those pies?

295
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,153
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!

296
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,448
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.

297
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:12,494
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal
in the old Bailey boarding house.

298
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,496
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

299
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,915
Pop, can I have the car? I got to
take over a lot of plates and things.

300
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:17,999
What plates?

301
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,459
Mom, I'm chairman
of the Eats Committee.

302
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,710
We only need a couple of dozen.

303
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,172
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.

304
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,258
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

305
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:29,302
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

306
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,929
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

307
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,305
What's the matter? You look tired.

308
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,641
I had another tussle
with Potter today.

309
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,726
I thought when we put him
on the board of directors,

310
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,145
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

311
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:41,106
What's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

312
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:44,109
He's a sick man, frustrated,
sick in his mind.

313
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,986
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

314
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,822
He hates everybody
that has anything that he can't have.

315
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,615
He hates us mostly, I guess.

316
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,033
Gangway. Gangway.

317
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,577
- So long, Pop.
- So long.

318
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,662
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.

319
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:56,746
Put those things in the car,

320
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,999
and I'll get your tie and studs
ready for you. Now, hurry up.

321
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,375
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.

322
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,668
You coming later, George?

323
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,003
What do you mean,
and be bored to death?

324
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,713
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls,

325
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,173
and we're gonna use
that new floor tonight, too.

326
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,966
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.

327
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,259
Oh, Pop, just a little?

328
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,178
No, Son. Not one drop.

329
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,847
Boys and girls and music.

330
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,849
Why do they need gin?

331
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,977
Did I act like that
when I graduated from high school?

332
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,228
Pretty much.

333
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,356
You know, George, I wish we could send
Harry to college with you.

334
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,067
Your mother and I talked it over
half the night.

335
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,028
We have that all figured out.

336
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,238
You see, Harry will take my job
at the Building and Loan,

337
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,074
work there for four years,
then he'll go.

338
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,826
Pretty young for that job.

339
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,620
Well, no younger than I was.

340
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:39,039
Well, you were born older, George.

341
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:41,583
How's that?

342
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,376
I said you were born older.

343
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,836
I suppose you've decided
what you want to do

344
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,213
when you get out of college.

345
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,256
Well, you know
what I've always talked about,

346
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,760
build things, design new buildings,
plan modern cities.

347
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,178
All that stuff
I've been talking about.

348
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,055
Still after that first million
before you're 307?

349
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:57,599
I'll settle for half that in cash.

350
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,310
Of course, it's just a hope.

351
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,604
But you wouldn't consider coming back

352
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,898
to the Building and Loan, would you?

353
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,151
Well,... I...

354
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,573
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable,

355
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,534
and you could hear everything
that's going on.

356
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,078
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.

357
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:19,704
You would, eh?

358
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,998
I know it's soon to talk about it.

359
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,668
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.

360
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,671
I couldn't face being cooped up
for the rest of my life

361
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:29,548
in a shabby little office.

362
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:34,010
I'm sorry, Pop.
I didn't mean that, but I...

363
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,721
It's this business
of nickels and dimes

364
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,974
and spending all your life
trying to figure out

365
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,976
how to save three cents
on a length of pipe.

366
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,104
I'd go crazy. I want to do
something big and something important.

367
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:47,148
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way,

368
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,150
we're doing something important,

369
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,444
satisfying a fundamental urge.

370
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,530
It's deep in the race
for a man to want his own roof

371
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,824
and walls and fireplace.

372
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,867
And we're helping him get those things

373
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,619
in our shabby little office.

374
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,373
I know, Pop. I know that.

375
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:05,500
I wish I felt that...

376
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:10,005
I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

377
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,216
Most of my friends
have already finished college.

378
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,720
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.

379
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,433
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

380
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,226
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

381
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,853
This town is no place for any man

382
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,230
unless he's willing
to crawl to Potter.

383
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,858
Now, you've got talent, Son.
I've seen it.

384
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,820
You get yourself an education
and get out of here.

385
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,199
Pop, you want a shock?

386
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,828
I think you're a great guy.

387
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,542
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.

388
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,003
It's about time
one of you lunkheads said it.

389
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,923
I'm gonna miss old Annie.

390
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:00,555
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

391
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,265
Have a good time, Son.

392
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,438
Excuse me.

393
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,065
There you are.

394
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,232
George, hello.

395
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,525
You know my kid brother George.

396
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,569
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.

397
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,945
Hee-haw!

398
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,405
Sam Wainwright.

399
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,032
How are you? When did you get here?

400
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:21,201
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

401
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,702
Old college graduate now.

402
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,871
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright
they call me.

403
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:27,749
Well, freshman, looks like
you're gonna make it after all, huh?

404
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,210
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.

405
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:32,379
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

406
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,297
Yeah, he's followed every game,
and his mouth's watering.

407
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,549
He wants me to find out
if you're gonna come along with us.

408
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,176
Well, I got to make some dough first.

409
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,804
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

410
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:42,555
Not broken down old guys
like this one.

411
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,765
Hee-haw!

412
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,226
George, welcome back.

413
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,936
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

414
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,230
Putting a pool under this floor
was a great idea.

415
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:51,606
Saved us another building.

416
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,566
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

417
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,734
There's lots of stuff here
to eat and drink.

418
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,903
- Lots of pretty girls around.
- Don't worry about the girls.

419
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,405
A third dance... A third...

420
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,574
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?

421
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,867
George.

422
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,786
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

423
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,913
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?

424
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,915
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

425
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:11,418
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

426
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,753
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?

427
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,213
Dance with her, will you?

428
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:18,425
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough
already with all these kids.

429
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,635
Come on, be a sport.
Just dance with her one time,

430
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,929
and you'll give her
the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

431
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,556
Don't be long, Marty.

432
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,349
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...

433
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,435
The next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

434
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,437
That's the reason
why I came in fourth.

435
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,231
If it hadn't been for that,
that race'd have been a cinch.

436
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:36,276
I tried to find out who it was later,
but I couldn't find out.

437
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,029
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was,
because they'd be scared.

438
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,573
"Cause they know
what kind of a guy I am.

439
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:43,783
You remember George. This is Mary.

440
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,493
Well, I'll be seeing you.

441
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,619
Well, well, well.

442
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,456
Now to get back to my story, see?

443
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,918
Hey, this is my dance.

444
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,587
Why don't you stop annoying people?

445
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,797
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

446
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,636
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

447
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,306
You look at me
as if you didn't know me.

448
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:07,599
Well, I don't.

449
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,976
You've passed me on the street
almost every day.

450
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,144
Me?

451
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:14,439
No. That was a little girl
named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

452
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,276
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!

453
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,323
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

454
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,117
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor.

455
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,202
Let's go!

456
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,172
I'm not very good at this.

457
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:40,840
Neither am ll.

458
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,759
Okay. What can we lose?

459
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,105
Hey, you're wonderful.

460
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,885
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

461
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,723
Did you know there's a swimming pool
under this floor?

462
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,017
And did you know
that button behind you

463
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,019
causes this floor to open up?

464
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:39,399
And did you further know
that George Bailey

465
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:41,818
is dancing right over that crack?

466
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,029
And I've got the key.

467
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:10,305
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

468
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:17,186
They're cheering us. We must be good.

469
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,559
Get out of there!

470
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,186
What... Oh, well.

471
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,946
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

472
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,322
Can't you come out tonight?

473
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,823
Can't you come out tonight?

474
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,409
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight

475
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,288
And dance

476
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,375
By the light

477
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:25,004
Of the moon?

478
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,341
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

479
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,635
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

480
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:32,971
You should have seen
the commotion in that locker room.

481
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,807
I had to knock down three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

482
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,767
Let me hold
that old wet dress of yours.

483
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,519
Do I look as funny as you do?

484
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:41,437
I guess
I'm not quite the football type.

485
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,272
You look wonderful!

486
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,024
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

487
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,526
I'd say you were
the prettiest girl in town.

488
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,697
Well, why don't you say it?

489
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,158
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?

490
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,285
Eighteen.

491
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,872
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year
you were seventeen.

492
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:01,874
Too young or too old?

493
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,711
Oh, no, no. Just right.
Your age fits you.

494
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,256
Yes, sir, you look a little older
without your clothes on.

495
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,718
I mean,
without a dress you look older.

496
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,721
I mean younger.
You look... You just...

497
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,724
I'm on the thing here.

498
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,767
Sir, my train, please.

499
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,562
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

500
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,898
Your caboose, milady.

501
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,901
You may kiss my hand.

502
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,822
Hey.

503
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,159
Hey, Mary.

504
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:40,246
As I was lumberin' down the street

505
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:42,790
Down the street, down the street

506
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,460
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

507
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,712
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

508
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:49,714
No, you see, you make a wish
and then try and break some glass.

509
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:51,424
And you got to be
a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

510
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:54,385
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.

511
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,679
I'd like to live in it.

512
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,889
In that place?

513
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,266
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.

514
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,019
Right in the second floor, there. See?

515
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,900
What did you wish, George?

516
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:11,402
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

517
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,571
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

518
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:16,282
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

519
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:19,202
I'm shaking the dust of this
crummy little town off my feet,

520
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,037
and I'm gonna see the world!

521
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,207
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon,
the Coliseum.

522
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,959
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college to see what they know.

523
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,628
And then I'm gonna build things.

524
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,129
I'm gonna build airfields.

525
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,632
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

526
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:35,093
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

527
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,385
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

528
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:43,392
Hey, that's pretty good.

529
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,062
What did you wish, Mary?

530
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,025
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

531
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,360
Can't you come out tonight?

532
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:53,986
Can't you come out tonight?

533
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,115
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight

534
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,201
And

535
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:04,330
Dance by the light of the moon?

536
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,332
What did you wish
when you threw that rock?

537
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,834
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

538
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,710
If I told you, it might not come true.

539
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,671
What is it you want, Mary?

540
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:14,257
What do you want? You want the moon?

541
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,717
Just say the word,
and I'll throw a lasso around it

542
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,885
and pull it down.

543
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,764
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

544
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,349
I'll take it.

545
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:24,851
Then what?

546
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,813
Well, then you could swallow it,
and it would all dissolve, see?

547
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,692
And the moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

548
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:34,777
and the ends of your hair.

549
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,406
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!

550
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,160
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

551
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,286
How's that?

552
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,955
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

553
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:50,042
You want me to kiss her, huh?

554
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,546
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

555
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,967
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!

556
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,428
I'll show you some kissing
that'll put hair back on your head.

557
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:01,762
What are you...

558
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:10,730
Mary?

559
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,868
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

560
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:27,079
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

561
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,665
Here you are. Catch.

562
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,169
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

563
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,884
This is a very interesting situation.

564
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,802
Please give me my robe.

565
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,390
A man doesn't get in a situation
like this every day.

566
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,476
I'd like to have my robe.

567
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,102
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

568
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,396
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

569
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,149
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

570
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,901
Give me my robe.

571
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:59,403
I've read about things like this,
but I've never...

572
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,615
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

573
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:05,326
My mother's way up
on the corner there.

574
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:07,370
I'll call the police.

575
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:10,248
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

576
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,208
Then I'm going to scream!

577
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,710
Maybe I could sell tickets.

578
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,923
Let's see. No, the point is

579
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:21,717
in order to get this robe...
I've got it.

580
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:23,678
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

581
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,221
George! George!

582
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:30,851
George, come on home! Quick!

583
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,354
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?

584
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,273
Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.

585
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,607
Come on, George, let's hurry.

586
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,775
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.

587
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,694
Campbell's there now.

588
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,914
I think that's all
we'll need you for, George.

589
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,165
I know you're anxious to make a train.

590
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,834
I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

591
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,753
I want the board to know
that George gave up his trip to Europe

592
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,589
to help straighten things out here
these past few months.

593
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,550
Good luck to you at school, George.

594
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,593
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.

595
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,305
And now we come to the real purpose
of this meeting,

596
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,057
to appoint a successor
to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

597
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,310
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

598
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,603
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

599
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:18,024
I claim this institution
IS not necessary to this town.

600
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:21,986
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make
a motion to dissolve this institution

601
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:25,364
and turn its assets and liabilities
over to the receiver.

602
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,366
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.

603
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,492
George, did you hear
what that buzzard...

604
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,618
Mr. Chairman.

605
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,495
It's too soon after
Peter Bailey's death

606
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,873
to talk about chloroforming
the Building and Loan.

607
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:36,375
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

608
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,294
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

609
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:39,795
Very well. In that case,

610
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,716
I'll ask the two executive officers
to withdraw. But before you go,

611
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,969
I'm sure the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

612
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,221
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

613
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,265
It was his faith and devotion

614
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,892
that are responsible
for this organization.

615
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:54,894
I'll go further than that.

616
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:57,355
I'll say that to the public

617
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,398
Peter Bailey
was the Building and Loan.

618
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,734
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

619
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:03,778
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

620
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,697
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

621
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,240
That's what killed him.

622
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,035
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect
to him. God rest his soul.

623
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:14,580
He was a man of high ideals,
so-called.

624
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:18,918
But ideals without common sense
can ruin this town.

625
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:22,505
Now, you take this loan here
to Ernie Bishop,

626
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:25,925
you know,
that fellow that sits around all day

627
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:28,761
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

628
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:32,681
I happen to know
the bank turned down this loan.

629
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,433
But he comes here,

630
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:39,313
and we're building him
a house worth $5,000.

631
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,483
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

632
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:45,444
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.

633
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,862
I can personally vouch
for his character.

634
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,864
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

635
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,202
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

636
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,538
you can come and borrow money.

637
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,706
What does that get us?

638
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,668
A discontented, lazy rabble

639
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:02,628
instead of a thrifty working class.

640
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:06,549
And all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers

641
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:09,802
like Peter Bailey stir them up
and fill their heads

642
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:12,138
with a lot of impossible ideas.

643
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,056
Now, I say...

644
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,976
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

645
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:20,312
You're right when you say my father
was no businessman. I know that.

646
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,065
Why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante Building and Loan

647
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,233
I'll never know.

648
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:25,568
But neither you nor anybody else

649
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,153
can say anything
against his character,

650
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,988
because his whole life was...

651
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:31,657
Why, in the 25 years since he
and Uncle Billy started this thing,

652
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,076
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

653
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,996
He didn't save enough money
to send Harry to school, let alone me.

654
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,832
But he did help a few people
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

655
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:41,000
And what's wrong with that?

656
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,003
Why, here,
you're all businessmen here.

657
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:45,296
Don't it make them better citizens,

658
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:47,339
and doesn't it make them
better customers?

659
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,675
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?

660
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:51,552
They had to wait and save their money

661
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:53,095
before they even thought
of a decent home.

662
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,847
Wait? Wait for what?

663
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,640
Until their children grow up
and leave them?

664
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,893
Until they're so old
and broken-down that they...

665
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,604
Do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $5,0007?

666
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:05,065
Just remember this, Mr. Potter,
that this rabble you're talking about,

667
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,942
they do most of the working and paying

668
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,069
and living and dying
in this community.

669
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,614
Well, is it too much to have them work
and pay and live and die

670
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:13,491
in a couple of decent rooms
and a bath?

671
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,659
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

672
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,621
People were human beings to him,
but to you,

673
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:21,624
a warped, frustrated old man,
they're cattle.

674
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,251
Well, in my book, he died
a much richer man than you'll ever be.

675
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,212
I'm not interested in your book.

676
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,631
I'm talking about
the Building and Loan.

677
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:30,883
I know very well
what you're talking about.

678
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:33,260
You're talking about something
you can't get your fingers on,

679
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,180
and it's galling you. That's what
you're talking about, I know.

680
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:38,557
Well, I've said too much. I...

681
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:41,936
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

682
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,604
There's just one thing more, though.

683
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:46,315
This town needs
this measly one-horse institution

684
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,985
if only to have some place where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

685
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,153
Come on, Uncle Billy.

686
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,579
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

687
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:05,251
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.

688
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,169
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

689
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,921
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.

690
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:11,674
Well, we're being voted
out of business after 25 years.

691
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:15,261
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

692
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,304
You still want me
to hang around, George?

693
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,932
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

694
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:21,809
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.

695
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:24,687
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.

696
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,815
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.

697
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,608
- I'm only 55.
- 56.

698
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,069
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

699
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:33,737
now you don't want to miss college,
too, do you?

700
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,282
George! George!
They voted Potter down.

701
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,158
They want to keep it going.

702
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,703
You did it, George. You did it.

703
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:42,955
They got one condition,
only one condition.

704
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:44,623
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.

705
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,750
They've appointed George here
as Executive Secretary

706
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,127
to take his father's place.

707
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,253
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...

708
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:51,046
You can keep him on. That's all right.

709
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,048
As Secretary,
you can hire anyone you like.

710
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,759
Dr. Campbell, now let's get
this thing straight. I'm leaving.

711
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,469
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.

712
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,014
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

713
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,933
But, George,
they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

714
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,771
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.

715
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:09,106
Not only that,

716
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,191
but he gave his school money
to his brother, Harry,

717
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,776
and sent him to college.

718
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,737
Harry became a football star.

719
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,071
Made second team all-American.

720
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,824
Yeah, but what happened to George?

721
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:22,119
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

722
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,288
and take over the Building and Loans.

723
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:26,665
There are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

724
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,791
Look at this. Here.

725
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:32,171
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted,
man with construction experience."

726
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:34,298
Here's the Yukon, right here.

727
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:36,759
"Wanted,
man with engineering experience."

728
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,678
There she blows.

729
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,681
You know what the three most exciting
sounds in the world are?

730
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,017
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...

731
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,812
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains,
plane motors and train whistles.

732
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,023
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.

733
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:53,442
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa
all-American Bailey.

734
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:55,569
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

735
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,737
What? No husky dogs? No sled?

736
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,238
Uncle Billy,
you haven't changed a bit.

737
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,865
Nobody ever changes here,
you know that.

738
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:01,617
Oh, am I glad to see you.

739
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,869
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

740
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:05,829
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

741
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,874
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.

742
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:10,292
- Hello.
- How do you do?

743
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,128
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

744
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,589
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

745
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,299
Here she is. Meet the wife.

746
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,219
Well, what do you know? A wife.

747
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:24,098
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?

748
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:26,892
What am I doing? Congratulations!

749
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,727
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!

750
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,938
Why don't you tell somebody?

751
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,565
Come on, Mrs. Bailey, I can't wait
to see everybody's reaction.

752
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,067
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.

753
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,902
What's a pretty girl like you doing

754
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:38,570
marrying this two-headed brother
of mine?

755
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,072
Well, I'll tell you.
It's purely mercenary.

756
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:41,740
My father offered him a job.

757
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,953
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

758
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,624
George, about that job. Ruth spoke
out of turn. I never said I'd take it.

759
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,544
You've been holding the bag here
for four years, and,

760
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:56,422
well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...

761
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,633
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.

762
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,926
It was a surprise to me.

763
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:02,970
This is the new Mrs. Bailey,
my nephew's wife.

764
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,849
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.

765
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:10,018
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...

766
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,063
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.

767
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,524
And I want to tell you,
we're gonna give the biggest party

768
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:17,067
this town ever saw.

769
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,572
Here, have some popcorn.

770
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,201
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.

771
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,537
Ruth, this...

772
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,830
What about this job?

773
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:32,291
Well, my father owns a glass factory
in Buffalo.

774
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:35,127
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

775
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,421
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

776
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,132
Not much money,
but good future, you know.

777
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,593
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.

778
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:46,054
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

779
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,737
Hey, Joe.

780
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,407
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.

781
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:10,162
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think 1 will.

782
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,748
What did you say? Huh?

783
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,542
Maybe I'd better go home.

784
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,920
Where's my hat? Where's my...

785
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:21,882
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.

786
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:25,010
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

787
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:27,387
if you'll point me
in the right direction...

788
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,472
Would you do that, George?

789
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:29,681
Right down here.

790
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,518
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

791
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,603
Now you just turn this way
and then right straight down there.

792
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:35,687
Oh, that way, huh?

793
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:41,443
My wild Irish rose

794
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,074
I'm all right. I'm all right.

795
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:51,954
The sweetest flower I know

796
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,659
Hello, Ma.

797
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,454
That's for nothing.

798
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,417
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?

799
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,253
Looks like
she can keep Harry on his toes.

800
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:43,672
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

801
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,635
Did you know that Mary Hatch
is back from school?

802
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:51,346
Came back three days ago.

803
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,558
Nice girl, Mary.

804
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:59,187
Kind that'll help you
find the answers, George.

805
00:40:00,188 --> 00:40:01,773
Stop that grunting.

806
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:07,237
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

807
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,739
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

808
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:10,782
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

809
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,160
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?

810
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,995
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

811
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:17,789
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't 1?

812
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,209
Why, she lights up like a firefly
whenever you're around.

813
00:40:22,502 --> 00:40:24,838
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

814
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,926
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.

815
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,219
I don't know about war.

816
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,642
Mother of mine,
I can see right through you

817
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,352
right to your back-collar button.

818
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,437
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

819
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,525
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

820
00:40:46,526 --> 00:40:49,488
All right, Mother,
old Building and Loan pal,

821
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:52,824
I think I'll go out and find a girl
and do a little passionate necking.

822
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,117
Oh, George.

823
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,245
Now, if you'll just point me
in the right direction...

824
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,915
This direction.

825
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,757
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

826
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,854
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

827
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,065
I think I got a date.

828
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,901
But stick around, fellows,
just in case, huh?

829
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,946
We'll wait for you, baby.

830
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:35,117
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.

831
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,412
- What gives?
- Nothing.

832
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:40,706
Where are you going?

833
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,667
On, I'll probably end up
down at the library.

834
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,130
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

835
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,257
Yes.

836
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,593
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

837
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:55,971
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.

838
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:58,265
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

839
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,225
Let's go out in the fields
and take off our shoes

840
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,769
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?

841
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,895
Then we can go up to the falls.

842
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,731
It's beautiful up there
in the moonlight,

843
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:10,027
and there's a green pool up there,
and we can swim in it.

844
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,864
Then we can climb Mount Bedford
and smell the pines

845
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:15,574
and watch the sunrise
against the peaks,

846
00:42:15,657 --> 00:42:17,117
and we'll stay up there
the whole night,

847
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,119
and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.

848
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:20,620
Georgie, have you gone crazy?

849
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,331
Why, walk in the grass
in my bare feet?

850
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,418
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.

851
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,919
If you think...

852
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,881
Okay, just forget about
the whole thing.

853
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:51,943
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.

854
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,113
I just happened to be passing by here.

855
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,032
Yes, so I noticed.

856
00:42:57,699 --> 00:42:59,951
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

857
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,662
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?

858
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,122
About coming in.

859
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,792
Your mother just phoned
and said you were on your way over

860
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,628
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?

861
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,129
Well, how did she know?

862
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,173
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

863
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:16,093
I just went for a walk
and happened to be passing by here.

864
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,719
What do you...

865
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:21,389
Went for a walk. That's all.

866
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:25,644
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.

867
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,793
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

868
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,379
Well, I'll come in for a minute.

869
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:55,799
But I...

870
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,981
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.

871
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,277
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

872
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:18,321
Where did you get that dress?

873
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,949
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

874
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:27,205
I thought you would go back
to New York,

875
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,499
like Sam and Angie
and the rest of them.

876
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:34,671
I worked there a couple of vacations,
but I don't know.

877
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:36,131
I guess I was homesick.

878
00:44:36,214 --> 00:44:39,217
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

879
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:42,470
Yes, and my family and...

880
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:44,890
Everything.

881
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:47,893
Would you like to sit down?

882
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,811
All right, for a minute.

883
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,564
I still can't understand it, though.

884
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:54,816
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.

885
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,234
Would you rather leave?

886
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,195
No. I don't want to be rude.

887
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,821
Well, then, sit down.

888
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,198
What's that?

889
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:05,785
Some joke, huh?

890
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,083
Well...

891
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:16,338
I see it still smells like
pine needles around here.

892
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,173
Thank you.

893
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,182
And dance by the

894
00:45:27,682 --> 00:45:29,059
What's the matter?

895
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,978
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

896
00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:35,982
Well...

897
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,443
Nice about your brother Harry
and Ruth, isn't it?

898
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:40,612
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

899
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,030
Don't you like her?

900
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:44,574
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.

901
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:49,663
Oh, just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

902
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:54,292
No. Marriage is all right
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

903
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,086
Mary! Mary!

904
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:57,545
Who's down there with you?

905
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,506
It's George Bailey, Mother.

906
00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:02,300
George Bailey? What's he want?

907
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,885
I don't know.

908
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,720
What do you want?

909
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,224
Me? Not a thing.

910
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:11,351
I just came in to get warm.

911
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,481
He's making
violent love to me, Mother.

912
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,277
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either!

913
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,488
Sam Wainwright promised to call you
from New York tonight.

914
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:26,574
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...

915
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,160
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.

916
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,871
You're supposed to be the one
that has all the answers. You tell me.

917
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,832
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.

918
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:35,542
I don't know why I came here
in the first place.

919
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,085
- Good night.
- Good night!

920
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:40,171
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.

921
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,506
I'll get it.

922
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,384
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

923
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,729
Mary, he's waiting.

924
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,275
Hello?

925
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:03,570
Forgot my hat.

926
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,783
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

927
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,911
I'm great. Gee, it's good
to hear your voice again.

928
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,789
Well, that's awfully
sweet of you, Sam.

929
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,210
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.

930
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,046
You mean old mossback George?

931
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,715
Yes, old mossback George.

932
00:47:23,798 --> 00:47:25,759
Hee-haw! Put him on.

933
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,136
Wait just a minute.
I'll call him. George!

934
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:30,388
He doesn't want to speak to George,
you idiot.

935
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,349
He does so. He asked for him.

936
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,894
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

937
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,316
Hi, Sam.

938
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:45,236
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.

939
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,155
What're you trying to do,
steal my girl?

940
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:48,239
What do you mean?

941
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,116
Nobody's trying to
steal anybody's girl.

942
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,118
Here... Here's Mary.

943
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,579
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
! want to talk to both of you.

944
00:47:54,662 --> 00:47:56,122
Tell Mary to get on the extension.

945
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,501
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!

946
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:01,669
We can both hear. Come here.

947
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,422
We're listening, Sam.

948
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,383
Well, look,
I have a big deal coming up

949
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,093
that's gonna make us all rich.

950
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,762
George, do you remember
that night in Martini's bar

951
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:14,516
when you told me you'd read some place
about making plastics out of soybeans?

952
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,768
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?

953
00:48:16,851 --> 00:48:19,521
You remember, out of chill...
Out of soybeans.

954
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,817
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

955
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,236
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea,

956
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,822
and he's gonna build
a factory outside of Rochester.

957
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,448
How do you like that?

958
00:48:32,158 --> 00:48:35,370
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

959
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,206
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?

960
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,918
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?

961
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:45,713
You remember that old tool
and machinery works?

962
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,799
You tell your father
he can get that for a song.

963
00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:49,175
And all the labor he wants, too.

964
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,719
Half the town was thrown out of work
when they closed down.

965
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,097
That so? Well, I'll tell him.

966
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,515
Hey, that sounds great.

967
00:48:55,598 --> 00:48:57,475
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

968
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,603
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.

969
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,106
Now listen. Have you got any money?

970
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,777
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

971
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:08,862
Well now, listen.

972
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,072
! want you to put every cent
you've got into our stock,

973
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,157
do you hear?

974
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,951
And, George, I may have a job for you,

975
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:18,997
that is unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

976
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,291
Well, this is the biggest thing
since radio,

977
00:49:21,374 --> 00:49:23,501
and I'm letting you in
on the ground floor.

978
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,628
Oh, Mary. Mary?

979
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,549
I'm here.

980
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,885
Would you tell that guy

981
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,012
I'm giving him the chance
of a lifetime, do you hear?

982
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:35,972
The chance of a lifetime!

983
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,895
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

984
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:46,941
Now you listen to me.

985
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,153
I don't want any plastics,
and I don't want any ground floors.

986
00:49:50,236 --> 00:49:52,197
And I don't want to get married,
ever, to anyone.

987
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,698
You understand that?

988
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:55,700
I want to do what I want to do.

989
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:58,870
And you're... And you're...

990
00:49:58,953 --> 00:50:02,457
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.

991
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,461
Oh, Mary.

992
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:11,591
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

993
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,427
Mary...

994
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,554
Here they come! Here they come!

995
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:43,998
Goodbye, George!

996
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:48,670
Goodbye!

997
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:58,638
First Harry, now George.

998
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:00,932
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

999
00:51:01,015 --> 00:51:03,142
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

1000
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,190
If either of you two
see a stranger around here, it's me.

1001
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,820
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.

1002
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:15,738
Bert the cop sent this over.

1003
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,199
He said to float away
to Happyland on the bubbles.

1004
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,451
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

1005
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,746
By the way, where are you two going
on this here now honeymoon?

1006
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,957
Where are we going? Look at this.

1007
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,418
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

1008
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,587
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

1009
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,047
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.

1010
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,383
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

1011
00:51:35,466 --> 00:51:37,927
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

1012
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:42,515
the richest caviar, the hottest music
and the prettiest wife.

1013
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,851
That does it! Then what?

1014
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:47,937
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

1015
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,398
That does it, come here. Come here.

1016
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,111
Don't look now,
but there's something funny

1017
00:51:55,194 --> 00:51:57,405
going on over there
at the bank, George.

1018
00:51:57,488 --> 00:51:58,615
I've never really seen one,

1019
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,534
but that's got all the earmarks
of being a run.

1020
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:12,045
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

1021
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,880
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

1022
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:15,465
Just a minute, dear.

1023
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:22,055
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

1024
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,115
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

1025
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,035
Charlie? What's the matter here,
can't you get in?

1026
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,096
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

1027
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:05,056
George.

1028
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,769
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.

1029
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:11,270
Look out, you.

1030
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,066
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

1031
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:17,360
There are a lot of seats over there.

1032
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,238
Just make yourselves at home.

1033
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,242
George, can I see you a minute?

1034
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,078
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

1035
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:28,746
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.

1036
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,373
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?

1037
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:31,457
How does a thing like this ever start?

1038
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,542
All I know is
the bank called our loan.

1039
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:33,835
- When?
- About an hour ago.

1040
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:35,962
- I handed over all our cash.
- All of it?

1041
00:53:36,045 --> 00:53:37,630
Every cent of it, and still it was
less than we owe them.

1042
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,507
Holy mackerel!

1043
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,718
And then I got scared, George,
and closed the doors.

1044
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,469
I... I...

1045
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,265
The whole town's gone crazy.

1046
00:53:47,348 --> 00:53:48,683
Yeah, hello?

1047
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,893
George, it's Potter.

1048
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,523
Hello?

1049
00:53:55,606 --> 00:53:59,944
George, there is a rumor around town
that you've closed your doors.

1050
00:54:00,027 --> 00:54:01,529
Is that true?

1051
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,115
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

1052
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:07,577
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?

1053
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,036
Police? What for?

1054
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:13,082
Well, mobs get pretty ugly
sometimes, you know.

1055
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:17,879
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

1056
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:23,134
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

1057
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,554
They'll close up for a week
and then reopen.

1058
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,515
He just took over the bank.

1059
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,392
I may lose a fortune,

1060
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:35,313
but I'm willing
to guarantee your people, too.

1061
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:37,899
Just tell them
to bring their shares over here,

1062
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:40,568
and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

1063
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:42,779
You never miss a trick,
do you, Potter?

1064
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,030
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

1065
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,907
If you close your doors
before 6:00 p.m.,

1066
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,825
you will never reopen.

1067
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,085
George, was it a nice wedding?

1068
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,171
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

1069
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,631
Yeah.

1070
00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:05,426
You can take this one off now.

1071
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:19,649
Now, just remember that this thing
isn't as black as it appeared.

1072
00:55:29,408 --> 00:55:31,244
I have some news for you, folks.

1073
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,745
I was just talking to old man Potter,

1074
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,455
and he's guaranteed cash payments
at the bank.

1075
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,082
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

1076
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:38,084
But, George, I got my money here.

1077
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,752
Did he guarantee this place?

1078
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,546
Well, no, Charlie.
I didn't even ask him.

1079
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,880
We don't need Potter over here.

1080
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,632
Then, I'll take mine now.

1081
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,676
No, but you're...

1082
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:49,554
You're thinking of this place
all wrong,

1083
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:53,266
as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.

1084
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,893
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.

1085
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,229
And in the Kennedy house
and Mrs. Macklin's house

1086
00:55:58,312 --> 00:55:59,814
and 100 others.

1087
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:01,482
Why, you're lending them
the money to build,

1088
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,609
and then, they're gonna pay it back
to you as best they can.

1089
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,361
Now, what are you gonna do,
foreclose on them?

1090
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:11,492
I got $242 in here,
and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

1091
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:14,954
Okay, Tom. All right.

1092
00:56:15,162 --> 00:56:17,748
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.

1093
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,000
Sixty days?

1094
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,127
Now, that's what you agreed to
when you bought your shares.

1095
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,337
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.

1096
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,422
Well, I did.

1097
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:25,715
Old man Potter'll pay
50 cents on the dollar

1098
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:27,174
for every share you've got.

1099
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,844
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

1100
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:31,512
Well, what do you say?

1101
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,223
Now, Tom, you have to stick
to your original agreement.

1102
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,641
Now, give us 60 days on this.

1103
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,768
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?

1104
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,979
Better to get half than nothing.

1105
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:42,148
Tom! Tom!

1106
00:56:42,523 --> 00:56:44,358
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

1107
00:56:44,775 --> 00:56:48,571
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.

1108
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:50,740
If Potter gets a hold
of this Building and Loan,

1109
00:56:50,823 --> 00:56:52,783
there'll never be another decent house
built in this town.

1110
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,368
He's already got charge of the bank.

1111
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,495
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.

1112
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,290
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.

1113
00:56:59,373 --> 00:57:01,626
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

1114
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,836
And because he wants
to keep you living in his slums

1115
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,796
and paying the kind of rent
he decides.

1116
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,840
Joe, you had one
of those Potter houses, didn't you?

1117
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:08,925
Well, have you forgotten?

1118
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,385
Have you forgotten what he charged you
for that broken-down shack?

1119
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,597
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last
year when things weren't going so well

1120
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,848
and you couldn't make your payments.

1121
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,391
Well, you didn't lose your house,
did you?

1122
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,226
You think Potter would've
let you keep it?

1123
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,979
Can't you understand
what's happening here?

1124
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,648
Don't you see what's happening?

1125
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,484
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?

1126
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:28,736
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.

1127
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:30,029
He's picking up some bargain.

1128
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:32,490
Now we can get through
this thing all right.

1129
00:57:32,573 --> 00:57:34,367
We've got to stick together, though.

1130
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,952
We've got to have faith in each other.

1131
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,246
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year, and I need money.

1132
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,040
How am going to live
until the bank opens?

1133
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:43,459
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.

1134
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:45,461
I can't feed my kids on faith.

1135
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:47,213
How much do you need?

1136
00:57:47,296 --> 00:57:50,758
Hey! I got $2,000.

1137
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:53,886
Here's $2,000. This'll tide us over
till the bank reopens.

1138
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,764
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
- $242.

1139
00:57:56,847 --> 00:57:59,350
Tom, just enough to tide you over
until the bank reopens.

1140
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:01,644
I'll take $242.

1141
00:58:04,438 --> 00:58:06,190
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1142
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:08,609
Your account's still here.
That's a loan.

1143
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:12,029
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.

1144
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:15,700
Now, Ed, what'll it take
till the bank opens? What do you need?

1145
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,160
Well, I suppose $20.

1146
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,038
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

1147
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,748
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

1148
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,125
But it's your own money, George.

1149
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:25,876
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?

1150
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,045
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.

1151
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,297
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.

1152
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,508
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.

1153
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:35,970
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.507?

1154
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:41,225
Bless your heart. Of course
you can have it. You got 50 cents?

1155
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:42,685
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.

1156
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:44,270
- ...SIX...
- They'll never close us up today!

1157
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:48,858
...five, four, three, two,

1158
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,068
one, bingo!

1159
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,820
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.

1160
00:58:52,903 --> 00:58:55,823
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.

1161
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:57,742
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!

1162
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,243
Get some glasses, Tilly.

1163
00:58:59,326 --> 00:59:02,580
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.

1164
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:05,166
Get a tray for these two
great big important simoleons here.

1165
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:06,792
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1166
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,337
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar
and to Papa Dollar,

1167
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,548
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

1168
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:14,091
you better have a family real quick.

1169
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:17,011
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.

1170
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:20,181
Okay, let's put them in the safe
and see what happens.

1171
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,773
Close the door.

1172
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,775
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

1173
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:34,278
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.

1174
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:36,989
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

1175
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,241
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.

1176
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,702
I wonder if Ernie's still here
with his taxicab.

1177
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,205
George, there's a call for you.

1178
00:59:44,288 --> 00:59:45,623
Look, will you get my wife
on the phone?

1179
00:59:45,706 --> 00:59:47,083
She's probably over at her mother's.

1180
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,709
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

1181
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,795
I don't want Mrs. Bailey.
I want my wife.

1182
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:54,465
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.

1183
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,885
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.

1184
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:02,056
Huh? Come home? What home?

1185
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,560
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?

1186
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:09,563
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1187
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:23,202
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

1188
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:25,287
How would you like
to get a ticket next week?

1189
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,664
You got any romance in you?

1190
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:29,333
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.

1191
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:31,961
Who wants to see liver pills
on their honeymoon?

1192
01:00:32,044 --> 01:00:34,463
What we want is romantic places,
beautiful places,

1193
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,382
places George wants to go.

1194
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:39,468
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

1195
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,803
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.

1196
01:00:40,886 --> 01:00:42,763
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1197
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,723
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

1198
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,350
What are they, ducks?

1199
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,397
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1200
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,316
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1201
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:06,036
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

1202
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:33,958
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1203
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,506
Well, I'll be...

1204
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:48,389
Mary. Mary, where did you...

1205
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,161
Oh, Mary.

1206
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,084
Remember the night we broke
some windows in this old house?

1207
01:03:18,502 --> 01:03:20,546
This is what I wished for.

1208
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,468
You're wonderful.

1209
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,390
You're wonderful.

1210
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:54,455
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1211
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,208
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1212
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,960
I own the house.

1213
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:03,547
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

1214
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:06,967
No more we live like a pigs
in this Potter's Field.

1215
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:10,179
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.

1216
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:12,639
This is like a dream.

1217
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,809
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

1218
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,812
All right, kids, here.
Here, get in here.

1219
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,065
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.

1220
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:23,776
Sit down, there.

1221
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:26,278
Here, now, get the dog, now.
That's it.

1222
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,698
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!

1223
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,325
All in!

1224
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,454
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1225
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:39,249
All in?

1226
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,687
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1227
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,732
Good old George,
he's always making a speech.

1228
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,110
Hee-haw!

1229
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:09,947
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.

1230
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:13,659
Bread. That this house
may never know hunger.

1231
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,746
Salt. That life
may always have flavor.

1232
01:05:18,163 --> 01:05:21,625
And wine. That joy and prosperity
may reign forever.

1233
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,460
Enter the Martini castle.

1234
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:27,756
Look, Mr. Potter,
it's no skin off my nose.

1235
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,633
I'm just your little rent collector.

1236
01:05:29,716 --> 01:05:32,553
But you can't laugh off
this Bailey Park anymore.

1237
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:33,762
Look at it.

1238
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:36,640
Congressman Blatz is here
to see you, sir.

1239
01:05:36,723 --> 01:05:39,726
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.

1240
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,604
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen
houses stuck here and there.

1241
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,940
There's the old cemetery, squirrels,
buttercups, daisies.

1242
01:05:45,023 --> 01:05:47,234
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1243
01:05:48,068 --> 01:05:49,403
Look at it today.

1244
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,406
Dozens of the prettiest little homes
you ever saw,

1245
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,784
90% owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you.

1246
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:59,163
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1247
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:02,708
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1248
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,543
Oh, they are, are they?

1249
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:07,546
Even though they know the Baileys
never made a dime out of it.

1250
01:06:07,629 --> 01:06:10,132
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.

1251
01:06:10,215 --> 01:06:12,176
Every one of these homes is worth

1252
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,344
twice what it cost
the Building and Loan to build.

1253
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,889
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.

1254
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:20,476
As I say, it's no skin off my nose,

1255
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,522
but one of these days
this bright young man

1256
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,275
is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.

1257
01:06:30,652 --> 01:06:33,780
The Bailey family has been
a boil on my neck long enough.

1258
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,949
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1259
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:38,494
We just stopped in town
to take a look at the new factory,

1260
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,537
and then we're gonna
drive on down to Florida.

1261
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,289
Why don't you
have your friends join us?

1262
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:45,792
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

1263
01:06:46,126 --> 01:06:48,921
Oh, I'm afraid
I couldn't get away, Sam.

1264
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:51,048
Still got the nose
to the old grindstone, eh?

1265
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:54,718
Jane, I offered to let George in
on the ground floor in plastics,

1266
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:56,011
and he turned me down cold.

1267
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:58,889
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1268
01:06:58,972 --> 01:07:00,557
Well, I guess we better run along.

1269
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,726
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1270
01:07:02,809 --> 01:07:04,186
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.

1271
01:07:04,269 --> 01:07:05,729
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.

1272
01:07:05,812 --> 01:07:07,898
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.

1273
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:09,983
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!

1274
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,777
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.

1275
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:42,349
Thank you, sir.

1276
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,935
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?

1277
01:07:45,018 --> 01:07:46,562
I'll send you a box.

1278
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,697
Well, I...

1279
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,741
I suppose
I'll find out sooner or later,

1280
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,703
but just what exactly
did you want to see me about?

1281
01:08:04,788 --> 01:08:08,375
George, now that's just what I like
SO much about you.

1282
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:12,546
George, I am an old man,
and most people hate me.

1283
01:08:12,629 --> 01:08:15,632
But I don't like them, either,
so that makes it all even.

1284
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,884
You know just as well as I do

1285
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,470
that I run practically everything
in this town

1286
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:23,181
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1287
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,726
You know, also,
that for a number of years

1288
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:27,728
I've been trying to get control of it.

1289
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:30,439
Or kill it.
But I haven't been able to do it.

1290
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:32,608
You have been stopping me.

1291
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,862
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1292
01:08:36,945 --> 01:08:41,408
and as anyone in this county
can tell you, that takes some doing.

1293
01:08:42,534 --> 01:08:45,245
Take during the Depression,
for instance.

1294
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:48,415
You and I were the only ones
that kept our heads.

1295
01:08:48,498 --> 01:08:52,461
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.

1296
01:08:52,544 --> 01:08:55,172
Yes. Well, most people say
you stole all the rest.

1297
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:58,592
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.

1298
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:03,597
Now, I have stated
my side very frankly.

1299
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:06,099
Now let's look at your side.

1300
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:13,940
Young man, 27-28, married,
making, say, $40 a week.

1301
01:09:14,107 --> 01:09:16,026
- $45.
- $45.

1302
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:17,235
$45.

1303
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:21,490
Out of which, after supporting
your mother and paying your bills,

1304
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:24,660
you're able to keep, say, $10,
if you skimp.

1305
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:29,081
A child or two comes along, and you
won't even be able to save the $10.

1306
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:34,711
Now, if this young man of 28
was a common, ordinary yokel,

1307
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,380
I'd say he was doing fine.

1308
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:40,717
But George Bailey is not a common,
ordinary yokel.

1309
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:44,513
He is an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man,

1310
01:09:44,596 --> 01:09:47,808
who hates his job,
who hates the Building and Loan

1311
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:49,309
almost as much as I do.

1312
01:09:50,268 --> 01:09:54,856
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

1313
01:09:55,273 --> 01:09:58,068
A young man... The smartest one
of the crowd, mind you.

1314
01:09:58,151 --> 01:09:59,778
A young man who has to sit by

1315
01:09:59,861 --> 01:10:03,323
and watch his friends go places
because he's trapped.

1316
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:07,077
Yes, sir,
trapped into frittering his life away,

1317
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,746
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters.

1318
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:14,501
Do I paint a correct picture,
or do I exaggerate?

1319
01:10:17,003 --> 01:10:19,548
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?

1320
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:22,217
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1321
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,554
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs,
run my properties.

1322
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:30,892
George, I'll start you out
at $20,000 a year.

1323
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,691
$20,000 a year?

1324
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:41,153
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1325
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:43,947
buying your wife
a lot of fine clothes,

1326
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,783
a couple of business trips
to New York a year,

1327
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:48,744
maybe once in a while Europe.

1328
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,120
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, George?

1329
01:10:50,203 --> 01:10:51,580
Would 1?

1330
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,918
You're not talking to somebody else
around here, are you?

1331
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,712
You know, this is me.
You remember me?

1332
01:10:58,795 --> 01:11:00,589
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.

1333
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:03,717
Yeah, George Bailey,
whose ship has just come in.

1334
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:08,263
Provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard.

1335
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:18,023
Holy mackerel.

1336
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:23,653
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1337
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:27,157
Oh, confound it, man,
are you afraid of success?

1338
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,785
I'm offering you
a three-years contract

1339
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:32,162
at $20,000 a year, starting today.

1340
01:11:32,245 --> 01:11:33,997
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1341
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,292
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1342
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:41,296
I know I ought to jump
at the chance but I... I just...

1343
01:11:42,422 --> 01:11:44,591
I wonder if it would be possible

1344
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:46,468
for you to give me 24 hours
to think it over?

1345
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:48,220
Sure, sure, sure.

1346
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:50,847
You go on home
and talk about it to your wife.

1347
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:52,516
I'd like to do that.

1348
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,935
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.

1349
01:11:55,018 --> 01:11:56,937
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1350
01:11:58,438 --> 01:11:59,940
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1351
01:12:08,114 --> 01:12:12,452
No. No. No, no,
now wait a minute, here.

1352
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:16,164
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.

1353
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:17,916
I know right now,
and the answer is no.

1354
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:19,835
No, doggone it!

1355
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,546
You sit around here,
and you spin your little webs,

1356
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:25,090
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

1357
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:26,716
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1358
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,011
In the whole vast
configuration of things,

1359
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,889
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1360
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:33,974
You...

1361
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:37,561
And that goes for you, too!

1362
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:43,733
And it goes for you, too!

1363
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,743
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1364
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,788
buying your wife
a lot of fine clothes,

1365
01:12:56,997 --> 01:13:00,542
going to New York on a business trip
a couple of times a year,

1366
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:02,836
maybe Europe once in a while.

1367
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:05,922
! know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

1368
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:09,259
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

1369
01:13:09,342 --> 01:13:12,470
I'm shaking the dust of this
crummy little town off my feet,

1370
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,389
and I'm gonna see the world.

1371
01:13:14,472 --> 01:13:17,225
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.

1372
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,895
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

1373
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,105
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.

1374
01:13:23,648 --> 01:13:26,818
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?

1375
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,821
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1376
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,656
and pull her down for you.

1377
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:34,367
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?

1378
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:37,329
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?

1379
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:40,373
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight

1380
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,167
And

1381
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,550
- Hi.
- Hi.

1382
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,307
Mary Hatch,

1383
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:02,604
why in the world
did you ever marry a guy like me?

1384
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:06,232
To keep from being an old maid.

1385
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,151
You could have married Sam Wainwright

1386
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:09,986
and anybody else in town.

1387
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:13,073
I didn't want
to marry anybody else in town.

1388
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:16,117
I want my baby to look like you.

1389
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:18,286
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1390
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,746
I promised you...

1391
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,874
- Your what?
- My baby.

1392
01:14:25,585 --> 01:14:27,128
Your... Your...

1393
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:29,714
Mary, you on the nest?

1394
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:33,885
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!

1395
01:14:37,889 --> 01:14:41,810
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?

1396
01:14:45,438 --> 01:14:47,440
Now, you've probably already guessed

1397
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:49,943
that George
never leaves Bedford Falls.

1398
01:14:50,026 --> 01:14:53,780
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.

1399
01:14:54,447 --> 01:14:56,574
Then she had another one, a girl.

1400
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,868
Day after day she worked away,

1401
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:01,871
remaking the old Granville house
into a home.

1402
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,625
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.

1403
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,631
Potter was bearing down hard.

1404
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,471
Then came a war.

1405
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:22,851

1406

but still found time to run the USO.

1407
01:15:27,647 --> 01:15:31,192
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

1408
01:15:31,484 --> 01:15:33,903
Potter became head of the draft board.

1409
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,655
One-A.

1410
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,074
One-A.

1411
01:15:40,952 --> 01:15:42,078
One-A.

1412
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,873
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1413
01:15:45,248 --> 01:15:49,335
Bert the cop was wounded
in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1414
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:53,173
Ernie the taxi driver
parachuted into France.

1415
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:56,676
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1416
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,136
Harry...

1417
01:15:58,219 --> 01:16:00,513
Harry Bailey topped them all.

1418
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:04,559
A Navy flyer, he shot down 15 planes,

1419
01:16:04,642 --> 01:16:06,394
two of them
as they were about to crash

1420
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,980
into a transport full of soldiers.

1421
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:12,984
- Yes, but George.
- George?

1422
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,153
Four-F on account of his ear,

1423
01:16:15,236 --> 01:16:17,697
George fought the battle
of Bedford Falls.

1424
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,575
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

1425
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:22,202

Like everybody else on VE Day,
he wept and prayed.

1431
01:16:43,014 --> 01:16:47,477
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

1432
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,771
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

1433
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:50,855
Yes, sir.

1434
01:16:51,564 --> 01:16:54,692

1436
01:16:56,402 --> 01:16:58,738
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

1437
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,245
It's gonna snow again.

1438
01:17:05,328 --> 01:17:07,497
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines.

1439
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,623
The President...

1440
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:11,167
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.

1441
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,752
Commander Harry Bailey!

1442
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:15,338
Mr. Gower, look at this,
the second page.

1443
01:17:15,421 --> 01:17:16,673
Now, look, this is for you.

1444
01:17:16,756 --> 01:17:18,216
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.

1445
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:20,093
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.

1446
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,930
Be sure you spell the name right.

1447
01:17:35,066 --> 01:17:36,568
Extra! Read all about it!

1448
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:39,112
George, George! It's Harry now
on long-distance from Washington.

1449
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:40,697
Harry! What do you know about that!

1450
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,323
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?

1451
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:44,701
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.

1452
01:17:44,784 --> 01:17:45,910
Harry!

1453
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:50,331
You old seven times
a son of a gun. Congratulations.

1454
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:53,001
How's Mother standing it? She did?

1455
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:54,586
What do you know?

1456
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:56,379
Mother had lunch
with the President's wife.

1457
01:17:56,462 --> 01:17:57,547
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1458
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,757
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?

1459
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:00,884
Harry,

1460
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:04,053
you should see what they're cooking up
in the town for you.

1461
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:05,221
Oh, they are?

1462
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,223
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home
this afternoon.

1463
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:08,433
In a plane?

1464
01:18:08,808 --> 01:18:10,935
What? Uncle Billy?

1465
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,396
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.

1466
01:18:13,479 --> 01:18:16,900
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.

1467
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,067
- George. George, George.
- What?

1468
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,235
- That man is here again.
- What man?

1469
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,945
Bank examiner.

1470
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,157
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute,
will you?

1471
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,408
I'll be right back.

1472
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:26,993
- Well...
- Harry.

1473
01:18:27,076 --> 01:18:29,579
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.

1474
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:31,789
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1475
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,625
We're all excited around here.

1476
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,752
My brother just got
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1477
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:38,630
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.

1478
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:41,549
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?

1479
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:44,844
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1480
01:18:45,094 --> 01:18:46,763
Yeah, very funny.

1481
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:51,726
Well, now,
come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1482
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:54,062
Although I shouldn't wonder
when you okay reverse charges

1483
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:55,897
on personal long-distance calls.

1484
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,565
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.

1485
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,275
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.

1486
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:02,153
Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd like to
finish with you by tonight.

1487
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:05,114
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1488
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:06,449
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1489
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:07,825
Just step right in here.
We'll fix you up.

1490
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:11,913
December 24.

1491
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:20,088
$8,000.

1492
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:23,800
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.

1493
01:19:23,883 --> 01:19:27,303
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?

1494
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:30,890
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey
wins Congressional Medal."

1495
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:33,309
That couldn't be
one of the Bailey boys.

1496
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:35,603
You just can't keep
those Baileys down,

1497
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:36,980
now can you, Mr. Potter?

1498
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:39,482
How does slacker George
feel about that?

1499
01:19:39,565 --> 01:19:40,817
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1500
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,111
He only lost
three buttons off his vest.

1501
01:19:43,194 --> 01:19:45,238
Of course,
slacker George would've gotten

1502
01:19:45,321 --> 01:19:47,198
two of these medals if he had gone.

1503
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,825
- Bad ear.
- Yes.

1504
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:52,453
After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

1505
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:56,582
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

1506
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:07,593
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1507
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:11,347
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1508
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,308
- You forgot something.
- What?

1509
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:14,892
Well, aren't you going
to make a deposit?

1510
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:15,977
Oh, sure, sure I am.

1511
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:19,439
Well, then, it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

1512
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:24,235
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1513
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,156
How about that finger there?

1514
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:29,324
Well, I...

1515
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:31,409
Bailey.

1516
01:20:37,915 --> 01:20:40,293
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1517
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,630
Come on, look sharp.

1518
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:03,858
Take me back.

1519
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:15,119
Just make yourself at home,
Mr. Carter.

1520
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:17,038
I got those books for you here.

1521
01:21:17,121 --> 01:21:18,539
Oh, hello, Vi.

1522
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:20,208
George, can I see you for a second?

1523
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:23,169
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.

1524
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:26,172
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

1525
01:21:26,964 --> 01:21:29,759
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

1526
01:21:29,842 --> 01:21:30,927
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1527
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:32,762
You know, your nephew,
remember? Harry.

1528
01:21:32,845 --> 01:21:34,138
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.

1529
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:38,393
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

1530
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:41,104
I ought to have my head examined.

1531
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:44,065
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.

1532
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:51,489
Here you are.

1533
01:21:52,031 --> 01:21:53,157
Character?

1534
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,076
If I had any character, I'd...

1535
01:21:55,159 --> 01:21:57,036
It takes a lot of character
to leave your hometown

1536
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,579
and start all over again.

1537
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:00,123
No, George, don't.

1538
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:02,250
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

1539
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:03,960
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do,

1540
01:22:04,043 --> 01:22:05,837
hock your furs and that hat?

1541
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:08,673
You want to walk to New York?

1542
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:10,550
You know, they charge
for meals and rent up there,

1543
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:12,051
just the same as they do
in Bedford Falls.

1544
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:13,928
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.

1545
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,514
That's my business, Building and Loan.

1546
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:19,725
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.

1547
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:21,978
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1548
01:22:27,191 --> 01:22:29,944
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.

1549
01:22:30,027 --> 01:22:31,904
Now, let's hear from you
once in a while.

1550
01:22:35,908 --> 01:22:39,203
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1551
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:42,582
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.

1552
01:22:42,665 --> 01:22:44,167
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?

1553
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,751
Yeah, he's in his office.

1554
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:48,045
What's going on?

1555
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:50,256
The bank examiner's here.

1556
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:51,799
He's here?

1557
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,968
Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

1558
01:22:54,093 --> 01:22:55,678
What's the matter with you?

1559
01:22:55,761 --> 01:22:57,180
Come here.

1560
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:18,409
Eustace.

1561
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,244
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.

1562
01:23:21,954 --> 01:23:24,248
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1563
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,792
He had it on his desk counting it
before he closed up.

1564
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,545
Now, look, did you buy anything?

1565
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:31,964
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1566
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,675
Now, we'll go over every step you took
since you left the house.

1567
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:35,760
- Right. This way.
- Come on.

1568
01:23:45,686 --> 01:23:47,688
And did you put the envelope
in your pocket?

1569
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:50,900
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1570
01:23:50,983 --> 01:23:53,778
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!

1571
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:55,404
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look,

1572
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:58,074
do you realize what's going
to happen if we don't find it?

1573
01:23:58,157 --> 01:23:59,200
Listen to me.

1574
01:23:59,283 --> 01:24:01,077
Do you have any secret hiding place
here in the house?

1575
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,204
Some place you would have...
Some place you hide the money?

1576
01:24:03,287 --> 01:24:04,914
I've gone over the whole house,

1577
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:08,918
even in rooms that have been locked
since I lost Laura.

1578
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:12,088
Listen to me, listen to me!
Think, think!

1579
01:24:12,171 --> 01:24:16,300
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.

1580
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,262
Where's that money,
you silly, stupid old fool?

1581
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:22,098
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?

1582
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:25,184
It means bankruptcy and scandal
and prison!

1583
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:27,645
That's what it means.

1584
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:30,982
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.

1585
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:54,839
Hello, darling.

1586
01:24:54,922 --> 01:24:56,716
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.

1587
01:24:56,799 --> 01:24:58,634
How do you like it?

1588
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:00,428
- Bless you!
- Bless you!

1589
01:25:02,179 --> 01:25:03,347
Did you bring the wreath?

1590
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,266
Yes, Daddy, did you bring
the Christmas wreath?

1591
01:25:05,349 --> 01:25:06,350
What wreath?

1592
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,894
The Merry Christmas wreath
for the window.

1593
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,313
No. I left it at the office.

1594
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,356
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.

1595
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,526
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1596
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:16,777
What's the matter?

1597
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:19,405
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.

1598
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:30,416
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.

1599
01:25:30,499 --> 01:25:33,502
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

1600
01:25:34,086 --> 01:25:37,923
All right, fill in that little
bare spot right there. Right there.

1601
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:43,638
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.

1602
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:47,475
Bet I had 50 calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

1603
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,727
Your mother's so excited. She...

1604
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,833
Must she keep playing that?

1605
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,711
I have to practice it
for the party tonight, Daddy.

1606
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:17,213
Mama said
we could stay up till midnight

1607
01:26:17,296 --> 01:26:18,881
and sing Christmas carols.

1608
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:20,466
Can you sing, Daddy?

1609
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:22,468
Better hurry and shave.

1610
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:25,513
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.

1611
01:26:25,596 --> 01:26:28,057
I don't want the families over here.

1612
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:32,895
Come on out in the kitchen with me
while I finish dinner.

1613
01:26:32,978 --> 01:26:36,065
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1614
01:26:36,148 --> 01:26:38,317
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.

1615
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,320
Another big red-letter day
for the Baileys.

1616
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:44,615
Daddy, the Browns next door
have a new car. You should see it.

1617
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,909
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?

1618
01:26:46,992 --> 01:26:48,119
Yes, Daddy.

1619
01:26:48,327 --> 01:26:50,788
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1620
01:26:50,871 --> 01:26:53,124
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.

1621
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,584
All right, darling, you're excused.

1622
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:58,462
Now, go on upstairs
and see if little Zulu wants anything.

1623
01:26:59,004 --> 01:27:01,090
Zulu? What's the matter with Zulu?

1624
01:27:01,173 --> 01:27:03,300
Oh, she's just got a cold.
She's in bed.

1625
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,844
Caught it coming home from school.

1626
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:07,471
They gave her a flower for a prize,
and she didn't want to crush it,

1627
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,764
so she didn't button up her coat.

1628
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:11,058
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.

1629
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,435
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1630
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:14,270
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1631
01:27:14,353 --> 01:27:15,354
He says it's nothing to worry about.

1632
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:16,439
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?

1633
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:19,108
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.

1634
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:20,693
Of course, it's this old house.

1635
01:27:20,776 --> 01:27:22,987
I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

1636
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:27,366
Drafty old barn. Might as well
be living in a refrigerator.

1637
01:27:27,616 --> 01:27:29,368
Why did we have
to live here in the first place

1638
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:32,580
and stay around this measly,
crummy old town?

1639
01:27:33,372 --> 01:27:35,958
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.

1640
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:39,295
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?

1641
01:27:39,378 --> 01:27:43,090
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.

1642
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:44,925
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zulu.

1643
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:47,386
He told me to write
a play for tomorrow.

1644
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:02,026
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1645
01:28:02,234 --> 01:28:03,569
Hi, Daddy!

1646
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:07,907
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1647
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,075
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?

1648
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,827
I want to give my flower a drink.

1649
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:14,121
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.

1650
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:15,498
I'll give it a drink.

1651
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:16,916
Now, here.

1652
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:20,544
Look, Daddy!

1653
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:22,046
Paste it!

1654
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,673
Yeah, all right, all right.
Give it here.

1655
01:28:27,092 --> 01:28:29,678
Now, we'll paste this together here.

1656
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:36,018
There. There it is. Good as new.

1657
01:28:36,101 --> 01:28:38,229
Now, give the flower a drink.

1658
01:28:38,312 --> 01:28:39,772
Now, will you do something for me?

1659
01:28:39,855 --> 01:28:42,608
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?

1660
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:45,694
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.

1661
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:48,364
I know, I know,
but you just go to sleep

1662
01:28:48,447 --> 01:28:50,241
and then you can dream about it,

1663
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:52,701
and it'll be a whole garden.

1664
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:54,036
It will?

1665
01:29:02,461 --> 01:29:04,213
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

1666
01:29:04,296 --> 01:29:05,756
I'll get it.

1667
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:08,843
Hello?

1668
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,804
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1669
01:29:12,137 --> 01:29:15,057
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1670
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,725
The doctor said
that she ought to be out of bed

1671
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:18,060
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1672
01:29:18,143 --> 01:29:19,687
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1673
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,105
Let me speak to her.

1674
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:23,649
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1675
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:26,485
This is George Bailey.
I'm Zuzu's father.

1676
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:28,279
Say, what kind of a teacher
are you, anyway?

1677
01:29:28,362 --> 01:29:30,656
What do you mean sending her
home like that, half naked?

1678
01:29:30,739 --> 01:29:32,366
Do you realize she'll probably end up
with pneumonia on account of you?

1679
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:33,492
George!

1680
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:35,327
Is this the sort of thing
we pay taxes for

1681
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:37,538
to have teachers like you?

1682
01:29:37,621 --> 01:29:38,998
Stupid, silly, careless people

1683
01:29:39,081 --> 01:29:40,875
who send our kids home
without any clothes on?

1684
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:42,793
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids.

1685
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,587
And maybe they don't have
any decent clothes...

1686
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:46,505
That stupid...

1687
01:29:47,214 --> 01:29:50,092
Hello, Mrs. Welch.
I want to apologize...

1688
01:29:50,175 --> 01:29:52,344
Hello? Hello.

1689
01:29:54,096 --> 01:29:56,515
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!

1690
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:59,768
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?

1691
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:01,687
Hello! Who's this?

1692
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:03,314
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1693
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:05,149
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1694
01:30:05,232 --> 01:30:07,276
Give me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

1695
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:08,444
George, stop it.

1696
01:30:08,527 --> 01:30:10,237
Will you get out
and let me handle this?

1697
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,865
Hello? Hello? What?

1698
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,118
Oh, you will, huh?

1699
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:19,121
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough, you...

1700
01:30:19,204 --> 01:30:20,748
Hello! Any...

1701
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,045
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

1702
01:30:26,128 --> 01:30:28,005
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?

1703
01:30:28,088 --> 01:30:29,340
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1704
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:31,300
Janie, haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

1705
01:30:31,383 --> 01:30:34,386
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!

1706
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:03,415
I'm sorry, Mary.

1707
01:31:07,086 --> 01:31:09,004
Janie, I'm sorry.

1708
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:13,509
I didn't mean that. ll...
You go on and practice.

1709
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:21,767
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1710
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:24,395
I'm sorry.

1711
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:28,649
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.

1712
01:31:35,614 --> 01:31:37,366
What's the matter with everybody?

1713
01:31:37,449 --> 01:31:40,035
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!

1714
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,453
Oh, Daddy!

1715
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:49,586
George, why must you
torture the children? Why don't you...

1716
01:31:51,046 --> 01:31:52,297
Mary...

1717
01:32:06,353 --> 01:32:08,272
Bedford 247, please.

1718
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:10,399
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1719
01:32:10,482 --> 01:32:13,569
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1720
01:32:13,652 --> 01:32:15,654
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1721
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,657
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1722
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:20,284
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1723
01:32:21,535 --> 01:32:22,953
I need help.

1724
01:32:23,996 --> 01:32:26,915
Through some sort of an accident,
my company's short in their accounts.

1725
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:28,792
The bank examiner got there today.

1726
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,086
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

1727
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:33,672
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted
to talk to you about?

1728
01:32:33,756 --> 01:32:35,090
- The reporters?
- Yes.

1729
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:38,552
They called me up
from your Building and Loan.

1730
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:42,222
<i>Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.</i>

1731
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:43,515
He's looking for you.

1732
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:47,227
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?

1733
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:49,146
Can't you see what it means
to my family?

1734
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:52,066
I'll pay any sort of a bonus
on the loan, any interest,

1735
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:53,734
if you still want
the Building and Loan...

1736
01:32:53,817 --> 01:32:57,321
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1737
01:32:57,404 --> 01:32:58,947
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.

1738
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:02,034
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.

1739
01:33:02,117 --> 01:33:05,829
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.

1740
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:12,795
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

1741
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:16,965
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.

1742
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:19,301
What've you been doing, George?

1743
01:33:19,384 --> 01:33:21,136
Playing the market
with the company's money?

1744
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,346
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.

1745
01:33:22,429 --> 01:33:24,431
Is it a woman, then?

1746
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:25,766
You know, it's all over town

1747
01:33:25,849 --> 01:33:28,102
that you've been giving money
to Violet Bick.

1748
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:29,228
What?

1749
01:33:29,311 --> 01:33:30,729
Not that it makes
any difference to me,

1750
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:32,022
but why did you come to me?

1751
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:34,817
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

1752
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,527
I can't get a hold of him.
He's in Europe.

1753
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:38,028
Well, what about
all your other friends?

1754
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:40,447
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.

1755
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:42,407
You're the only one in town
that can help me.

1756
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:46,954
I've suddenly become quite important.

1757
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:50,457
What kind of security
would I have, George?

1758
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:53,836
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1759
01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:56,755
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

1760
01:33:57,297 --> 01:34:01,510
I have some life insurance,
a $15,000 policy.

1761
01:34:01,593 --> 01:34:05,264
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.

1762
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,266
Five hundred dollars?

1763
01:34:07,724 --> 01:34:10,352
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

1764
01:34:11,937 --> 01:34:15,023
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

1765
01:34:15,357 --> 01:34:18,443
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

1766
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:23,782
You once called me
a warped, frustrated old man.

1767
01:34:24,449 --> 01:34:27,828
What are you
but a warped, frustrated young man?

1768
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:29,997
A miserable little clerk,

1769
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,748
Crawling in here
on your hands and knees

1770
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,709
and begging for help.

1771
01:34:33,917 --> 01:34:35,836
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

1772
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:39,548
Nothing but a miserable
little $500 equity

1773
01:34:39,631 --> 01:34:41,842
in a life insurance policy.

1774
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:45,095
You're worth more dead than alive.

1775
01:34:45,554 --> 01:34:48,557
Why don't you go to the riffraff
you love so much

1776
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,143
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

1777
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:52,811
You know why?

1778
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:55,189
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

1779
01:34:55,689 --> 01:34:58,901
But I tell you
what I'm going to do for you, George.

1780
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:02,154
Since the state examiner
is still here,

1781
01:35:02,237 --> 01:35:04,781
as a stockholder
of the Building and Loan,

1782
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,826
I'm going to swear out
a warrant for your arrest.

1783
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:12,247
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance.

1784
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:16,251
All right, George, go ahead.

1785
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:19,171
You can't hide
in a little town like this.

1786
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:21,673
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

1787
01:35:35,437 --> 01:35:38,690
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

1788
01:35:39,274 --> 01:35:40,943
How about some of that good spaghetti?

1789
01:35:41,026 --> 01:35:42,694
We got everything.

1790
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,082
Oh, God.

1791
01:35:58,377 --> 01:35:59,670
Oh, God.

1792
01:36:04,716 --> 01:36:06,551
Dear Father in Heaven,

1793
01:36:09,763 --> 01:36:11,723
I'm not a praying man,

1794
01:36:12,891 --> 01:36:15,811
but if you're up there
and you can hear me,

1795
01:36:17,437 --> 01:36:19,064
show me the way.

1796
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:21,858
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1797
01:36:23,735 --> 01:36:25,737
Show me the way, O God.

1798
01:36:30,575 --> 01:36:34,246
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?

1799
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,334
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1800
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:42,796
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

1801
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:45,799
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1802
01:36:46,425 --> 01:36:48,468
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1803
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:55,517
The next time you talk to my wife
like that, you'll get worse!

1804
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,977
She cried for an hour!

1805
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,353
It isn't enough she slaves

1806
01:36:58,437 --> 01:37:00,188
teaching your stupid kids
how to read and write,

1807
01:37:00,272 --> 01:37:02,858
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1808
01:37:02,941 --> 01:37:04,401
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.

1809
01:37:04,484 --> 01:37:06,153
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!

1810
01:37:06,236 --> 01:37:09,197
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!

1811
01:37:14,536 --> 01:37:17,164
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?

1812
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:20,667
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

1813
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:23,545
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.

1814
01:37:23,628 --> 01:37:25,547
That's what I get for praying.

1815
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:27,674
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?

1816
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:28,884
Yes, you bet.

1817
01:37:28,967 --> 01:37:32,387
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.

1818
01:37:32,471 --> 01:37:34,181
Oh, no, please,
don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

1819
01:37:34,264 --> 01:37:35,891
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.

1820
01:37:35,974 --> 01:37:37,392
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.

1821
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:39,561
Please no go away, please!

1822
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,374
What do you think you're doing?

1823
01:38:02,459 --> 01:38:03,794
Now look what you did.

1824
01:38:03,877 --> 01:38:06,338
My great-grandfather
planted this tree!

1825
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:09,216
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1826
01:38:09,966 --> 01:38:13,261
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!

1827
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:25,232
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.

1828
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:13,196
Help!

1829
01:39:14,739 --> 01:39:17,451
Help! Help!

1830
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:22,789
Help! Help!

1831
01:39:25,417 --> 01:39:27,043
Help!

1832
01:39:29,921 --> 01:39:33,884
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1833
01:39:40,056 --> 01:39:42,350
Help! Help!

1834
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:01,578
I didn't have time
to get some stylish underwear.

1835
01:40:01,661 --> 01:40:03,830
Wife gave me this on my last birthday.

1836
01:40:05,123 --> 01:40:06,875
I passed away in it.

1837
01:40:10,462 --> 01:40:12,839
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1838
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:19,971
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

1839
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,516
How did you happen to fall in?

1840
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:25,769
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.

1841
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:28,980
You what? To save me?

1842
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:30,607
Well, I did, didn't ll?

1843
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,275
You didn't go through with it,
did you??

1844
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:34,486
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1845
01:40:34,569 --> 01:40:37,656
It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

1846
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:40,575
Yeah, it's against the law
where I come from, too.

1847
01:40:40,659 --> 01:40:42,994
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1848
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:51,169
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

1849
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:53,672
I knew if I were drowning,
you'd try to save me.

1850
01:40:53,755 --> 01:40:56,675
You see, you did,
and that's how I saved you.

1851
01:40:57,425 --> 01:40:58,843
Very funny.

1852
01:40:59,052 --> 01:41:01,096
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1853
01:41:01,179 --> 01:41:03,557
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw

1854
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,308
in answer to a prayer
a little bit ago.

1855
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:09,229
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.

1856
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:11,648
That's why I was sent down here.

1857
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:15,402
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.

1858
01:41:15,485 --> 01:41:17,279
I've watched you grow up
from a little boy.

1859
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:18,822
What are you,
a mind reader or something?

1860
01:41:18,905 --> 01:41:20,031
No.

1861
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:24,035
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

1862
01:41:24,744 --> 01:41:26,037
Oddbody?

1863
01:41:27,122 --> 01:41:29,165
AS2? What's that, AS2?

1864
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:30,333
Angel Second Class.

1865
01:41:41,636 --> 01:41:43,430
Cheerio, my good man.

1866
01:41:47,559 --> 01:41:49,019
Oh, brother.

1867
01:41:51,313 --> 01:41:52,564
Gee whiz.

1868
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,401
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks.

1869
01:41:58,486 --> 01:42:03,033
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?

1870
01:42:03,325 --> 01:42:04,951
Why'd you want to save me?

1871
01:42:05,035 --> 01:42:08,622
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.

1872
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:11,166
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1873
01:42:11,249 --> 01:42:15,587
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

1874
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:18,715
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?

1875
01:42:18,798 --> 01:42:22,844
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.

1876
01:42:23,845 --> 01:42:26,973
Well, you look about
like the kind of an angel I'd get.

1877
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:30,018
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?

1878
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:34,105
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.

1879
01:42:38,443 --> 01:42:39,986
I don't know
whether I'd like it very much

1880
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:42,030
being seen around
with an angel without any wings.

1881
01:42:42,113 --> 01:42:45,700
Oh, I've got to earn them,
and you'll help me, won't you??

1882
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:47,202
Sure, sure.

1883
01:42:47,702 --> 01:42:50,330
- How?
- By letting me help you.

1884
01:42:50,538 --> 01:42:53,333
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

1885
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:55,377
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?

1886
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,879
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.

1887
01:42:57,962 --> 01:43:00,548
Oh, yeah, that's right,
I keep forgetting.

1888
01:43:01,257 --> 01:43:04,886
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1889
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:08,139
I found it out a little late.

1890
01:43:08,556 --> 01:43:10,600
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1891
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:12,060
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.

1892
01:43:12,143 --> 01:43:14,854
I won't get my wings
with that attitude.

1893
01:43:14,938 --> 01:43:17,190
You just don't know
all that you've done.

1894
01:43:17,273 --> 01:43:18,608
If it hadn't been for you...

1895
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:21,403
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1896
01:43:21,486 --> 01:43:23,697
My wife and my kids and my friends.

1897
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:27,033
I mean, look, little fellow, go off
and haunt somebody else, will you?

1898
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:29,744
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...

1899
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:31,705
Oh, shut up, will you?

1900
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:38,294
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1901
01:43:43,174 --> 01:43:45,385
Yeah, so you still think
killing yourself

1902
01:43:45,468 --> 01:43:47,721
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1903
01:43:49,514 --> 01:43:52,308
Well, I don't know.
I guess you're right.

1904
01:43:53,601 --> 01:43:56,479
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

1905
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:59,482
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1906
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:02,610
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1907
01:44:03,027 --> 01:44:07,657
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.

1908
01:44:08,616 --> 01:44:10,285
What do you think?

1909
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:12,704
Yeah, that'll do it.

1910
01:44:13,371 --> 01:44:14,706
All right.

1911
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:20,628
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.

1912
01:44:26,217 --> 01:44:29,220
You don't have
to make all that fuss about it!

1913
01:44:30,138 --> 01:44:31,556
What did you say?

1914
01:44:31,639 --> 01:44:33,808
You've never been born.
You don't exist.

1915
01:44:33,892 --> 01:44:35,477
You haven't a care in the world.

1916
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,855
No worries, no obligations,
no $8,000 to get,

1917
01:44:38,938 --> 01:44:40,815
no Potter looking for you
with the Sheriff.

1918
01:44:40,899 --> 01:44:44,319
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.

1919
01:44:44,402 --> 01:44:46,571
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1920
01:44:46,654 --> 01:44:49,199
I haven't heard anything
out of that ear since I was a kid.

1921
01:44:49,282 --> 01:44:51,451
Must have been that jump
in that cold water.

1922
01:44:51,534 --> 01:44:54,245
Your lip stopped bleeding, too,
George.

1923
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:02,670
What do you know about that?
What's happening?

1924
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:06,424
It stopped snowing out here,
didn't it?

1925
01:45:06,508 --> 01:45:08,301
What's happened here?

1926
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,929
What I need
is a couple of good stiff drinks.

1927
01:45:11,012 --> 01:45:13,306
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?

1928
01:45:14,766 --> 01:45:17,060
Come on, soon as
these clothes of ours are dry...

1929
01:45:17,143 --> 01:45:19,103
The clothes are dry.

1930
01:45:19,187 --> 01:45:22,357
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1931
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:26,528
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...

1932
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:28,822
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

1933
01:45:28,905 --> 01:45:30,448
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1934
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:32,242
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.

1935
01:45:38,873 --> 01:45:40,208
What's the matter?

1936
01:45:40,291 --> 01:45:43,044
Well, this is where I left my car,
and it isn't here.

1937
01:45:43,127 --> 01:45:44,212
You have no car.

1938
01:45:44,295 --> 01:45:46,422
Well, I had a car,
and it was right here.

1939
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:48,049
I guess somebody moved it.

1940
01:45:48,132 --> 01:45:52,220
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

1941
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:54,556
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1942
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:56,933
I'm the fellow that owns the car
that ran into your tree.

1943
01:45:57,016 --> 01:45:59,060
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?

1944
01:45:59,143 --> 01:46:01,229
This tree. Here, I ran into it.

1945
01:46:01,312 --> 01:46:04,524
Cut a big gash
in the side of it there.

1946
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:12,323
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.

1947
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,617
One of the oldest trees
in Pottersville.

1948
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:15,869
Pottersville?

1949
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:17,579
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1950
01:46:17,662 --> 01:46:21,207
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?

1951
01:46:21,374 --> 01:46:23,459
What's the matter with you?

1952
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:26,754
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...

1953
01:46:29,132 --> 01:46:30,133
Oh, I don't know.

1954
01:46:30,216 --> 01:46:33,219
Either I'm off my nut
or he is or you are.

1955
01:46:34,596 --> 01:46:35,763
It isn't me.

1956
01:46:35,847 --> 01:46:38,099
Well, maybe I left the car
up at Martini's.

1957
01:46:38,182 --> 01:46:40,351
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.

1958
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:42,186
Clarence. Clarence.

1959
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:50,653
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.

1960
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:54,699
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

1961
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:03,458
Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?

1962
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:04,626
Want a martini?

1963
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:06,753
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?

1964
01:47:06,836 --> 01:47:09,255
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?

1965
01:47:09,339 --> 01:47:11,549
Okay, all right. Double bourbon,
will you, and quick, huh?

1966
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:12,884
Okay.

1967
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:19,057
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.

1968
01:47:20,266 --> 01:47:22,685
It's been so long since ll...

1969
01:47:22,769 --> 01:47:26,439
Look, mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

1970
01:47:26,522 --> 01:47:28,149
That's a good man.

1971
01:47:28,232 --> 01:47:30,401
I was just thinking

1972
01:47:31,235 --> 01:47:34,405
of a flaming rum punch.

1973
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:37,325
No, it's not cold enough for that,
not nearly cold enough.

1974
01:47:37,408 --> 01:47:40,328
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I got it.

1975
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:44,040
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon
and light on the cloves.

1976
01:47:44,123 --> 01:47:46,042
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1977
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:49,170
Hey, look, mister,
we serve hard drinks in here

1978
01:47:49,253 --> 01:47:51,005
for men who want to get drunk fast.

1979
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:54,676
And we don't need any characters
around to give the joint atmosphere.

1980
01:47:54,759 --> 01:47:58,346
Is that clear, or do I have
to slip you my left for a convincer?

1981
01:47:58,429 --> 01:47:59,847
What's he talking about?

1982
01:47:59,931 --> 01:48:03,810
Nick, Nick,
just give him the same as mine.

1983
01:48:03,893 --> 01:48:06,229
- He's okay.
- Okay.

1984
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:11,234
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1985
01:48:11,317 --> 01:48:14,445
You'll see a lot of strange things
from now on.

1986
01:48:14,696 --> 01:48:16,447
Oh, yeah.

1987
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:23,287
Hey, little fellow,
you worry me, you know.

1988
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:26,332
- You got some place to sleep?
- No.

1989
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:27,959
You don't, huh?

1990
01:48:28,042 --> 01:48:30,670
- Well, you got any money?
- No.

1991
01:48:31,629 --> 01:48:33,256
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1992
01:48:33,339 --> 01:48:36,968
I jumped in the river to save you
so I could get my wings.

1993
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:42,974
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1994
01:48:43,057 --> 01:48:44,475
Every time you hear a bell ring,

1995
01:48:44,559 --> 01:48:47,854
it means that
some angel's just got his wings.

1996
01:48:55,737 --> 01:48:58,489
Look, I think maybe you
better not mention

1997
01:48:58,573 --> 01:48:59,907
getting your wings around here.

1998
01:48:59,991 --> 01:49:02,452
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1999
01:49:04,996 --> 01:49:06,873
Yeah, they believe in them.

2000
01:49:06,956 --> 01:49:10,251
Oh, why should they be surprised
when they see one?

2001
01:49:12,045 --> 01:49:15,298
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

2002
01:49:15,673 --> 01:49:19,719
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three,

2003
01:49:21,512 --> 01:49:22,513
next May.

2004
01:49:23,806 --> 01:49:26,434
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

2005
01:49:26,517 --> 01:49:28,478
Go through the door or out the window.

2006
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:30,605
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.

2007
01:49:30,688 --> 01:49:32,690
Where do you come off calling me Nick?

2008
01:49:32,774 --> 01:49:34,275
Well, Nick, that's your name.

2009
01:49:34,358 --> 01:49:38,488
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

2010
01:49:38,571 --> 01:49:40,656
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.

2011
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:48,498
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

2012
01:49:55,546 --> 01:49:56,923
Mr. Gower.

2013
01:49:58,174 --> 01:49:59,509
Mr. Gower.

2014
01:50:01,135 --> 01:50:02,887
What... What did...

2015
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:05,681
Mr. Gower, look,
this is George Bailey.

2016
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:09,185
- Don't you know me?
- No.

2017
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:11,979
No.

2018
01:50:12,063 --> 01:50:13,481
Throw him out. Throw him out.

2019
01:50:13,564 --> 01:50:15,608
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

2020
01:50:16,734 --> 01:50:19,028
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

2021
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:21,322
You know, that's another reason
for me not to like you.

2022
01:50:21,405 --> 01:50:24,867
That rum head spent 20 years in jail
for poisoning a kid.

2023
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:27,829
If you know him,
you must be a jailbird yourself.

2024
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:29,956
Would you show these gentlemen
to the door?

2025
01:50:30,039 --> 01:50:32,083
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

2026
01:50:37,505 --> 01:50:38,798
Stay out.

2027
01:50:39,924 --> 01:50:42,552
Get me! I'm giving out wings!

2028
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:47,723
You see, George,
you were not there to stop Gower

2029
01:50:47,807 --> 01:50:49,517
from putting that poison
into the capsules.

2030
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,271
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...

2031
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:57,900
Hey, what's going on around here?

2032
01:50:58,151 --> 01:50:59,527
What...

2033
01:51:00,653 --> 01:51:03,281
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

2034
01:51:09,203 --> 01:51:10,872
Look, who are you?

2035
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:13,666
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

2036
01:51:13,749 --> 01:51:15,501
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

2037
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:24,844
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?

2038
01:51:24,927 --> 01:51:26,053
No. Of course not.

2039
01:51:26,137 --> 01:51:28,723
Well, then, why am I seeing
all these strange things here?

2040
01:51:28,806 --> 01:51:33,227
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.

2041
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:37,648
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am 1?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.

2042
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:40,401
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.

2043
01:51:40,484 --> 01:51:42,528
There is no George Bailey.

2044
01:51:43,654 --> 01:51:47,992
You have no papers, no cards,
no driver's license,

2045
01:51:48,409 --> 01:51:51,162
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

2046
01:51:52,163 --> 01:51:54,165
They're not there, either.

2047
01:51:55,374 --> 01:51:57,710
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

2048
01:52:03,174 --> 01:52:05,927
You've been given
a great gift, George,

2049
01:52:06,093 --> 01:52:09,680
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

2050
01:52:12,016 --> 01:52:14,685
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

2051
01:52:16,562 --> 01:52:19,857
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.

2052
01:52:20,024 --> 01:52:21,859
So long, mister. I'm going home.

2053
01:52:21,943 --> 01:52:24,820
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!

2054
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:29,367
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.

2055
01:52:29,784 --> 01:52:32,453
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.

2056
01:52:32,536 --> 01:52:34,455
I'm going home
and see my wife and family.

2057
01:52:34,538 --> 01:52:37,750
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.

2058
01:52:40,127 --> 01:52:42,046
How am I doing, Joseph?

2059
01:52:42,755 --> 01:52:43,965
Thanks.

2060
01:52:44,298 --> 01:52:46,384
No, I didn't have a drink.

2061
01:53:37,601 --> 01:53:40,146
Hey, hey, where did
the Building and Loan move to?

2062
01:53:40,229 --> 01:53:41,230
Building and what?

2063
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:43,065
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.

2064
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:45,026
They went out of business years ago.

2065
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:46,485
That sailor's a liar!

2066
01:53:46,569 --> 01:53:48,863
I know every big shot in this town!

2067
01:53:48,946 --> 01:53:51,490
I know Potter,
and I'll have you kicked off the beat.

2068
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:53,034
Hey, Violet!

2069
01:53:54,243 --> 01:53:56,829
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

2070
01:53:56,912 --> 01:53:59,040
- I know.
- I know that girl!

2071
01:53:59,123 --> 01:54:00,916
Take a walk. Beat it.

2072
01:54:02,918 --> 01:54:04,670
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

2073
01:54:06,839 --> 01:54:08,716
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.

2074
01:54:08,799 --> 01:54:09,842
Where do you live?

2075
01:54:09,925 --> 01:54:12,011
Now, doggone it, Ernie,
don't you start pulling that stuff.

2076
01:54:12,094 --> 01:54:14,597
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.

2077
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:18,142
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

2078
01:54:18,225 --> 01:54:20,061
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

2079
01:54:20,644 --> 01:54:22,730
Come on, Ernie,
now straighten me out here.

2080
01:54:22,813 --> 01:54:25,816
Look, I've got some bad liquor
or something. Listen to me.

2081
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:27,068
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

2082
01:54:27,151 --> 01:54:28,903
and you live in Bailey Park
with your wife and kid?

2083
01:54:28,986 --> 01:54:31,072
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?

2084
01:54:31,155 --> 01:54:34,408
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.

2085
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:37,286
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field,

2086
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:39,413
my wife ran away three years ago
and took the kid,

2087
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:41,957
and I ain't never seen you
before in my life, see?

2088
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:44,835
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!

2089
01:55:02,353 --> 01:55:04,605
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.

2090
01:55:04,688 --> 01:55:07,942
Well, this house ain't been lived in
for 20 years.

2091
01:55:13,989 --> 01:55:15,950
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.

2092
01:55:16,033 --> 01:55:19,245
But we better keep our eye
on this guy. He's bats.

2093
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,889
Mary. Mary!

2094
01:55:41,892 --> 01:55:44,770
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zulu!
Where are you?

2095
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:47,815
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

2096
01:55:47,898 --> 01:55:49,358
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

2097
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:51,610
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.

2098
01:55:51,694 --> 01:55:53,279
Come on out here, both of you.

2099
01:55:53,362 --> 01:55:55,656
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.

2100
01:55:55,739 --> 01:55:59,034
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

2101
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:00,786
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.

2102
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:02,913
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?

2103
01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:04,498
You were here on my wedding night.

2104
01:56:04,582 --> 01:56:06,167
You, both of you,
stood out there on the porch

2105
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:08,586
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.

2106
01:56:08,669 --> 01:56:10,004
Look, now,
why don't you be a good kid,

2107
01:56:10,087 --> 01:56:11,213
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

2108
01:56:11,297 --> 01:56:13,257
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.

2109
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:15,176
Ernie, will you take me over
to my mother's house?

2110
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:17,761
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.

2111
01:56:17,845 --> 01:56:21,265
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...

2112
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:25,352
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

2113
01:56:27,062 --> 01:56:29,857
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.

2114
01:56:29,982 --> 01:56:32,776
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

2115
01:56:38,616 --> 01:56:41,911
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.

2116
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:45,498
I need a drink.

2117
01:56:46,665 --> 01:56:48,959
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.

2118
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:00,346
Well?

2119
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:04,808
Mother.

2120
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:08,812
Mother? What do you want?

2121
01:57:10,022 --> 01:57:12,650
Mother, this is George.

2122
01:57:13,025 --> 01:57:14,818
I thought sure you'd remember me.

2123
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:16,320
George who?

2124
01:57:16,403 --> 01:57:18,239
If you're looking for a room,
there's no vacancy.

2125
01:57:18,322 --> 01:57:21,700
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.

2126
01:57:21,784 --> 01:57:24,203
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

2127
01:57:24,286 --> 01:57:27,248
Please let me come in,
and keep me here until I get over it.

2128
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:29,667
Get over what?
I don't take in strangers

2129
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:32,294
unless they're sent here
by somebody I know.

2130
01:57:32,628 --> 01:57:37,591
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2131
01:57:37,675 --> 01:57:39,426
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2132
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:41,637
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2133
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,846
It's a lie.

2134
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:45,808
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

2135
01:57:45,891 --> 01:57:48,769
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

2136
01:58:00,698 --> 01:58:02,366
Strange, isn't it?

2137
01:58:02,825 --> 01:58:05,744
Each man's life
touches so many other lives.

2138
01:58:06,203 --> 01:58:09,123
And when he isn't around,
he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2139
01:58:09,206 --> 01:58:10,416
I've heard of things like this.

2140
01:58:10,499 --> 01:58:12,251
You got me in some kind of a spell
or something.

2141
01:58:12,334 --> 01:58:14,420
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.

2142
01:58:14,503 --> 01:58:16,297
I know how, too. I...

2143
01:58:16,714 --> 01:58:17,840
The last man I talked to,

2144
01:58:17,923 --> 01:58:20,092
before all this stuff
started happening to me, was Martini.

2145
01:58:20,175 --> 01:58:21,385
You know where he lives?

2146
01:58:21,468 --> 01:58:24,388
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

2147
01:58:27,975 --> 01:58:32,438
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2148
01:58:33,314 --> 01:58:36,150
<i>Al know is
this should be Bailey Park.</i>

2149
01:58:36,942 --> 01:58:40,696
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.

2150
01:58:45,242 --> 01:58:48,287
Your brother Harry Bailey
broke through the ice

2151
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:50,247
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2152
01:58:50,331 --> 01:58:52,416
That's a lie.
Harry Bailey went to war.

2153
01:58:52,499 --> 01:58:53,959
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

2154
01:58:54,043 --> 01:58:56,003
He saved the lives
of every man on that transport.

2155
01:58:56,086 --> 01:58:58,130
Every man on that transport died.

2156
01:58:58,213 --> 01:58:59,506
Harry wasn't there to save them,

2157
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:01,884
because you weren't there
to save Harry.

2158
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:17,066
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.

2159
01:59:17,524 --> 01:59:21,612
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

2160
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:24,198
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?

2161
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:28,410
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...

2162
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:29,745
I don't know
how you know these things,

2163
01:59:29,828 --> 01:59:31,038
but tell me, where is she?

2164
01:59:31,121 --> 01:59:33,082
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

2165
01:59:33,165 --> 01:59:34,375
I'm not supposed to tell.

2166
01:59:34,458 --> 01:59:36,168
Please, Clarence,
tell me where she is.

2167
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:38,545
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?

2168
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:41,006
She's an old maid. She never married.

2169
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:43,425
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?

2170
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:46,428
She's just about
to close up the library!

2171
01:59:50,307 --> 01:59:53,686
There must be some easier way
for me to get my wings.

2172
02:00:05,197 --> 02:00:06,323
Mary!

2173
02:00:11,954 --> 02:00:13,038
Mary!

2174
02:00:15,457 --> 02:00:16,583
Mary!

2175
02:00:18,001 --> 02:00:19,503
Mary! Mary!

2176
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,423
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

2177
02:00:22,506 --> 02:00:23,882
I don't know you. Let me go!

2178
02:00:23,966 --> 02:00:27,010
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

2179
02:00:27,094 --> 02:00:28,637
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.

2180
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:31,682
Help me, Mary!

2181
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:33,600
Mary! Let me go!

2182
02:00:33,851 --> 02:00:35,602
Help! It's a wild man!

2183
02:00:36,854 --> 02:00:39,523
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!

2184
02:00:39,606 --> 02:00:42,192
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

2185
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:44,236
That's my wife!

2186
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:48,282
- Mary!
- No, you don't.

2187
02:00:48,365 --> 02:00:49,491
Somebody call the police.

2188
02:00:49,575 --> 02:00:50,909
Somebody hit him on the head
with a bottle.

2189
02:00:50,993 --> 02:00:53,120
You need a straightjacket.

2190
02:00:54,204 --> 02:00:55,539
Clarence!

2191
02:00:55,998 --> 02:00:57,583
Get out of here!

2192
02:00:57,666 --> 02:00:58,917
Clarence!

2193
02:01:00,627 --> 02:01:02,671
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!

2194
02:01:06,216 --> 02:01:07,551
Stand back!

2195
02:01:11,305 --> 02:01:12,598
Clarence!

2196
02:01:21,732 --> 02:01:23,066
Clarence!

2197
02:01:27,988 --> 02:01:30,240
Clarence! Clarence!

2198
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:33,577
Help me, Clarence!

2199
02:01:34,703 --> 02:01:36,079
Get me back!

2200
02:01:36,955 --> 02:01:39,917
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.

2201
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:42,628
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2202
02:01:42,795 --> 02:01:44,880
Help me, Clarence, please.

2203
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:50,010
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.

2204
02:01:51,762 --> 02:01:55,766
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.

2205
02:02:04,775 --> 02:02:06,235
Hey, George!

2206
02:02:07,611 --> 02:02:08,821
George!

2207
02:02:09,863 --> 02:02:11,865
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2208
02:02:11,949 --> 02:02:12,950
Now get out of here, Bert,

2209
02:02:13,033 --> 02:02:14,409
or I'll hit you again!
Get out of here!

2210
02:02:14,493 --> 02:02:16,203
What the sam hill
are you yelling for, George?

2211
02:02:16,286 --> 02:02:17,788
You...

2212
02:02:19,122 --> 02:02:22,042
George? Bert, do you know me?

2213
02:02:22,376 --> 02:02:24,378
Know you? You kidding?

2214
02:02:24,461 --> 02:02:26,588
I've been looking all over town
trying to find you.

2215
02:02:26,672 --> 02:02:29,633
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

2216
02:02:29,716 --> 02:02:31,969
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

2217
02:02:32,052 --> 02:02:33,554
What did...

2218
02:02:37,432 --> 02:02:40,602
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...

2219
02:02:40,853 --> 02:02:43,897
Zuzu's petals. Zulu... There they are!

2220
02:02:43,981 --> 02:02:46,900
Bert! What do you know about that?

2221
02:02:46,984 --> 02:02:50,779
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.

2222
02:02:51,196 --> 02:02:54,324
Mary! Mary!

2223
02:03:02,958 --> 02:03:04,960
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2224
02:03:07,963 --> 02:03:09,339
Merry Christmas!

2225
02:03:09,423 --> 02:03:11,258
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!

2226
02:03:11,341 --> 02:03:13,218
Merry Christmas, George.

2227
02:03:13,302 --> 02:03:15,679
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2228
02:03:16,263 --> 02:03:18,557
Merry Christmas, emporium!

2229
02:03:19,808 --> 02:03:23,520
Merry Christmas,
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2230
02:03:27,691 --> 02:03:31,278
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2231
02:03:31,361 --> 02:03:34,114
Happy New Year to you in jail!

2232
02:03:34,197 --> 02:03:36,199
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2233
02:03:37,826 --> 02:03:40,829
Mary! Mary!

2234
02:03:42,539 --> 02:03:43,624
Mary!

2235
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:47,377
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?

2236
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:49,671
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.

2237
02:03:49,755 --> 02:03:51,214
George, I've got a little paper here.

2238
02:03:51,298 --> 02:03:52,591
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

2239
02:03:52,674 --> 02:03:54,301
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!

2240
02:03:54,384 --> 02:03:56,803
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?

2241
02:03:56,887 --> 02:03:59,681
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful,
old drafty house.

2242
02:03:59,765 --> 02:04:02,059
Mary! Mary!

2243
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:04,394
Mary.

2244
02:04:05,187 --> 02:04:06,813
Have you seen my wife?

2245
02:04:06,897 --> 02:04:09,816
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

2246
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,902
Kids! Pete!

2247
02:04:16,573 --> 02:04:17,866
Kids! Janie!

2248
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:19,451
Janie! Tommy!

2249
02:04:21,578 --> 02:04:24,414
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.

2250
02:04:25,207 --> 02:04:26,291
Where's your mother?

2251
02:04:26,375 --> 02:04:28,168
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.

2252
02:04:28,251 --> 02:04:29,962
- Daddy!
- Zulu!

2253
02:04:30,045 --> 02:04:32,589
Zulu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?

2254
02:04:32,673 --> 02:04:35,968
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...

2255
02:04:36,635 --> 02:04:38,595
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.

2256
02:04:39,346 --> 02:04:42,516
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!

2257
02:04:42,599 --> 02:04:44,810
George, darling. Where have you been?

2258
02:04:44,893 --> 02:04:48,188
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.

2259
02:04:48,271 --> 02:04:51,525
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?

2260
02:04:52,985 --> 02:04:55,112
George, George.

2261
02:04:55,195 --> 02:04:57,114
You have no idea
what's happened to me.

2262
02:04:57,197 --> 02:04:59,199
You've no idea what happened...

2263
02:05:00,075 --> 02:05:02,202
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.

2264
02:05:02,285 --> 02:05:03,620
- They're on their way.
- All right.

2265
02:05:03,704 --> 02:05:04,955
Come on.

2266
02:05:07,332 --> 02:05:09,126
Come on in here now.

2267
02:05:10,293 --> 02:05:11,920
Now, you stand right over here
by the tree.

2268
02:05:12,004 --> 02:05:14,256
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.

2269
02:05:14,339 --> 02:05:15,924
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?

2270
02:05:16,299 --> 02:05:17,676
I hear them coming now.

2271
02:05:17,759 --> 02:05:20,178
George, it's a miracle.
It's a miracle.

2272
02:05:20,262 --> 02:05:22,472
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

2273
02:05:22,556 --> 02:05:24,558
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?

2274
02:05:24,641 --> 02:05:28,270
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.

2275
02:05:28,353 --> 02:05:29,604
George.

2276
02:05:31,064 --> 02:05:33,316
Here's everything right here.

2277
02:05:34,609 --> 02:05:38,238
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2278
02:05:38,321 --> 02:05:39,906
She told some people
you were in trouble,

2279
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:41,908
and they scattered all over town
collecting money.

2280
02:05:41,992 --> 02:05:43,118
Didn't ask any questions.

2281
02:05:43,201 --> 02:05:44,911
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."

2282
02:05:44,995 --> 02:05:46,705
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.

2283
02:05:46,788 --> 02:05:48,915
...another run on the bank?

2284
02:05:48,999 --> 02:05:51,460
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

2285
02:05:51,543 --> 02:05:53,545
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.

2286
02:05:53,628 --> 02:05:55,797
The line forms on the right.

2287
02:05:56,131 --> 02:05:57,758
More coming, George.

2288
02:05:57,841 --> 02:06:00,385
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.

2289
02:06:01,428 --> 02:06:03,055
Merry Christmas.

2290
02:06:03,388 --> 02:06:05,766
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.

2291
02:06:05,849 --> 02:06:08,351
Martini! Step right up here.

2292
02:06:09,102 --> 02:06:11,521
I busted the jukebox, too.

2293
02:06:14,691 --> 02:06:16,234
Oh, Mr. Gower!

2294
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:21,198
I made the rounds
of my charge accounts.

2295
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:31,708
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.

2296
02:06:32,417 --> 02:06:33,877
Violet Bick.

2297
02:06:34,628 --> 02:06:36,338
Oh, Annie! Annie!

2298
02:06:37,547 --> 02:06:39,800
I've been saving this money
for a divorce,

2299
02:06:39,883 --> 02:06:41,885
if ever I get a husband.

2300
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:44,387
Merry Christmas.

2301
02:06:46,556 --> 02:06:47,766
There you are, George.

2302
02:06:47,849 --> 02:06:49,935
I got the faculty
all up and out of bed.

2303
02:06:50,018 --> 02:06:51,269
Here's something for you to play with.

2304
02:06:53,814 --> 02:06:56,983
I wouldn't have a roof over my head
if it wasn't for you, George.

2305
02:06:57,067 --> 02:07:00,570
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2306
02:07:00,654 --> 02:07:02,864
Now, get this, it's from London.

2307
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:06,368
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2308
02:07:06,576 --> 02:07:10,831
"My office instructed
to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.

2309
02:07:10,914 --> 02:07:13,959
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."

2310
02:07:24,177 --> 02:07:26,596
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2311
02:07:32,602 --> 02:07:36,314
Hark the herald angels sing

2312
02:07:36,398 --> 02:07:40,694
Glory to the newborn king

2313
02:07:40,777 --> 02:07:45,115
Peace on earth and mercy mild

2314
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:49,286
God and sinners reconciled

2315
02:07:49,369 --> 02:07:53,707
Joyful, all ye nations rise

2316
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:57,878
Join the triumph of the skies

2317
02:07:57,961 --> 02:08:02,090
With angelic host proclaim

2318
02:08:02,174 --> 02:08:05,760
Christ is born in Bethlehem

2319
02:08:05,844 --> 02:08:07,345
Harry Bailey!

2320
02:08:12,809 --> 02:08:15,103
George, you old son of a gun.

2321
02:08:15,312 --> 02:08:17,606
Harry. Harry.

2322
02:08:17,814 --> 02:08:19,024
Looks like I got here too late.

2323
02:08:19,107 --> 02:08:21,735
Mary, I got him here from the airport
just as quick as I could.

2324
02:08:21,818 --> 02:08:23,570
The fool flew all the way up here
in a blizzard.

2325
02:08:23,653 --> 02:08:25,405
Harry, how about your banquet
in New York?

2326
02:08:25,488 --> 02:08:28,158
Oh, I left right in the middle of it
as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2327
02:08:28,241 --> 02:08:30,243
Good idea, Ernie. A toast

2328
02:08:30,327 --> 02:08:33,622
to my big brother, George,
the richest man in town!

2329
02:08:35,749 --> 02:08:41,213
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2330
02:08:41,296 --> 02:08:46,801
And never brought to mind?

2331
02:08:46,885 --> 02:08:50,472
Should auld acquaintance

2332
02:08:50,555 --> 02:08:52,599
Be forgot

2333
02:08:52,682 --> 02:08:57,103
And days of auld lang syne

2334
02:08:57,187 --> 02:08:58,647
Who's that?

2335
02:08:59,731 --> 02:09:03,360
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

2336
02:09:04,152 --> 02:09:05,278
Look, Daddy!

2337
02:09:05,362 --> 02:09:10,784
Teacher says every time a bell rings,
an angel gets his wings.

2338
02:09:11,534 --> 02:09:13,036
That's right.

2339
02:09:13,578 --> 02:09:15,080
That's right.

2340
02:09:16,581 --> 02:09:17,749
Attaboy, Clarence.

2341
02:09:17,832 --> 02:09:20,460
Auld lang syne

2342
02:09:20,543 --> 02:09:25,966
For auld lang syne, my dear

2343
02:09:26,049 --> 02:09:31,263
For auld lang syne

2344
02:09:31,346 --> 02:09:36,810
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2345
02:09:36,893 --> 02:09:42,691
For auld lang syne

2346
02:09:43,149 --> 02:09:48,488
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2347
02:09:48,571 --> 02:09:54,077
For auld lang syne
