2
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:53,893
<i>- Is everything in place?</i>
- You're not to relieve me.

3
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,771
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

4
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:59,690
<i>- You like him, don't you?</i>
<i>- You like watching him.</i>

5
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,943
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.</i>
<i>- We're going to kill him.</i>

6
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,654
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

7
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:06,864
<i>Do you?</i>

8
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:08,866
<i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>

9
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,743
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

10
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:13,079
<i>- Did you hear that?</i>
<i>- Hear what?</i>

11
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:14,914
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

12
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:17,166
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

13
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,959
<i>I better go.</i>

14
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:58,707
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

15
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,334
Do it! Do it now!

16
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:24,358
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

17
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:28,404
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

18
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:30,364
I'm just doing my job.

19
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:35,411
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

20
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,372
The orders were for your protection.

21
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,084
I think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:48,966
I sent two units!

23
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:50,801
They're bringing her down now!

24
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:54,180
No, lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

25
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:24,335
Shit.

26
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:29,340
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

27
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,217
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

28
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:33,594
<i>There's no time.</i>
<i>Get to another exit.</i>

29
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:36,263
- Are there any agents?
<i>- Yes.</i>

30
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,640
Goddamn it.

31
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,433
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

32
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:42,061
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

33
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:44,104
<i>You can make it.</i>

34
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,023
- All right.
<i>- Go.</i>

35
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,211
That's impossible.

36
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,206
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

37
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,083
Get up.

38
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:15,464
She got out.

39
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,049
It doesn't matter.

40
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,469
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

41
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:22,388
We have the name of their next target.

42
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,306
The name is Neo.

43
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:29,103
We'll need a search running.

44
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,313
It has already begun.

45
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,286
What?

46
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:34,543
What the hell?

47
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:44,136
"Follow the white rabbit."

48
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:57,149
Who is it?

49
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,692
It's Choi.

50
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:05,657
Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:13,373
You're two hours late.

52
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,709
I know. It's her fault.

53
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:16,960
You got the money?

54
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:20,255
Two grand.

55
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:22,257
Hold on.

56
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:41,318
Hallelujah.

57
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:44,446
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

58
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:46,573
You get caught using that...

59
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:48,951
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

60
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:52,162
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

61
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,456
You look a little whiter than usual.

62
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,751
My computer, it...

63
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:05,300
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

64
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,846
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

65
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,473
It's the only way to fly.

66
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,852
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

67
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,604
Get some R and R?

68
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,775
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

69
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:24,987
Definitely.

70
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:28,323
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

71
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,075
Come on.

72
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,953
It'll be fun. I promise.

73
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,961
Yeah.

74
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,630
Sure. I'll go.

75
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,326
Hello, Neo.

76
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:14,828
How do you know that name?

77
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:17,372
I know a lot about you.

78
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:20,334
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

79
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:22,502
Trinity.

80
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,297
The Trinity?

81
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,466
That cracked the IRS D-base?

82
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,176
That was a long time ago.

83
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,345
- Jesus.
- What?

84
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,597
I just thought...

85
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,516
...you were a guy.

86
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,226
Most guys do.

87
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,647
That was you on my computer.

88
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:43,357
How did you do that?

89
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,735
Right now, all I can tell you...

90
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:48,904
...is that you're in danger.

91
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:51,782
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

92
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,034
They're watching you, Neo.

93
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:57,037
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

94
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,376
I know why you're here, Neo.

95
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,128
I know what you've been doing.

96
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,255
I know why you hardly sleep...

97
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:10,676
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

98
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:13,261
...you sit at your computer.

99
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,973
You're looking for him.

100
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:19,768
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

101
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,396
And when he found me...

102
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:26,108
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

103
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,777
...I was looking for an answer.

104
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,531
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

105
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,867
It's the question
that brought you here.

106
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:39,329
You know the question...

107
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,081
...just as I did.

108
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,251
What is the Matrix?

109
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,962
The answer is out there, Neo.

110
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,631
It's looking for you.

111
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,092
And it will find you...

112
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:54,386
...if you want it to.

113
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,144
Shit.

114
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,520
Shit, shit.

115
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,616
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

116
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:20,912
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

117
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:23,623
Obviously, you are mistaken.

118
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:29,463
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

119
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:33,091
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

120
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:37,971
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

121
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,435
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

122
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:48,190
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

123
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,401
...or you choose to find another job.

124
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:53,612
Do I make myself clear?

125
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:56,281
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

126
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:05,624
Thomas Anderson?

127
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:09,294
Yeah, that's me.

128
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,296
Okay.

129
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:18,470
Great.

130
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:21,056
Have a nice day.

131
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:37,572
Hello?

132
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:41,201
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

133
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,205
- Morpheus.
- Yes.

134
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,457
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

135
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,877
<i>I don't know if you're ready to see</i>
<i>what I want to show you.</i>

136
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,297
<i>But unfortunately, you and I</i>
<i>have run out of time.</i>

137
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:58,260
<i>They're coming for you, and I don't know</i>
<i>what they're going to do.</i>

138
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,845
Who's coming for me?

139
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:02,180
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

140
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:03,932
What? Right now?

141
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,726
<i>Yes. Now.</i>

142
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:09,479
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

143
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,106
<i>The elevator.</i>

144
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:17,779
- Oh, shit!
- Yes.

145
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,535
What do they want?

146
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:27,038
<i>I don't know. If you don't want</i>
<i>to find out, get out of there.</i>

147
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:28,248
How?

148
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:31,626
<i>I can guide you,</i>
<i>but you must do exactly as I say.</i>

149
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,504
- Okay.
<i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

150
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:39,759
- But what if they--
<i>- Go. Now.</i>

151
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,894
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

152
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,862
<i>When I tell you,</i>
<i>go to the end of the row...</i>

153
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:01,072
<i>...to the office</i>
<i>at the end of the hall.</i>

154
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,700
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

155
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,120
<i>Go. Now.</i>

156
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,055
<i>Good. Now, outside</i>
<i>there is a scaffold.</i>

157
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,101
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time.</i>

158
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:33,188
<i>To your left there's a window.</i>
<i>Go to it.</i>

159
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:36,983
<i>Open it.</i>

160
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:39,611
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

161
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:42,447
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

162
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:45,075
<i>There are two ways</i>
<i>out of this building.</i>

163
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:49,120
<i>One is that scaffold.</i>
<i>The other is in their custody.</i>

164
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,582
<i>You take a chance either way.</i>
<i>I leave it to you.</i>

165
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,921
This is insane!

166
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,966
Why is this happening to me?

167
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,884
What'd I do?

168
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,012
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

169
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,056
I'm gonna die.

170
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:18,900
Shit!

171
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:40,297
Oh, shit!

172
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,053
I can't do this.

173
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:00,734
Shit.

174
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:54,829
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

175
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:58,792
It seems that you've been living...

176
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:01,169
...two lives.

177
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:05,090
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

178
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:08,676
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

179
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,014
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

180
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:14,724
And you...

181
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,938
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

182
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:25,568
The other life is lived in computers...

183
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:28,822
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

184
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:33,868
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

185
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:37,122
One of these lives...

186
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:39,207
...has a future.

187
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,543
And one of them does not.

188
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:49,092
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

189
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,428
You're here...

190
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,013
...because we need your help.

191
00:18:57,643 --> 00:19:00,645
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

192
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:02,689
...individual.

193
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:07,652
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

194
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:12,657
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

195
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:15,326
He is considered by many authorities...

196
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:18,621
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

197
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,542
My colleagues...

198
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:25,920
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

199
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:29,632
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

200
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:33,428
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

201
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,930
...give you a fresh start.

202
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:39,350
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

203
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:43,104
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

204
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:45,732
Yeah.

205
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:49,110
That sounds like a really good deal.

206
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,489
But I got a better one.

207
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,240
How about...

208
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,659
...I give you the finger...

209
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:01,247
...and you give me my phone call.

210
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:05,293
Mr. Anderson...

211
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:10,507
...you disappoint me.

212
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:13,384
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

213
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:15,011
I know my rights.

214
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:16,763
I want my phone call.

215
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,516
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

216
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,809
...what good is a phone call...

217
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:25,647
...if you're unable to speak?

218
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,641
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

219
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:04,310
...whether you want to or not.

220
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:05,997
<i>This line is tapped,</i>
<i>so I must be brief.</i>

221
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:10,543
<i>They got to you first, but they've</i>
<i>underestimated how important you are.</i>

222
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:12,629
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

223
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,881
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

224
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:19,594
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

225
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:24,682
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have</i>
<i>spent the last few years...</i>

226
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,894
<i>...Iooking for me, but I've spent</i>
<i>my entire life...</i>

227
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:29,646
<i>...Iooking for you.</i>

228
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,358
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

229
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:37,195
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

230
00:22:47,414 --> 00:22:48,623
Get in.

231
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:01,719
What's this?

232
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,514
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

233
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:06,933
- From what?
- From you.

234
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:09,936
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

235
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:11,270
Stop the car.

236
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,026
Listen, coppertop.

237
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:19,278
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

238
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,156
Right now, there's only one rule:

239
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:23,783
Our way...

240
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:25,201
...or the highway.

241
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,834
Fine.

242
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:37,171
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

243
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:40,383
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

244
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:42,343
You know that road.

245
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,971
You know exactly where it ends.

246
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:49,434
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

247
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:05,158
Apoc, lights.

248
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:09,829
- Lie back.
- Lift up your shirt.

249
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:14,000
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

250
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,217
Try and relax.

251
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:30,683
Come on.

252
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:32,769
Come on.

253
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,521
It's on the move.

254
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:38,524
Come on, you shit.

255
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,612
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

256
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,863
Clear!

257
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:54,582
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

258
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,659
This is it.

259
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:35,456
Let me give you one piece of advice.

260
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,084
Be honest.

261
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,879
He knows more than you can imagine.

262
00:25:50,597 --> 00:25:51,931
At last.

263
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:54,559
Welcome, Neo.

264
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,687
As you no doubt have guessed...

265
00:25:57,938 --> 00:25:59,188
...I am Morpheus.

266
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:01,816
It's an honor to meet you.

267
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:03,317
No...

268
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:05,194
...the honor is mine.

269
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:08,614
Please, come. Sit.

270
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,339
I imagine...

271
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:28,509
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

272
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,638
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

273
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:34,557
You could say that.

274
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:38,102
I can see it in your eyes.

275
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:41,981
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

276
00:26:42,232 --> 00:26:44,483
...because he's expecting to wake up.

277
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,487
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

278
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:51,574
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

279
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:52,825
No.

280
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:54,285
Why not?

281
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:57,330
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

282
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,751
I know exactly what you mean.

283
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,424
Let me tell you why you're here.

284
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,010
You know something.

285
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:13,179
What you know,
you can't explain.

286
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,264
But you feel it.

287
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:17,767
You felt it your entire life:

288
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:22,521
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

289
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,232
Like a splinter in your mind...

290
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,360
...driving you mad.

291
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,030
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

292
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:35,409
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

293
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:38,579
The Matrix?

294
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,750
Do you want to know...

295
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,211
...what it is?

296
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,465
The Matrix is everywhere.

297
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:51,425
It is all around us.

298
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:53,636
Even now, in this very room.

299
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,681
You can see it when you
look out your window...

300
00:27:56,932 --> 00:27:59,266
...or when you turn on your television.

301
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,228
You can feel it when you go to work...

302
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:05,439
...when you go to church...

303
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:07,942
...when you pay your taxes.

304
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:11,988
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

305
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,823
...to blind you from the truth.

306
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,284
What truth?

307
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,082
That you are a slave.

308
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,877
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

309
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:31,799
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

310
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:33,384
A prison...

311
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:34,760
...for your mind.

312
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:44,103
Unfortunately, no one can be...

313
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:46,814
...told what the Matrix is.

314
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:52,153
You have to see it for yourself.

315
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:03,956
This is your last chance.

316
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:06,542
After this, there is no turning back.

317
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:08,461
You take the blue pill...

318
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:11,839
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

319
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,883
...whatever you want to believe.

320
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:15,468
You take the red pill...

321
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,678
...you stay in Wonderland...

322
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,890
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

323
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:31,984
Remember...

324
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:35,863
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

325
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,504
Follow me.

326
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,716
Apoc, are we on-line?

327
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,343
Almost.

328
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,723
Time is always against us.

329
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,600
Please take a seat there.

330
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,495
- You did all this?
Mm-hm.

331
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,626
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

332
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:36,006
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

333
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,591
What does that mean?

334
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,344
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

335
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,012
...because Kansas...

336
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:43,305
...is going bye-bye.

337
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:22,595
Did you...?

338
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:37,693
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

339
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:41,739
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

340
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,491
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

341
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:46,535
...and the real world?

342
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:49,330
This can't be.

343
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:50,539
Be what?

344
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:52,750
Be real?

345
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,130
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

346
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Still nothing.

347
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:01,133
It's cold.

348
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:02,760
It's cold!

349
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,307
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

350
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:12,478
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

351
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:14,188
Targeting almost there.

352
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:18,901
He's going into arrest.

353
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:21,654
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

354
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:19,998
Welcome...

355
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,251
...to the real world.

356
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,504
We've done it, Trinity.

357
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:27,297
We found him.

358
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:30,342
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

359
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,511
I know it.

360
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:38,725
Am I dead?

361
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:41,395
Far from it.

362
00:35:55,368 --> 00:35:56,785
He still needs a lot of work.

363
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,413
What are you doing?

364
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:01,874
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

365
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,001
Why do my eyes hurt?

366
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,587
You've never used them before.

367
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,383
Rest, Neo.

368
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:13,302
The answers are coming.

369
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:29,461
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

370
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,171
What is this place?

371
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:34,091
More important than "what" is "when."

372
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,634
"When"?

373
00:37:35,843 --> 00:37:37,886
You believe it's the year 1999...

374
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:40,389
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

375
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:44,268
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

376
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,144
...because we honestly don't know.

377
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:49,481
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

378
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:52,484
Come with me.
See for yourself.

379
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:54,778
This is my ship.

380
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:57,990
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

381
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:02,578
This is the main deck.

382
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:09,585
This is the core...

383
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:15,841
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

384
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,389
Most of my crew you already know.

385
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:28,812
This is Apoc...

386
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:30,939
...Switch...

387
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:33,692
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

388
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:37,654
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

389
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,949
The little one behind you is Mouse.

390
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:48,540
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

391
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:50,792
Trinity.

392
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:13,398
Try to relax.

393
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:20,113
This will feel a little weird.

394
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,460
This...

395
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:35,337
...is the Construct.

396
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:37,881
It's our loading program.

397
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:40,592
We can load anything, from clothing...

398
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:42,219
...to equipment...

399
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:43,845
...weapons...

400
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:46,306
...training simulations...

401
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:49,226
...anything we need.

402
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:54,439
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

403
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:56,650
Is it really so hard to believe?

404
00:39:57,151 --> 00:39:59,778
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

405
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,073
Your hair has changed.

406
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:06,785
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

407
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:10,122
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

408
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:17,129
This isn't real?

409
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,922
What is "real"?

410
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:21,550
How do you define "real"?

411
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:23,760
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

412
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:26,430
...what you can smell, taste and see...

413
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:30,559
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

414
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:37,149
This is the world that you know.

415
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:41,611
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

416
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:48,326
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

417
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:49,828
...that we call the Matrix.

418
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,169
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

419
00:40:58,171 --> 00:40:59,296
This is the world...

420
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,339
...as it exists today.

421
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:17,355
Welcome to "the desert...

422
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:19,816
...of the real."

423
00:41:23,196 --> 00:41:25,572
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

424
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:29,618
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

425
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:33,121
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

426
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:38,126
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

427
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,045
AI.

428
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:42,464
You mean artificial intelligence.

429
00:41:42,715 --> 00:41:47,135
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

430
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,431
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

431
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,060
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

432
00:41:56,729 --> 00:41:58,897
They were dependent on solar power...

433
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:02,484
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

434
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:06,321
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

435
00:42:06,572 --> 00:42:11,451
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

436
00:42:12,912 --> 00:42:17,123
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

437
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:24,756
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

438
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:29,135
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

439
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:33,223
Combined with a form of fusion...

440
00:42:33,558 --> 00:42:38,395
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

441
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:46,194
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

442
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:49,698
...where human beings
are no longer born.

443
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:52,242
We are grown.

444
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,876
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

445
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,795
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

446
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:06,756
...watched them liquefy the dead...

447
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:10,343
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

448
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:15,140
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

449
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:18,310
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

450
00:43:20,938 --> 00:43:22,731
What is the Matrix?

451
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:24,983
Control.

452
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,738
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

453
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:33,617
...built to keep us under control...

454
00:43:34,785 --> 00:43:37,954
...in order to change a human being...

455
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:39,748
...into this.

456
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,250
No.

457
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:45,462
I don't believe it.

458
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:47,047
It's not possible.

459
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:52,218
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

460
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,762
Stop!

461
00:43:54,305 --> 00:43:55,513
Let me out!

462
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:58,141
Let me out! I want out!

463
00:44:00,102 --> 00:44:02,771
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

464
00:44:03,022 --> 00:44:04,689
Get this thing out of me!

465
00:44:06,484 --> 00:44:07,984
Don't touch me!

466
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:09,861
Stay away from me!

467
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:11,780
I don't believe it.

468
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,698
I don't believe it.

469
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,450
I don't believe it.

470
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:17,744
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

471
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,204
Just breathe.

472
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:39,391
I can't go back, can I?

473
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:41,643
No.

474
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:43,687
But if you could...

475
00:44:44,522 --> 00:44:46,022
...would you really want to?

476
00:44:48,526 --> 00:44:49,901
I owe you an apology.

477
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:51,861
We have a rule.

478
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:55,573
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

479
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:56,825
It's dangerous.

480
00:44:57,535 --> 00:44:59,244
The mind has trouble letting go.

481
00:44:59,495 --> 00:45:01,788
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

482
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:04,916
I did what I did because...

483
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:07,085
...I had to.

484
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:19,597
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

485
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,893
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

486
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,188
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

487
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:32,402
It was he who freed the first of us...

488
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:34,904
...taught us the truth.

489
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:39,451
As long as the Matrix exists...

490
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:41,870
...the human race will never be free.

491
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,625
After he died...

492
00:45:48,377 --> 00:45:51,087
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

493
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,841
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

494
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:56,760
...end the war...

495
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:58,344
...bring freedom to our people.

496
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,309
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

497
00:46:04,643 --> 00:46:06,227
...Iooking for him.

498
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:10,732
I did what I did because...

499
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,486
...I believe that search is over.

500
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:20,992
Get some rest.

501
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:23,411
You're going to need it.

502
00:46:26,123 --> 00:46:27,165
For what?

503
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:31,419
Your training.

504
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,439
Morning. Did you sleep?

505
00:46:52,316 --> 00:46:53,525
You will tonight.

506
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:55,443
I guarantee it.

507
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:58,863
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

508
00:46:59,323 --> 00:47:01,741
- You don't have any--
- Holes? Nope.

509
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,372
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

510
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:08,832
Born free right here...

511
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,708
...in the real world.

512
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,627
Genuine child of Zion.

513
00:47:13,462 --> 00:47:15,922
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

514
00:47:16,173 --> 00:47:17,674
...Zion's where the party would be.

515
00:47:18,092 --> 00:47:19,384
It's a city?

516
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:22,804
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

517
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,640
Where is it?

518
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:30,812
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

519
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:34,315
You live long enough,
you might see it.

520
00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:41,406
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

521
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:43,408
...if Morpheus is right and all.

522
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:46,661
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

523
00:47:46,912 --> 00:47:48,329
...if you are...

524
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,416
...it's a very exciting time.

525
00:47:52,459 --> 00:47:55,170
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

526
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:02,010
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

527
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:06,472
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

528
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:08,266
How about...

529
00:48:09,852 --> 00:48:11,603
...combat training?

530
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:19,110
"Jujitsu"?

531
00:48:19,987 --> 00:48:21,654
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

532
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,209
Holy shit!

533
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,794
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

534
00:48:37,129 --> 00:48:38,421
How about some more?

535
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:39,964
Hell, yes.

536
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:43,092
Hell, yeah.

537
00:48:55,272 --> 00:48:56,356
How is he?

538
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:58,775
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

539
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:11,371
I know kung fu.

540
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Show me.

541
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:17,585
This is a sparring program...

542
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:20,630
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

543
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:23,216
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

544
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:26,928
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

545
00:49:27,471 --> 00:49:28,972
Some of them can be bent.

546
00:49:29,181 --> 00:49:31,641
Others can be broken.

547
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:33,268
Understand?

548
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:35,395
Then hit me...

549
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,105
...if you can.

550
00:50:16,103 --> 00:50:17,145
Good!

551
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:19,063
Adaptation.

552
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:20,565
Improvisation.

553
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:22,191
But your weakness...

554
00:50:22,443 --> 00:50:23,818
...is not your technique.

555
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:32,869
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

556
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,317
How did I beat you?

557
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:53,991
You're too fast.

558
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:55,868
Do you believe that...

559
00:51:56,245 --> 00:51:58,746
...my being stronger or faster...

560
00:51:58,997 --> 00:52:02,667
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

561
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:08,506
You think you're breathing air?

562
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,229
Again!

563
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,118
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

564
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:39,579
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

565
00:52:45,043 --> 00:52:46,502
What are you waiting for?

566
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:48,713
You're faster than this.

567
00:52:50,924 --> 00:52:53,134
Don't think you are.

568
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:55,052
Know you are.

569
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:08,232
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

570
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,911
I don't believe it.

571
00:53:21,455 --> 00:53:23,581
I know what you're trying to do.

572
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,418
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

573
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:29,837
But I can only show you the door.

574
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:32,256
You have to walk through it.

575
00:53:34,635 --> 00:53:36,761
Tank, load the jump program.

576
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:51,067
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

577
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,778
...doubt and disbelief.

578
00:53:54,947 --> 00:53:57,657
Free your mind.

579
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,041
Whoa.

580
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,550
Okey-dokey.

581
00:54:17,636 --> 00:54:18,803
Free my mind.

582
00:54:19,263 --> 00:54:20,388
What if he makes it?

583
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:23,349
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

584
00:54:24,685 --> 00:54:27,144
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

585
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:28,813
Come on.

586
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:30,231
All right.

587
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:32,733
No problem. Free my mind.

588
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:36,320
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

589
00:54:55,716 --> 00:54:57,383
What does that mean?

590
00:54:57,759 --> 00:54:59,594
It doesn't mean anything.

591
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:02,763
Everybody falls the first time.

592
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:04,515
Right, Trin?

593
00:55:25,203 --> 00:55:27,830
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

594
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:33,336
If you're killed in the Matrix...

595
00:55:33,503 --> 00:55:34,545
...you die here?

596
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,632
The body cannot live without the mind.

597
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:11,499
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

598
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:17,421
There is something about him,
isn't there?

599
00:56:18,048 --> 00:56:19,674
You're a believer now?

600
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:21,884
I keep wondering...

601
00:56:22,135 --> 00:56:25,805
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

602
00:56:26,723 --> 00:56:29,642
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

603
00:56:39,444 --> 00:56:40,986
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

604
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:44,031
That system is our enemy.

605
00:56:44,658 --> 00:56:46,992
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

606
00:56:47,244 --> 00:56:51,038
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

607
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:54,083
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

608
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:57,294
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

609
00:56:57,546 --> 00:56:59,463
...and that makes them our enemy.

610
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:00,840
You have to understand...

611
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:04,427
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

612
00:57:04,678 --> 00:57:06,262
And many of them are so inert...

613
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:08,931
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

614
00:57:09,182 --> 00:57:11,892
...that they will fight to protect it.

615
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:17,148
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

616
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:19,066
- I was--
- Look again.

617
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:21,402
Freeze it.

618
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:29,660
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

619
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:35,291
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

620
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:38,335
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

621
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:41,672
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

622
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:46,719
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

623
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:50,473
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

624
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:52,141
...is potentially an agent.

625
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:54,935
Inside the Matrix...

626
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,229
...they are everyone...

627
00:57:57,564 --> 00:57:59,273
...and they are no one.

628
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:02,651
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

629
00:58:02,903 --> 00:58:04,528
...but they are the gatekeepers.

630
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,740
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

631
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:10,826
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

632
00:58:10,994 --> 00:58:12,203
Someone?

633
00:58:12,537 --> 00:58:13,954
I won't lie to you, Neo.

634
00:58:14,414 --> 00:58:19,251
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

635
00:58:19,503 --> 00:58:21,879
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

636
00:58:22,047 --> 00:58:23,130
Why?

637
00:58:23,381 --> 00:58:25,674
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

638
00:58:25,926 --> 00:58:29,512
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

639
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:34,391
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

640
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:35,768
Because of that...

641
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:39,396
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

642
00:58:43,693 --> 00:58:45,569
What are you telling me?

643
00:58:46,279 --> 00:58:47,738
That I can dodge bullets?

644
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:51,116
No, Neo.

645
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:54,537
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

646
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:56,747
...you won't have to.

647
00:59:00,877 --> 00:59:02,086
<i>We got trouble.</i>

648
00:59:21,022 --> 00:59:23,482
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

649
00:59:26,736 --> 00:59:28,028
Shit.

650
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,156
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

651
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:34,577
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

652
00:59:34,828 --> 00:59:36,036
Search and destroy.

653
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:38,539
Set her down there.

654
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:01,312
How are we doing, Tank?

655
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,196
Power off-line.

656
01:00:11,698 --> 01:00:13,657
EMP armed...

657
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,743
- ...and ready.
- EMP?

658
01:00:16,036 --> 01:00:17,912
Electromagnetic pulse.

659
01:00:18,163 --> 01:00:21,040
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

660
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:23,500
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

661
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:32,426
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

662
01:00:33,678 --> 01:00:34,803
Sewers.

663
01:00:35,013 --> 01:00:37,723
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

664
01:00:38,224 --> 01:00:40,142
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

665
01:00:40,393 --> 01:00:41,727
Quiet.

666
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,769
Whoa! Neo.

667
01:01:25,605 --> 01:01:27,773
You scared the bejesus out of me.

668
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:30,776
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

669
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:34,530
Is that...?

670
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:36,365
The Matrix?

671
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:37,741
Yeah.

672
01:01:39,536 --> 01:01:42,705
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

673
01:01:42,956 --> 01:01:46,041
The image translators work
for the construct program.

674
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:49,712
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

675
01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:52,923
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

676
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:56,593
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

677
01:01:57,762 --> 01:01:59,138
Do you...

678
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:00,514
...want a drink?

679
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:01,807
Sure.

680
01:02:05,353 --> 01:02:06,812
You know...

681
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:09,273
...I know what you're thinking.

682
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:11,608
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

683
01:02:11,943 --> 01:02:15,279
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

684
01:02:17,198 --> 01:02:20,200
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

685
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:34,506
Good shit, huh?

686
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:36,050
Dozer makes it.

687
01:02:36,509 --> 01:02:37,676
It's good for two things:

688
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:41,013
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

689
01:02:42,015 --> 01:02:44,224
So can I ask you something?

690
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:48,854
Did he tell you why he did it?

691
01:02:51,483 --> 01:02:53,317
Why you're here?

692
01:02:56,988 --> 01:02:58,739
Jesus!

693
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:01,867
What a mind job.

694
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:06,080
So you're here to save the world.

695
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:09,666
What do you say
to something like that?

696
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,215
A little piece of advice.

697
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:19,426
You see an agent...

698
01:03:19,761 --> 01:03:22,054
...you do what we do:

699
01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:23,931
Run.

700
01:03:24,265 --> 01:03:26,016
You run your ass off.

701
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:34,983
Thanks for the drink.

702
01:03:39,697 --> 01:03:40,864
Sweet dreams.

703
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:48,288
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

704
01:03:48,957 --> 01:03:50,082
You know...

705
01:03:51,501 --> 01:03:53,961
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

706
01:03:54,963 --> 01:03:57,714
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

707
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:01,051
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

708
01:04:01,344 --> 01:04:02,469
...juicy...

709
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,471
...and delicious.

710
01:04:07,392 --> 01:04:08,642
After nine years...

711
01:04:09,686 --> 01:04:11,228
...you know what I realize?

712
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,279
Ignorance is bliss.

713
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:27,161
Then we have a deal.

714
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:31,582
I don't want to remember nothing.

715
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:34,334
Nothing. You understand?

716
01:04:38,214 --> 01:04:40,215
And I want to be rich.

717
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:44,261
You know, someone important.

718
01:04:45,763 --> 01:04:46,889
Like an actor.

719
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:51,226
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

720
01:04:53,396 --> 01:04:54,938
Okay.

721
01:04:55,315 --> 01:04:57,733
You get my body
back in a power plant...

722
01:04:58,109 --> 01:04:59,860
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

723
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:01,612
...I'll get you what you want.

724
01:05:01,863 --> 01:05:03,864
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

725
01:05:04,115 --> 01:05:06,283
No. I told you, I don't know them.

726
01:05:09,245 --> 01:05:11,246
I can get you the man who does.

727
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:13,790
Morpheus.

728
01:05:23,885 --> 01:05:27,346
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

729
01:05:28,681 --> 01:05:31,475
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

730
01:05:31,684 --> 01:05:33,393
Or a bowl of snot.

731
01:05:33,937 --> 01:05:35,520
You know what it reminds me of?

732
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:39,691
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

733
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:42,027
No, but technically,
neither did you.

734
01:05:42,278 --> 01:05:44,321
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

735
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:45,948
Because you have to wonder...

736
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:49,451
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

737
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:51,119
Maybe they got it wrong.

738
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:54,581
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

739
01:05:54,874 --> 01:05:56,875
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

740
01:05:57,252 --> 01:06:00,087
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

741
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:02,339
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

742
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,633
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

743
01:06:04,884 --> 01:06:06,677
- And maybe they--
- Shut up.

744
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:09,763
It's a single-celled protein...

745
01:06:10,014 --> 01:06:13,058
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

746
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:14,559
Everything the body needs.

747
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:17,688
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

748
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:23,527
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

749
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,613
You know, I wrote that program.

750
01:06:26,906 --> 01:06:28,198
Here it comes.

751
01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:30,409
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

752
01:06:30,785 --> 01:06:33,829
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

753
01:06:34,163 --> 01:06:36,915
She doesn't talk very much...

754
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:41,128
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

755
01:06:41,379 --> 01:06:42,754
The digital pimp hard at work.

756
01:06:43,006 --> 01:06:45,257
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

757
01:06:46,551 --> 01:06:48,385
To deny our own impulses...

758
01:06:48,636 --> 01:06:51,763
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

759
01:06:53,683 --> 01:06:55,058
Dozer, when you're done...

760
01:06:55,268 --> 01:06:56,852
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

761
01:06:57,437 --> 01:06:58,770
We're going in.

762
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,897
I'm taking Neo to see her.

763
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:06,069
See who?

764
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:08,322
The Oracle.

765
01:07:13,828 --> 01:07:15,370
Everyone please observe...

766
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:18,415
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

767
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:22,294
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

768
01:07:46,736 --> 01:07:47,736
We're in.

769
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:04,544
We'll be back in an hour.

770
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:21,311
Unbelievable...

771
01:08:21,562 --> 01:08:22,896
...isn't it?

772
01:08:26,484 --> 01:08:28,318
- God!
- What?

773
01:08:28,986 --> 01:08:30,362
I used to eat there.

774
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:34,241
Really good noodles.

775
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:41,540
I have these memories from my life.

776
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:45,669
None of them happened.

777
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:47,629
What does that mean?

778
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,090
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

779
01:08:51,008 --> 01:08:52,217
But an oracle can?

780
01:08:52,677 --> 01:08:53,885
That's different.

781
01:08:58,599 --> 01:08:59,850
Did you go to her?

782
01:09:01,394 --> 01:09:02,561
Yes.

783
01:09:03,062 --> 01:09:04,438
What did she tell you?

784
01:09:07,692 --> 01:09:09,192
She told me...

785
01:09:10,236 --> 01:09:11,403
What?

786
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:16,533
We're here.

787
01:09:16,909 --> 01:09:19,202
Neo, come with me.

788
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:41,600
So is this the same oracle
that made...

789
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:43,018
...the prophecy?

790
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:47,606
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

791
01:09:48,065 --> 01:09:50,066
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

792
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,696
And she knows what? Everything?

793
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:58,658
She would say she knows enough.

794
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:01,578
And she's never wrong.

795
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:06,958
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

796
01:10:07,293 --> 01:10:08,877
She is a guide, Neo.

797
01:10:09,253 --> 01:10:11,129
She can help you to find the path.

798
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:12,881
She helped you?

799
01:10:13,591 --> 01:10:14,633
Yes.

800
01:10:15,384 --> 01:10:16,718
What did she tell you?

801
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,389
That I would find the One.

802
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:36,655
I told you I can only
show you the door.

803
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:39,449
You have to walk through it.

804
01:10:43,246 --> 01:10:44,329
Hello, Neo.

805
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,248
You're right on time.

806
01:10:54,173 --> 01:10:57,968
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

807
01:11:03,641 --> 01:11:05,225
These are the other Potentials.

808
01:11:05,476 --> 01:11:07,018
You can wait here.

809
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:50,395
Do not try and bend the spoon.

810
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:52,897
That's impossible.

811
01:11:53,733 --> 01:11:57,736
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

812
01:11:58,279 --> 01:11:59,654
What truth?

813
01:11:59,905 --> 01:12:01,573
There is no spoon.

814
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,493
There is no spoon?

815
01:12:05,745 --> 01:12:10,206
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

816
01:12:26,265 --> 01:12:27,724
The Oracle will you see now.

817
01:12:38,444 --> 01:12:39,986
I know you're Neo.

818
01:12:40,613 --> 01:12:41,780
Be right with you.

819
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:45,200
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

820
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:50,789
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

821
01:12:51,832 --> 01:12:54,000
Almost done.

822
01:12:56,504 --> 01:12:58,129
Smell good, don't they?

823
01:12:59,382 --> 01:13:00,632
Yeah.

824
01:13:00,883 --> 01:13:02,717
I'd ask you to sit down...

825
01:13:02,968 --> 01:13:05,345
...but you're not going to anyway.

826
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:08,723
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

827
01:13:11,852 --> 01:13:13,019
That vase.

828
01:13:13,979 --> 01:13:15,021
I'm sorry.

829
01:13:15,272 --> 01:13:17,148
I said, don't worry about it.

830
01:13:18,317 --> 01:13:20,276
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

831
01:13:20,903 --> 01:13:22,112
How did you know?

832
01:13:24,156 --> 01:13:27,951
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

833
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:31,246
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

834
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:37,961
You're cuter than I thought.

835
01:13:41,006 --> 01:13:43,258
I can see why she likes you.

836
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:45,218
Who?

837
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:47,303
Not too bright, though.

838
01:13:50,599 --> 01:13:53,685
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

839
01:13:55,813 --> 01:13:56,980
So...

840
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,315
...what do you think?

841
01:14:01,152 --> 01:14:02,902
Do you think you are the One?

842
01:14:04,864 --> 01:14:05,905
I don't know.

843
01:14:09,326 --> 01:14:10,744
You know what that means?

844
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:12,746
It's Latin.

845
01:14:13,122 --> 01:14:15,331
Means, "Know thyself."

846
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:18,752
I'll let you in on a little secret.

847
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:24,841
Being the One is just
like being in love.

848
01:14:25,551 --> 01:14:28,428
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

849
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:29,804
...through and through.

850
01:14:30,139 --> 01:14:32,182
Balls to bones.

851
01:14:34,518 --> 01:14:35,560
Well...

852
01:14:37,521 --> 01:14:39,606
...I'd better have a look at you.

853
01:14:40,941 --> 01:14:42,442
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

854
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:58,500
Okay...

855
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:04,088
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

856
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:05,715
Then you say:

857
01:15:06,383 --> 01:15:07,592
But what?

858
01:15:07,843 --> 01:15:11,805
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

859
01:15:13,224 --> 01:15:16,184
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

860
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,813
You got the gift...

861
01:15:20,731 --> 01:15:23,024
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

862
01:15:27,696 --> 01:15:28,738
What?

863
01:15:28,989 --> 01:15:31,866
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

864
01:15:32,451 --> 01:15:34,702
That's the way these things go.

865
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:38,164
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

866
01:15:41,627 --> 01:15:43,336
He almost had me convinced.

867
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:44,712
I know.

868
01:15:46,257 --> 01:15:48,383
Poor Morpheus.

869
01:15:50,761 --> 01:15:53,888
Without him, we're lost.

870
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:57,600
What do you mean, "without him"?

871
01:16:01,605 --> 01:16:03,523
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

872
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:08,486
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

873
01:16:10,197 --> 01:16:12,365
And no one, not you, not even me...

874
01:16:12,616 --> 01:16:14,868
...can convince him otherwise.

875
01:16:15,244 --> 01:16:17,620
He believes it so blindly...

876
01:16:17,913 --> 01:16:22,250
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

877
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:23,626
What?

878
01:16:23,794 --> 01:16:26,462
You're going to
have to make a choice.

879
01:16:27,089 --> 01:16:30,675
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

880
01:16:31,176 --> 01:16:34,053
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

881
01:16:35,472 --> 01:16:37,765
One of you is going to die.

882
01:16:39,852 --> 01:16:43,146
Which one will be up to you.

883
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:46,441
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

884
01:16:46,692 --> 01:16:48,359
You have a good soul.

885
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:52,155
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

886
01:16:55,284 --> 01:16:56,743
Don't worry about it.

887
01:16:56,994 --> 01:16:59,412
As soon as you
step outside that door...

888
01:16:59,663 --> 01:17:01,789
...you'll start feeling better.

889
01:17:02,499 --> 01:17:06,294
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

890
01:17:07,129 --> 01:17:09,881
You're in control of your own life.

891
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:12,008
Remember?

892
01:17:13,677 --> 01:17:14,886
Here...

893
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:18,306
...take a cookie.

894
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:22,185
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

895
01:17:23,145 --> 01:17:25,521
...you'll feel right as rain.

896
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,074
What was said...

897
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,159
...was for you...

898
01:17:38,702 --> 01:17:40,536
...and for you alone.

899
01:18:03,477 --> 01:18:04,560
They're on the way.

900
01:18:34,383 --> 01:18:35,425
What is that?

901
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,607
Oh, déjà vu.

902
01:18:55,112 --> 01:18:56,195
What did you just say?

903
01:18:56,447 --> 01:18:57,947
Nothing.
Just déjà vu.

904
01:18:58,198 --> 01:18:59,824
- What did you see?
- What happened?

905
01:19:01,243 --> 01:19:03,411
A black cat went past us...

906
01:19:03,662 --> 01:19:05,288
...then another just like it.

907
01:19:05,539 --> 01:19:07,081
Was it the same cat?

908
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:10,877
- I'm not sure.
- Switch, Apoc.

909
01:19:14,965 --> 01:19:16,174
What is it?

910
01:19:16,425 --> 01:19:20,845
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.

911
01:19:23,807 --> 01:19:25,058
Oh, my God.

912
01:19:26,852 --> 01:19:27,852
Let's go.

913
01:19:33,108 --> 01:19:34,901
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

914
01:19:40,365 --> 01:19:41,616
Oh, no.

915
01:20:21,907 --> 01:20:24,367
- That's what they changed.
- We're trapped.

916
01:20:24,618 --> 01:20:26,494
Be calm. Give me your phone.

917
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:28,287
They'll be able to track it.

918
01:20:28,539 --> 01:20:29,956
We have no choice.

919
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:32,583
Operator.

920
01:20:32,918 --> 01:20:35,753
<i>Find a structural drawing of</i>
<i>this building. Find it fast.</i>

921
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:46,180
- Got it!
<i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>

922
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:50,268
Eighth floor.

923
01:20:50,477 --> 01:20:52,061
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

924
01:20:52,354 --> 01:20:53,813
Switch, straight ahead.

925
01:20:54,565 --> 01:20:55,731
Neo...

926
01:21:01,864 --> 01:21:03,990
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

927
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:13,791
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

928
01:21:14,084 --> 01:21:15,126
Good.

929
01:21:24,845 --> 01:21:26,137
Where are they?

930
01:22:26,573 --> 01:22:27,740
They're in the walls.

931
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:30,368
In the walls!

932
01:22:51,765 --> 01:22:53,432
It's an agent!

933
01:23:00,732 --> 01:23:02,066
Morpheus!

934
01:23:02,234 --> 01:23:03,484
You must get Neo out!

935
01:23:03,735 --> 01:23:05,569
He's all that matters!

936
01:23:05,862 --> 01:23:08,072
- No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

937
01:23:09,032 --> 01:23:10,366
Go!

938
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,541
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

939
01:23:42,858 --> 01:23:44,650
Cypher, come on!

940
01:23:49,573 --> 01:23:53,409
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

941
01:23:53,952 --> 01:23:55,077
And you are?

942
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:57,079
A Smith.

943
01:23:57,331 --> 01:23:58,622
Agent Smith.

944
01:23:59,207 --> 01:24:01,250
You all look the same to me.

945
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:58,182
Take him.

946
01:25:04,815 --> 01:25:06,273
No!

947
01:25:11,405 --> 01:25:13,239
- Operator.
<i>- I need an exit, fast.</i>

948
01:25:15,325 --> 01:25:18,244
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

949
01:25:18,578 --> 01:25:20,371
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

950
01:25:20,622 --> 01:25:21,997
Somebody up there still likes me.

951
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:23,499
I got you.

952
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,918
<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>

953
01:25:26,169 --> 01:25:28,838
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

954
01:25:29,089 --> 01:25:30,131
Right.

955
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,844
- Operator.
<i>- Tank, it's me.</i>

956
01:25:35,095 --> 01:25:36,262
Is Morpheus alive?

957
01:25:36,638 --> 01:25:37,930
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

958
01:25:38,348 --> 01:25:40,266
<i>Yes. They're moving him.</i>
<i>I don't know where.</i>

959
01:25:40,475 --> 01:25:42,768
He's alive. We need an exit.

960
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:44,103
You're not far from Cypher.

961
01:25:44,271 --> 01:25:45,521
<i>- Cypher?</i>
- I know.

962
01:25:45,772 --> 01:25:47,857
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i>
- Got it.

963
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,159
Got him.

964
01:26:09,087 --> 01:26:10,129
Where are they?

965
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,630
Making the call.

966
01:26:12,299 --> 01:26:13,466
Good.

967
01:26:26,605 --> 01:26:27,855
You first.

968
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:32,276
Shit!

969
01:26:35,572 --> 01:26:37,239
Tank!

970
01:26:37,407 --> 01:26:39,033
No!

971
01:26:40,952 --> 01:26:43,120
I don't know. It just went dead.

972
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:11,148
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

973
01:27:11,566 --> 01:27:12,900
Cypher? Where's Tank?

974
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:19,532
You know...

975
01:27:21,243 --> 01:27:23,369
...for a long time...

976
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:27,456
...I thought I was in love with you.

977
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,292
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

978
01:27:31,378 --> 01:27:34,088
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

979
01:27:34,339 --> 01:27:36,715
<i>Too bad things had to</i>
<i>turn out this way.</i>

980
01:27:37,259 --> 01:27:38,300
You killed them.

981
01:27:38,802 --> 01:27:40,302
- What?
- Oh, God.

982
01:27:40,554 --> 01:27:41,971
I'm tired, Trinity.

983
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,266
I'm tired of this war...

984
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:48,394
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

985
01:27:48,728 --> 01:27:53,357
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

986
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:56,694
But most of all...

987
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:00,656
<i>...I'm tired of that jackoff</i>
<i>and all of his bullshit.</i>

988
01:28:01,783 --> 01:28:03,075
Surprise, asshole!

989
01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:05,828
I bet you never saw this coming...

990
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:07,121
...did you?

991
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:11,792
God, I wish I could be there...

992
01:28:12,377 --> 01:28:13,877
...when they break you.

993
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:18,090
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

994
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,509
...so right then...

995
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,094
...you'd know it was me.

996
01:28:22,596 --> 01:28:23,762
You gave them Morpheus.

997
01:28:24,014 --> 01:28:25,472
<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

998
01:28:26,057 --> 01:28:27,558
He tricked us!

999
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:30,102
If you had told us the truth...

1000
01:28:30,353 --> 01:28:33,230
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1001
01:28:33,481 --> 01:28:35,608
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1002
01:28:35,859 --> 01:28:38,736
"Free." You call this free?

1003
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:43,657
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1004
01:28:45,243 --> 01:28:48,162
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1005
01:28:49,331 --> 01:28:50,539
...I choose the Matrix.

1006
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:52,458
The Matrix isn't real.

1007
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:54,126
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1008
01:28:54,377 --> 01:28:56,629
I think the Matrix...

1009
01:28:56,963 --> 01:28:59,548
...can be more real than this world.

1010
01:29:01,718 --> 01:29:04,219
All I do is pull the plug here.

1011
01:29:04,596 --> 01:29:05,804
But there...

1012
01:29:06,348 --> 01:29:08,641
<i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1013
01:29:09,643 --> 01:29:10,893
Trinity.

1014
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:19,360
<i>- Welcome to the real world.</i>
- But you're out, Cypher.

1015
01:29:19,611 --> 01:29:22,029
<i>- You can't go back.</i>
- That's what you think.

1016
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,781
<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>

1017
01:29:24,032 --> 01:29:27,660
<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,</i>
<i>I won't remember a thing.</i>

1018
01:29:27,869 --> 01:29:28,911
By the way...

1019
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:32,122
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1020
01:29:32,624 --> 01:29:33,707
<i>...say it now.</i>

1021
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:37,002
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1022
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:40,339
Not like this.

1023
01:29:44,803 --> 01:29:45,844
Too late.

1024
01:29:46,596 --> 01:29:47,888
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1025
01:29:48,139 --> 01:29:50,015
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1026
01:29:50,392 --> 01:29:52,267
I'm just a messenger.

1027
01:29:52,686 --> 01:29:55,854
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1028
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,607
If Morpheus was right...

1029
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:01,026
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1030
01:30:01,611 --> 01:30:03,112
<i>If Neo's the One...</i>

1031
01:30:03,613 --> 01:30:05,447
<i>...then there'd have to be...</i>

1032
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:08,283
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1033
01:30:08,451 --> 01:30:09,660
Right?

1034
01:30:10,286 --> 01:30:12,371
I mean, how can he be the One...

1035
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:13,622
...if he's dead?

1036
01:30:14,999 --> 01:30:17,251
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1037
01:30:17,544 --> 01:30:19,878
<i>...if you bought into</i>
<i>Morpheus' bullshit.</i>

1038
01:30:20,255 --> 01:30:23,465
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1039
01:30:24,843 --> 01:30:27,177
Look into his eyes...

1040
01:30:27,929 --> 01:30:29,430
<i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1041
01:30:32,183 --> 01:30:33,517
...and tell me...

1042
01:30:34,227 --> 01:30:35,477
<i>...yes...</i>

1043
01:30:35,812 --> 01:30:37,187
<i>...or no.</i>

1044
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:40,023
- Yes.
<i>- No!</i>

1045
01:30:40,191 --> 01:30:41,358
I don't believe it.

1046
01:30:42,777 --> 01:30:47,531
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1047
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,176
You first.

1048
01:31:15,393 --> 01:31:17,686
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1049
01:31:20,482 --> 01:31:21,648
Dozer?

1050
01:31:39,918 --> 01:31:42,294
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1051
01:31:43,171 --> 01:31:46,298
Marveled at its beauty...

1052
01:31:46,674 --> 01:31:48,926
...its genius?

1053
01:31:50,094 --> 01:31:51,970
Billions of people...

1054
01:31:52,222 --> 01:31:54,973
...just living out their lives.

1055
01:31:56,017 --> 01:31:57,684
Oblivious.

1056
01:32:02,273 --> 01:32:05,150
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1057
01:32:05,401 --> 01:32:10,072
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1058
01:32:10,573 --> 01:32:13,492
...where everyone would be happy.

1059
01:32:14,035 --> 01:32:15,536
It was a disaster.

1060
01:32:15,787 --> 01:32:20,123
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1061
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,751
Some believe that...

1062
01:32:23,002 --> 01:32:27,381
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1063
01:32:27,632 --> 01:32:29,174
But I believe that...

1064
01:32:29,342 --> 01:32:30,509
...as a species...

1065
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,596
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1066
01:32:34,848 --> 01:32:36,223
...and suffering.

1067
01:32:36,474 --> 01:32:39,184
So the perfect world was a dream...

1068
01:32:39,435 --> 01:32:44,273
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1069
01:32:45,608 --> 01:32:49,278
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1070
01:32:49,737 --> 01:32:51,238
The peak...

1071
01:32:51,489 --> 01:32:52,906
...of your civilization.

1072
01:32:53,157 --> 01:32:55,409
I say, "your civilization"...

1073
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:59,788
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1074
01:33:00,039 --> 01:33:03,125
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1075
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:07,045
Evolution, Morpheus.

1076
01:33:07,338 --> 01:33:08,672
Evolution.

1077
01:33:10,967 --> 01:33:12,843
Like the dinosaur.

1078
01:33:15,013 --> 01:33:16,638
Look out that window.

1079
01:33:17,348 --> 01:33:19,474
You had your time.

1080
01:33:20,184 --> 01:33:24,104
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1081
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:26,815
The future is our time.

1082
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:32,237
There could be a problem.

1083
01:33:33,156 --> 01:33:36,533
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1084
01:33:36,784 --> 01:33:38,952
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1085
01:33:39,203 --> 01:33:40,412
How much time?

1086
01:33:40,663 --> 01:33:43,790
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1087
01:33:44,042 --> 01:33:48,462
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1088
01:33:48,713 --> 01:33:51,673
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1089
01:33:51,925 --> 01:33:52,966
What do they want?

1090
01:33:53,217 --> 01:33:57,262
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1091
01:33:57,513 --> 01:34:00,432
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1092
01:34:00,683 --> 01:34:03,769
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1093
01:34:03,937 --> 01:34:06,188
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1094
01:34:06,356 --> 01:34:07,522
...or you...

1095
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:08,982
...or even Morpheus.

1096
01:34:12,779 --> 01:34:14,446
There has to be
something we can do.

1097
01:34:14,864 --> 01:34:16,865
There is. We pull the plug.

1098
01:34:19,953 --> 01:34:21,703
You're going to kill him?

1099
01:34:21,955 --> 01:34:23,121
Kill Morpheus?

1100
01:34:23,748 --> 01:34:25,374
We don't have a choice.

1101
01:34:32,173 --> 01:34:35,092
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1102
01:34:35,343 --> 01:34:37,094
If the insider has failed...

1103
01:34:37,345 --> 01:34:40,555
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--

1104
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:42,516
They're dead. In either case--

1105
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:46,311
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1106
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:47,646
Immediately.

1107
01:34:52,902 --> 01:34:55,570
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1108
01:34:56,531 --> 01:34:58,740
You were a father.

1109
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:02,244
We'll miss you always.

1110
01:35:09,127 --> 01:35:10,335
Stop!

1111
01:35:11,504 --> 01:35:12,838
I don't believe this is happening.

1112
01:35:13,006 --> 01:35:15,048
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1113
01:35:15,842 --> 01:35:17,217
I don't know.

1114
01:35:17,552 --> 01:35:20,012
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1115
01:35:20,221 --> 01:35:21,471
The Oracle.

1116
01:35:21,723 --> 01:35:23,515
She told me this would happen.

1117
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:28,103
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1118
01:35:28,563 --> 01:35:29,771
What choice?

1119
01:35:32,775 --> 01:35:35,277
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1120
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:37,946
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1121
01:35:38,156 --> 01:35:41,783
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1122
01:35:42,035 --> 01:35:43,952
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1123
01:35:44,537 --> 01:35:47,789
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1124
01:35:49,292 --> 01:35:50,333
What?

1125
01:35:51,044 --> 01:35:52,669
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1126
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:56,006
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1127
01:35:56,257 --> 01:35:58,925
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1128
01:35:59,594 --> 01:36:00,844
No, Neo, that's not true.

1129
01:36:01,429 --> 01:36:04,056
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1130
01:36:08,478 --> 01:36:11,813
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1131
01:36:12,065 --> 01:36:16,443
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1132
01:36:17,737 --> 01:36:21,656
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1133
01:36:21,908 --> 01:36:23,492
That's what it looks like...

1134
01:36:23,659 --> 01:36:24,701
...but it's not.

1135
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:27,329
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1136
01:36:28,414 --> 01:36:32,125
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1137
01:36:32,376 --> 01:36:35,378
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1138
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:38,173
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1139
01:36:38,341 --> 01:36:39,966
What?

1140
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:42,385
I believe I can bring him back.

1141
01:36:59,362 --> 01:37:01,279
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1142
01:37:01,572 --> 01:37:03,573
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1143
01:37:04,742 --> 01:37:06,868
Let me tell you what I believe.

1144
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:09,746
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1145
01:37:10,081 --> 01:37:14,376
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1146
01:37:14,627 --> 01:37:16,670
And since I am the ranking officer...

1147
01:37:16,921 --> 01:37:19,798
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1148
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:22,968
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1149
01:37:23,386 --> 01:37:24,928
Tank...

1150
01:37:25,096 --> 01:37:26,221
...Ioad us up.

1151
01:37:35,857 --> 01:37:39,151
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1152
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:41,111
...during my time here.

1153
01:37:41,362 --> 01:37:45,365
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1154
01:37:45,616 --> 01:37:47,868
...and I realized...

1155
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:50,412
...that you're not actually mammals.

1156
01:37:52,623 --> 01:37:55,083
Every mammal on this planet...

1157
01:37:55,418 --> 01:38:00,338
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1158
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:02,424
But you humans do not.

1159
01:38:02,967 --> 01:38:06,511
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1160
01:38:06,762 --> 01:38:11,266
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1161
01:38:11,601 --> 01:38:13,685
The only way you can survive...

1162
01:38:13,978 --> 01:38:16,938
...is to spread to another area.

1163
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:25,238
There is another organism
on this planet...

1164
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:27,449
...that follows the same pattern.

1165
01:38:28,075 --> 01:38:29,743
Do you know what it is?

1166
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:31,953
A virus.

1167
01:38:33,289 --> 01:38:36,333
Human beings are a disease.

1168
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:38,251
A cancer of this planet.

1169
01:38:38,502 --> 01:38:40,629
You are a plague.

1170
01:38:41,172 --> 01:38:42,589
And we...

1171
01:38:42,757 --> 01:38:44,132
...are the cure.

1172
01:38:45,134 --> 01:38:46,551
Okay, so what do you need?

1173
01:38:47,178 --> 01:38:48,303
Besides a miracle.

1174
01:38:48,888 --> 01:38:50,096
Guns.

1175
01:38:50,932 --> 01:38:52,140
Lots of guns.

1176
01:39:02,026 --> 01:39:03,235
Neo...

1177
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:07,530
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1178
01:39:08,741 --> 01:39:10,659
That's why it's going to work.

1179
01:39:14,747 --> 01:39:16,665
Why isn't the serum working?

1180
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:19,584
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1181
01:39:21,671 --> 01:39:22,921
Leave me with him.

1182
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:26,633
Now.

1183
01:39:37,853 --> 01:39:39,437
Hold on, Morpheus.

1184
01:39:39,689 --> 01:39:42,399
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1185
01:39:44,777 --> 01:39:46,903
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1186
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:49,823
I'm going to be honest...

1187
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:51,408
...with you.

1188
01:39:55,788 --> 01:39:57,205
I...

1189
01:39:58,082 --> 01:39:59,207
...hate...

1190
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:01,418
...this place...

1191
01:40:01,752 --> 01:40:04,045
...this zoo...

1192
01:40:04,297 --> 01:40:05,422
...this prison...

1193
01:40:05,673 --> 01:40:08,842
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1194
01:40:09,093 --> 01:40:11,386
I can't stand it any longer.

1195
01:40:12,138 --> 01:40:14,014
It's the smell.

1196
01:40:15,391 --> 01:40:17,267
If there is such a thing.

1197
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:20,895
I feel saturated by it.

1198
01:40:22,398 --> 01:40:23,690
I can...

1199
01:40:23,941 --> 01:40:25,483
...taste...

1200
01:40:25,651 --> 01:40:27,694
...your stink.

1201
01:40:27,945 --> 01:40:31,573
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1202
01:40:31,741 --> 01:40:32,741
It's repulsive.

1203
01:40:33,743 --> 01:40:35,118
Isn't it?

1204
01:40:37,288 --> 01:40:39,581
I must get out of here.

1205
01:40:39,999 --> 01:40:42,208
I must get free.

1206
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:45,337
And in this mind is the key.

1207
01:40:45,588 --> 01:40:47,255
My key.

1208
01:40:47,506 --> 01:40:50,383
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1209
01:40:50,634 --> 01:40:52,260
Do you understand?

1210
01:40:52,553 --> 01:40:53,928
I need the codes.

1211
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:56,514
I have to get inside Zion...

1212
01:40:56,849 --> 01:40:59,351
...and you have to tell me how.

1213
01:40:59,769 --> 01:41:01,644
You're going to tell me...

1214
01:41:01,896 --> 01:41:04,064
...or you're going to die.

1215
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:27,379
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1216
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,342
Holy shit!

1217
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:47,148
Backup. Send backup.

1218
01:42:10,965 --> 01:42:12,090
Freeze!

1219
01:44:26,934 --> 01:44:28,142
What were you doing?

1220
01:44:29,979 --> 01:44:31,271
He doesn't know.

1221
01:44:31,522 --> 01:44:33,022
Know what?

1222
01:45:01,093 --> 01:45:03,595
I think they're trying to save him.

1223
01:45:18,444 --> 01:45:20,194
There is no spoon.

1224
01:45:49,808 --> 01:45:51,976
Find them and destroy them!

1225
01:45:53,604 --> 01:45:55,438
We're under attack!

1226
01:46:27,554 --> 01:46:28,721
Trinity!

1227
01:46:29,223 --> 01:46:30,306
Help!

1228
01:46:52,329 --> 01:46:53,538
Only human.

1229
01:46:54,498 --> 01:46:55,581
Dodge this.

1230
01:47:08,804 --> 01:47:10,304
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1231
01:47:10,723 --> 01:47:14,642
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1232
01:47:15,769 --> 01:47:17,145
It wasn't fast enough.

1233
01:47:19,898 --> 01:47:21,190
Can you fly that thing?

1234
01:47:22,317 --> 01:47:23,317
Not yet.

1235
01:47:26,613 --> 01:47:27,655
Operator.

1236
01:47:27,865 --> 01:47:31,033
<i>I need a pilot program</i>
<i>for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1237
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:32,785
<i>Hurry.</i>

1238
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:42,336
Let's go.

1239
01:47:57,436 --> 01:47:58,519
No.

1240
01:48:50,113 --> 01:48:52,740
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1241
01:49:30,779 --> 01:49:31,821
He's not going to make it.

1242
01:49:41,623 --> 01:49:42,665
Got you.

1243
01:50:48,732 --> 01:50:49,899
Trinity!

1244
01:51:31,566 --> 01:51:32,984
I knew it.

1245
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:34,819
He's the One.

1246
01:51:50,794 --> 01:51:53,004
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1247
01:51:55,882 --> 01:51:57,049
Morpheus...

1248
01:51:58,719 --> 01:51:59,802
The Oracle.

1249
01:52:01,054 --> 01:52:03,431
- She told me--
- She told you...

1250
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:05,391
...what you needed to hear.

1251
01:52:05,684 --> 01:52:07,018
That's all.

1252
01:52:08,061 --> 01:52:11,022
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1253
01:52:11,356 --> 01:52:13,649
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1254
01:52:14,401 --> 01:52:15,693
...and walking the path.

1255
01:52:18,739 --> 01:52:19,947
- Operator.
<i>- Tank.</i>

1256
01:52:20,866 --> 01:52:23,409
- It's good to hear your voice.
<i>- We need an exit.</i>

1257
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:26,454
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1258
01:52:39,509 --> 01:52:41,927
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1259
01:52:42,179 --> 01:52:45,765
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1260
01:52:47,476 --> 01:52:48,976
Order the strike.

1261
01:52:55,525 --> 01:52:57,526
They're not out yet.

1262
01:53:08,705 --> 01:53:10,039
You first, Morpheus.

1263
01:53:30,727 --> 01:53:33,020
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1264
01:53:36,274 --> 01:53:40,236
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1265
01:53:43,824 --> 01:53:47,118
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1266
01:53:49,871 --> 01:53:51,413
Everything but this.

1267
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:53,958
But what?

1268
01:54:18,859 --> 01:54:20,025
Neo!

1269
01:54:20,277 --> 01:54:21,902
- What happened?
- An agent.

1270
01:54:22,154 --> 01:54:24,071
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1271
01:54:26,116 --> 01:54:28,075
Mr. Anderson.

1272
01:54:30,287 --> 01:54:31,662
Run, Neo. Run.

1273
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,586
What is he doing?

1274
01:54:38,837 --> 01:54:40,087
He's beginning to believe.

1275
01:55:07,073 --> 01:55:08,449
You're empty.

1276
01:55:09,034 --> 01:55:10,326
So are you.

1277
01:55:43,485 --> 01:55:46,487
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1278
01:55:47,614 --> 01:55:48,656
...Mr. Anderson.

1279
01:56:29,614 --> 01:56:31,699
Jesus, he's killing him.

1280
01:57:57,869 --> 01:57:59,995
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1281
01:58:00,747 --> 01:58:03,749
That is the sound of inevitability.

1282
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:09,671
It is the sound of your death.

1283
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:12,925
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1284
01:58:13,176 --> 01:58:14,802
My name...

1285
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:19,848
...is Neo.

1286
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:54,299
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1287
01:58:56,803 --> 01:58:57,845
Oh, shit.

1288
01:59:10,233 --> 01:59:11,692
Sentinels.

1289
01:59:12,444 --> 01:59:14,695
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1290
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:18,907
Tank, charge the EMP.

1291
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:22,202
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1292
01:59:23,371 --> 01:59:24,455
He's gonna make it.

1293
01:59:24,706 --> 01:59:26,582
Flat or pumps? No, just--

1294
01:59:26,833 --> 01:59:29,710
What the shit? That's my phone!

1295
01:59:30,128 --> 01:59:31,712
That guy took my phone!

1296
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:36,383
Got him!
He's on the run.

1297
01:59:36,634 --> 01:59:39,303
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1298
01:59:39,554 --> 01:59:41,430
<i>I got an old exit.</i>
<i>Wabash and Lake.</i>

1299
01:59:45,393 --> 01:59:46,393
Oh, shit!

1300
02:00:07,957 --> 02:00:09,958
Help! Need a little help!

1301
02:00:11,586 --> 02:00:12,794
<i>The door.</i>

1302
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:30,270
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1303
02:00:31,189 --> 02:00:32,439
<i>Your other left!</i>

1304
02:00:39,155 --> 02:00:40,405
<i>The back door.</i>

1305
02:01:01,177 --> 02:01:02,302
Oh, no.

1306
02:01:03,972 --> 02:01:05,472
Here they come.

1307
02:01:34,252 --> 02:01:35,502
He's going to make it.

1308
02:01:45,722 --> 02:01:48,849
<i>The fire escape at the end</i>
<i>of the alley, room 303.</i>

1309
02:02:23,968 --> 02:02:25,052
They're inside.

1310
02:02:27,388 --> 02:02:28,430
Hurry, Neo.

1311
02:03:24,654 --> 02:03:25,779
It can't be.

1312
02:03:33,579 --> 02:03:34,955
Check him.

1313
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,502
He's gone.

1314
02:03:47,218 --> 02:03:49,636
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1315
02:03:57,228 --> 02:03:58,270
Neo...

1316
02:03:59,731 --> 02:04:01,690
I'm not afraid anymore.

1317
02:04:03,317 --> 02:04:04,651
The Oracle told me...

1318
02:04:04,819 --> 02:04:10,240
...I'd fall in love, and that
the man I loved would be the One.

1319
02:04:13,369 --> 02:04:15,328
So you see...

1320
02:04:16,038 --> 02:04:18,039
...you can't be dead.

1321
02:04:19,625 --> 02:04:21,460
You can't be...

1322
02:04:23,004 --> 02:04:25,172
...because I love you.

1323
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,717
You hear me?

1324
02:04:29,844 --> 02:04:31,511
I love you.

1325
02:04:55,244 --> 02:04:56,536
Now, get up.

1326
02:05:05,213 --> 02:05:06,379
No.

1327
02:05:33,115 --> 02:05:34,157
How?

1328
02:05:35,034 --> 02:05:36,076
He is the One.

1329
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:04,289
Neo!

1330
02:08:00,554 --> 02:08:02,263
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1331
02:08:02,515 --> 02:08:04,349
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1332
02:08:04,767 --> 02:08:08,395
<i>I know that you're afraid.</i>
<i>You're afraid of us.</i>

1333
02:08:08,729 --> 02:08:10,563
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1334
02:08:12,024 --> 02:08:13,358
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

1335
02:08:13,526 --> 02:08:16,111
<i>I didn't come here to tell you</i>
<i>how this is going to end.</i>

1336
02:08:16,362 --> 02:08:19,322
<i>I came here to tell you</i>
<i>how it's going to begin.</i>

1337
02:08:20,282 --> 02:08:21,866
<i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>

1338
02:08:22,118 --> 02:08:25,203
<i>And then I'll show these people</i>
<i>what you don't want them to see.</i>

1339
02:08:25,454 --> 02:08:27,330
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1340
02:08:27,581 --> 02:08:29,332
<i>...without you.</i>

1341
02:08:29,625 --> 02:08:33,253
<i>A world without rules and controls,</i>
<i>without borders or boundaries.</i>

1342
02:08:33,504 --> 02:08:37,215
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1343
02:08:39,844 --> 02:08:41,177
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1344
02:08:41,429 --> 02:08:43,388
<i>...is a choice I leave to you.</i>
