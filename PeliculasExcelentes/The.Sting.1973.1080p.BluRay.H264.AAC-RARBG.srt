1
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,809
Let's see what you got.

2
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,169
I need more runners.

3
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:39,687
I can't write the
business fast enough.

4
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,421
You've got to see Granger.

5
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,888
8720. Yeah.

6
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,534
Yeah. Hold it a minute.
Beat it, Mottola!

7
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,894
Mr. Granger?
Chicago's on the line.

8
00:02:59,273 --> 00:03:00,374
Yeah.

9
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,500
Granger, this is Combs.

10
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:03,753
Why haven't we heard from you?
Everybody else is in.

11
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:05,880
We had problems with
the law this morning.

12
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:08,215
The mayor promised to get tough
on the rackets again,

13
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,077
so he shut everybody down for a
couple of hours to make it look good.

14
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,246
It's nothing serious.
It just put us a little behind.

15
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,930
You been making your payoffs,
haven't you?

16
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,974
Oh, hell, yes!
He does this every year.

17
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,284
There's nothing
to worry about.

18
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:20,227
<i>Okay, finish your count
and get it up here.</i>

19
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:22,128
<i>I don't want to
be here all night.</i>

20
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,523
Yeah, well, believe me,
the man's gonna be real happy.

21
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,734
Looks like we cleared over
$10,000 this week.

22
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,444
<i>We cleared $22,000 here.</i>

23
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,946
Oh, what the hell, you got
the whole Chicago South Side.

24
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,908
How do you expect the eight lousy
spots I got to compete with that?

25
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:38,245
They did $14,000 in Evanston,
$16,500 in Gary and $20,000 in Cicero.

26
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,247
Looks like you're bringing
up the rear, Granger.

27
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:41,832
Well, I just got the count.

28
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,417
I'll put the take on the 4:15.

29
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:44,776
We'll be waiting.

30
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:49,239
Mottola!

31
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:54,994
Take this up to Chicago
on the 4:15.

32
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:58,123
They'll be waiting for it
at the clearinghouse.

33
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,709
And don't stop
for any entertainment.

34
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,711
You can get a cab over on 7th.

35
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:04,879
Ah, cut it out!

36
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:07,899
8720.

37
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,188
Hey, you there! Stop!

38
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:23,833
Hey, you!
Stop that man!

39
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,942
Stop him! Stop him!
He's got my wallet!

40
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:28,170
Stop him! Stop that man!

41
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:29,880
He's got all of my money!

42
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:32,157
Stop him!

43
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:37,078
Goddamn nigger-lover!

44
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:42,125
I'm gonna get you someday
for this! Sucker egg!

45
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:44,478
Don't let him get away!
He's got my wallet!

46
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:46,087
He's got all my money!

47
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,505
My wallet!
He's got my wallet!

48
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:49,108
We got the wallet.
We got it!

49
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,484
- What happened?
- Give it to me, please.

50
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:51,610
Did he get you with the knife?

51
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:54,029
You sit tight, old man.
You need a doctor. I'll call a cop.

52
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,930
No, no! No. No cops!

53
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,411
You wanted by the law
or something?

54
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:01,728
No, it's okay.

55
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:04,999
Are you nuts, carrying
a wad around like that

56
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,059
in a neighborhood like this?
No wonder you got hit.

57
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:08,711
Thanks.
I'm obliged to you.

58
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,111
I've got to get going.

59
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,399
You ain't going nowhere on this leg.
Let me see.

60
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:17,511
I gotta. Got to run some slots
down in West Bend for a mob here.

61
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,472
I got a little behind
in the payoffs.

62
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:21,682
So, they think I've been
holding out on 'em.

63
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:24,518
They gave me until 4:00
to come up with the cash.

64
00:05:24,543 --> 00:05:26,687
If they don't
get it, I'm dead.

65
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,981
It don't look good, Gramps.
It's almost 4:00 now.

66
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:32,383
I'll give you and your friend
$100 to deliver it for me.

67
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,055
I don't know.

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,823
That mug that hit you
is mad enough at me.

69
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:40,242
What if he's around the corner
waiting with some friends?

70
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,851
He won't know
you're carrying it.

71
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,646
Come on. You've got to
help me out.

72
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:46,165
Hey, I'm sorry, pal. I'm gonna
maybe help you get fixed up,

73
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,208
get to a doctor,

74
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,376
but I ain't about to walk
into no knife for you.

75
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:52,379
How about you? All you got to
do is put it in the door slot.

76
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:53,672
I'll give you the whole $100.

77
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:56,091
What makes you think you can trust him?
He didn't do shit.

78
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,928
Hey, butt out, chicken liver!
I gave him back the wallet, didn't I?

79
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,137
How far is this place?

80
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:02,765
- 1811 Mason. Put it in box 3-C.
- 3-C.

81
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,833
You won't have no trouble.

82
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:08,044
There's $5,000 there

83
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,588
and here's $100 for you.

84
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,608
Okay, old man,
I'll make your drop for you.

85
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,801
And don't worry,
you can trust me.

86
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,949
Hey. Hey! If those goons
decide to search you,

87
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:21,951
you ain't gonna get far
carrying it there.

88
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:23,077
What'll we do?

89
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:26,121
You got a bag or something?
How about a handkerchief?

90
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:27,498
Here's a handkerchief!

91
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:28,648
Here. Give it to me.

92
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,817
Give me the money.

93
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:32,235
Just hurry, will you?

94
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:37,258
You got any more? Better give it
all to me if you want to keep it.

95
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:39,134
They think I've been
holding out on them.

96
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,012
My wife got sick and I had to pay the bill.
I wasn't holding out.

97
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:43,621
Stuff it down your pants here.

98
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,099
Like that. Got it?

99
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,124
Uh-huh. Yeah.

100
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,309
Hurry, will you?

101
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:50,062
Ain't a tough guy in the world
that's gonna frisk you there.

102
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,087
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:06,829
Where to?

104
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:08,122
Which way is Mason?

105
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,331
Twenty blocks south.

106
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:10,916
Okay, go north,
Joliet Station, fast!

107
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:12,358
Right.

108
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,215
What's so funny?

109
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,409
I just made
the world's easiest $5,000!

110
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,415
- Come on, Luther!
- Hold on, man, I'm fading.

111
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,482
Come on!

112
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:36,674
Hustle!

113
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:42,305
In here!

114
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:47,769
Man, was that beautiful!

115
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:50,289
I thought for sure
he was on to us.

116
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:52,583
No, you had him all the way.

117
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:53,608
All the way!

118
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:57,445
All right.

119
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,074
Luther.

120
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,011
Good God!
We're millionaires.

121
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,721
Jesus! Did you know
he was that loaded?

122
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,806
Hell, no! I just cut into him.
I would've settled

123
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,999
for pawning one of them shoes.

124
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,961
Oh, God!

125
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:19,360
Come on,
let's get out of here.

126
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,718
We'll split it up tonight.

127
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:58,423
Hiya, Marge!

128
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,428
- Hi, kid.
- Hi, Hooker. She's onstage.

129
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:19,920
Hi, Hooker.
Getting married or something?

130
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,213
Get used to it, Leonard.

131
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:22,947
I'm going to look
this good from now on.

132
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:24,866
What do you say, Ed?

133
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,159
Hi, Hooker.

134
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:40,381
Hey.

135
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:43,468
I want to talk...

136
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:50,951
Hiya, Hooker.

137
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:53,561
You getting
married or something?

138
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,687
For Christ's sake, Ed,
did you hear that out there?

139
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:04,339
Harry drops four beats in the
middle of my goddamn routine!

140
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:06,008
Now, how long do I have
to put up with that?

141
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:07,033
Leonard, you're on.

142
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,553
Crystal, you want to get
out of here tonight?

143
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:10,846
I come into some dough.

144
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,748
Oh, I can't. I got a 10:00 show.
I need the $5.

145
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,625
I'll spend $50 on you.

146
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:17,936
Yeah?

147
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:18,961
Yeah.

148
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:20,838
Okay.

149
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:24,485
...opens up his pants,
the duck sticks his head out.

150
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,095
One lady says to the other,
"Mabel, do you see what I see?"

151
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:30,157
She says, "So what? You've seen
one, you've seen them all."

152
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:32,391
She says, "Yes, but this one
is eating my popcorn."

153
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:40,358
You see that guy Harry, he can't
keep time in a watch factory.

154
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,462
Supposing there's some Hollywood
movie agent out there.

155
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,923
All those years of training
right down the drain.

156
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:48,342
Hooker! Ain't seen you in months.
Thought you took a fall.

157
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,886
Nah, just a little hard times, is all.
Everything's Jake now.

158
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,179
You gonna have a go here?

159
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:53,472
How about $10 on the line?

160
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,474
There's a lot of action
there on 28th Street.

161
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,101
Pay you $35.

162
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,709
$3,000 on the red, Jimmy.

163
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,978
$3,000?

164
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,021
Are you nuts?

165
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,481
No, I feel lucky. Come on.

166
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:05,275
Hooker, I can't accept that.
It's too big a bet.

167
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,360
There's a house limit.

168
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:07,444
Take it.

169
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:08,529
But Hooker here's a--

170
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:09,554
Take it!

171
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:19,689
Twenty-two, black.

172
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:23,901
Tough luck, kid.

173
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,547
Lucky for me
it came up black, Hooker.

174
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:29,591
A fella could get in big trouble
around here, losing a bet like that.

175
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,826
Listen, Jimmy,
can't we do it again, huh?

176
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,897
Don't worry about it, pal.
It was my mistake.

177
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:45,732
There's always more
where that came from.

178
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:48,902
"Don't worry about it," he says.
Don't worry about it. $3,000!

179
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:49,987
Thanks, Hooker.

180
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:52,614
Comes in here with $50
he's going to spend on me!

181
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,639
$3000.

182
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,661
Thanks for the evening, Hooker.

183
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:58,672
Come on. It's not over yet.

184
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,664
Next time you want to
spend $50 on me, mail it.

185
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:01,689
Come on. Would you...

186
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,649
Listen, will you...

187
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,264
They found Mottola.

188
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:00,782
He was drunk in a dive in Joliet.

189
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,267
He never got on the train.

190
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,810
I don't want to
hear about his day, Greer.

191
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:05,312
What happened to the money?

192
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:08,440
He lost it to a couple of con artists
on his way out of the spot.

193
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:10,549
- How much?
- $11,000.

194
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:17,265
Okay, I better get on
the phone to New York,

195
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:20,559
see what the big mick
wants to do about it.

196
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,729
I have a pretty
good idea, though.

197
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,495
No more bets!

198
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:48,963
Ace. Bet the ace.

199
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:50,232
Bet the ace.

200
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:51,358
Ace says two.

201
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:52,466
Ace bets a deuce.

202
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:53,592
Two.

203
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:59,432
Four, five. Two spades.

204
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,809
Ace six. Ace deuce.

205
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,568
Doyle, can I talk to you?

206
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:12,254
I'm busy, Floyd.

207
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,656
It's important. We had a little
trouble in Chicago today.

208
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:18,451
One of our runners
got hit for $11,000.

209
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,264
What makes you think
he just didn't pocket it?

210
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:24,206
We checked his story
with a tipster.

211
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,250
He was cleaned by two grifters.

212
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,729
They workin' for anybody?

213
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:30,254
I don't know. Could be.

214
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:31,922
We're running that down now.

215
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,860
Have some local people
take care of them.

216
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,552
Nothing fancy.

217
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:39,263
We've got to discourage
this kind of thing.

218
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,767
You follow?

219
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:03,805
Johnny Hooker!

220
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,516
If you ain't a sharper
in them linens!

221
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,601
Evening, Louise.

222
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:08,769
Hey, Ma!

223
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:12,004
Child, if I didn't know you better,
I'd swear you had some class.

224
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:16,175
Luther said you was something
to see today!

225
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:17,944
I don't know, Alva.

226
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:19,988
I've got to get faster
tyin' up that bundle.

227
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,823
I'm still given 'em
too much time to think.

228
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:24,493
Oh! Bushwah!
I used to make that switch

229
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,328
with slower hands
than you got.

230
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:29,247
Course, the "Up and Down
Broadway" was my best game.

231
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:33,335
Me and Luther didn't make much
on it, but it wasn't so touchy.

232
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,337
Them marks can
beat you up awful bad

233
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:37,297
when they catch you
making that switch.

234
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:39,299
Come on, Leroy.
We'll be late for church.

235
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,718
Oh, Ma, they were closing in
on Machine Gun Kelly!

236
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,470
Who you rooting for anyhow?

237
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:44,554
Hey, Hooker!

238
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,765
Can't help you, Leroy.
You can't beat the house.

239
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,808
Nuts!

240
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,643
Since when do you go
to church at night?

241
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,269
Since they
started late bingo.

242
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:54,564
I'm gonna ask the Lord for some of
that cash while He's still paying off.

243
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,651
Luther, look in on the baby
from time to time, will you?

244
00:15:57,676 --> 00:15:58,968
You, too, huh, Louise?

245
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:01,011
- Child, yeah, got to go pray. See you.
- Yeah.

246
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:02,888
Hey, Erie.

247
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:05,492
Give me!
Give me, give me!

248
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,017
There's your cut.

249
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:10,038
Guy turned out
to be an oil well.

250
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:11,123
Which way did he go?

251
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:12,999
Due north. He was
gonna take it all.

252
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,459
Aw, the bastard.

253
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:15,818
He can blow his
nose all the way.

254
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:23,451
There you go, Luther.
$6,000.

255
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,013
You're late.
Where have you been?

256
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,831
I had a couple of appointments.

257
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,043
How much did you lose?

258
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:39,943
All of it.

259
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,760
In one goddamn night?

260
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:45,782
Why are you spraying money around like that?
You could've been nailed!

261
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,909
I checked the place first.
There were no dicks there.

262
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,537
But you're a con man,
and you blew it like a pimp!

263
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:51,955
I didn't teach you
to be no pimp.

264
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,181
What the hell's eating you?

265
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:55,000
I've blown money before.

266
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,210
No class grifter would've
done it, that's all.

267
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,111
You think my play is bad?

268
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,530
I think you're the best.

269
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,786
I wouldn't be
getting out otherwise.

270
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,725
What the hell
are you talking about?

271
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,393
I'm getting too old
for this racket.

272
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:16,563
You hang on too long and you
start embarrassing yourself.

273
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:18,940
We just took off today on the
biggest score we've ever had.

274
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:21,735
It's nothing compared to what you
could be makin' on the big con.

275
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,737
But you played the big con.

276
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:24,779
You told me yourself

277
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:27,806
it was some dumb game
for mama's boys and flakes.

278
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:32,603
Hell, I never played no big con.

279
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:35,105
I hung around and
picked up a few things.

280
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,793
Ain't no rich boys gonna trust

281
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,778
a hungry nigger
enough to be conned.

282
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,030
But I'll tell you

283
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:46,301
I've been looking for this
one all my life, Johnny.

284
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:49,036
Now I have a chance
to step out when I'm ahead.

285
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:52,289
Come on! What would
you do with yourself?

286
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:54,559
Oh, I have a brother
down in K.C.,

287
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:56,186
runs a freight outlet.

288
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:58,003
I can go halfsies with him.

289
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:02,633
It ain't too exciting,
but it's mostly legal.

290
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:08,389
I got an old friend in Chicago
named Henry Gondorff.

291
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,141
I want you to look him up.

292
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,435
There ain't a better
inside man alive.

293
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,205
He'll teach you all
you got to know.

294
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,772
To hell with that.

295
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,335
I want to work
with you, Luther.

296
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,777
I'm out, Johnny.

297
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:31,996
Yeah, sure. If that's
the way you want it.

298
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,124
That's the way I want it.

299
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:39,795
How do you like that Coleman?

300
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,505
After five years.

301
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:43,608
Come on,
it was the only thing to do.

302
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,985
He knew he was
holding you back.

303
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,278
Yeah, but we were partners.

304
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:48,905
If it weren't for Luther, I'd
still be hustling pinball.

305
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,490
I don't need any more
than what I got.

306
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:53,910
Well, you won't have anything if you
don't lay off the games of chance.

307
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,412
There's a depression on,
you know.

308
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:56,830
There's always
a depression on.

309
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:59,291
If you saved a little bit,
you wouldn't have to grift.

310
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:00,667
I like grifting.

311
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,210
Maybe you could buy
yourself some things.

312
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:04,045
- What?
- Clean clothes, a car.

313
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,964
I got clothes, and
I don't know how to drive.

314
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:07,799
What else do you got to sell?

315
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:08,824
All right. Forget it.

316
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:13,412
Hey, Hooker!
Come on, you son of a...

317
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,143
Oh, hi there, Snyder.

318
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:19,185
What's the matter?

319
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,188
Things a little slow down at the
bunco department tonight, huh?

320
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:23,523
Somebody lose the dominoes?

321
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:26,776
You scored blood money today,
Hooker, you need a friend.

322
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,094
Go find yourself
a shoplifter to roll.

323
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:35,410
You got the wrong guy, pal.

324
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:37,561
I've been home
with the flu all day.

325
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,497
You can stake out
my toilet if you want.

326
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:40,814
Keep talking!

327
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:56,747
I'll tell you what
you did, smart boy.

328
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:00,709
You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

329
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,896
And you and Coleman
played the switch for him

330
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:05,339
and blew him off
to a cab on 49th.

331
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:08,276
If he hadn't been a numbers
runner for Doyle Lonnegan,

332
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:10,427
it would've been perfect.

333
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,221
You're crazy.

334
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:17,577
I ain't stupid enough
to play for no rackets money.

335
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,603
Not intentionally, maybe.

336
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:22,106
That don't cut no ice
with Lonnegan.

337
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:23,625
He'll swat you like a fly.

338
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,942
Yeah, well,

339
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:28,713
Well, I'll square it
with the fixer.

340
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,782
Nobody can buy you a prayer
if I put the finger on you.

341
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:36,286
Now, I figure your end of the
score was at least $3,000.

342
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,515
I want $2,000,
no matter what it was.

343
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,124
My take was only $1,000.

344
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,877
Then you're gonna have to come up
with another $1,000 somewhere.

345
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:56,306
All right.

346
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,487
You're a smart egg, Hooker.

347
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:14,491
No sense getting dead
over $2,000.

348
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:25,544
Relax, Erie.
I'll bill you.

349
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:36,865
I thought you blew
all your money.

350
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,098
I did.

351
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:41,035
The stuff I gave him
is counterfeit.

352
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,288
They'll spot it the first
place he tries to spend it.

353
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,856
Are you crazy,
giving him counterfeit money?

354
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:51,028
Hey, wait up!
Where you going?

355
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,246
I'll tell you!

356
00:22:11,883 --> 00:22:13,151
What the hell
are you gonna do

357
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:14,944
if Snyder puts
the finger on you, huh?

358
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,404
You're committing
suicide, kid.

359
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:17,822
Christ, what difference
does it make?

360
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,866
If Snyder knows about us,
so does everybody else.

361
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:21,642
He never gets anything first.

362
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:23,870
Hey, listen to me.

363
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:25,455
Don't go back
to your place tonight.

364
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,081
Don't go anyplace
you usually go.

365
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:28,607
You hear me?

366
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,276
Damn! There's no answer
at Luther's.

367
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:34,530
Look, you better get out
of town or somethin', huh?

368
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:38,909
Hey, lady. Lady, let go!

369
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:41,411
Ma'am! Ma'am!

370
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,413
I want my nickel
back for that telephone!

371
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,713
No, sir.
Nobody here did.

372
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:54,883
1521 North Bryant.

373
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:00,722
Luther!

374
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,545
Is he dead?

375
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,255
I don't know.
There was a big fight.

376
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,572
I don't know.

377
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:18,031
Somebody must've pushed him.

378
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:22,578
Oh!

379
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:24,013
Jesus!

380
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,098
Luther!

381
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:26,182
Luther!

382
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:27,267
Jesus!

383
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,042
Oh! God! No!

384
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:33,439
Luther! Luther!

385
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:34,774
What happened?

386
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,718
God, who would do such
a thing to you, Luther?

387
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:39,887
Luther!

388
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:42,490
Alva.

389
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,325
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

390
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,451
Luther.

391
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:48,270
Hooker, come on! If Snyder
catches you here, you're dead!

392
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:53,793
Get out of here!

393
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:54,878
Out of the way.

394
00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:57,321
Help me! Help me! Help me!

395
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Ah.

396
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:46,536
Excuse me.

397
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,848
I'm looking for a guy
named Henry Gondorff.

398
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:49,933
Know him?

399
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:50,958
No.

400
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:57,673
You sure?

401
00:24:58,424 --> 00:24:59,591
Beat it.

402
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:02,052
Luther Coleman sent me.

403
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:06,157
Are you Hooker?

404
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:07,182
Yeah.

405
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:11,103
Why didn't you say so?

406
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,357
We heard about Luther
last night.

407
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Come on.

408
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,576
I thought maybe you were
a cop or somethin'.

409
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,514
It's the room in the back.

410
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,915
He wasn't expecting
you so soon, though.

411
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:34,584
Thanks.

412
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,070
The great Henry Gondorff.

413
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:46,573
Turn it off!

414
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:51,995
You sober?

415
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,414
Turn it off, will you?

416
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:14,518
Glad to meet you, kid.
You're a real horse's ass.

417
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:17,979
Luther said I could learn
somethin' from you.

418
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,024
I already know how to drink.

419
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:24,361
Sorry about Luther.

420
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:27,864
He was the best street worker
I ever saw.

421
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:32,637
He had you down as a big-timer.

422
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:33,912
What happened?

423
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:41,169
I conned a senator from
Florida on a stock deal.

424
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:45,006
A real lop-ear. Thought he was
gonna take over General Electric.

425
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:48,885
Some chanteuse woke him, though,
and he put the feds on me.

426
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:51,304
You mean you blew it.

427
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,408
Luther didn't tell me
you had a big mouth.

428
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:57,060
He didn't tell me
you was a screw-up, either.

429
00:28:06,237 --> 00:28:08,780
You played any
big cons since then?

430
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:12,576
Oh, I lammed around
a bunch of bohunk towns,

431
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,703
one kick ahead of the G-men.

432
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:17,914
Would be still, if Billie
hadn't set me up here.

433
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,296
Don't kid yourself, friend.
I still know how.

434
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:32,989
Are you going to stay
for breakfast,

435
00:28:33,014 --> 00:28:34,890
or do you already
know how to eat?

436
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,185
I picked something up
along the way.

437
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,649
Is Lonnegan after you, too?

438
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:47,962
I don't know.
I ain't seen anybody.

439
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,905
You never do, kid.

440
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:05,420
Doyle?

441
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:07,422
Yeah.

442
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:12,260
We just talked to Chicago.

443
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:15,263
They got one of the grifters last night.
A nigger.

444
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:17,992
How about the other one?

445
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,310
They're still
looking for him.

446
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:22,896
Who did Combs put on it?

447
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,665
He gave it to Riley and Cole.

448
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,792
They staked out the other
guy's place last night,

449
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:28,252
but he never showed.

450
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:30,362
They figure maybe
he skipped town.

451
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:32,948
Do you want to
keep after him?

452
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:36,368
You see that fella in the
red sweater over there?

453
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:38,471
His name's Danny McCoy.

454
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:40,556
Works a few of the protection
rackets for Carnello

455
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:42,624
when he's waiting for
something better to happen.

456
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,794
Danny and I have known each
other since we were six.

457
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:51,258
Take a good look
at that face, Floyd.

458
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:55,720
Because if he ever finds out I can
be beat by one lousy grifter,

459
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:58,366
I'll have to kill him
and every other hood

460
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:01,101
who wants to muscle in
on my Chicago operation.

461
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:04,664
You follow?

462
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:05,689
Yes, sir.

463
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:08,775
Good lad.

464
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:16,050
Hey, you feeling all right
this morning, Henry?

465
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,426
Yeah, fine.

466
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:20,012
Would you mind opening up the
round a little early today?

467
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:22,289
We got some business
coming in before hours.

468
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:25,142
- Sure.
- Check the main gearing, will you?

469
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:28,878
Man O' War started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head.

470
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,633
Great little countess,
that Billie.

471
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,695
She runs a spiffy house
up there, too.

472
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,406
You, uh, plan to spend
the rest of your life here?

473
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:40,390
I could do a lot worse.

474
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:48,732
Listen, Gondorff, am I gonna learn
to play the big con or not?

475
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:50,167
What's your hurry?

476
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:52,235
I wanna play for Lonnegan.

477
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,487
You know anything
about the guy?

478
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:57,615
Yeah, he croaked Luther.
Anything else I got to know?

479
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,583
All right.

480
00:31:07,418 --> 00:31:09,461
He runs a numbers racket
on the South Side,

481
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:11,689
he owns a packinghouse,
a few banks--

482
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:14,775
Yeah, and half the politicians
in New York and Chicago.

483
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,695
Not a fix in this world gonna
cool him out if he blows on you.

484
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,471
- I'll get him anyway.
- Why?

485
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:22,932
'Cause I don't know enough
about killin' to kill him.

486
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:42,678
You can't do it alone,
you know.

487
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:45,306
It takes a mob of guys and enough
money to make them look good.

488
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:46,515
I know plenty of guys.

489
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,601
It's not like playing winos.
You can't outrun a--

490
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:49,852
I never played for no winos.

491
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,271
You've gotta keep his con
even after you take his money.

492
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:53,463
He can't know you took him.

493
00:31:53,631 --> 00:31:54,857
You're scared of him.

494
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:57,342
Right down
to my socks, buster.

495
00:31:57,676 --> 00:31:59,779
You're talkin' about a guy
who would kill a grifter

496
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:03,181
over a chunk of money that
wouldn't support him for two days.

497
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,851
You're going to go for him.

498
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:11,957
I just don't want a hothead
looking to get even,

499
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:13,459
coming back
halfway through saying,

500
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:16,361
it ain't enough, 'cause
it's all we're gonna get.

501
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:23,094
Can you get a mob together?

502
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,512
After what happened
to Luther,

503
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:27,080
I don't think I can get more
than 200, 300 guys.

504
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:34,796
Luther said you learn fast.
I hope he's right.

505
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:09,510
Lonnegan gets most of his
income from the numbers

506
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:11,220
even though he's been
putting more money

507
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:12,721
into his
savings-and-loan business.

508
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:14,807
- You think he's moving out of the racket?
- No.

509
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:16,809
He owns most of
the stock that's traded.

510
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:20,062
But my guess is he's just trying to
build himself a respectable image.

511
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:21,397
He came out of Five Points,

512
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:24,316
but he's been telling everybody
he was born in Forest Hills.

513
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:25,985
He knows the market, though.

514
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,053
I don't think we can take him
on a stocks deal.

515
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:30,614
Twist,
what about the numbers?

516
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,559
Tipsters say it's run out of a
packinghouse on 14th by a guy named Combs.

517
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,663
Lonnegan comes out every three
weeks to check on it, but

518
00:35:37,688 --> 00:35:40,982
he stays away from the day-to-day
stuff in case it's raided.

519
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:44,336
These are two of Combs' favorite
torpedoes: Riley and Cole.

520
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:45,862
You ever seen 'em?

521
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:51,034
- No.
- They're the ones who hit Luther.

522
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,346
They also got the numbers
runner you conned.

523
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:55,931
A guy named Mottola.

524
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:57,874
Found him in a quarry
with a knife in his eye.

525
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:02,313
Lonnegan's had seven or eight
people rubbed on his way up.

526
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,690
His pattern has been
to get close to a racket boss,

527
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:07,008
learn the operation,
then move in on it.

528
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:10,404
He's done it to Gorman,
O'Donnell, Buchalman.

529
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,180
He took the numbers
from Sharkey.

530
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:14,057
All four of these guys
are dead.

531
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,452
He's vindictive as hell, Henry.

532
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:18,227
Kills for pride.

533
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:21,022
Doesn't add up he'd let
Hooker get away from him.

534
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:24,275
You see anything,
kid, you let us know.

535
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:28,213
If they put you on the spot, we got
to fold the con. You got that?

536
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:31,491
Yeah. You sure it's got to be
one of these two guys?

537
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,744
No. They're just
the only ones we know of.

538
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:47,548
Time.

539
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:01,437
Set me up five more beers,
will you, Danny?

540
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,532
- You the owner here?
- That's right.

541
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:15,076
Lt. Snyder, Bunco.

542
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:17,620
That's a Joliet badge,
Snyder.

543
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:19,455
Don't cut much up here.

544
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:22,309
Looking for a guy on the lam
from a counterfeiting rap.

545
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:23,727
Thought he might've
come in here.

546
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:25,771
Don't think so.
I know everyone in the place.

547
00:37:25,796 --> 00:37:27,439
And I always bounce
the lamsters.

548
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:29,483
All right if
I look around in here?

549
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:33,136
No, but you're welcome
to a free beer before you go.

550
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,770
I don't really
need your permission.

551
00:37:47,025 --> 00:37:48,961
I don't know what to do
with this guy, Henry.

552
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:50,963
He's an Irishman
who doesn't drink,

553
00:37:50,988 --> 00:37:52,965
doesn't smoke and
doesn't chase dames.

554
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,175
He's a grand knight
in the Knights of Columbus.

555
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,677
And he only goes
out to play faro.

556
00:37:56,702 --> 00:37:58,303
Sometimes plays
15 to 20 hours at a time.

557
00:37:58,328 --> 00:37:59,763
Just him against the house.

558
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:00,830
Roulette, craps?

559
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:02,141
He won't touch 'em.

560
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,853
The croupier at Gilman's says he
never plays anything he can't win.

561
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:07,062
Sports?

562
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:09,273
Likes to be seen
with fighters sometimes,

563
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:11,340
but doesn't go to
the fights or bet on them.

564
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:14,510
Jesus. Does he do anything
where he's not alone?

565
00:38:14,803 --> 00:38:16,179
Just poker.

566
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,515
And he cheats.

567
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:22,518
Pretty good at it, too.

568
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,502
Where does he play?

569
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:33,547
The porters say he runs a braced
game on the Century Limited

570
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:35,364
when he comes out
here from New York.

571
00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:37,325
$100 minimum, straight poker.

572
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:40,995
And a lot of high rollers ride
that train just to play him.

573
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:43,581
That sounds good, J.J.

574
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:51,130
Which way are the rooms?

575
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,400
Who told you this guy was in here?

576
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:56,195
Nobody. I just know what
kind of woman he likes.

577
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,697
I'm gonna check all the
joy houses till I find him.

578
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:01,432
Well, maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

579
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:04,519
I doubt it.
Which way are the rooms?

580
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,896
Right through there.

581
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:08,957
But I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

582
00:39:08,982 --> 00:39:10,876
What are you gonna do,
call the cops?

583
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:12,652
I don't have to.

584
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:16,572
You'd be busting in on the chief
of police just up the hall.

585
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,227
We'll play it out here.

586
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:29,561
And a huge duke is too simple.

587
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:32,564
With no fix, we're gonna need a
con with a sure-fire blow-off.

588
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:34,900
I think we ought to play
this guy on the payoff.

589
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,485
It's the tightest game
we got.

590
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,028
It's not all over
the papers yet.

591
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:39,571
Lonnegan is a fast egg, J.J.

592
00:39:39,596 --> 00:39:41,657
He's not going to sit still
for a standard play.

593
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:42,932
So what does that leave us?

594
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:44,684
We can't con
the payoff to a banker.

595
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:47,478
We'll use the wire.

596
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:50,249
Haven't known a poker player yet
didn't wanna beat the ponies.

597
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:52,084
The wire's been
out of date for 10 years.

598
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:53,794
That's why he won't know it.

599
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:55,611
I'm not sure I know it.

600
00:39:55,946 --> 00:39:58,322
It'll take two of us
working the inside.

601
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:01,033
Any objections
to Hooker as second man?

602
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:06,849
All right.
We'll give Lonnegan the hook

603
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,809
on the train and play him here.

604
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:10,936
J.J., you think I can
get in that poker game?

605
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:13,730
Just show up with a lot of
money and look like a sucker.

606
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:15,131
I also gotta win.

607
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:19,302
Oh, by the way, any of you guys
been passing bad money lately?

608
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,850
If he comes in again, stall him
so I can get a look at him.

609
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:43,760
Fella by the name of Stenner had this
place until about six months ago,

610
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:45,578
but he had to give it up.

611
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:48,307
It doesn't look so good
right now,

612
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:50,142
but maybe you can fix it up
a little bit.

613
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,810
Watch your step
when you come in.

614
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:53,586
There's a dip down
on the left.

615
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,995
How's it look, Eddie?

616
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,079
It looks all right, Kid.

617
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:12,956
It's big enough,
and it's off the street.

618
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:14,333
I don't know.

619
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,460
It's kind of short notice.
I'm not sure

620
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:18,545
we can get it all
done by Saturday.

621
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,365
Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark
down from New York on the Century.

622
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:23,617
We'll take it.

623
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:26,094
That building at the end of
the alley, do you manage that?

624
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,279
For 15 years.

625
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:29,014
I'll need a corner room
facing this way.

626
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,307
How much a week?

627
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:31,558
Only rents by the month.

628
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,334
$250 for the two of them.

629
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,545
Last time I expect
to see you down here.

630
00:41:36,672 --> 00:41:38,482
Never heard of the place.

631
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:41,276
It's been awhile since
I stocked the wire store.

632
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,278
Not many mobs playing that anymore.

633
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:45,364
All we'll need
is the bookie setup for now.

634
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:47,407
All right.
I'll rent you everything

635
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:49,701
I've got in the warehouse
for $2,000.

636
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:53,646
That'll give you phones,
cages, blackboards and ticker gear.

637
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:57,542
If you want a counter and bar,
that's another $1,000.

638
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,110
That's pretty steep, Benny.

639
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:00,879
Gondorff's still a hot item.

640
00:42:00,904 --> 00:42:02,255
Where would I be if he gets hit?

641
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,882
Benny, you just give us
what you can.

642
00:42:03,907 --> 00:42:05,384
We'll send a truck down.

643
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:07,970
Now how do you want to work this?
Flat rate or percentage?

644
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,036
Who's the mark?

645
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:10,246
Doyle Lonnegan.

646
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:15,751
Flat rate.

647
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:33,686
The guy in the black hat
with the gimp.

648
00:42:43,405 --> 00:42:45,406
He's not as tough
as he thinks.

649
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:47,283
Neither are we.

650
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:52,806
Mr. Shaw?

651
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:53,890
That's right.

652
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:55,100
You wanted to see me?

653
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,520
I hear there's a friendly poker
game on this train. Know about it?

654
00:42:58,545 --> 00:42:59,938
Oh, a little.Thank you, sir.

655
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,231
Can you get me in that game?

656
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:02,441
Oh, don't know.

657
00:43:02,466 --> 00:43:04,550
There's usually a waiting list.

658
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:11,265
That'll get you
first alternate, sir.

659
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:18,481
I'll see what I can do.

660
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:24,254
Hey, Twist!

661
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:25,922
Patty, me boy!
How are you?

662
00:43:25,947 --> 00:43:27,507
How are you, Twist?

663
00:43:27,532 --> 00:43:29,468
Hey, Champ,
you're looking like a million!

664
00:43:29,493 --> 00:43:31,344
Good to see you!

665
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:34,014
Goldie, you old son of a gun.

666
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:35,456
I saw the Kid in Denver.

667
00:43:35,582 --> 00:43:36,999
He says to say hello to you.

668
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:39,478
Joiner, are you still
working those shapes?

669
00:43:39,503 --> 00:43:41,772
Any number you want, Twist!

670
00:43:41,797 --> 00:43:43,047
Good to see you again, Twist.

671
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:44,524
Okay, Lacey.
Good to see you.

672
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:46,485
- It's good to see you.
- Dukey, how are you?

673
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,652
Come on in.

674
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:49,112
When did you get back in town?

675
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,530
A couple of days ago.

676
00:43:50,555 --> 00:43:52,624
You heard about Luther Coleman,
didn't you?

677
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:54,493
Yeah, some of the boys
were passing the hat

678
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:55,827
for Alva and the kids.

679
00:43:55,852 --> 00:43:57,746
I never seen the guys
so worked up.

680
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:59,998
Well, don't worry
about it, Dukey.

681
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:02,709
We're gonna send a little
calling card of our own.

682
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:04,961
Gondorff is setting up
a wire store on the north side.

683
00:44:04,986 --> 00:44:07,172
I'm gonna need a 20-man
boost right away.

684
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:08,965
I got plenty of talent
out there tonight.

685
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,634
You can take
your pick. Lace!

686
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:11,968
This is a tough one, Dukey.

687
00:44:11,993 --> 00:44:14,179
These boys have
got to be the quill.

688
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:17,456
Get me the sheet.
Let's see who's in town, huh?

689
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,268
Hey, Patty,
give me the sheet.

690
00:44:20,293 --> 00:44:21,460
Sure.

691
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:40,020
Gondorff's already on...

692
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:50,781
Twist, you know this guy?

693
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,121
No, I never saw him before.

694
00:44:57,998 --> 00:44:59,707
He's a dick, though.

695
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,551
Hello, Snyder.

696
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:13,721
- What are you doin' up here?
- I'm on vacation.

697
00:45:14,472 --> 00:45:16,765
Hey, you seen that
friend of yours lately?

698
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,994
No, no.
He, uh, packed it in.

699
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:20,519
Enrolled in detective school.

700
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:31,089
When you see him,

701
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:33,741
you tell him he better pay
up before I get to him.

702
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:46,503
That son of a bitch.

703
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:51,133
Oh, thanks, Lace.

704
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:53,052
Now, let's see
what we got here.

705
00:45:53,303 --> 00:45:56,031
Let's see. Horse Face Lee,
Slim Miller,

706
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:59,516
Suitcase Murphy and the Big
Alabama are in from New Orleans.

707
00:46:00,268 --> 00:46:02,954
Crying Jonesy and the
Boone Kid from Denver.

708
00:46:02,979 --> 00:46:06,482
Dippy Burke and Limehouse
Chappie from New York.

709
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,294
Well, these and
the guys outside

710
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:11,296
should give you 30 or more
to choose from.

711
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:12,797
Good, Dukey.

712
00:46:12,822 --> 00:46:15,592
Have them down at Stenner's
old pool hall before 6:00.

713
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:17,302
We're gonna run
the route tonight.

714
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:18,994
Okay, Twist, but

715
00:46:20,205 --> 00:46:22,057
if this thing
blows up, remember,

716
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:23,832
I can't do you no good downtown.

717
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:25,268
Gondorff is federal.

718
00:46:25,293 --> 00:46:27,503
Dukey, if this thing blows up,

719
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:30,589
the feds will be
the least of our problems.

720
00:46:46,523 --> 00:46:47,648
Yeah?

721
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:52,444
You in?

722
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,672
Yeah, I think so.

723
00:46:53,697 --> 00:46:55,048
I gave the kayducer a C-note.

724
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:56,383
Did you find out the deck?

725
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:59,052
He usually plays with a Tally-Ho
Fan or a Tally-Ho Circle.

726
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:00,887
I got you one of each.

727
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:03,872
He likes to cold-deck low,
eights or nines.

728
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:07,334
That's nice work, J.J. Here.

729
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:32,502
Oh, I'm sorry.

730
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:33,569
Don't mention it, ma'am.

731
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,166
She picked him clean.
He never missed it.

732
00:48:30,794 --> 00:48:33,629
My God, looks like
he's expecting a big night.

733
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:35,964
Must be $15,000
or $20,000 here.

734
00:48:38,134 --> 00:48:39,718
He's waiting for you
in the card room.

735
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:41,470
Let him wait.

736
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,852
You just worry
about your end, kid.

737
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:31,770
If we ever get to it.

738
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:35,190
Excuse me.

739
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:38,420
You sure you
checked this guy out?

740
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:40,839
He seemed like a pleasant man,
a lot of cash on him.

741
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:42,340
$200 suit, expensive luggage.

742
00:49:42,365 --> 00:49:43,842
I'll vouch for him.

743
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:45,576
Why isn't he here then?

744
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:47,744
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

745
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:49,413
All right.

746
00:49:59,924 --> 00:50:01,341
What're you doing?

747
00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:06,281
Always drink gin with a mark, kid.

748
00:50:06,306 --> 00:50:07,973
He can't tell if you cut it.

749
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:11,286
$2,000 for you, Mr. Clayton.

750
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:12,620
Thank you.

751
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:15,290
All right, gentlemen.
Should we not wait for him?

752
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:16,499
Let's go.

753
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:17,667
I think that's a good idea.

754
00:50:17,692 --> 00:50:19,693
Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

755
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:30,704
Sorry I'm late, guys.
I was taking a crap.

756
00:50:31,915 --> 00:50:33,415
The name's Shaw.

757
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,686
Mr. Shaw, meet
Mr. Jameson from Chicago.

758
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:37,770
How are you?

759
00:50:37,795 --> 00:50:39,272
Mr. Lombard from Philadelphia.

760
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:40,297
Yeah.

761
00:50:40,423 --> 00:50:41,733
And Mr. Lonnegan
from New York.

762
00:50:41,758 --> 00:50:43,067
Pleased to meet you.

763
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:44,694
Mr. Clayton, Pittsburgh.

764
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:47,005
Any of you guys want to make
a little book in Chicago,

765
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,947
I'm the guy to see.

766
00:50:50,266 --> 00:50:52,017
The game is straight poker

767
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:54,228
$100 minimum, table stakes.

768
00:50:55,939 --> 00:50:58,082
Ah, Mr. Shaw,
this is a gentleman's game.

769
00:50:58,107 --> 00:51:00,192
We assume you're all
good for your debts.

770
00:51:01,444 --> 00:51:03,320
How much would you like,
Mr. Shaw?

771
00:51:03,446 --> 00:51:05,322
I'll start with $5,000.

772
00:51:10,495 --> 00:51:13,306
Mr. Shaw, we usually require
a tie at this table.

773
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:15,624
If you don't have one,
we can get you one.

774
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,377
Hey, that'd be real nice of you,
Mr. Lonneman.

775
00:51:19,087 --> 00:51:20,379
Lonnegan.

776
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:36,788
Name's Curly Jackson.

777
00:51:36,813 --> 00:51:38,456
Worked for Gad Bryan
out of Baldwin.

778
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:39,648
Jackson?

779
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,318
Jackson, Jackson.
Oh, yeah.

780
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:45,880
You ever played the wire, Curly?

781
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:47,298
Roped for it long ago.

782
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:49,825
I can shill, mark board,
anything you want.

783
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:53,412
I don't run with riffraff,
and I only drink on the weekend.

784
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:56,498
Me specialty's an Englishman.

785
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:58,726
All right, Curly.

786
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:00,436
We got a rack of suits
over there.

787
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:02,105
Pick yourself out
a nice tweed one.

788
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,673
That's all right.
I've got all my own stuff.

789
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:12,055
Doyle?

790
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:14,182
One.

791
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:16,018
Bill?

792
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:18,937
I'll take one.

793
00:52:20,106 --> 00:52:21,291
Shaw?

794
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:22,316
Three.

795
00:52:24,777 --> 00:52:27,112
And the dealer will take one.

796
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,703
Bet $500.

797
00:52:36,706 --> 00:52:37,998
I'll call.

798
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:41,752
Call and raise.

799
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,672
- $300.
- I'm out.

800
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:47,424
Fold.

801
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:52,846
Your $300

802
00:52:54,223 --> 00:52:55,641
and raise

803
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:57,893
$500.

804
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:01,229
That's $800 to me.

805
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:07,736
Call.

806
00:53:12,283 --> 00:53:13,533
Jacks on top.

807
00:53:14,118 --> 00:53:15,369
Beats me.

808
00:53:19,415 --> 00:53:20,624
Three tens.

809
00:53:26,297 --> 00:53:27,815
Tough luck, Lonnihan.

810
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,735
But that's what you get for playing
with your head up your ass.

811
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,720
Couple more like that,
we can all go to bed early.

812
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,183
The name's Lonnegan.
Doyle Lonnegan.

813
00:53:38,726 --> 00:53:40,370
You're gonna remember that,
Mr. Shaw,

814
00:53:40,395 --> 00:53:42,521
or you're gonna get yourself
another game.

815
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:44,523
You follow?

816
00:53:51,114 --> 00:53:52,698
Bring it right up here!

817
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,012
Hey, Eddie, we brought you
a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.

818
00:53:58,037 --> 00:53:59,639
You'll get race results, odds,

819
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:02,016
scratches,
pole positions, everything.

820
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,394
And just as fast
as Western Union gets them.

821
00:54:04,419 --> 00:54:06,062
Does J.J. know
how to use that thing?

822
00:54:06,087 --> 00:54:07,838
All he's got to do is read.

823
00:54:12,135 --> 00:54:14,261
The name is Joe Erie.

824
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:16,346
Joe Erie.

825
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,786
You, uh, played for
any particular mobs?

826
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:22,811
No.

827
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:24,980
You ever play
the wire before, Erie?

828
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:26,565
No.

829
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:30,986
I never played no
big con before, but, uh,

830
00:54:31,446 --> 00:54:34,698
Luther Coleman was a friend
of mine, and I thought maybe

831
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:37,784
there'd be something
I could do.

832
00:54:39,078 --> 00:54:41,663
You get that nose
in Duke Boudreau's tonight?

833
00:54:45,168 --> 00:54:46,251
Yeah.

834
00:54:48,796 --> 00:54:52,382
You got moxie, Erie.
Get yourself a suit.

835
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:54,593
Thanks.

836
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:04,728
I'll bet $300.

837
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:07,564
Call and raise $200.

838
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:11,526
Call.

839
00:55:13,863 --> 00:55:15,006
No.

840
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:16,198
I'm out.

841
00:55:17,033 --> 00:55:18,158
Call.

842
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,702
Aces over.

843
00:55:22,163 --> 00:55:23,705
Three cowboys.

844
00:55:24,207 --> 00:55:26,124
All red, queen high.

845
00:55:27,543 --> 00:55:28,960
Well, that finishes me.

846
00:55:29,086 --> 00:55:30,587
Don't worry about it, pal.

847
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,026
They wouldn't have let you in
if you weren't a chump!

848
00:55:35,051 --> 00:55:37,153
Lombard will be joining you
in a couple of minutes.

849
00:55:37,178 --> 00:55:38,279
Now, look here, Shaw

850
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:39,697
I've had enough of this game

851
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:41,431
and quite enough of this company.

852
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:43,809
Check me out, Clemens.

853
00:55:44,977 --> 00:55:47,205
I guess that just
leaves the three of us.

854
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:51,024
Yes, Mr. Shaw.
that just leaves us three.

855
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:54,378
Mr. Clayton, I think we should
take a break for five minutes.

856
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:57,173
Tempers seem to be
running a little high.

857
00:55:57,198 --> 00:55:58,382
Oh, come on, Linneman,

858
00:55:58,407 --> 00:55:59,825
I was just
starting to do good.

859
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,397
Stack me a cooler, Floyd.
Oh, come on, Doyle.

860
00:56:13,422 --> 00:56:15,149
We'll be in the station
in another hour.

861
00:56:15,174 --> 00:56:17,276
The other guys are the losers.
You're still okay.

862
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:18,611
Fix me a deck.
Threes and nines.

863
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:20,220
I'll cut it in
on Clayton's deal.

864
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:21,864
What do you want
Clayton to get?

865
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:23,574
Nothing. I want him
out of there early.

866
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,725
I'm gonna bust that bastard
bookie in one play.

867
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,275
$400 to you, Mr. Jameson.
You're even.

868
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:35,610
Well, just wasn't my night.

869
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:53,628
I need it.

870
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,131
- You know what time we get in?
- No, I don't.

871
00:56:57,675 --> 00:56:59,009
Hey, where's your ante?

872
00:57:07,143 --> 00:57:10,729
Every time I had anything,
he stayed in front of me.

873
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:35,170
$500.

874
00:57:38,841 --> 00:57:41,176
Your $500. $1,000.

875
00:57:42,678 --> 00:57:44,137
I'll fold.

876
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:47,724
I'll play.

877
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:50,894
Cards?

878
00:57:52,313 --> 00:57:53,521
Two.

879
00:57:58,361 --> 00:57:59,486
Three.

880
00:58:28,182 --> 00:58:29,265
$500.

881
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:35,522
Your $500 and $1,000.

882
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:46,574
Your $1,000.
I'll raise you $2,000.

883
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,373
Your $2,000.

884
00:58:57,586 --> 00:58:58,920
Mr. Clemens,

885
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,798
give me $10,000 more.

886
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:48,428
I'll call.

887
00:59:50,264 --> 00:59:51,681
Four nines.

888
01:00:02,109 --> 01:00:03,318
Four Jacks.

889
01:00:14,705 --> 01:00:17,040
You owe me $15,000, pal.

890
01:00:31,222 --> 01:00:33,115
Must've left
my wallet in my room.

891
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,992
Don't hand me
any of that crap!

892
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:37,244
When you come to a game like this,
you bring your money!

893
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:38,954
How do I know you
won't take a powder?

894
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:40,081
No, no,
no, no, no, now...

895
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:41,749
All right,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

896
01:00:41,774 --> 01:00:44,043
I'll send a boy around
to your room in five minutes.

897
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:45,336
You better have the money

898
01:00:45,361 --> 01:00:47,505
or it's gonna be all around
Chicago that you welched.

899
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:49,614
You won't be able to
get a game of jacks!

900
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:52,826
Cash me in for
the rest of these bums.

901
01:01:08,092 --> 01:01:09,551
You're on, kid.

902
01:01:11,512 --> 01:01:13,614
But I can tell you,
it's a hard act to follow.

903
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:14,698
How did it go?

904
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:15,932
We got working money.

905
01:01:16,892 --> 01:01:18,184
- Hey?
- Yeah?

906
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:19,453
He's steamin'.

907
01:01:19,478 --> 01:01:20,478
Yeah.

908
01:01:20,729 --> 01:01:22,063
Watch yourself.

909
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:32,907
Doyle, I know
I gave him four threes!

910
01:01:33,284 --> 01:01:34,885
He had to make a switch!

911
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:36,470
We can't let him
get away with that.

912
01:01:36,495 --> 01:01:37,555
What was I supposed to do?

913
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,039
Call him for cheating better
than me in front of the others?

914
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:01,227
Name's Kelly.
Shaw sent me.

915
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:11,630
Your boss is quite
a card player, Mr. Kelly.

916
01:02:11,655 --> 01:02:12,864
How does he do it?

917
01:02:13,824 --> 01:02:14,991
He cheats.

918
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:18,721
Well, in that case,
I'll keep my money,

919
01:02:18,746 --> 01:02:20,306
and we'll just
have another game.

920
01:02:20,331 --> 01:02:22,123
You don't have any to keep.

921
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:27,521
Here's your wallet.

922
01:02:27,546 --> 01:02:29,214
He hired a dame
to take it from you.

923
01:02:30,216 --> 01:02:32,359
Shaw's been planning
to beat your game for months.

924
01:02:32,384 --> 01:02:34,886
He's been waiting for you to
cheat him so he could clip you.

925
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:38,616
Who do you think you're
talking to, errand boy?

926
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:39,950
Nobody sets me up!

927
01:02:39,975 --> 01:02:41,452
Take him back to
the baggage room!

928
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:42,536
Put one in his ear!

929
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:44,663
There were four witnesses
at that table!

930
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:47,082
Then go back, get that
other goddamn son of a bitch

931
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:49,251
and we'll dump them
in the first tunnel we hit.

932
01:02:49,276 --> 01:02:51,295
Doyle, we'll be in the station
in a few minutes!

933
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,463
It ain't gonna look too good

934
01:02:52,488 --> 01:02:54,155
you killing a guy
you owe money to.

935
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:57,784
There's better ways
of taking him down.

936
01:03:01,747 --> 01:03:03,349
What do you think
Shaw would do to me

937
01:03:03,374 --> 01:03:04,999
if he knew I was
telling you this?

938
01:03:08,295 --> 01:03:09,587
Okay.

939
01:03:12,091 --> 01:03:13,341
Why the rat?

940
01:03:19,556 --> 01:03:21,200
I want to take over
his operation,

941
01:03:21,225 --> 01:03:23,101
and I need you
to help me break him.

942
01:03:30,943 --> 01:03:32,127
Where's my money?

943
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:33,152
Shaw's got it.

944
01:03:33,737 --> 01:03:35,989
How the hell could
I ask him for it back?

945
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:39,242
We're pulling in.

946
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,251
I'm giving you a lift home.

947
01:03:49,712 --> 01:03:51,188
I was supposed to go with Shaw.

948
01:03:51,213 --> 01:03:52,523
Explain it to him somehow.

949
01:03:52,548 --> 01:03:53,816
Yeah, but he's expecting me.

950
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:55,174
I'm giving you a lift home.

951
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:57,302
You follow?

952
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:04,142
Yeah, sure. Sure thing.

953
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,311
What makes you think
you can beat him?

954
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,146
I've been planning this
for two years.

955
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:34,398
I know his organization
backwards and forwards.

956
01:04:34,423 --> 01:04:37,109
And I need somebody who's respectable
but not completely legit.

957
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:39,361
I'm a banker, Kelly.
That's legit in this state.

958
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:41,905
All you gotta do is put down a
bet for me at Shaw's place.

959
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,866
I'll do the rest.
I'll supply the money.

960
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:45,391
I'll supply the information.

961
01:04:45,809 --> 01:04:48,245
What about the money you come to collect?
Won't he miss it?

962
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:49,371
I'll tell him you paid it.

963
01:04:49,396 --> 01:04:50,664
I keep his books.
He trusts me.

964
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:53,858
If you help me, I'll pay you back the
money he stole out of my own pocket.

965
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:55,586
It's worth that much to you?

966
01:04:55,611 --> 01:04:56,652
Yeah.

967
01:04:57,279 --> 01:05:00,073
Oh, yeah.
Maybe a couple of million.

968
01:05:06,872 --> 01:05:08,664
Where do you
come from, Kelly?

969
01:05:10,459 --> 01:05:12,960
From the East Side of New York.
A place called Five Points.

970
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:15,421
But I got out of there.

971
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:16,964
Out and up, huh?

972
01:05:18,926 --> 01:05:20,051
Hey, Floyd,

973
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:23,113
I'm gonna have to keep
you away from this guy.

974
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:25,181
You're liable to get ideas.

975
01:05:42,908 --> 01:05:44,760
I'll be at Klein's Drug Store

976
01:05:44,785 --> 01:05:48,204
660 South Marshall at 1:30,
if you're interested.

977
01:05:48,914 --> 01:05:51,499
If I'm not there by 1:45,
I'm not coming.

978
01:07:05,324 --> 01:07:06,842
- Hey, Hooker.
- Hey, Ed.

979
01:07:06,867 --> 01:07:08,409
How did it go?
Jake.

980
01:07:11,246 --> 01:07:12,306
Everything go okay?

981
01:07:12,331 --> 01:07:13,706
Yeah, sure. Hell, easy.

982
01:07:24,593 --> 01:07:25,652
No sign of trouble, huh?

983
01:07:25,677 --> 01:07:26,737
No.

984
01:07:26,762 --> 01:07:27,779
What about Lonnegan?

985
01:07:27,804 --> 01:07:29,573
I gave him the breakdown,
just like you said.

986
01:07:29,598 --> 01:07:30,657
And?

987
01:07:30,682 --> 01:07:32,266
He's good.
He threatened to kill me.

988
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:33,952
Hell, kid,
if they don't do that,

989
01:07:33,977 --> 01:07:35,561
you know you're not
getting to them.

990
01:07:53,872 --> 01:07:55,122
Hello, Doyle.

991
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,626
All right, Riley,
what the hell happened?

992
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:00,586
We missed him.

993
01:08:00,921 --> 01:08:02,922
Whoever he is,
he made a fool out of you.

994
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:05,943
There wasn't no way he could've
known we was in that room.

995
01:08:05,968 --> 01:08:07,885
Somebody must've
wised him up.

996
01:08:08,136 --> 01:08:10,096
What does Cole
say about that?

997
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:12,950
I don't know.
He took it hard.

998
01:08:12,975 --> 01:08:14,642
Get out of here, Riley.

999
01:08:15,811 --> 01:08:17,829
Put Salino onto it.

1000
01:08:17,854 --> 01:08:21,399
Salino? Why waste our best
people on a small-time job?

1001
01:08:22,067 --> 01:08:24,503
This is a nickel-and-dime
grifter we're after, Doyle.

1002
01:08:24,528 --> 01:08:25,629
They'll get him next time.

1003
01:08:25,654 --> 01:08:26,672
They had their chance.

1004
01:08:26,697 --> 01:08:28,465
All they did was
shoot up a neighborhood,

1005
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,217
make a lot of noise,
wake up a few cops.

1006
01:08:30,242 --> 01:08:32,451
Yeah, but that was-- I told
you to put Salino onto it.

1007
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:34,721
It may take
a little more time,

1008
01:08:34,746 --> 01:08:36,306
but there won't be any holes.

1009
01:08:36,331 --> 01:08:38,559
Tell Cole I wanna see him
when he comes in.

1010
01:08:38,584 --> 01:08:40,060
Well, he won't be coming in,

1011
01:08:40,085 --> 01:08:41,979
not to get bounced
off a job, anyway.

1012
01:08:42,004 --> 01:08:44,297
This is Salino's job, Vince.

1013
01:08:45,507 --> 01:08:47,734
Cole wants to muscle in on it,
that's his business.

1014
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,028
But he's breaking the rules
and Salino won't like it.

1015
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:51,637
Now, get me the books.

1016
01:09:31,678 --> 01:09:34,781
Joe, those odds on
the third race are wrong.

1017
01:09:34,806 --> 01:09:36,724
Just a minute.
I'll get them for you.

1018
01:09:37,225 --> 01:09:39,769
Don't worry so much, lad.
You're gonna be all right.

1019
01:09:40,937 --> 01:09:43,230
Just stay to the back
the first time around.

1020
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:48,235
Put a little of this
on your nose.

1021
01:10:32,823 --> 01:10:33,948
Kelly?

1022
01:10:38,995 --> 01:10:41,288
You should always
look to the back, kid.

1023
01:10:41,665 --> 01:10:43,183
I was afraid
you wasn't gonna show.

1024
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:44,476
We haven't got much time.

1025
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:45,626
Get on with it, then.

1026
01:10:47,629 --> 01:10:49,439
Sometime after 2:00

1027
01:10:49,464 --> 01:10:51,024
a guy's gonna
call on that phone there

1028
01:10:51,049 --> 01:10:52,800
and give you
the name of a horse.

1029
01:10:54,177 --> 01:10:55,904
All you got to do
is take this $2,000

1030
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:57,614
across the street
and down the alley

1031
01:10:57,639 --> 01:10:59,866
to Shaw's place,
and bet it on that pony.

1032
01:10:59,891 --> 01:11:01,201
There's nothing to it.

1033
01:11:01,226 --> 01:11:02,452
But don't take too much time.

1034
01:11:02,477 --> 01:11:05,020
We've only got three or four
minutes after you get the call.

1035
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:07,999
You'll not break him
with a $2,000 bet.

1036
01:11:08,024 --> 01:11:10,085
This is just a test.
The big one comes later.

1037
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:12,319
But be careful with that.
That's all I got.

1038
01:11:12,487 --> 01:11:14,881
And you were gonna pay me back
out of your own pocket?

1039
01:11:14,906 --> 01:11:17,074
I am. After the race.

1040
01:11:18,201 --> 01:11:20,077
I got to get back
before Shaw misses me.

1041
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:21,662
Good luck.

1042
01:12:18,136 --> 01:12:20,304
Yeah? Go ahead.

1043
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:22,574
<i>The horse is Blue Note to win.</i>

1044
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:24,451
<i>Fourth race at Narragansett.</i>

1045
01:12:24,476 --> 01:12:25,684
Got it.

1046
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:48,266
Yeah?

1047
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:50,101
<i>Blue Note to win</i>

1048
01:12:50,126 --> 01:12:52,419
<i>in the fourth race
at Narragansett.</i>

1049
01:13:28,874 --> 01:13:31,852
<i>Turning for home,
it's Lady Scout by a length.</i>

1050
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:34,271
<i>Speed Queen a half,
Lady Trust and Miss Petrina.</i>

1051
01:13:34,296 --> 01:13:36,606
<i>Into the stretch,
it's Lady Scout ahead,</i>

1052
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:38,608
<i>Speed Queen a half.</i>

1053
01:13:38,633 --> 01:13:41,862
<i>And at the wire,
it's Speed Queen the winner!</i>

1054
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,739
<i>Lady Scout placed
and Miss Petrina showed.</i>

1055
01:13:44,764 --> 01:13:47,141
<i>Post numbers two, five,
and one.</i>

1056
01:13:47,642 --> 01:13:49,184
<i>Taking off at 23.</i>

1057
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,353
Look at that.

1058
01:13:53,356 --> 01:13:54,940
He's got his apes with him.

1059
01:13:56,109 --> 01:13:58,736
Yeah, we're gonna have to do
something about that.

1060
01:14:00,113 --> 01:14:04,158
<i>Bubblesome is 10,
Beefsteak, 7...</i>

1061
01:14:04,576 --> 01:14:07,804
<i>Vote Boy, 8, Kerry Patch, 12</i>

1062
01:14:07,829 --> 01:14:10,497
<i>and Blue Note is 7-1.</i>

1063
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:14,209
<i>This is your last call for the
third race at Lincoln Fields.</i>

1064
01:14:14,419 --> 01:14:15,812
<i>They're going to the post.</i>

1065
01:14:15,837 --> 01:14:17,230
<i>- You may still wager...</i>
- There he goes.

1066
01:14:17,255 --> 01:14:18,714
<i>...if you hurry.</i>

1067
01:14:22,177 --> 01:14:25,930
<i>At Detroit, the winner,
Speed Queen, paid $7.20</i>

1068
01:14:26,139 --> 01:14:27,866
<i>$4.80 and $3.40.</i>

1069
01:14:27,891 --> 01:14:30,392
<i>Lady Scout, $7.40.</i>

1070
01:14:30,518 --> 01:14:32,645
<i>Miss Petrina paid $4.</i>

1071
01:14:33,188 --> 01:14:35,165
<i>Last flash at Narragansett.</i>

1072
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,358
<i>Lady Higloss, 6-5.</i>

1073
01:14:40,362 --> 01:14:42,696
I'd think you'd get
tired of losing, Harrigan.

1074
01:14:42,906 --> 01:14:45,032
Thank you, Mr. Willis.

1075
01:14:45,867 --> 01:14:47,052
Blue Note,

1076
01:14:47,077 --> 01:14:50,055
$2,000 to win, fourth race,
Narragansett.

1077
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,057
Make sure
you see the cash, Eddie.

1078
01:14:52,082 --> 01:14:54,643
He's got a name for
betting money he doesn't have.

1079
01:14:54,668 --> 01:14:57,127
We'll give you the results
on that one in a minute.

1080
01:14:57,712 --> 01:14:59,689
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Arnold Rowe,</i>

1081
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:01,524
<i>your caller
for the fourth race.</i>

1082
01:15:01,549 --> 01:15:03,526
<i>The mile and one-sixteenth
Mansfield handicap</i>

1083
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,427
<i>at Narragansett Park,
Rhode Island.</i>

1084
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,806
<i>$13,000 added,
3-year-olds and up.</i>

1085
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,726
<i>The flag is up,
and they're off and running.</i>

1086
01:15:13,561 --> 01:15:15,497
<i>It's Bubblesome
going to the front,</i>

1087
01:15:15,522 --> 01:15:16,581
<i>followed by Lady Higloss,</i>

1088
01:15:16,606 --> 01:15:18,875
<i>Vote Boy, Chancing,
Beefsteak, Kerry Patch</i>

1089
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,710
<i>and Blue Note
trails the field.</i>

1090
01:15:20,735 --> 01:15:23,380
<i>Around the clubhouse turn,
it's Bubblesome ahead,</i>

1091
01:15:23,405 --> 01:15:25,674
<i>Chancing a half,
Lady Higloss by one</i>

1092
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:27,384
<i>followed by
Vote Boy, Beefsteak,</i>

1093
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:28,927
<i>Kerry Patch and Blue Note.</i>

1094
01:15:28,952 --> 01:15:31,221
<i>Into the second turn,
it's Chancing by a length.</i>

1095
01:15:31,246 --> 01:15:33,807
<i>Lady Higloss driving
on the rail and Vote Boy</i>

1096
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:36,518
<i>followed by Bubblesome, Beefsteak,
Kerry Patch and Blue Note.</i>

1097
01:15:36,543 --> 01:15:37,560
Come on, Chancing!

1098
01:15:37,585 --> 01:15:38,669
Hey, uh...

1099
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,897
<i>Lady Higloss a half,
Vote Boy by one.</i>

1100
01:15:40,922 --> 01:15:42,899
That Lady Higloss is
a hell of a finisher.

1101
01:15:42,924 --> 01:15:45,134
Chancing's gonna have to open
up a little more on her.

1102
01:15:47,095 --> 01:15:49,596
Know anything about a horse
named Blue Note?

1103
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:51,574
Nah, nah,
he never done much.

1104
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:53,910
Probably in there
just to round out the field.

1105
01:15:53,935 --> 01:15:56,103
Chancing's where you want
to have your money.

1106
01:15:59,816 --> 01:16:01,960
Great tip you handed me, kid.

1107
01:16:01,985 --> 01:16:03,503
Just give him time.

1108
01:16:03,528 --> 01:16:04,713
<i>Chancing by one.</i>

1109
01:16:04,738 --> 01:16:06,756
<i>And here comes Blue Note,
driving on the outside!</i>

1110
01:16:06,781 --> 01:16:08,091
<i>Nice work, Erie.
He loves you.</i>

1111
01:16:08,116 --> 01:16:09,342
<i>He's third!</i>

1112
01:16:09,367 --> 01:16:11,094
<i>Chancing is
shortening stride,</i>

1113
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:13,430
<i>and now it's Lady Higloss
and Blue Note.</i>

1114
01:16:13,455 --> 01:16:15,849
<i>They're head to head.
They're neck to neck.</i>

1115
01:16:15,874 --> 01:16:17,600
<i>It's Lady Higloss, Blue Note.</i>

1116
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,144
<i>Lady Higloss, Blue Note.</i>

1117
01:16:19,169 --> 01:16:22,254
<i>And Blue Note
wins it by a nose!</i>

1118
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,149
<i>Lady Higloss is second by three,</i>

1119
01:16:24,174 --> 01:16:26,008
<i>and Chancing is third by one.</i>

1120
01:16:27,677 --> 01:16:29,887
Who in the blazes
is Blue Note?

1121
01:16:30,472 --> 01:16:34,617
<i>The winner, Blue Note,
paid $16, $9.40 and $6.</i>

1122
01:16:34,642 --> 01:16:37,561
So you want to have
your money on Chancing, huh?

1123
01:16:38,605 --> 01:16:40,731
Chancing paid $3.80.

1124
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:43,317
<i>Time for the mile
and one-sixteenth.</i>

1125
01:16:53,161 --> 01:16:55,454
<i>They're going to
the gate at Belmont.</i>

1126
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:57,414
<i>And here are the late odds.</i>

1127
01:16:57,582 --> 01:16:59,625
Both those garbage men
belong to you?

1128
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:02,145
Well, get them out of here
and don't bring 'em back.

1129
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:03,796
This is a class joint.

1130
01:17:04,089 --> 01:17:06,340
Hey, you! Kelly!

1131
01:17:06,549 --> 01:17:07,633
Yes, sir?

1132
01:17:07,842 --> 01:17:09,484
Run those bums out of here.

1133
01:17:10,595 --> 01:17:12,489
Uh, M-Mr. Shaw, could I--

1134
01:17:12,514 --> 01:17:14,556
Don't give me
any of your lip, kid.

1135
01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:16,934
Now, run 'em out of here.

1136
01:17:17,685 --> 01:17:19,829
The winner is Panic Relief.

1137
01:17:19,854 --> 01:17:21,688
Barbara A is second...

1138
01:17:21,856 --> 01:17:23,107
I...

1139
01:17:23,608 --> 01:17:25,502
<i>Time for the three-quarter mile:</i>

1140
01:17:25,527 --> 01:17:26,961
<i>1:11.4.</i>

1141
01:17:26,986 --> 01:17:29,923
<i>The winner,
Panic Relief, paid $12.40</i>

1142
01:17:29,948 --> 01:17:32,199
<i>$8.20 and $5.</i>

1143
01:17:32,742 --> 01:17:35,869
<i>Barbara A, $6.20 and $4.</i>

1144
01:17:36,371 --> 01:17:38,705
<i>Wilder paid $4.</i>

1145
01:17:39,749 --> 01:17:42,393
<i>They're at the post
at Belmont at 38.</i>

1146
01:17:42,418 --> 01:17:46,547
<i>We're waiting on one.
I'll call Belmont next.</i>

1147
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:47,965
That's it, fellas!

1148
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:54,030
I want to repeat that--

1149
01:17:54,055 --> 01:17:55,222
All right, J.J.

1150
01:18:00,728 --> 01:18:02,271
What do you say, pal?

1151
01:18:12,532 --> 01:18:13,574
Yeah?

1152
01:18:18,454 --> 01:18:19,788
He's on his way.

1153
01:18:34,596 --> 01:18:35,888
Hi, Mutt.

1154
01:18:37,015 --> 01:18:38,473
Say, Jeff.

1155
01:18:40,226 --> 01:18:41,411
Well, what'd I tell you?

1156
01:18:41,436 --> 01:18:43,121
You got lucky once.
That's not enough.

1157
01:18:43,146 --> 01:18:45,248
Oh. Lucky, hell.
I can do it every time.

1158
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:46,666
Why don't you then?

1159
01:18:46,691 --> 01:18:48,650
'Cause it's better
to do it all at once.

1160
01:18:50,028 --> 01:18:52,446
We're gonna put down
$400,000 next week.

1161
01:18:52,614 --> 01:18:54,615
At 5-1 odds,
that's $2 million.

1162
01:18:54,824 --> 01:18:57,010
Twenty percent of that
is yours if you stick with it.

1163
01:18:57,035 --> 01:18:58,493
Got a system, Kelly?

1164
01:18:58,953 --> 01:19:01,580
No. You can still lose
with a system.

1165
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,665
You're past-posting,
aren't you?

1166
01:19:08,504 --> 01:19:09,796
Could be.

1167
01:19:10,506 --> 01:19:11,632
How?

1168
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,277
You're gonna stay in?

1169
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:16,278
Not until I get some answers.

1170
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,309
I got a partner downtown.

1171
01:19:23,394 --> 01:19:25,538
And he runs the central office
of the Western Union.

1172
01:19:25,563 --> 01:19:27,832
Now, race results from all
over the country come in there

1173
01:19:27,857 --> 01:19:30,084
and go across his desk
to the bookies.

1174
01:19:30,109 --> 01:19:32,337
Now, all he does is hold them
up for a couple of minutes

1175
01:19:32,362 --> 01:19:35,173
till he can call us,
get a bet down on the winner.

1176
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:37,258
Then he releases
the results to the bookies.

1177
01:19:37,283 --> 01:19:40,428
We clean up on a race that's already
been run. Now, you can't miss.

1178
01:19:40,453 --> 01:19:42,663
Unless the Western Union dicks
get a hold of it.

1179
01:19:51,297 --> 01:19:53,107
You got the $400,000 yet?

1180
01:19:53,132 --> 01:19:54,800
No, not yet, but...

1181
01:19:56,344 --> 01:19:58,387
Hey, there's only $1,000 here.

1182
01:19:58,846 --> 01:20:00,073
Make another bet tomorrow.

1183
01:20:00,098 --> 01:20:01,824
What the hell is this?
Where's my money?

1184
01:20:01,849 --> 01:20:03,034
I got $16,000 coming.

1185
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:04,302
You owe me
$15,000 already.

1186
01:20:04,327 --> 01:20:07,372
Besides, if your setup's as good as you say,
there's plenty more to come.

1187
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:08,831
I decide when to
place the bets!

1188
01:20:08,856 --> 01:20:10,850
Not if you want me
to keep making them for you.

1189
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,335
I gotta talk to my partner.

1190
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,962
We can't afford
to expose too much.

1191
01:20:13,987 --> 01:20:15,672
- I'll talk to him myself.
- No!

1192
01:20:15,697 --> 01:20:17,924
You've been waiting
a long time for this, Kelly.

1193
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:19,342
Don't ruin it for yourself.

1194
01:20:19,367 --> 01:20:21,201
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at 3:00.

1195
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:22,786
You follow?

1196
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:59,757
Twist, I told him the tale,
but he didn't go for it.

1197
01:20:59,782 --> 01:21:01,843
He wants to see my partner
tomorrow at 3:00.

1198
01:21:01,868 --> 01:21:02,969
- 3:00?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1199
01:21:02,994 --> 01:21:05,221
No, we'll never get a telegraph
store set up by then.

1200
01:21:05,246 --> 01:21:06,806
Any chance of talking him
out of it?

1201
01:21:06,831 --> 01:21:09,976
None. I would've stalled him, but I
didn't have many friends in the room.

1202
01:21:10,001 --> 01:21:12,562
Yeah. Well, all right, we'll
have to play him on the fly.

1203
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:14,063
I'll get Eddie
looking for a place.

1204
01:21:14,088 --> 01:21:15,648
<i>Let me know when
you got something.</i>

1205
01:21:15,673 --> 01:21:17,257
Sure thing, tootsie.

1206
01:21:18,468 --> 01:21:19,926
All right, Hooker!

1207
01:21:28,144 --> 01:21:29,436
Stop him!

1208
01:21:59,425 --> 01:22:00,801
Hey, watch it.

1209
01:22:40,383 --> 01:22:43,319
Hooker! Hooker!

1210
01:22:43,344 --> 01:22:45,303
I'll get you, you rat!

1211
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,514
Hooker!

1212
01:22:53,563 --> 01:22:55,623
Why didn't you tell me
about Snyder before?

1213
01:22:55,648 --> 01:22:56,999
I thought I'd lost him.

1214
01:22:57,024 --> 01:22:58,334
Well, you found him again.

1215
01:22:58,359 --> 01:23:00,569
And we're gonna have to
do something about it.

1216
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,296
What else haven't
you been telling me?

1217
01:23:02,321 --> 01:23:03,840
Nothing. That's all there is.

1218
01:23:03,865 --> 01:23:05,115
Hold still.

1219
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:07,492
Why did you move
out of your room?

1220
01:23:08,911 --> 01:23:10,245
It was too noisy.

1221
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,540
You can't play your friends
like marks, Hooker.

1222
01:23:14,776 --> 01:23:16,244
You know how easy
it would be

1223
01:23:16,269 --> 01:23:17,854
for one of
Lonnegan's guys to get you?

1224
01:23:17,879 --> 01:23:19,522
Henry, all we need
is a couple of days

1225
01:23:19,547 --> 01:23:21,631
and we can get the son
of a bitch and nail him.

1226
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:24,902
You just won't learn,
will you?

1227
01:23:24,927 --> 01:23:26,779
I come in here,
I teach you stuff

1228
01:23:26,804 --> 01:23:28,656
that maybe five guys
in the world know.

1229
01:23:28,681 --> 01:23:30,783
Stuff most grifters couldn't
do even if they knew it.

1230
01:23:30,808 --> 01:23:32,535
All you want to do
is run down a bullet.

1231
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,370
I'm asking a couple
of days, that's all.

1232
01:23:34,395 --> 01:23:35,996
I can stay clear that long!

1233
01:23:38,816 --> 01:23:41,067
Christ, they'll probably
miss you and hit me.

1234
01:24:17,605 --> 01:24:18,706
Hey.

1235
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:19,689
Hi.

1236
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,150
What will you have?

1237
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:25,796
Give me
the, uh, blue plate special.

1238
01:24:25,821 --> 01:24:27,364
One blue plate special.

1239
01:24:58,479 --> 01:24:59,580
You're done?

1240
01:24:59,605 --> 01:25:00,665
Yeah.

1241
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:02,291
Guess I should've
had the meat loaf.

1242
01:25:02,316 --> 01:25:03,567
It isn't any better.

1243
01:25:07,655 --> 01:25:09,131
Hey, where's June?

1244
01:25:09,156 --> 01:25:10,299
She quit.

1245
01:25:10,324 --> 01:25:12,093
I'm filling in for her
a couple of days

1246
01:25:12,118 --> 01:25:14,119
until I can get
a train out of here.

1247
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:15,829
Yeah? Where are you going?

1248
01:25:15,997 --> 01:25:17,139
I don't know.

1249
01:25:17,164 --> 01:25:18,832
Depends on
what train I get on.

1250
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:26,464
Keep it.

1251
01:25:27,008 --> 01:25:28,133
Thanks.

1252
01:25:44,525 --> 01:25:45,817
Let's go.

1253
01:26:08,674 --> 01:26:11,593
Excuse me, ma'am, but
we're looking for Mr., uh...

1254
01:26:11,886 --> 01:26:13,595
Harmon.
Uh, Mr. Harmon's office.

1255
01:26:13,763 --> 01:26:14,947
Mr. Harmon?

1256
01:26:14,972 --> 01:26:16,032
Yeah.

1257
01:26:16,057 --> 01:26:17,992
Got a work order here
for a painting job.

1258
01:26:18,017 --> 01:26:19,076
For Mr. Harmon's office?

1259
01:26:19,101 --> 01:26:20,161
That's right, ma'am.

1260
01:26:20,186 --> 01:26:21,811
Well, uh, hold on.
Just a second.

1261
01:26:37,453 --> 01:26:38,578
Hiya.

1262
01:26:39,246 --> 01:26:40,431
Where to?

1263
01:26:40,456 --> 01:26:41,998
110 South Wabash.

1264
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,584
110 South Wabash.
Get going.

1265
01:26:47,488 --> 01:26:48,898
What happened to your face?

1266
01:26:48,923 --> 01:26:51,800
Uh, got into a fight
with a raggle down on 13th.

1267
01:26:52,176 --> 01:26:53,760
Cut me with her ring.

1268
01:26:54,428 --> 01:26:56,262
You ought to
lay off the skirts.

1269
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:57,948
You don't find any of my boys

1270
01:26:57,973 --> 01:27:00,100
messing around
with that kind of trash.

1271
01:27:09,276 --> 01:27:11,087
Brigham signed it, all right.

1272
01:27:11,112 --> 01:27:12,922
I can't understand
why he didn't tell me.

1273
01:27:12,947 --> 01:27:15,091
Ah, he's like
all 'em supervisors.

1274
01:27:15,116 --> 01:27:17,301
They think they're too good
for regular people.

1275
01:27:17,326 --> 01:27:19,804
He says he was in here a while
ago and the place was a mess.

1276
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:22,014
We'll hurry so we don't
keep you out too long.

1277
01:27:22,039 --> 01:27:23,849
Well, why can't I work
with you in here?

1278
01:27:23,874 --> 01:27:25,960
Look, pal, we got to cover
the floor, the furniture,

1279
01:27:25,985 --> 01:27:27,436
so we don't spill on nothin'.

1280
01:27:27,461 --> 01:27:29,230
Now, if you want to sit
in here with a tarp

1281
01:27:29,255 --> 01:27:30,898
over your head,
you're welcome to it.

1282
01:27:30,923 --> 01:27:32,274
All right.
How long will you be?

1283
01:27:32,299 --> 01:27:34,467
Oh, an hour or two at the most.
It's a small job.

1284
01:28:21,974 --> 01:28:23,600
We'll go in
the side door here.

1285
01:28:35,321 --> 01:28:36,404
Hiya, Les.

1286
01:28:36,697 --> 01:28:38,674
Uh, Les,
this is Doyle Lonnegan.

1287
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:40,259
Mr. Lonnegan,
this is Les Harmon.

1288
01:28:40,284 --> 01:28:41,242
How do you do,
Mr. Lonnegan?

1289
01:28:41,368 --> 01:28:43,471
- Could we, uh...
- What did you bring him here for?

1290
01:28:43,496 --> 01:28:46,015
I thought it'd be a good idea
for him to see the operation.

1291
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,558
Kelly,
I'm having the place painted.

1292
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,250
- We can't talk in here now.
- Oh.

1293
01:28:50,002 --> 01:28:51,854
Well, we'll have to
find someplace else.

1294
01:28:51,879 --> 01:28:53,463
Excuse me, Mr. Lonnegan.

1295
01:28:58,135 --> 01:29:00,763
Yeah, Miss Barnes,
I'm going home a little early.

1296
01:29:00,788 --> 01:29:02,531
<i>Look, if there are any calls,</i>

1297
01:29:02,556 --> 01:29:05,058
<i>tell them they can reach me here
tomorrow morning. Thank you.</i>

1298
01:29:06,727 --> 01:29:07,894
Mr. Lonnegan?

1299
01:29:41,136 --> 01:29:42,988
I want to see it
one more time.

1300
01:29:43,013 --> 01:29:44,240
I can't do it.

1301
01:29:44,265 --> 01:29:45,950
We got telegraph
inspectors everywhere.

1302
01:29:45,975 --> 01:29:47,660
One more time won't
make a difference.

1303
01:29:47,685 --> 01:29:50,329
We got $400,000 coming in
from the coast next week.

1304
01:29:50,354 --> 01:29:52,647
You wanna risk that
on a lousy $15,000?

1305
01:29:53,232 --> 01:29:55,817
If it works again tomorrow,
I'll finance the whole thing.

1306
01:29:56,652 --> 01:29:59,922
$500,000.
60-40, we split.

1307
01:29:59,947 --> 01:30:02,383
What are you talking... I told
you, we've already got a guy.

1308
01:30:02,408 --> 01:30:04,844
He's gonna give us half. What
am I supposed to say to him?

1309
01:30:04,869 --> 01:30:06,494
Say to him what you want.

1310
01:30:07,162 --> 01:30:09,265
What I know about
your operation, if I were you

1311
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:11,249
I'd be worried
about making me happy.

1312
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,269
He's right, Les.
Your guy says a week.

1313
01:30:13,294 --> 01:30:14,770
How do we know it
won't be a month?

1314
01:30:14,795 --> 01:30:15,896
Lonnegan here is a banker.

1315
01:30:15,921 --> 01:30:17,815
He can get the money
without any questions asked.

1316
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,441
But we can't keep
going into Shaw's place

1317
01:30:19,466 --> 01:30:21,610
and cleaning up on long shots.
He's bound to get wise.

1318
01:30:21,635 --> 01:30:23,970
All right.
We'll go for short odds.

1319
01:30:24,138 --> 01:30:25,239
But it's still--

1320
01:30:25,264 --> 01:30:26,306
You follow?

1321
01:30:47,912 --> 01:30:49,746
You Lt. William Snyder?

1322
01:30:51,457 --> 01:30:52,957
I don't know.
What's up?

1323
01:30:53,584 --> 01:30:55,209
FBI.

1324
01:30:56,211 --> 01:30:58,564
Special Agent Polk would
like a few words with you.

1325
01:30:58,589 --> 01:31:00,423
You got a couple of minutes?

1326
01:31:00,883 --> 01:31:02,216
Yeah, sure.

1327
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:32,097
No, no, no. It's got to be
south of the river.

1328
01:31:32,122 --> 01:31:34,058
Probably this
section in here.

1329
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:36,936
31st, 39th,
Morgan and Halstead.

1330
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:39,337
Now, that's
this section here.

1331
01:31:40,756 --> 01:31:43,883
Now, let's break it
into two sections along 35th.

1332
01:31:45,386 --> 01:31:47,095
What is this?
I got work to do.

1333
01:31:48,722 --> 01:31:50,723
Sit down and
shut up, will you?

1334
01:31:51,141 --> 01:31:53,601
Try not to live up
to all my expectations.

1335
01:31:55,062 --> 01:31:56,872
Take two men with you.
work your way south

1336
01:31:56,897 --> 01:31:59,565
from 31st to 35th,
Morgan and Halstead.

1337
01:31:59,817 --> 01:32:02,402
Go into every place and
let me know what you find.

1338
01:32:09,284 --> 01:32:11,011
We've been told
you know a hustle artist

1339
01:32:11,036 --> 01:32:12,328
named Johnny Hooker.

1340
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,807
You know him or don't you?

1341
01:32:14,832 --> 01:32:16,350
Yeah, but I don't know
where he is.

1342
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:17,617
Well, we do.

1343
01:32:17,835 --> 01:32:19,436
He's chumming around
with a big "C"

1344
01:32:19,461 --> 01:32:20,795
named Henry Gondorff.

1345
01:32:22,047 --> 01:32:23,131
Ring any bells?

1346
01:32:23,382 --> 01:32:25,693
Sure. Every bunco man in
the country knows Gondorff.

1347
01:32:25,718 --> 01:32:27,486
Well, there's word
he's gonna run a con

1348
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:28,761
on the South Side here.

1349
01:32:29,555 --> 01:32:31,532
We've got a year-old
Florida warrant on him,

1350
01:32:31,557 --> 01:32:32,908
but it's a thin beef.

1351
01:32:32,933 --> 01:32:35,768
He can beat it in court
unless we catch him cold.

1352
01:32:36,854 --> 01:32:39,164
All we want you to do
is pick up Hooker for us.

1353
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:41,065
Why don't you
pick him up yourself?

1354
01:32:42,401 --> 01:32:44,586
Because if word gets out
that the feds are in on it,

1355
01:32:44,611 --> 01:32:46,487
Gondorff will fold up
the whole thing.

1356
01:32:46,613 --> 01:32:48,114
Wouldn't that be too bad?

1357
01:32:48,365 --> 01:32:50,426
Then you'd have to move out
of this nice office

1358
01:32:50,451 --> 01:32:51,617
you've got here.

1359
01:32:54,121 --> 01:32:56,539
Don't crack wise
with me, flatfoot.

1360
01:32:57,124 --> 01:32:59,268
I spent too much time
in dumps like this

1361
01:32:59,293 --> 01:33:00,394
eating Gondorff's dust

1362
01:33:00,419 --> 01:33:02,271
while you guys in
the bunco squads get rich

1363
01:33:02,296 --> 01:33:03,671
tipping him off!

1364
01:33:03,797 --> 01:33:05,631
That's not gonna
happen this time.

1365
01:33:06,592 --> 01:33:08,801
We're not gonna tell
the police we're here.

1366
01:33:09,803 --> 01:33:11,780
You keep your mouth shut
and do a job,

1367
01:33:11,805 --> 01:33:13,848
there'll be some
reward bucks in it for you.

1368
01:33:14,183 --> 01:33:15,793
And you better take it,

1369
01:33:16,018 --> 01:33:18,311
'cause I can make you
work for us without it.

1370
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,314
What the hell good
is Hooker to you?

1371
01:33:21,815 --> 01:33:23,816
He's gonna set up
Gondorff for us.

1372
01:33:25,486 --> 01:33:26,819
He'll never do it.

1373
01:33:27,071 --> 01:33:28,321
I think he will.

1374
01:33:51,428 --> 01:33:52,887
He's there.
Let's get on it.

1375
01:33:55,182 --> 01:33:56,724
What's the line on Exponent?

1376
01:33:57,142 --> 01:33:59,268
Uh, 5-1.

1377
01:34:00,979 --> 01:34:01,997
How's it going?

1378
01:34:02,022 --> 01:34:03,165
Ah, nothing yet.

1379
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:05,334
I had a good one on the lead
at Lincoln Fields,

1380
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:06,502
but he faded.

1381
01:34:06,527 --> 01:34:08,712
Best we had the last hour
was Love Potion

1382
01:34:08,737 --> 01:34:10,947
at Rockingham
and she was 5-1.

1383
01:34:11,615 --> 01:34:13,533
All the long shots
coming in today.

1384
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:17,054
Take 4-1
if you have to.

1385
01:34:17,079 --> 01:34:18,412
Okay.

1386
01:34:20,332 --> 01:34:22,416
You can forget
the boodle, Eddie.

1387
01:34:22,543 --> 01:34:24,478
He could hit us
for $15,000 at 4-1.

1388
01:34:24,503 --> 01:34:25,521
We can't handle that.

1389
01:34:25,546 --> 01:34:26,855
We'll give him
the shut-out.

1390
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,922
Okay.

1391
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,550
Okay, Billie, here we go.

1392
01:34:31,468 --> 01:34:34,530
At the wire, it's Wrecking
Crew, the winner by five.

1393
01:34:34,555 --> 01:34:38,283
Black Mischief, second.
Whichaway, third.

1394
01:34:38,308 --> 01:34:41,936
Wrecking Crew was 3-1.
That's our boy.

1395
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,441
Henry?

1396
01:34:51,196 --> 01:34:53,465
Here we go, Henry.
We got a 3-1 at Belmont.

1397
01:34:53,490 --> 01:34:54,574
Wrecking Crew.

1398
01:34:57,911 --> 01:34:58,911
Yeah?

1399
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:04,709
Right.

1400
01:35:19,683 --> 01:35:20,742
Yeah?

1401
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:22,744
<i>In the sixth race at Belmont.</i>

1402
01:35:22,769 --> 01:35:25,539
<i>Wrecking Crew to win,
Black Mischief to place,</i>

1403
01:35:25,564 --> 01:35:27,064
<i>Whichaway to show.</i>

1404
01:35:38,285 --> 01:35:39,452
Wait here.

1405
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:46,768
<i>The winner,
Time to Go, paid $7</i>

1406
01:35:46,793 --> 01:35:49,045
<i>$5.40 and $3.80.</i>

1407
01:35:49,338 --> 01:35:52,340
<i>Joy Flag, $6 and $4.20.</i>

1408
01:35:52,841 --> 01:35:55,134
<i>Readily paid $3.80 to show.</i>

1409
01:35:55,844 --> 01:35:58,155
<i>The weather's threatening,
but the track is fast</i>

1410
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,805
<i>there in Salem,
New Hampshire.</i>

1411
01:36:02,267 --> 01:36:03,660
<i>Here's a late jockey change</i>

1412
01:36:03,685 --> 01:36:05,102
<i>there in the fifth
at Rockingham.</i>

1413
01:36:05,604 --> 01:36:08,773
<i>R.C. Stark
will ride Itsie-Bitsie.</i>

1414
01:36:10,108 --> 01:36:12,669
$5,000 on Black Mischief,
across the board.

1415
01:36:12,694 --> 01:36:14,028
The sixth at Belmont.

1416
01:36:16,365 --> 01:36:18,157
Would you hurry it up
there, please?

1417
01:36:19,201 --> 01:36:23,120
<i>Wrecking Crew is 3-1,
Vale of Tears, 4</i>

1418
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:26,558
<i>Black Mischief, 5,
Whichaway, 6</i>

1419
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:30,479
<i>Chief Yeoman, 12,
Peerless Pal is 20...</i>

1420
01:36:30,504 --> 01:36:31,730
Okay.

1421
01:36:31,755 --> 01:36:33,273
and Mariato is, uh, 40.

1422
01:36:33,298 --> 01:36:35,317
<i>And here we go for
the sixth at Belmont:</i>

1423
01:36:35,342 --> 01:36:36,735
<i>it's five
and a half furlongs.</i>

1424
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:37,903
<i>They're at the post.</i>

1425
01:36:37,928 --> 01:36:39,071
- Now.
- <i>The flag is up.</i>

1426
01:36:39,096 --> 01:36:40,571
<i>- And they're off!</i>
- 6th race, Belmont, $15,000.

1427
01:36:40,755 --> 01:36:43,742
Excuse me, sir. We can't take
any bets once the race is started.

1428
01:36:43,767 --> 01:36:46,143
You can bet on
another race if you care to.

1429
01:36:47,354 --> 01:36:50,207
<i>Going into the backstretch,
it's Wrecking Crew by two.</i>

1430
01:36:50,232 --> 01:36:52,000
<i>Whichaway a half,
Black Mischief</i>

1431
01:36:52,025 --> 01:36:53,961
<i>and Vale of Tears
driving on the outside.</i>

1432
01:36:53,986 --> 01:36:55,170
Nothing, thank you.

1433
01:36:55,195 --> 01:36:56,529
What happened?

1434
01:36:56,905 --> 01:36:58,781
I didn't get
the bet down in time.

1435
01:36:59,825 --> 01:37:00,866
Jesus!

1436
01:37:03,453 --> 01:37:05,597
<i>Heading for home,
it's Wrecking Crew all alone</i>

1437
01:37:05,622 --> 01:37:06,848
<i>by six lengths</i>

1438
01:37:06,873 --> 01:37:09,142
<i>Whichaway a length,
and Vale of Tears.</i>

1439
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:11,436
<i>It's Wrecking Crew,
Whichaway and Black Mischief.</i>

1440
01:37:11,461 --> 01:37:12,729
<i>And at the wire,</i>

1441
01:37:12,754 --> 01:37:15,190
<i>Wrecking Crew
wins it by six lengths.</i>

1442
01:37:15,215 --> 01:37:17,359
<i>Black Mischief
is second by a head</i>

1443
01:37:17,384 --> 01:37:20,636
<i>Whichaway is third by a neck,
followed by Vale of Tears.</i>

1444
01:37:21,388 --> 01:37:23,681
<i>You should've had your money
on Wrecking Crew.</i>

1445
01:37:24,016 --> 01:37:26,910
<i>It's raining and the track is
sloppy there at Riverside Park.</i>

1446
01:37:26,935 --> 01:37:28,620
<i>There's a late scratch there.</i>

1447
01:37:28,645 --> 01:37:32,231
<i>Transmutate--Transmutate is scratched
in the fifth at Riverside.</i>

1448
01:37:32,733 --> 01:37:35,377
<i>At Belmont,
the winner, Wrecking Crew</i>

1449
01:37:35,402 --> 01:37:38,362
<i>paid $6, $4.20 and $2.80.</i>

1450
01:37:38,613 --> 01:37:41,407
<i>Black Mischief,
$4.60 and $3.20.</i>

1451
01:37:45,996 --> 01:37:48,664
I'll have $500,000 here
by post time tomorrow.

1452
01:37:49,207 --> 01:37:51,727
Lay it on the first race where
the odds are 4-1 or better.

1453
01:37:51,752 --> 01:37:53,562
Make sure I get
to the window this time.

1454
01:37:53,587 --> 01:37:54,771
How the hell
am I gonna do that?

1455
01:37:54,796 --> 01:37:57,548
I don't know. Figure it out
for yourself, Kelly.

1456
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:26,577
Finished?

1457
01:38:27,162 --> 01:38:30,247
Yeah. Meat loaf, apple pie
and a cup of coffee.

1458
01:38:37,047 --> 01:38:38,732
Say, what time
you get off work here?

1459
01:38:38,757 --> 01:38:39,941
2:00 a.m.

1460
01:38:39,966 --> 01:38:41,675
Yeah? Doing anything tonight?

1461
01:38:41,968 --> 01:38:43,844
Yeah. Sleeping.

1462
01:38:45,138 --> 01:38:46,305
Eighty-five.

1463
01:39:04,282 --> 01:39:06,009
Uh, you got a back door
to this place?

1464
01:39:06,034 --> 01:39:07,219
What's wrong with the front?

1465
01:39:07,244 --> 01:39:10,138
No time to mess around. There's a
guy out there I don't need to see.

1466
01:39:10,163 --> 01:39:11,390
Don't look around.

1467
01:39:11,415 --> 01:39:12,474
What does he want?

1468
01:39:12,499 --> 01:39:13,725
He'd like to kill me.

1469
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:16,019
Now, look, do me a favor.
Go into the bathroom,

1470
01:39:16,044 --> 01:39:17,920
open the window
and wait there.

1471
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:20,941
Why should I-- Just do what I tell
you, and everything will be Jake.

1472
01:39:20,966 --> 01:39:22,007
Please.

1473
01:39:29,558 --> 01:39:31,183
Thanks. Good night.

1474
01:40:04,968 --> 01:40:06,218
It's taken.

1475
01:40:24,905 --> 01:40:26,280
Thanks. See you.

1476
01:40:31,578 --> 01:40:32,661
Shit.

1477
01:41:15,956 --> 01:41:18,040
Salino. Hey, I wasn't...

1478
01:41:42,774 --> 01:41:45,150
Hey! Got you, Hooker!

1479
01:41:45,777 --> 01:41:47,796
Hey there, Snyder.
Long time no see.

1480
01:41:47,821 --> 01:41:49,029
Get going!

1481
01:42:17,475 --> 01:42:18,601
Chuck,

1482
01:42:19,853 --> 01:42:21,788
get this off to
the Department right away.

1483
01:42:21,813 --> 01:42:23,188
Yes, sir.

1484
01:42:39,414 --> 01:42:42,207
Hello, Hooker. Take them off.

1485
01:42:44,085 --> 01:42:46,045
Special Agent Polk, FBI.

1486
01:42:46,379 --> 01:42:47,630
Have a chair.

1487
01:42:50,717 --> 01:42:52,027
You want
a drink or something?

1488
01:42:52,052 --> 01:42:53,052
No.

1489
01:42:54,679 --> 01:42:56,847
We want to talk to you
about Henry Gondorff.

1490
01:42:58,558 --> 01:43:00,368
Yeah? I don't think
I know him.

1491
01:43:00,393 --> 01:43:02,287
Well, give yourself
a couple of seconds.

1492
01:43:02,312 --> 01:43:04,063
You wouldn't
want to lie to me.

1493
01:43:04,564 --> 01:43:06,833
Lt. Snyder says you've done
a lot of confidence work

1494
01:43:06,858 --> 01:43:07,876
in his town.

1495
01:43:07,901 --> 01:43:09,902
Oh, yeah? Lt. Snyder
doesn't know shit.

1496
01:43:11,613 --> 01:43:13,423
You ain't got nothing on me.

1497
01:43:13,448 --> 01:43:14,573
Yeah?

1498
01:43:15,492 --> 01:43:17,034
How about counterfeiting?

1499
01:43:20,497 --> 01:43:22,724
We've got a tip that Gondorff
is gonna run a con

1500
01:43:22,749 --> 01:43:24,166
on the South Side here.

1501
01:43:24,876 --> 01:43:26,394
All you've got
to do is tell us

1502
01:43:26,419 --> 01:43:28,045
when he's gonna
play his chump.

1503
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:30,148
We come in at the sting,
make the pinch,

1504
01:43:30,173 --> 01:43:32,925
and you walk out
free as a bird.

1505
01:43:34,552 --> 01:43:35,594
No.

1506
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:38,990
You want to spend
the next 20 years

1507
01:43:39,015 --> 01:43:41,266
in a federal penitentiary,
starting tonight?

1508
01:43:42,727 --> 01:43:43,936
I'll make parole.

1509
01:43:44,813 --> 01:43:47,832
Like hell.
You won't even get a review.

1510
01:43:47,857 --> 01:43:48,982
I'll chance it.

1511
01:43:52,529 --> 01:43:55,698
Okay. If that's the way
you want it.

1512
01:43:56,324 --> 01:43:58,176
We might even provide you
with a little company

1513
01:43:58,201 --> 01:43:59,594
on your way up the river.

1514
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:01,179
That wife of Luther Coleman's.

1515
01:44:01,204 --> 01:44:02,538
Snyder, what was her name?

1516
01:44:02,956 --> 01:44:05,141
Alva.

1517
01:44:05,166 --> 01:44:06,625
That's it. Alva Coleman.

1518
01:44:07,919 --> 01:44:09,962
Pretty fair grifter
in her time.

1519
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:12,798
Snyder's given us
quite a folder on her.

1520
01:44:13,967 --> 01:44:16,635
Nothing major by itself,
but, uh,

1521
01:44:16,886 --> 01:44:19,638
put them all together, it could
add up to a lot of years.

1522
01:44:21,641 --> 01:44:23,308
You stink, mister.

1523
01:44:23,977 --> 01:44:25,644
Don't be a sap.

1524
01:44:25,937 --> 01:44:27,438
It's not her I want.

1525
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:31,042
If you're too dumb
to save yourself,

1526
01:44:31,067 --> 01:44:33,277
there's no sense
dragging her down with you.

1527
01:44:55,508 --> 01:44:57,217
It's over, Hooker.

1528
01:44:59,053 --> 01:45:00,929
You can save me
a lot of trouble.

1529
01:45:01,806 --> 01:45:03,575
But I'm gonna
get Henry Gondorff

1530
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,392
whether you
help me out or not.

1531
01:45:21,117 --> 01:45:22,927
Will you wait till
the chump is played?

1532
01:45:22,952 --> 01:45:24,304
Hell, yes.

1533
01:45:24,329 --> 01:45:26,806
We don't care about the mark.
He deserves what he gets.

1534
01:45:26,831 --> 01:45:27,891
I mean completely played.

1535
01:45:27,916 --> 01:45:30,209
You come in before we beat him,
and I'll kill him.

1536
01:45:31,669 --> 01:45:33,045
All right, Hooker.

1537
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,839
But you try to
take it on the lam,

1538
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:38,050
and we'll shoot
you down on sight.

1539
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:48,268
As long as I get
to finish the play.

1540
01:45:58,571 --> 01:46:00,823
What is it, kid?
You're not saying much.

1541
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:02,300
Just got the jumps.

1542
01:46:02,325 --> 01:46:03,784
Come in.

1543
01:46:04,077 --> 01:46:05,804
Things are a little slow
tonight, Henry.

1544
01:46:05,829 --> 01:46:07,680
I want to open
the round for the girls.

1545
01:46:07,705 --> 01:46:08,872
Sure.

1546
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:16,397
Take it easy, kid.
We're not gonna lose him now.

1547
01:46:16,422 --> 01:46:18,966
We had him 10 years ago
when he decided to be somebody.

1548
01:46:19,801 --> 01:46:21,969
Believe me, I've seen
enough to know. 10.

1549
01:46:22,595 --> 01:46:23,655
20.

1550
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,739
30.

1551
01:46:24,764 --> 01:46:25,949
Go.

1552
01:46:25,974 --> 01:46:27,182
31.

1553
01:46:33,481 --> 01:46:35,899
How many guys you conned
in your life, Henry?

1554
01:46:36,943 --> 01:46:38,877
I don't know, 200, 300.

1555
01:46:39,654 --> 01:46:43,407
Sometimes we played two a day
when I was with O'Shea's mob.

1556
01:46:44,492 --> 01:46:46,785
Of course,
Chicago was a rigged town.

1557
01:46:46,953 --> 01:46:48,263
The fix was in.

1558
01:46:48,288 --> 01:46:50,372
The dicks took their end
without a beef.

1559
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:53,625
We had it down to a business.

1560
01:46:55,628 --> 01:46:57,379
And it really stunk, kid.

1561
01:46:57,589 --> 01:46:59,107
No sense in being a grifter

1562
01:46:59,132 --> 01:47:01,091
if it's the same
as being a citizen.

1563
01:47:02,635 --> 01:47:03,862
Well, I got packing to do.

1564
01:47:03,887 --> 01:47:06,388
I'm gonna be a hot number
again after tomorrow.

1565
01:47:17,734 --> 01:47:20,485
I wouldn't ask you to do this, you
know, if it weren't for Luther.

1566
01:47:21,654 --> 01:47:23,530
Nothing's gonna
make up for Luther.

1567
01:47:24,324 --> 01:47:25,800
Revenge is for suckers.

1568
01:47:25,825 --> 01:47:28,160
I've been grifting 30 years.
I never got any.

1569
01:47:31,789 --> 01:47:33,081
Then why are you doing it?

1570
01:47:34,584 --> 01:47:36,376
It seems worthwhile,
doesn't it?

1571
01:47:44,093 --> 01:47:45,135
See you.

1572
01:50:06,194 --> 01:50:07,652
Looks like he missed you.

1573
01:50:08,112 --> 01:50:10,197
Uh, yeah. This time, anyway.

1574
01:50:11,365 --> 01:50:13,033
Good night,
Mrs. Hillard.

1575
01:50:20,708 --> 01:50:22,477
I, uh, was wondering

1576
01:50:22,502 --> 01:50:24,479
if you might want
to come out for a while

1577
01:50:24,504 --> 01:50:26,338
maybe have
a drink or something.

1578
01:50:26,506 --> 01:50:28,381
You move right along,
don't you?

1579
01:50:29,342 --> 01:50:31,384
Hey, I don't mean
nothing by it.

1580
01:50:32,136 --> 01:50:34,346
I just don't know many
regular girls, is all.

1581
01:50:35,306 --> 01:50:37,575
And you expect me
to come out just like that?

1582
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,785
If I expected something,

1583
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:41,162
I wouldn't still be
standing here in the hall.

1584
01:50:41,187 --> 01:50:42,813
I don't even know you.

1585
01:50:44,148 --> 01:50:45,315
You know me.

1586
01:50:46,275 --> 01:50:47,692
I'm just like you.

1587
01:50:48,945 --> 01:50:51,154
It's 2:00 in the morning,
and I don't know nobody.

1588
01:51:18,141 --> 01:51:20,392
Come on, Henry. Knock off.

1589
01:51:21,227 --> 01:51:22,978
You've done
everything you can.

1590
01:55:54,792 --> 01:55:56,060
Yeah? Polk.

1591
01:55:56,085 --> 01:55:57,770
<i>Polk, this is Hooker.</i>

1592
01:55:57,795 --> 01:55:58,896
<i>You ready?</i>

1593
01:55:58,921 --> 01:56:00,130
Yeah, go ahead.

1594
01:56:00,381 --> 01:56:01,482
Everything's all set.

1595
01:56:01,507 --> 01:56:03,067
There'll be a guy
or two at the door.

1596
01:56:03,092 --> 01:56:05,277
Nobody's carrying heaters.
You won't have any trouble.

1597
01:56:05,302 --> 01:56:06,678
Okay. See you there.

1598
01:57:10,201 --> 01:57:11,910
She was gonna kill you, kid.

1599
01:57:12,286 --> 01:57:14,078
Her name's Loretta Salino.

1600
01:57:14,371 --> 01:57:16,390
Lonnegan's people
set her up in the diner.

1601
01:57:16,415 --> 01:57:17,558
Come on.

1602
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:19,209
Let's get out of here.

1603
01:57:20,419 --> 01:57:28,176
Come on!

1604
01:57:34,058 --> 01:57:36,100
But she could have
killed me last night.

1605
01:57:36,769 --> 01:57:39,079
Too many people could have
seen you go in her room.

1606
01:57:39,104 --> 01:57:40,581
She was a real professional.

1607
01:57:40,606 --> 01:57:42,524
Used to work in
the Dutch Schultz mob.

1608
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:45,610
Who are you?

1609
01:57:46,862 --> 01:57:48,780
Gondorff asked me
to look after you.

1610
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:00,708
Snyder,

1611
01:58:01,126 --> 01:58:03,145
we just got a tip
that Gondorff's mark

1612
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:04,879
is some big New York wheel.

1613
01:58:05,256 --> 01:58:07,942
As soon as we're inside,
you get him out of there fast

1614
01:58:07,967 --> 01:58:09,276
before the reporters show up.

1615
01:58:09,301 --> 01:58:10,945
I don't want any
big shots around

1616
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:12,178
to mess this up for me.

1617
01:58:12,429 --> 01:58:13,763
All right, let's go!

1618
01:59:15,242 --> 01:59:16,576
Let's go, guys!

1619
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:19,495
The flag is up, kid.

1620
01:59:26,545 --> 01:59:27,855
Anytime, J.J.

1621
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:29,380
I'm working on it.

1622
01:59:40,517 --> 01:59:41,702
Got one, Billie.
Here we go.

1623
01:59:41,727 --> 01:59:42,727
Okay.

1624
01:59:56,909 --> 01:59:58,010
Yeah?

1625
01:59:58,035 --> 01:59:59,470
<i>Place it on Lucky Dan</i>

1626
01:59:59,495 --> 02:00:01,537
<i>third race at Riverside Park.</i>

1627
02:00:21,809 --> 02:00:24,060
<i>1:11.6 seconds.</i>

1628
02:00:24,478 --> 02:00:26,396
<i>They were off at 21.</i>

1629
02:00:28,148 --> 02:00:31,067
<i>Last call on
the third at Riverside Park.</i>

1630
02:00:31,402 --> 02:00:32,902
<i>They're at the post.</i>

1631
02:00:33,612 --> 02:00:36,656
<i>At Havre De Grace,
the winner, Light Chatter</i>

1632
02:00:36,949 --> 02:00:40,118
<i>paid, uh, $5.40, $3.80</i>

1633
02:00:40,285 --> 02:00:43,204
<i>and $2.40. Blacksod...</i>

1634
02:00:43,455 --> 02:00:45,790
$500,000 to win.

1635
02:00:46,875 --> 02:00:49,961
Lucky Dan,
third race at Riverside.

1636
02:00:52,256 --> 02:00:53,548
You heard me.

1637
02:00:56,009 --> 02:00:58,761
Hold on, sir.
I'll get the manager.

1638
02:00:58,929 --> 02:01:00,656
<i>...in the fourth at Belmont.</i>

1639
02:01:00,681 --> 02:01:03,641
<i>Jay Stout will
ride Flying Cross.</i>

1640
02:01:04,852 --> 02:01:06,203
See that guy up there?

1641
02:01:06,228 --> 02:01:08,479
He just put
$500,000 on Lucky Dan.

1642
02:01:10,315 --> 02:01:12,483
<i>The winner at Rockingham Park</i>

1643
02:01:12,776 --> 02:01:15,778
<i>Enfin, paid $6.10</i>

1644
02:01:16,071 --> 02:01:18,489
<i>$4.30 and $2.50.</i>

1645
02:01:23,829 --> 02:01:25,163
What's your problem?

1646
02:01:25,456 --> 02:01:27,975
I'm putting $500,000
on Lucky Dan to win.

1647
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,601
Third race at Riverside.

1648
02:01:29,626 --> 02:01:31,085
Can't lay that off in time.

1649
02:01:32,129 --> 02:01:33,796
A bet like that
could break us.

1650
02:01:35,883 --> 02:01:37,967
Not only are you a cheat

1651
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:40,845
you're a gutless cheat
as well.

1652
02:01:45,642 --> 02:01:46,952
What are the odds?

1653
02:01:46,977 --> 02:01:48,269
4-1.

1654
02:01:51,565 --> 02:01:53,107
Take all of it.

1655
02:02:04,077 --> 02:02:06,138
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Arnold Rowe

1656
02:02:06,163 --> 02:02:08,891
<i>calling the third race at
Riverside Park in Kansas City.</i>

1657
02:02:08,916 --> 02:02:12,186
<i>This is a claiming race for
$1,500 for 3-year-olds and up.</i>

1658
02:02:12,211 --> 02:02:14,104
<i>It's been raining,
and the track is muddy.</i>

1659
02:02:14,129 --> 02:02:17,965
<i>The flag is up and
they're off and running.</i>

1660
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:20,360
<i>Dr. Twink is going to the front</i>

1661
02:02:20,385 --> 02:02:23,781
<i>followed by Lucky Dan,
Ima Dreamer, Orkin</i>

1662
02:02:23,806 --> 02:02:26,700
<i>Josie G.,
Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1663
02:02:26,725 --> 02:02:29,870
Around the clubhouse turn,
it's Lucky Dan ahead

1664
02:02:29,895 --> 02:02:32,414
<i>Dr. Twink a length,
Orkin a half</i>

1665
02:02:32,439 --> 02:02:34,917
<i>followed by Ima Dreamer,
Josie G.,</i>

1666
02:02:34,942 --> 02:02:36,901
<i>Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1667
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:38,879
<i>Into the backstretch</i>

1668
02:02:38,904 --> 02:02:41,632
<i>it's Lucky Dan a length,
Dr. Twink a half</i>

1669
02:02:41,657 --> 02:02:43,884
<i>Orkin a head,
Ima Dreamer by one.</i>

1670
02:02:43,909 --> 02:02:45,535
Sorry, I couldn't wait.

1671
02:02:45,869 --> 02:02:47,495
Everything going all right?

1672
02:02:48,163 --> 02:02:49,914
You got nothing to worry about.

1673
02:02:51,250 --> 02:02:53,125
I put it all on Lucky Dan.

1674
02:02:53,752 --> 02:02:55,878
$500,000 to win.

1675
02:02:57,339 --> 02:02:58,422
To win?

1676
02:03:00,175 --> 02:03:03,427
I said place!
Place it on Lucky...

1677
02:03:03,762 --> 02:03:05,638
That horse is
gonna run second!

1678
02:03:05,848 --> 02:03:07,908
<i>Ima Dreamer a half,
Dr. Twink a half</i>

1679
02:03:07,933 --> 02:03:10,309
<i>and Orkin by two,
followed by Little Star.</i>

1680
02:03:11,436 --> 02:03:12,704
<i>It's a driving finish!</i>

1681
02:03:12,729 --> 02:03:13,997
There's been a mistake.

1682
02:03:14,022 --> 02:03:15,666
- Give me my money back!
- No, I'm sorry--

1683
02:03:15,691 --> 02:03:17,334
I tell you
there's been a mistake!

1684
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:18,943
Give me my
goddamn money back!

1685
02:03:19,611 --> 02:03:22,422
All right, everybody, FBI!
Don't anybody try to leave.

1686
02:03:22,447 --> 02:03:24,758
Stand on your feet,
put your hands over your head

1687
02:03:24,783 --> 02:03:26,176
and move nice and slow.

1688
02:03:26,201 --> 02:03:27,326
Snyder!

1689
02:03:28,912 --> 02:03:30,722
All right.
Get 'em up against the wall.

1690
02:03:30,747 --> 02:03:32,582
Make sure they're
not carrying anything.

1691
02:03:36,545 --> 02:03:39,505
Hello, Henry.
It's been a long time.

1692
02:03:40,215 --> 02:03:41,549
But it's over.

1693
02:03:42,968 --> 02:03:44,677
Okay, kid, you can go.

1694
02:03:46,638 --> 02:03:49,140
All right, I said hands up.
Keep 'em up!

1695
02:03:49,683 --> 02:03:52,643
Come on.
Move them back! Put them up!

1696
02:04:12,289 --> 02:04:14,999
Get him out. Get him out!

1697
02:04:16,043 --> 02:04:18,628
Come on!
Got to get you out of here!

1698
02:04:28,889 --> 02:04:30,032
Come on!

1699
02:04:30,057 --> 02:04:31,366
But my money's in there!

1700
02:04:31,391 --> 02:04:32,951
There's a couple of
dead guys, too.

1701
02:04:32,976 --> 02:04:34,286
You can't get
mixed up in that.

1702
02:04:34,311 --> 02:04:35,495
You don't understand.

1703
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,188
There's $500,000 in there!

1704
02:04:48,075 --> 02:04:49,283
He's gone.

1705
02:04:56,124 --> 02:04:58,000
Okay, Henry, all clear.

1706
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:18,562
Can you believe it?
We pulled it off.

1707
02:05:19,731 --> 02:05:21,166
It's a nice con, Hickey.

1708
02:05:21,191 --> 02:05:23,877
I thought you were the feds
myself when you came in.

1709
02:05:23,902 --> 02:05:25,379
No trouble, Henry.

1710
02:05:25,404 --> 02:05:27,089
Snyder went for it
all the way.

1711
02:05:27,114 --> 02:05:29,573
You should've seen the rag
he lit under Lonnegan!

1712
02:05:35,706 --> 02:05:37,289
Well, kid, you beat him.

1713
02:05:39,543 --> 02:05:42,420
You're right, Henry.
It's not enough.

1714
02:05:45,048 --> 02:05:47,133
But it's close.

1715
02:05:50,262 --> 02:05:53,240
Okay, guys, let's take
this place apart fast.

1716
02:05:53,265 --> 02:05:56,100
You can pick up your splits
from Eddie at Boudreau's tonight.

1717
02:06:01,690 --> 02:06:03,441
Nice going, J.J.

1718
02:06:06,236 --> 02:06:08,029
Oh, Henry!

1719
02:06:24,629 --> 02:06:26,630
You're not gonna stick around
for your share?

1720
02:06:28,383 --> 02:06:30,468
Nah. I'd only blow it.

1721
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000


1722
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000


1723
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
