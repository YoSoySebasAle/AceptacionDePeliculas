00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,834
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,003
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,714
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,174
Thank you.

6
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:39,567
- Mr. Ullman?
- Yes.

7
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:43,029
- I'm Jack Torrance.
- Oh, come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:46,658
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,868
- This is my secretary, Susie.
- Hello.

10
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:51,288
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,332
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 31/2 hours.

12
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,418
That's very good time.

13
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,378
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:00,380
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:01,840
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,551
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,719
- Susie.
- Sure.

18
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:07,679
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:09,306
Yes, I will.

(MUSIC PLAYS ON TV)

21
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,318
Mom?

22
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,361
Yeah?

23
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:27,407
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

24
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:29,367
Sure I do.

25
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:31,494
It'll be lots of fun.

26
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:35,457
Yeah. I guess so.

27
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,836
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

28
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,257
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

29
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,053
Yeah, I guess so.

30
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:49,846
What about Tony?

31
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,432
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

32
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,352
(IN TONY'S VOICE)
<i>No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

33
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,188
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

34
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,607
<i>I don't want to go there.</i>

35
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,109
How come you don't want to go?

36
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,445
<i>I just don't.</i>

37
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:08,448
Let's just wait and see.

38
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,409
We're all going to
have a real good time.

39
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:15,246
Bill, I'd like you to
meet Jack Torrance.

40
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:16,873
How do you do, Bill?

41
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,042
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

42
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,169
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

43
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:25,507
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

44
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,676
I'd like you to take him
around soon as we're through.

45
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:29,844
Fine.

46
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,013
Jack is a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:34,641
Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.

48
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,518
BILL: What line of work are you in now?

49
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,311
I'm a writer.

50
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:42,190
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

51
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,359
This ought to be quite
a change for you.

52
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:47,112
Well, I'm looking for a change.

53
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:50,907
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

54
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,700
...I agree with them.

55
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,161
Let's see, where were we?

56
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,956
I was about to explain...

57
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:02,335
...that our season here runs
from May 15th to October 30th.

58
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:06,005
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

59
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:09,008
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

60
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:12,679
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

61
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,515
It would be.
The problem is the enormous cost...

62
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:18,268
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

63
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,645
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

64
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:23,189
It gets 20 feet of
snow during the winter.

65
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,651
There's just no way to make
it economically feasible...

66
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,778
...to keep it clear.

67
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,364
When the place was built in 1907...

68
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:34,117
...there was very little
interest in winter sports.

69
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:39,205
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

70
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:41,958
It's certainly got plenty of that.

71
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,376
That's right.

72
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:46,880
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

73
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,756
...about what the job entails?

74
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:51,050
Only in a very general way.

75
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:53,303
Well...

76
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,139
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

77
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:59,809
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

78
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,020
...and depreciation which can occur.

79
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,647
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

80
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:08,818
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

81
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,738
...repairing damage as it occurs...

82
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,741
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

83
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:18,077
That sounds fine to me.

84
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,414
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

85
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,792
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

86
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:27,629
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

87
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:33,343
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

88
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,804
I'm outlining a new writing project.

89
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,517
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

90
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:43,019
That's very good, Jack.

91
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:46,481
Because, for some people...

92
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,441
...solitude...

93
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,276
...and isolation...

94
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:53,446
...can, of itself, become a problem.

95
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,823
Not for me.

96
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,619
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

97
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:02,580
They'll love it.

98
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,957
Great.

99
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,129
Well, before I turn you over to Bill...

100
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,800
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

101
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,468
Not to sound melodramatic...

102
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:18,221
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

103
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,640
...second thoughts about the job.

104
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:22,976
I'm intrigued.

105
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

106
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,691
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

107
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,318
I don't believe they did.

108
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,821
ULLMAN: Well...

109
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:37,323
My predecessor in this job...

110
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:40,535
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

111
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:44,289
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

112
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:47,500
He had a good employment record,
good references.

113
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:49,961
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

114
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,839
...like a completely
normal individual.

115
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:55,425
But at some point during the winter...

116
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:59,262
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

117
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,848
He ran amuck...

118
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:07,437
...and killed his family with an ax.

119
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:13,359
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

120
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,864
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

121
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,867
The police thought...

122
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:25,163
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

123
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:28,374
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

124
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:32,712
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

125
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,382
Wow.

126
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,218
That is...

127
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,970
...quite a story.

128
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,723
Yeah, it is.

129
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,144
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

130
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,188
But it did.

131
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:51,773
And, uh...

132
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,985
...I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

133
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:59,030
I certainly can.

134
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:02,075
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

135
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:04,577
...left it for you to tell me.

136
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:08,456
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

137
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:12,752
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

138
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:17,882
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

139
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:21,761
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

140
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:25,765
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

141
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:28,810
She's a confirmed ghost story...

142
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,437
...and horror film addict.

143
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:39,987
Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?

144
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,616
<i>He already did.</i>

145
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:47,787
<i>He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.</i>

147
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,260
Hello.

148
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:05,138
- Hi, babe.
<i>- Hi, hon. How's it going?</i>

149
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:08,975
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

150
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:12,311
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

151
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,980
Sounds like you got the job.

152
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,899
Right. It's a beautiful place.

153
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,235
You and Danny are going to love it.

154
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,614
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

155
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,616
<i>I don't know.</i>

156
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,204
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

157
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,832
<i>I don't want to.</i>

158
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:34,834
Please.

159
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,170
<i>No.</i>

160
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,589
Now, Tony, tell me.

161
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,205
<i>DOCTOR: Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.</i>

162
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,920
That's good. Now the other one.

163
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,798
Good boy.

164
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,515
Now, Danny...

165
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:33,017
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

166
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:36,229
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

167
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:41,192
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

168
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,196
No.

169
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,741
DOCTOR: Do you remember
when you were brushing your teeth?

170
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:50,618
Yes.

171
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:55,414
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

172
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:03,756
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

173
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:08,678
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

174
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:11,806
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

175
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:16,102
Talking to Tony.

176
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,105
Is Tony one of your animals?

177
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:22,942
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

178
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,611
Tony's his imaginary friend.

179
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,446
DOCTOR: Oh.

180
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,951
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

181
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,161
No.

182
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:35,872
Why not?

183
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:38,958
Because he hides.

184
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,377
Where does he go?

185
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,297
To my stomach.

186
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,218
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

187
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:55,975
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

188
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,436
Okay.

189
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,021
That's fine.

190
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:02,607
All right, Danny.

191
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,193
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

192
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:09,780
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

193
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,115
Do I have to?

194
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,576
Yes. I'd like you to.

195
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:16,537
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

196
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:19,123
I'll come back and check on you.

197
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,167
- Okay.
- Bye.

198
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:29,800
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

199
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:35,348
- Please.
- Thank you.

200
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:43,606
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

201
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:47,860
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

202
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,029
Yeah?

203
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,031
Oh.

204
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:55,701
He seems absolutely fine now.

205
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:56,911
But you should've seen him.

206
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:58,621
I know.

207
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,539
Kids can scare you to death.

208
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:03,584
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

209
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:06,379
And they look much worse
than they are.

210
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,548
But what was the matter with him?

211
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:13,886
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

212
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:18,933
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

213
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:22,728
They're more akin to autohypnosis...

214
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:25,898
...a kind of self-induced trance.

215
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,067
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

216
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:32,071
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

217
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,990
No, thank you.

218
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,909
I'm sure you're right.

219
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:41,247
Have you been in Boulder long?

220
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:43,374
Only about three months.

221
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,919
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

222
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:52,758
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend...

223
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,010
Tony.

224
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:58,180
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

225
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,100
No, um...

226
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,601
Let's see...

227
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:05,896
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

228
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:08,774
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

229
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:11,485
Did he adjust well to school?

230
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,529
No.

231
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,614
He didn't like it too much at first.

232
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:19,118
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and...

233
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:24,457
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

234
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,835
What sort of injury did he have?

235
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,671
He dislocated his shoulder.

236
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,424
How did he manage to do that?

237
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,930
It was just one of
those things, you know.

238
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,141
Purely an accident.

239
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,895
My husband had been drinking...

240
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:49,440
...and he came home
about three hours late.

241
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:54,320
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

242
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,825
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

243
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:04,330
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

244
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:07,583
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

245
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,835
...you know, in a park or in the street.

246
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:13,547
But on this particular occasion...

247
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:16,383
...my husband just used
too much strength...

248
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:19,178
...and he injured Danny's arm.

249
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:26,769
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

250
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,563
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

251
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,690
And if I do, you can leave me."

252
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,234
And he didn't.

253
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:37,947
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

254
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:04,723
Boy.

255
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:09,061
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

256
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,730
Mm-hm.

257
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,901
Dad?

258
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,070
Yes?

259
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:20,406
I'm hungry.

260
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,994
You should've eaten your breakfast.

261
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:28,747
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

262
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,583
Okay, Mom.

263
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:36,130
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

264
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,218
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

265
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,678
Oh.

266
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:45,264
What was the Donner party?

267
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:51,478
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

268
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,982
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

269
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:59,403
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

270
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,449
You mean they ate each other up?

271
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:06,744
They had to in order to survive.

272
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,162
Jack.

273
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,455
Don't worry, Mom.

274
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:14,001
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

275
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:16,837
See, it's okay.

276
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:19,465
He saw it on the television.

277
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:51,997
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

278
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:55,000
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

279
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:57,127
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

280
00:19:57,337 --> 00:20:00,464
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

281
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:03,300
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

282
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,387
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

283
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,347
- Hi.
- Is your family having a look around?

284
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:11,892
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

285
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,228
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

286
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:15,646
Oh, fine.

287
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,731
In view of all we have to cover today...

288
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:21,610
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

289
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,321
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

290
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,699
- Fine.
- I'd better collect my family first.

291
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:28,117
Oh, yes.

292
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,002
This is our Colorado Lounge.

293
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,629
It's beautiful.

294
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:42,881
My God!

295
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:45,676
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

296
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:47,219
It sure is.

297
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:50,222
I've never seen anything
like this before.

298
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,809
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

299
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,436
I believe they're based...

300
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:58,856
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

301
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:01,025
They're really gorgeous.

302
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:02,234
As a matter of fact...

303
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:05,571
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

304
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,907
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

305
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:12,244
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

306
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:15,414
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

307
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:18,667
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

308
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:20,210
Lots of movie stars.

309
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,962
Royalty?

310
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:23,756
All the best people.

311
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:19,436
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

312
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:23,732
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

313
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:26,860
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

314
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,113
ULLMAN: And here are your quarters.

315
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:32,116
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

316
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:34,827
And a small bedroom for your son.

317
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,165
Perfect for a child.

318
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,042
- Yeah.
- Yes.

319
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:51,135
ULLMAN: Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

320
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,886
Easy to keep.

321
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:56,723
Cozy.

322
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:59,184
ULLMAN: Yes, very cozy for a family.

323
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:01,103
If you feel like spreading out...

324
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:03,981
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

325
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:08,110
Well, it's very...

326
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,945
...homey.

327
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:11,321
Yeah.

328
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:15,117
This is our famous hedge maze.

329
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:19,621
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

330
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,124
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

331
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,960
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

332
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,172
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

333
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,675
WENDY: When was the Overlook built?

334
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,887
Construction started in 1907.

335
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,055
It was finished in 1909.

336
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:39,933
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

337
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:41,768
They actually had to repel...

338
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:44,897
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

339
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:47,399
That's our Snowcat.

340
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,401
Can you both drive a car?

341
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:50,569
BOTH: Yes.

342
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:54,239
ULLMAN: That's fine. Basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

343
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,992
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

344
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,580
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

345
00:24:01,748 --> 00:24:04,291
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

346
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:07,085
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

347
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:09,588
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

348
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:12,758
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

349
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,594
Oh, I'll say!

350
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:19,598
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

351
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,976
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

352
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:26,980
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

353
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,275
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

354
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:33,529
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

355
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:34,696
We don't drink.

356
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,323
Then you're in luck.

357
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:40,786
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

358
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:43,121
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

359
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,041
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

360
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,459
Glad to meet you.

361
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:50,504
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

362
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:54,466
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

363
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:56,510
It's just wonderful.

364
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,262
Hi, Danny!

365
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,848
I found him outside looking for you.

366
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,769
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

367
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,145
Yeah.

368
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:08,480
Come on over here.

369
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,190
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Susie.

370
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,403
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

371
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:16,488
...while I continue on with Jack.

372
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:19,116
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

373
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:20,867
Great. See you later, hon.

374
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:22,452
Bye, darling.

375
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:28,166
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

376
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,877
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

377
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:32,087
I'm a Wendy.

378
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:35,757
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

379
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,593
This is the kitchen, huh?

380
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,386
This is it.

381
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:42,055
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

382
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:45,559
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

383
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,145
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

384
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:51,898
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

385
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,693
Don't let it get you down.

386
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:57,362
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

387
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,781
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

388
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,200
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

389
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,537
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

390
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:10,417
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

391
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:13,712
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

392
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:17,924
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

393
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,135
You got 15 rib roasts...

394
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,471
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

395
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,724
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

396
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:29,061
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

397
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:32,230
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

398
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:34,066
- No.
- You don't?

399
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:35,817
What's your favorite food, then?

400
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,903
French fries and ketchup.

401
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:40,614
I think we can manage that too, Doc.

402
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:42,574
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

403
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,330
Mr. Hallorann...

404
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,874
...how'd you know we call him Doc?

405
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:55,087
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

406
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:57,339
- I did?
- Yeah.

407
00:26:57,507 --> 00:27:00,634
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

408
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:02,094
But how did you know?

409
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:04,846
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

410
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,307
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

411
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,726
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

412
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:12,104
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

413
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:14,981
(IMITATES BUGS BUNNY)
Eh, what's up, Doc?

414
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:19,027
Now, this is the storeroom.

415
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,614
In here is where we keep...

416
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:25,617
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

417
00:27:25,785 --> 00:27:28,245
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

418
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:32,249
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

419
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:35,627
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

420
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:39,881
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

421
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,551
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

422
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,971
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

424
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:56,064
<i>DICK'S VOICE:
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?</i>

425
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:00,485
DICK: Sociables, finger rolls...

426
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:02,195
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

427
00:28:02,405 --> 00:28:05,949
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

428
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,244
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

429
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,749
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

430
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,501
- Hi.
WENDY: Hi.

431
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,295
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.

432
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:22,048
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

433
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:24,176
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

434
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:27,596
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

435
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,348
- You like ice cream, Doc?
- Yeah.

436
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:31,516
I thought you did.

437
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,770
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

438
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,813
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

439
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:38,690
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

440
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:41,485
DANNY: Yeah.
- Okay, you behave yourself.

441
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,364
What kind of ice cream do you like?

442
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:47,574
Chocolate.

443
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:50,619
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

444
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,209
It's amazing, all this activity today.

445
00:28:57,376 --> 00:29:00,212
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

446
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:01,838
...last day's always hectic.

447
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:05,091
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

448
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:09,346
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

449
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:11,598
WENDY: Just like a ghost ship, huh?
- Yes.

450
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:20,232
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

451
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:29,241
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

452
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,709
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

453
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:42,629
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

454
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,675
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

455
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,053
She called it "shining."

456
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,266
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

457
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:57,102
...that had "the shine" to us.

458
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:00,730
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

459
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,275
But there are other folks...

460
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:07,195
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

461
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:14,286
How long have you
been able to do it?

462
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,918
Why don't you want to talk about it?

463
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:29,217
I'm not supposed to.

464
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:33,305
Who says you ain't supposed to?

465
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,143
Tony.

466
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:41,813
Who's Tony?

467
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,652
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

468
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,656
Is Tony the one that...

469
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:53,408
...tells you things?

470
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:56,536
Yes.

471
00:30:57,955 --> 00:31:00,332
How does he tell you things?

472
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:06,463
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

473
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:10,759
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

474
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:16,306
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

475
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:18,808
Yes.

476
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:22,187
Do they know he tells you things?

477
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:25,982
Tony told me never to tell them.

478
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,488
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

479
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:34,240
About the Overlook Hotel?

480
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:39,079
I don't know.

481
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:42,374
Now think real hard, Doc.

482
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,042
Think.

483
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:49,881
Maybe he showed me something.

484
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,426
Try to think of what it was.

485
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,724
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

486
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:02,686
No.

487
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:05,063
Scared of nothing here.

488
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:07,065
It's just that...

489
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:10,610
...you know, some places
are like people.

490
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:13,154
Some shine...

491
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,739
...and some don't.

492
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:18,118
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

493
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:21,621
...has something about it
that's like shining.

494
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,085
Is there something bad here?

495
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:36,761
Well...

496
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:41,099
...you know, Doc,
when something happens...

497
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:44,936
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

498
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,272
Say, like...

499
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,567
...if someone burns toast.

500
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:52,485
Well...

501
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:57,323
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

502
00:32:58,492 --> 00:33:01,953
Not things that anyone can notice.

503
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:06,958
But things that people
who shine can see.

504
00:33:08,044 --> 00:33:11,337
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

505
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:13,173
...well...

506
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:17,802
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

507
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:22,182
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

508
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:26,102
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

509
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,022
And not all of them was good.

510
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:34,986
What about room 237?

511
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:40,492
Room 237?

512
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:44,913
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?

513
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:48,166
No, I ain't.

514
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:53,505
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

515
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,174
Nothing.

516
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,844
There ain't nothing in room 237.

517
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:03,306
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

518
00:34:03,516 --> 00:34:05,642
So stay out.

519
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:08,353
You understand? Stay out!

522
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,621
Good morning, hon.

523
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:53,374
Your breakfast is ready.

524
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,793
What time is it?

525
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:57,837
It's about 11:30.

526
00:35:58,297 --> 00:36:01,341
Eleven-thirty, Jesus.

527
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:04,719
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

528
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,471
I know it.

529
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,642
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

530
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,477
Nice.

531
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,564
It's really pretty outside.

532
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,984
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

533
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,948
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

534
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,034
Any ideas yet?

535
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:30,703
Lots of ideas.

536
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:32,455
No good ones.

537
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:35,375
Something will come.

538
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:39,837
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

539
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:43,091
Yep. That's all it is.

540
00:36:45,177 --> 00:36:47,512
It's really nice up here, isn't it?

541
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:49,347
I love it.

542
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:51,432
I really do.

543
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,353
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

544
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:59,357
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

545
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:02,443
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

546
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,696
...I thought it was kind of scary.

547
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:07,699
I fell in love with it right away.

When I came up here
for my interview...

549
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:15,373
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

550
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:18,209
I mean, we all have moments
of déjà vu...

551
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:20,628
...but this was ridiculous.

552
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,214
It was almost as though I knew...

553
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:26,884
...what was going to be
around every corner.

554
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:29,721

America clean. How's that?

557

- All right.
- And you're going to lose.

558
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:09,594

01:40:35,003 --> 01:40:36,212
All right.

1232
01:40:37,089 --> 01:40:41,175
I'll-I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1233
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:44,345
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1234
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:34,854
Jack?

1235
01:41:55,667 --> 01:41:57,126
Jack?

1236
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:11,677
JACK: How do you like it?

1237
01:44:11,845 --> 01:44:13,262
(SHRIEKS)

1238
01:44:14,431 --> 01:44:15,889
Jack.

1239
01:44:18,977 --> 01:44:20,519
How do you like it?

1240
01:44:30,447 --> 01:44:33,115
What are you doing down here?

1241
01:44:37,495 --> 01:44:39,830
I just...

1242
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:41,332
...wanted...

1243
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,500
...to talk to you.

1244
01:44:45,879 --> 01:44:47,129
Okay.

1245
01:44:47,756 --> 01:44:49,214
Let's talk.

1246
01:44:59,017 --> 01:45:01,018
What do you want to talk about?

1247
01:45:07,025 --> 01:45:08,275
I...

1248
01:45:08,943 --> 01:45:12,112
I can't really remember.

1249
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:15,032
You can't remember.

1250
01:45:15,825 --> 01:45:17,159
No...

1251
01:45:17,535 --> 01:45:18,952
...I can't.

1252
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:27,503
<i>JACK: Maybe it was about Danny?</i>

1253
01:45:29,881 --> 01:45:32,591
<i>Maybe it was about him.</i>

1254
01:45:36,221 --> 01:45:39,515
<i>I think we should discuss Danny.</i>

1255
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:44,144
<i>I think...</i>

1256
01:45:44,521 --> 01:45:48,315
<i>...we should discuss
what should be done with him.</i>

1257
01:45:52,987 --> 01:45:55,614
What should be done with him?

1258
01:46:00,578 --> 01:46:02,371
I don't know.

1259
01:46:02,872 --> 01:46:04,873
I don't think that's true.

1260
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:07,668
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1261
01:46:07,877 --> 01:46:09,586
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1262
01:46:09,796 --> 01:46:12,381
And I'd like to know what they are.

1263
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,093
Well, I...

1264
01:46:16,386 --> 01:46:20,806
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1265
01:46:21,015 --> 01:46:24,309
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1266
01:46:24,519 --> 01:46:25,894
Yes.

1267
01:46:26,521 --> 01:46:29,857
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1268
01:46:30,525 --> 01:46:31,859
As soon as possible?

1269
01:46:32,485 --> 01:46:34,820
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
"As soon as possible?"

1270
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:38,907
Please.

1271
01:46:40,326 --> 01:46:43,579
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1272
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:46,707
Yes.

1273
01:46:48,042 --> 01:46:50,669
And you are concerned about him.

1274
01:46:50,879 --> 01:46:52,421
Yes.

1275
01:46:53,214 --> 01:46:55,466
And are you concerned about me?

1276
01:46:56,301 --> 01:46:57,468
Of course I am.

1277
01:46:57,677 --> 01:46:59,887
Of course you are!

1278
01:47:00,096 --> 01:47:03,223
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1279
01:47:03,433 --> 01:47:04,933
What are you talking about?

1280
01:47:05,143 --> 01:47:07,978
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1281
01:47:08,188 --> 01:47:10,230
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1282
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,733
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1283
01:47:12,901 --> 01:47:15,736
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1284
01:47:15,987 --> 01:47:17,821
Has it ever occurred to you...

1285
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:21,533
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May the 1st?

1286
01:47:21,743 --> 01:47:23,785
Does it matter to you at all...

1287
01:47:23,995 --> 01:47:27,080
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1288
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:30,417
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1289
01:47:30,627 --> 01:47:33,253
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1290
01:47:33,713 --> 01:47:35,756
Do you have the slightest idea...

1291
01:47:35,924 --> 01:47:39,176
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1292
01:47:39,552 --> 01:47:42,638
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1293
01:47:42,847 --> 01:47:45,265
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1294
01:47:45,433 --> 01:47:47,768
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1295
01:47:47,936 --> 01:47:49,478
Stay away from me!

1296
01:47:50,355 --> 01:47:51,438
Why?

1297
01:47:51,731 --> 01:47:54,691
I just want to go back to my room.

1298
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:56,151
Why?

1299
01:47:56,653 --> 01:47:57,653
Well...

1300
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:00,822
...I'm very confused.

1301
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:05,619
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1302
01:48:06,663 --> 01:48:10,624
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1303
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:13,585
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1304
01:48:14,546 --> 01:48:16,046
Stay away from me!

1305
01:48:16,381 --> 01:48:17,673
Please!

1306
01:48:18,466 --> 01:48:19,508
Don't hurt me.

1307
01:48:19,717 --> 01:48:21,051
I'm not going to hurt you.

1308
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:22,261
Stay away from me!

1309
01:48:22,428 --> 01:48:23,512
- Wendy.
- Stay away!

1310
01:48:23,721 --> 01:48:24,721
Darling.

1311
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:26,473
Light of my life.

1312
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:28,267
I'm not going to hurt you.

1313
01:48:28,476 --> 01:48:30,477
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1314
01:48:30,645 --> 01:48:32,854
I said, "I'm not going to hurt you."

1315
01:48:33,064 --> 01:48:35,816
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1316
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:39,069
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1317
01:48:40,154 --> 01:48:41,697
Stay away from me!

1318
01:48:42,198 --> 01:48:43,240
Don't hurt me!

1319
01:48:43,449 --> 01:48:45,826
I'm not going to hurt you.

1320
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:47,661
Stay away from me!

1321
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:48,954
Stay away!

1322
01:48:49,831 --> 01:48:51,039
Please!

1323
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:53,834
Stop swinging the bat.

1324
01:48:54,043 --> 01:48:55,335
Stay away from me.

1325
01:48:56,087 --> 01:48:57,379
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1326
01:48:57,589 --> 01:48:59,089
Stop it!

1327
01:48:59,257 --> 01:49:00,382
Wendy.

1328
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:01,675
Give me the bat.

1329
01:49:01,884 --> 01:49:03,010
Please!

1330
01:49:03,261 --> 01:49:05,470
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1331
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,722
Stop it!

1332
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:08,390
- Give me the bat.
- Jack.

1333
01:49:08,725 --> 01:49:10,350
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

1334
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,935
Please stop!

1335
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:13,353
Give me the bat.

1336
01:49:13,521 --> 01:49:14,771
- Stay away from me.
- Wendy.

1337
01:49:15,023 --> 01:49:16,523
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

1338
01:49:16,691 --> 01:49:18,108
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1339
01:49:18,276 --> 01:49:19,860

1343
01:50:37,605 --> 01:50:38,605
Hey.

1344
01:50:39,607 --> 01:50:41,108
Wait a minute.

1345
01:50:42,485 --> 01:50:44,486
What are you doing?

1346
01:50:47,323 --> 01:50:48,573
What are you doing?

1347
01:50:54,288 --> 01:50:55,539
Oh! Oh!

1348

What are you doing?

1351
01:51:08,136 --> 01:51:09,886
Open the door!

1352
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:12,222
Goddamn it!

1353
01:51:12,432 --> 01:51:15,976
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1354
01:51:19,689 --> 01:51:20,939
Wendy, listen.

1355
01:51:21,357 --> 01:51:24,317
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1356
01:51:24,485 --> 01:51:26,987
It'll be just like nothing ever happened.

1357
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:43,003
Wendy, baby.

1358
01:51:44,213 --> 01:51:47,507
I think you hurt my head real bad.

1359
01:51:49,135 --> 01:51:50,802
I'm dizzy.

1360
01:51:51,804 --> 01:51:54,014
I need a doctor.

1361
01:52:00,855 --> 01:52:02,063
Honey.

1362
01:52:04,734 --> 01:52:07,068
Don't leave me in here.

1363
01:52:15,703 --> 01:52:17,579
I'm going to go now.

1364
01:52:20,666 --> 01:52:22,501
I'm going to try...

1365
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:25,712
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1366
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:28,757
...in the Snowcat today.

1367
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:32,844
I'll bring back a doctor.

coming to you.

You're not going anywhere.

1374
01:52:57,078 --> 01:53:01,206
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

Go check it out!

1378
01:53:15,221 --> 01:53:17,138

GRADY: It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

Delbert Grady.

1384
01:55:11,837 --> 01:55:13,421
Grady?

1385
01:55:18,219 --> 01:55:20,220
Oh, Grady.

1386
01:55:24,475 --> 01:55:26,643
Grady, uh...

1387
01:55:33,776 --> 01:55:35,610
Hello, Grady.

1388
01:55:40,282 --> 01:55:42,075
Mr. Torrance...

1389
01:55:44,036 --> 01:55:47,747
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1390
01:55:48,499 --> 01:55:51,001
...business we discussed.

1391
01:55:57,717 --> 01:56:00,635
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1392
01:56:01,512 --> 01:56:05,598
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1393
01:56:06,434 --> 01:56:09,185
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1394
01:56:09,687 --> 01:56:11,521
I wonder.

1395
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:14,774
I have my doubts.

1396
01:56:15,985 --> 01:56:20,238
I, and others, have come to believe...

1397
01:56:20,448 --> 01:56:23,450
...that your heart is not in this.

1398
01:56:24,076 --> 01:56:26,619
That you haven't the belly for it.

1399
01:56:32,793 --> 01:56:37,088
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1400
01:56:37,923 --> 01:56:39,841
That's all I ask.

1401
01:56:41,385 --> 01:56:45,638
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1402
01:56:45,848 --> 01:56:47,307
Somewhat more...

1403
01:56:47,516 --> 01:56:49,476
...resourceful.

1404
01:56:49,769 --> 01:56:52,520
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1405
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:58,443
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1406
01:56:59,153 --> 01:57:01,321
Only for the moment.

1407
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:07,410
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1408
01:57:07,661 --> 01:57:11,331
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1409
01:57:11,916 --> 01:57:13,500
