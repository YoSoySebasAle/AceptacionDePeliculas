1
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>Saigon.</i>

2
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,973
<i>Shit.</i>

3
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,769
<i>I'm still only in Saigon.</i>

4
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,822
<i>Every time, I think
I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle.</i>

5
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,582
<i>When I was home after my first tour,
it was worse.</i>

6
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,468
<i>I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.</i>

7
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,605
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce.</i>

8
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,277
<i>When I was here, I wanted to be there.</i>

9
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:25,075
<i>When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle.</i>

10
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,330
<i>I'm here a week now.</i>

11
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,877
<i>Waiting for a mission.</i>

12
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,505
<i>Getting softer.</i>

13
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,013
<i>Every minute I stay in this room,
I get weaker.</i>

14
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,558
<i>And every minute
Charlie squats in the bush,</i>

15
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,268
<i>he gets stronger.</i>

16
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,235
<i>Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.</i>

17
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,587
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants.</i>

18
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,382
<i>I wanted a mission.</i>

19
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,718
<i>And for my sins, they gave me one.</i>

20
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,972
<i>Brought it up to me like room service.</i>

21
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,976
Captain Willard, are you in there?

22
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,311
Yeah, I'm coming.

23
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,106
<i>It was a real choice mission.</i>

24
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,652
<i>And when it was over,
I'd never want another.</i>

25
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,913
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

26
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,915
What does it look like?

27
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,844
- Are you Captain Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

28
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,512
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

29
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,473
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?

30
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,687
We have orders
to escort you to the airfield.

31
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,692
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

32
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,776
What'd I do?

33
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,070
There's no charges, Captain.

34
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:53,116
You have orders to report
to COMSEC Intelligence at Nha Trang.

35
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,161
- I see.
- All right?

36
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,747
- Nha Trang for me?
- That's right.

37
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,500
Come on, Captain. You still
have a few hours to get cleaned up.

38
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,336
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

39
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,091
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

40
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,469
Come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.

41
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,304
- Don't be an ass.
- Get hold of him good.

42
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,598
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.

43
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,725
- In we go.
- Now stand underneath this, Captain.

44
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,573
<i>I was going
to the worst place in the world</i>

45
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,825
<i>and I didn't even know it yet.</i>

46
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,829
<i>Weeks away
and hundreds of miles up a river</i>

47
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,373
<i>that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable,</i>

48
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,043
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz.</i>

49
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,837
Insult me again and I'll kick your ass.

50
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,965
<i>It was no accident
that I got to be the caretaker</i>

51
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,468
<i>of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory</i>

52
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,222
<i>any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.</i>

53
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,352
<i>There is no way to tell his
story without telling my own.</i>

54
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,105
<i>And if his story is really a confession...</i>

55
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,356
Captain Willard reporting, sir.

56
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,440
<i>...then so is mine.</i>

57
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,985
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,447
- Stand at ease.
- General.

59
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,827
Do you want a cigarette?

60
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,662
No, thank you, sir.

61
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,707
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?

62
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,167
No, sir.

63
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,045
- Met the General or myself?
- No, sir.

64
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,380
Not personally.

65
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,967
You've worked a lot on your own,
haven't you, Captain?

66
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,468
Yes, sir, I have.

67
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,719
Your report specifies Intelligence,

68
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,222
Counterintelligence with COMSEC, I Corps.

69
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,724
I'm not presently disposed
to discuss those operations, sir.

70
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,403
Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?

71
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,990
No, sir.

72
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,742
Did you not
assassinate a government tax collector,

73
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,704
Tr Provinee, June 18, 19687?

74
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,583
Captain?

75
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,797
Sir, I am unaware
of any such activity or operation...

76
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:19,137
nor would I be
disposed to discuss such an operation

77
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,681
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.

78
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,820
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

79
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,032
I hope you brought a good appetite,
Captain.

80
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,701
I noticed that you have...

81
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,246
a bad hand, there. Are you wounded?

82
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,832
I had a little fishing accident
on R&R, sir.

83
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,793
- Fishing on R&R?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,296
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

85
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,965
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.

86
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,759
Well, let's see what we have here.

87
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,221
Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

88
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,516
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.

89
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,270
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

90
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,735
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp,

91
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,071
but if you'll eat it,

92
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,324
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

93
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,370
Right, well,
why don't I just take a piece here?

94
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,832
Captain,
you've heard of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

95
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,128
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.

96
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,381
Jesus.

97
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,967
Operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.

98
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,136
Luke, would you play
that tape for the Captain, please?

99
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,390
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

100
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,937
<i>October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter Victor King.</i>

101
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,231
These were monitored out of Cambodia.

102
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,859
This has been
verified as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

103
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,612
<i>I watched a snail...</i>

104
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,907
<i>crawl along the edge...</i>

105
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,660
<i>of a straight razor.</i>

106
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,913
<i>That's my dream.</i>

107
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,875
<i>It's my nightmare.</i>

108
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,380
<i>Crawling, slithering...</i>

109
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,300
<i>along the edge...</i>

110
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,138
<i>of a straight razor...</i>

111
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,891
<i>and surviving.</i>

112
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:36,607
<i>Transmission 11, received '68,
December 30, 0500 hours.</i>

113
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,568
<i>Sector King Zulu King.</i>

114
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,655
<i>But we must kill them.</i>

115
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,991
<i>We must incinerate them,</i>

116
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,576
<i>pig after pig---</i>

117
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,829
<i>cow after cow...</i>

118
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>village after village,</i>

119
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,376
<i>army after army.</i>

120
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,671
<i>And they call me an assassin.</i>

121
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:03,843
<i>What do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin?</i>

122
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
<i>They lie.</i>

123
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,931
<i>They lie, and we have to be merciful</i>

124
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,933
<i>for those who lie.</i>

125
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,229
<i>Those Nabobs...</i>

126
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,691
<i>I hate them.</i>

127
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,527
<i>I do hate them.</i>

128
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,994
Walt Kurtz
was one of the most outstanding officers

129
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,580
this country's ever produced.

130
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,833
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

131
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,337
And he was a good man, too.

132
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,047
A humanitarian man.

133
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,175
A man of wit and humor.

134
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,637
He joined the Special Forces.

135
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,474
And after that...

136
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,312
his ideas, methods...

137
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,108
became...

138
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,945
unsound.

139
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,077
Unsound.

140
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:21,003
Now he's crossed into Cambodia
with this Montagnard army of his

141
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,841
that worship the man like a god.

142
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,011
And follow every order,
however ridiculous.

143
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,809
Well, I have some
other shocking news to tell you.

144
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,603
Colonel Kurtz is about to be

145
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,481
arrested for murder.

146
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,235
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

147
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,489
Kurtz had ordered the execution
of some Vietnamese intelligence agents.

148
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,992
Men he believed were double agents.

149
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,121
So he took matters into his own hands.

150
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,333
Well, you see, Willard...

151
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,503
in this war, things get...

152
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,882
confused out there.

153
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,344
Power, ideals, the old morality,

154
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,055
and practical military necessity.

155
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,518
But out there with these natives...

156
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,647
it must be a temptation...

157
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,650
to be God.

158
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,657
Because there's
a conflict in every human heart...

159
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,620
between the rational and the irrational,

160
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,331
between good and evil.

161
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,168
And good does not always triumph.

162
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,130
Sometimes...

163
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,467
the dark side

164
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,514
overcomes what Lincoln called,
"The better angels of our nature."

165
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,018
Every man has got a breaking point.

166
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,479
You and I have them.

167
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,274
Walt Kurtz has reached his...

168
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,029
and very obviously he has gone insane.

169
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:27,213
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

170
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,304
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat...

171
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,142
pick up Colonel
Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba,

172
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,563
follow it,
learn what you can along the way.

173
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,440
When you find the Colonel,
infiltrate his team by

174
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,068
whatever means available

175
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,113
and terminate the Colonel's command.

176
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,122
Terminate the Colonel?

177
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:06,210
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

178
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:12,174
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable human conduct.

179
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,344
And he is still in the field,
commanding troops.

180
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,224
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

181
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,313
You understand, Captain,
that this mission does not exist...

182
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,066
nor will it ever exist.

183
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,041
<i>How many people had I already killed?</i>

184
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,045
<i>There were those six
that I knew about for sure.</i>

185
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,132
<i>Close enough to blow
their last breath in my face.</i>

186
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:42,390
<i>But this time it was
an American and an officer.</i>

187
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,322
<i>That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me, but it did.</i>

188
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,412
<i>Shit, charging a man
with murder in this place</i>

189
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.</i>

190
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:14,296
I took tine mission.
Whet the hell else was I gonna do?

191
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,844
<i>But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him.</i>

192
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,395
Did you check the tank?

193
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,938
Yeah.

194
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,277
<i>I was being ferried
down the coast in a Navy PBR.</i>

195
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,865
<i>A type of plastic patrol boat,
a pretty common sight on the rivers.</i>

196
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,325
<i>They said it was a good way
to pick up information and move</i>

197
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,911
<i>without drawing a lot of attention.</i>

198
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,830
<i>And that was okay.</i>

199
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>I needed the air and the time.</i>

200
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,335
<i>Only problem was, I wouldn't be alone.</i>

201
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,254
Morning, Captain.

202
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,885
<i>The crew were mostly just kids.</i>

203
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,054
<i>Rock 'n' rollers
with one foot in their graves.</i>

204
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,433
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

205
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,686
The machinist,
the one they called Chef,

206
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,229
<i>was from New Orleans.</i>

207
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,191
<i>He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.</i>

208
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,735
<i>Probably wrapped
too tight for New Orleans.</i>

209
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,488
<i>Lance, on the forward .50s,
was a famous surfer</i>

210
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,865
<i>from the beaches south of LA.</i>

211
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,911
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.</i>

212
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,042
<i>Clean, Mr. Clean,
was from some South Bronx shithole,</i>

213
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,211
<i>and I think the light and space of Vietnam</i>

214
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,546
<i>really put the zap on his head.</i>

215
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,843
<i>Then there was Phillips, the Chief.</i>

216
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,806
<i>It might have been my mission,
but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat.</i>

217
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,141
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water

218
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,519
to get into the Nung River.

219
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,104
They're both hot, belong to Charlie.

220
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,274
Don't worry about it.

221
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,610
Don't smoke.

222
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,782
You know,
I've pulled a few special ops in here.

223
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,784
About six months ago,

224
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,704
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Luong.

225
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,916
He was regular Army, too.

226
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,046
I heard he shot himself in the head.

227
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,439
<i>Good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AFVN.</i>

228
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,402
<i>It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid.</i>

229
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,779
<i>And we have an
important message for all Gls</i>

230
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,948
<i>who are living off base
from the Mayor of Saigon.</i>

231
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,032
Yeah!

232
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,286
<i>He'd like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills.</i>

233
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,454
<i>The Mayor wants you
to keep Saigon beautiful.</i>

234
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,208
<i>And now, here's another blast
from the past going out to big Sam</i>

235
00:22:56,292 --> 00:23:00,254
<i>who's all alone out there with
the First Battalion, 35th Infantry,</i>

236
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,382
<i>and dedicated by the fire team
at An Khe to their groovy CO...</i>

237
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,803
<i>- The Rolling Stones, "Satisfaction."</i>
- Ooh! All right!

238
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,765
Work out, Clean!

239
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,434
Get down, Bubba!

240
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,278
Hang on, Lance!

241
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,287
Get down, Bubba!

242
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,631
Yeah!

243
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,180
Can you get it, Lance? Can you get it?

244
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,225
I see you is right on target.

245
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,981
Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

246
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,566
All right!

247
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,485
Look out, Lance!

248
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,780
Sayonara!

249
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,588
<i>At first, I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.</i>

250
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,883
<i>I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.</i>

251
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,471
<i>Third-generation West Point,
top of his class,</i>

252
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:38,143
<i>Korea, Airborne, about 1,000 decorations,
et cetera, et cetera.</i>

253
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,776
<i>I had heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me,</i>

254
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,197
<i>but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man.</i>

255
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,165
<i>Like they said,
he had an impressive career.</i>

256
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,918
<i>Maybe too impressive.</i>

257
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,504
<i>I mean, perfect.</i>

258
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:10,426
<i>He was being groomed for one
of the top slots in the corporation,</i>

259
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,345
<i>General, Chief of Staff, anything.</i>

260
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,685
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour
with advisory command in Vietnam</i>

261
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,104
<i>and things started to slip.</i>

262
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,442
<i>His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.</i>

263
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,612
<i>Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them.</i>

264
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,367
<i>During the next few months,
he made three requests for transfer</i>

265
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:40,664
<i>to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.</i>

266
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,877
<i>Airborne?</i>

267
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,381
<i>He was 38 years old.</i>

268
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,552
<i>Why the fuck would he do that?</i>

269
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,141
<i>1966, joins Special Forces,</i>

270
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,643
<i>returns Vietnam.</i>

271
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,397
- Hey, what's that?
- Arc light.

272
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,400
- What's that?
- B-52 strike.

273
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,737
- What's that?
- Arc light.

274
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,907
I hate that. Every time
I hear that, something terrible happens.

275
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,992
Charlie don't never see them
or hear them, man.

276
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,077
There they are.

277
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,788
Concussion will suck
the air out of your damn lungs.

278
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,416
- Something terrible's gonna happen.
- Smoke!

279
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,251
Secondary burning.

280
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,212
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

281
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,296
Let's have a look, Chief.

282
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,011
<i>It was the air cav, First of the Ninth.</i>

283
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,221
That's them.

284
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,765
<i>Our escorts
to the mouth of the Nung River.</i>

285
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,769
<i>But they were supposed to be
waiting for us another 30 km ahead.</i>

286
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:48,315
<i>Well, Airmobile,
those boys just couldn't stay put.</i>

287
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,914
Kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

288
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,678
<i>First of the Ninth
was an old cavalry division</i>

289
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,306
<i>that had cashed in its horses for
choppers and gone tear-assing around Nam</i>

290
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,225
<i>looking for the shit.</i>

291
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,563
<i>They'd given Charlie a few
surprises in their time here.</i>

292
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,109
<i>What they were mopping up now
hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.</i>

293
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,696
Just keep running by. Run for television.

294
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,198
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on! Keep going.

295
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,867
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

296
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,034
Don't look at the camera.

297
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,620
Just go by like you're fighting.
Like you're fighting.

298
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,123
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through!

299
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,709
Go through! Just go by! Keep on going!

300
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,671
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

301
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,530
Where can I find the CO?

302
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,491
I'm the fourth tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

303
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:24,536
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

304
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,079
Captain Willard!

305
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,958
I carry priority papers from
COMSEC Intelligence, ll Corps.

306
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,712
I understand Nha Trang has briefed
you on the requirements of my mission.

307
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,465
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

308
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,301
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

309
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,303
- We'll see what we can do, but...
- Colonel.

310
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,222
...just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

311
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,980
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

312
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,109
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds,

313
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,905
six of clubs, eight of spades.

314
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,534
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch. Four of diamonds.

315
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:10,332
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

316
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,168
- What?
- Death cards!

317
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,921
- Death?
- It lets Charlie know who did this.

318
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,177
- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.

319
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,888
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

320
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,475
<i>We are here to help you.</i>

321
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,648
<i>We are hereto extend a welcome hand</i>

322
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,234
<i>- to those of you who would like...</i>
- Come on. Everybody in?

323
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,487
<i>...to return to the arms
of the South Vietnamese government.</i>

324
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,032
Hurry UP!

325
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,619
Move it out!

326
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:54,126
<i>This is an area that is controlled
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.</i>

327
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,752
Hey! What's this?

328
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,255
What is this?

329
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,341
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

330
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,677
About the only thing
that's holding his guts in, sir,

331
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,387
- Is that pot lid.
- Yeah?

332
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,972
What does he have to say?

333
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,808
This soldier is dirty VC.

334
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,186
He wants water. He can drink paddy water.

335
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,606
Get out of here! Give me that canteen.

336
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,735
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to...

337
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,821
Get out of here!
I'll kick your fucking ass!

338
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,156
He killed a lot of our people!

339
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,075
Any man brave enough to fight
with his guts strapped on him

340
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,994
can drink from my canteen any day!

341
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,873
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

342
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,751
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

343
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,670
Yeah? Here.

344
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,007
Repeat, we have a body count. We have...

345
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,012
What's your name, sailor?

346
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,014
Gunner's Mate Third Class I. Johnson, sir!

347
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,434
- Gunner's Mate Third Class...
- Wait. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

348
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,769
Yes, sir.

349
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:58,273
Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.
I've admired your nose riding for years.

350
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,318
I like your cutback, too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

351
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,112
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

352
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,198
I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.

353
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,450
- This guy with you?
- Yeah.

354
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,620
I want you to meet some guys.
This is Mike from San Diego.

355
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,330
- Far out.
- Johnny from Malibu.

356
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,540
- John, hi. Far out.
- Pretty solid surfers.

357
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,417
None of us are anywhere
near your class, though.

358
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,919
No way.

359
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,839
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
I like to finish operations early,

360
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,967
fly down to Vung Tau
for the evening glass.

361
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,011
Been riding since you got here?

362
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,180
No way.
I haven't surfed since I been here.

363
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,935
Through Christ our Lord,
from whom all good things come.

364
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,854
Through him
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

365
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:41,608
all glory and honor is yours,
Almighty Father. Amen.

366
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,654
Let us pray with confidence to the Father
in the words our savior gave us.

367
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:50,409
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

368
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,078
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done

369
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,247
on Earth as it is in heaven.

370
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,290
Give us this day our daily bread...

371
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,254
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

372
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,799
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

373
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,937
<i>Kilgore had had
a pretty good day for himself.</i>

374
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,273
<i>They choppered in the T-bones and the beer</i>

375
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,775
<i>and turned the LZ into a beach party.</i>

376
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,696
<i>The more they tried
to make it just like home,</i>

377
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,490
<i>the more they made everybody miss it.</i>

378
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,785
Make my meat rare, rare but not cold!

379
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,419
<i>Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.</i>

380
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,965
<i>He loved his boys
and you felt safe with him.</i>

381
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,427
<i>He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him.</i>

382
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,847
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here.</i>

383
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,765
What happened to your mission, Captain?

384
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,517
Nha Trang forget all about you?

385
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,570
Airborne.

386
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,616
Sir, two places
we can get into the river...

387
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,327
- Yeah.
- ...here and here.

388
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,206
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm really sure of.

389
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,460
Well, that village you're
pointing at is kind of hairy, Willard.

390
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,213
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy,

391
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,048
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

392
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,134
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

393
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,637
What's the name of that goddamn village?
Vin Drin...

394
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,597
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

395
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,808
Damn gook names all sound the same.

396
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,813
Mike, you know anything
about this point at Vin Drin Dop?

397
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,398
That's a fantastic peak.

398
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,109
- Peak?
- About six foot.

399
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:51,530
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak. It's got
both the long right and left slide

400
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,950
with a bowl section. It's unbelievable.
It's just tube city.

401
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,706
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
A good peak.

402
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,334
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

403
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,295
- It's all goddamn beach break.
- It's really hairy in there, sir.

404
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,298
That's where we lost McDonald.
They shot the hell out of us there.

405
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,634
That's Charlie's point.

406
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,555
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.

407
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,890
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

408
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,934
We may not be able to get the boat in.

409
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,353
The draft at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

410
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,732
We'll pick your boat up and put it
down like a baby, right where you want it.

411
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,236
This is the First of the Ninth air cav,
son. Airmobile.

412
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,406
I can take that point
and hold it just as long as I like.

413
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,659
And you can get any place up that
river that suits you, young Captain.

414
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,494
Hell, a six-foot peak.

415
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,790
All right,
take a gunship back to the division.

416
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,959
Lance, go with Mike
and let him pick out a board for you,

417
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,794
and bring me my Yater Spoon, the 8'6".

418
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,547
- I don't know, sir, it's...
- What is it, soldier?

419
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,300
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

420
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,552
Charlie don't surf!

421
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,621
Hey, Jesus, Clean,
you ain't gonna believe this. Look.

422
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,625
Hey, man! They're picking up the boat!

423
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,548
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

424
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,886
All right, son, let her rip.

425
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,970
Let's go!

426
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,806
I never have
gotten used to a light board,

427
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,392
and I can't get used to one.
I'm used to a heavy board.

428
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,102
I know, it's a real drag.

429
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,647
- You prefer a heavy or a light board?
- Heavier.

430
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,940
- Really?
- Yeah!

431
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,067
I thought all the young
guys like lighter boards.

432
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,361
You can't ride the nose on those things.

433
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,781
Big Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

434
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,243
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on heading 2-7-0.

435
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,078
Assume attack formation.

436
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,748
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke.
Okay, we're going in.</i>

437
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:33,752
Lance, we'll come in low
out of the rising sun,

438
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,254
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

439
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,798
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

440
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,260
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

441
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,971
Hey, they're gonna play music!

442
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,522
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

443
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,276
So we don't get our balls blown off.

444
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:14,584
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on psy war op, make it loud.

445
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:18,129
This is a Romeo Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

446
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,344
- Jimmy!
- Yes, sir!

447
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,963
Run, Charlie!

448
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,068
We got some...
There's more and more down there.

449
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,821
Look out, automatic .50-cal!
.50-cal in the open!

450
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,033
I've spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.

451
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,327
All right, this is Fox Five.
We're going in.

452
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,216
- All right. What a shot.
- Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.

453
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,592
Get you a case of beer for that.

454
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,117
6-4-1-0,
we're over the village right now.

455
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,077
I think I see a vehicle
down in the courtyard.

456
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:21,456
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Well done, hawks. Well done.

457
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,751
I want some 20 Mike-Mike
Vulcan right along those tree lines.

458
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,127
Ripple the shit out of them.

459
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,047
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.

460
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,799
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

461
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,553
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.

462
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,971
Don't these people ever give up?

463
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,311
Nice shot, Bill.

464
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,230
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

465
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:51,569
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get out of here!

466
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,613
Un-ass that shit. Get it out of here!

467
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:57,492
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right. It's just a flare.

468
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,828
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!

469
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,136
Get down!

470
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,911
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going!

471
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,511
<i>We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza.</i>

472
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,472
<i>Blue Three, Blue Four,
hold out over position...</i>

473
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,725
<i>Duke Six, Duke Six,
we've got wounded down there.</i>

474
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,441
My God! Oh, my God!

475
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,779
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

476
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,739
Please! Help me!

477
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,287
- Please, God! Help me!
- Stay with me, son, you're gonna be okay.

478
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,331
- Let's give him some morphine.
- My God! My God!

479
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,625
- 0-3-7-7-4-2.
- Where's that duster?

480
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,547
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

481
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,465
I want my men out.

482
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,259
<i>Somebody stay in
there tight with Big Duke.</i>

483
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,305
<i>This is 10-10. We're gonna
be in, throw them on and get out...</i>

484
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,871
She's got a grenade! She's got a grenade!

485
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,751
Jesus! The whole goddamn thing just...

486
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,753
- She blew the shit out of...
- Fucking savages.

487
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,256
Can I get a medevac?

488
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,925
What's going on...
Holy Christ, she's a sapper.

489
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,385
I'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny. Go in there.

490
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,512
Put that right skid right up her ass.

491
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,268
We gotta get some air in these trees.
It's goddamn eat up with enemy down there.

492
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,646
I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over...

493
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,316
Three o'clock! Three o'clock, my position!
Drawing fire, drawing heavy fire!

494
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,527
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm going in.
My tail rotor's out. I got control.

495
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,456
- What do you think?
- Wow, this is really exciting, man.

496
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,793
- No, no! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.

497
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,796
Look at that, breaks both ways.
Watch. Watch.

498
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,258
Look! Good six-foot swells!

499
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,117
Come here, Lance.

500
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,162
Incoming!

501
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,795
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.

502
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:41,882
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

503
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,344
Come here! Come here!

504
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,183
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

505
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:54,145
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is.
Go change.

506
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,855
It's still pretty hairy out there, sir.

507
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,190
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

508
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:03,237
That's good, son, 'cause you either
surf or fight. That clear? Now get going.

509
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:06,449
I'll cover for them.
And bring a board for Lance!

510
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,161
We can't do shit till the boat gets here.

511
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,748
Lance,
I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.

512
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,875
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

513
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,837
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

514
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,048
We ought to wait for the tide to come up.

515
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,925
- Lance, come here. Look. Look!
- Incoming!

516
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,222
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!

517
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,560
You wanna wait here for six hours?

518
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,024
Yo! Hey! Chief!

519
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:51,035
Okay, fellas, quit hiding. Come on!

520
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,246
- Let's go, dickheads, take off!
- God damn it!

521
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,916
Don't you think
it's a little risky for R&R?

522
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:01,587
If I say it's safe to surf this beach,
Captain, it's safe to surf this beach!

523
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,008
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fucking place.

524
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,513
Give me that RT, soldier.

525
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,183
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.

526
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,186
God damn it! I want that tree line bombed!

527
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,064
<i>Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.</i>

528
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,899
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son!</i>

529
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,527
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three, roger.</i>

530
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,112
<i>They need some napalm
down there in the tree line.</i>

531
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,114
<i>Can you guys push
ground and put it down there?</i>

532
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:31,033
<i>Right, One-Three. We're fixing
to fuck with them. What's the target?</i>

533
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:34,328
<i>We're trying to suppress some
mortar fire off the tree line down there.</i>

534
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,621
<i>Roger. Here we come.</i>

535
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,625
<i>Good, give it all you got.
Bring in all your ships.</i>

536
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,296
Don't worry. We'll have this place
cleaned up and ready in a jiffy, son.

537
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,881
Don't you worry.

538
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,539
You smell that?

539
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,167
- Do you smell that?
- What?

540
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,711
Napalm, son.

541
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,547
Nothing else in the world
smells like that.

542
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,966
Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!

543
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,471
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

544
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,640
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

545
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,101
And when it was all over, I walked up.

546
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,314
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

547
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,611
But the smell, you know,
that gasoline smell...

548
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,362
The whole hill,

549
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,199
it smelled like

550
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,161
victory.

551
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,668
Someday this war's gonna end.

552
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,151
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

553
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,611
Come on. Let's get high.

554
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,655
- Want to smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

555
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,990
<i>Someday this war's gonna end.</i>

556
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,827
<i>That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.</i>

557
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,413
<i>They weren't looking
for anything more than a way home.</i>

558
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,748
Captain?

559
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,876
<i>Trouble is, I'd been back there</i>

560
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,505
<i>and I knew that it
just didn't exist anymore.</i>

561
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,010
Buddha time, here.

562
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,265
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

563
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,814
<i>If that's how Kilgore fought the war,</i>

564
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,276
<i>I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz.</i>

565
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,445
<i>It wasn't just insanity and murder.</i>

566
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:17,241
<i>There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.</i>

567
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,461
I mean, he never was hurting for pussy.

568
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,005
I'm not here.

569
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,259
I'm walking through the jungle
gathering mangos.

570
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,970
I meet Raquel Welch.

571
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,975
I make a nice mango cream pudding,

572
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,231
kind of spread it around on us.

573
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,776
Hey captain, I wanna get some mangoes.

574
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,654
Just don't go out there by yourself.

575
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,407
You don't wanna go in there alone...

576
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,161
not unless you really know the territory.

577
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,079
Any poisonous snakes around here?

578
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,499
Fuck it! I'm gonna get some mangoes.

579
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,426
Chef?

580
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,928
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

581
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,140
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

582
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,769
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

583
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:31,231
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

584
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:38,113
Yes, sir. See, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier,

585
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,782
a great saucier.

586
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,786
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

587
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,376
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.

588
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:01,387
Then I was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier School.

589
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,724
But then I got orders for my physical.

590
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,157
Hell, I joined the Navy.
Heard they had better food.

591
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,536
A cook school, that did it.

592
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:29,581
- Oh, yeah? How's that?
- You don't want to hear about that.

593
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,963
They lined us up in front
of 100 yards of prime rib.

594
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,341
All of us lined up, looking at it.

595
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:44,596
Magnificent meat, really.
Beautifully marbled.

596
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,598
Magnifique.

597
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,227
Next thing, they're throwing
the meat into these big cauldrons.

598
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,855
All of it, boiling it.

599
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,025
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.

600
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,154
I couldn't fucking believe that one.

601
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:04,241
That's when I applied for radioman school,
but then they gave me the...

602
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,826
What is it?

603
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,163
Charlie?

604
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,759
It's a tiger!

605
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,348
Tiger, man! It's a tiger!

606
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,767
Battle stations. Lance, up front!

607
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,268
- On the .60, Clean!
- Got it, man.

608
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,478
Holy shit.

609
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,023
- Chef, come on!
- Fucking tiger!

610
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,317
- Captain, come on!
- What's happening?

611
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,861
- Let's go!
- Tiger!

612
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:26,114
Chief, you were right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

613
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,326
- Bring that .60 forward!
- Never get out of the boat!

614
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:34,373
Never get out of the boat! I gotta
remember. Never get out of the boat.

615
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,128
- What happened? How many is it?
- A fucking tiger!

616
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,839
- What?
- A fucking tiger!

617
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,633
- Tiger?
- Yes! I've had it!

618
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:48,220
I've had the whole goddamn fucking shit,
man!

619
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:52,975
You can kiss my ass on the county square,
because I'm fucking bugging out.

620
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:57,312
I didn't come here for this.
I don't fucking need it! I don't want it.

621
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:01,233
I didn't get out of the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

622
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,278
All I wanted to do was fucking cook!

623
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,114
I just wanted
to learn to fucking cook, man!

624
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,993
- It's all right. It's all right.
- What happened, bro?

625
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,955
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.

626
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,457
- All right. It's all right.
- You're all right.

627
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:21,086
It's gonna be all right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

628
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:26,049
Never get out of the fucking boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Good-bye!

629
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,053
<i>Never get out of the boat.</i>

630
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,598
<i>Absolutely goddamn right.</i>

631
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,768
<i>Unless you were going all the way.</i>

632
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,901
<i>Kurtz got off the boat.</i>

633
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,821
<i>He split from the whole fucking program.</i>

634
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,743
<i>How did that happen?</i>

635
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,079
<i>What did he see here that first tour?</i>

636
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,047
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old.</i>

637
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:10,844
<i>If you joined the Green Berets, there
was no way you'd ever get above colonel.</i>

638
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,139
<i>Kurtz knew what he was giving up.</i>

639
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:20,103
And tine more ll reed and began
to understand, the more I admired him.

640
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,274
<i>His family and friends
couldn't understand it,</i>

641
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,943
<i>and they couldn't talk him out of it.</i>

642
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,698
<i>He had to apply three times
and he put up with a ton of shit.</i>

643
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,826
<i>But when he threatened to resign,
they gave it to him.</i>

644
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,292
<i>The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age.</i>

645
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,921
<i>They must have thought
he was some far-out old man,</i>

646
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,839
<i>humping it over that course.</i>

647
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:52,177
<i>I did it when I was 19
and it damn near wasted me.</i>

648
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,848
<i>A tough motherfucker.</i>

649
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,851
<i>He finished it.</i>

650
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,648
<i>He could have gone for General...</i>

651
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,193
<i>but he went for himself instead.</i>

652
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,156
"Dear Eva,

653
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:19,037
today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive by a fucking tiger.

654
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,750
Really un-fucking-believable, you know?

655
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,628
We're taking this guy, Captain Willard,
up the river,

656
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,547
but he hasn't told us
yet where we're taking him."

657
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,470
"Thought you might have heard by
now from Elwood. I'll be coming home..."

658
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,723
<i>October 1967,</i>

659
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:41,018
<i>on special assignment, Kon Tum Province,
II Corps.</i>

660
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,521
<i>Kurtz staged Operation Archangel!
with combined local forces,</i>

661
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,024
<i>rated a major success.</i>

662
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:54,740
<i>He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.</i>

663
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,660
<i>What balls.</i>

664
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,749
<i>They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one.</i>

665
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:07,544
<i>But after the press got a hold of it,
they promoted him to full colonel instead.</i>

666
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:11,715
<i>Oh, man,</i>

667
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,177
<i>the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam,</i>

668
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,095
<i>you needed wings to stay above it.</i>

669
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,294
This sure enough is a bizarre
sight in the middle of this shit.

670
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,464
Expecting us this time?

671
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,343
Damned if I know.

672
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:05,102
- Hello. Hello...
- Jesus.

673
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,902
Everything goes back up into the truck.

674
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:14,986
What?

675
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,696
We gotta get all that stuff up.

676
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,622
Hau Phat.
You ever been up here before, Chef?

677
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,874
- Let's go!
- I bet you we can score up here.

678
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,460
Yo, man, check out the bikes, Lance.

679
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,256
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

680
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,716
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, sukiyaki.

681
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,177
Yeah, man. This is something.

682
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,348
Please!

683
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,684
- This must be the guy.
- Right over there.

684
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,521
Sergeant. Sergeant?

685
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,321
Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR 5.

686
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:02,033
Come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
One hour. That's all. What do you want?

687
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,577
Can I get some Panama Red with it?

688
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,371
Panama Red. Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

689
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,915
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

690
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,876
- I don't have no destination.
- I can't do a goddamn thing

691
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,752
without a destination.
You got a destination?

692
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:13,920
- Sergeant.
- I need diesel fuel.

693
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,047
All right. You got
a destination? I need a destination.

694
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,799
I can't do a goddamn
thing without a destination.

695
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,968
Hey, Sarge, these guys are with me.

696
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,178
Destination's classified.

697
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,763
I carry priority papers from
COMSEC Intelligence, ll Corps.

698
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,850
Okay, right, sir.
Hey, listen, it's a real big night.

699
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,268
Eight bucks for that...

700
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,189
All right. Damn.

701
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,942
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

702
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,362
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

703
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,824
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

704
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,953
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

705
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,373
Hey, listen, would you guys like some
seats, some press box seats for the show?

706
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,335
You want those? The show, man.
The show out here.

707
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,171
- Bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

708
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,048
You got it. You gonna be here?

709
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,549
Hey, listen, Captain,

710
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,802
on the house. No hard feelings, huh?

711
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,800
How you doing out there?

712
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:45,595
I said, "How you doing out there?"

713
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:49,599
Want to say hello to you from all of us
up here to all of you out there

714
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,894
who worked so goddamn hard
in Operation Brute Force!

715
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,689
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!

716
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,317
And the Marines! And the sailors!

717
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,279
We want to let you know
that we're proud of you!

718
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,114
'Cause we know how tough
and how hard it's been.

719
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,032
Yeah!

720
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:09,744
And to prove it, we're gonna give you some
entertainment we know you're gonna like.

721
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:12,914
Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.

722
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:19,379
Miss May, Miss Terry Teray! Yeah!

723
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:24,884
And the Playmate of the Year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!

724
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,438
What's the matter?

725
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,107
They've got them here tonight!

726
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,948
Grease my gun!

727
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,250
I'm ready to bow-wow, baby!

728
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,353
You're cute. I like you.

729
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,398
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

730
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,609
Oh, my God...

731
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,404
Yeah!

732
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,032
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!

733
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,913
Hey, lover! You want us to come over?

734
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:21,334
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!

735
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,963
Sign my centerfold!

736
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,216
Come on, baby! Come up here now.

737
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,468
Get your goddamn hands off of my girl!

738
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:42,981
Start her up.

739
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,070
Come on!

740
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,491
Will you sign these?

741
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,994
Girls! Let's go!

742
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,097
So long!

743
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,601
<i>Charlie didn't get much USO.</i>

744
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,813
<i>He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.</i>

745
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:14,280
<i>His idea of great R&R was
cold rice and a little rat meat.</i>

746
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,326
<i>He had only two ways home,</i>

747
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,539
<i>death or victory.</i>

748
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:37,220
<i>No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Commands ass.</i>

749
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,685
<i>The war was being run
by a bunch of four-star clowns</i>

750
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,020
<i>who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus</i> away.

751
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,153
- Shit.
- Holy shit.

752
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,115
Chicken time. You ain't shitting,
bro. They're motherfucking...

753
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,245
- Who is that?
- What's going on?

754
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,791
Is that you, Lazzaro?

755
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:26,352
- Fire on the canopy!
- I got it! Get out of there!

756
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:30,481
Get out! I got it! Yeah! I got it!

757
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,820
- Lance, get down!
- Put that fucker out, man!

758
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,871
What the fuck they think they're doing?

759
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,649
<i>Late summer, autumn 1968.</i>

760
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:17,028
<i>Kurtz's patrols in the
highlands coming under frequent ambush.</i>

761
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,989
<i>The camp started falling apart.</i>

762
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:27,997
<i>November.</i>

763
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:32,335
<i>Kurtz orders assassination
of three Vietnamese men and one woman.</i>

764
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,006
<i>Two of the men were colonels
in the South Vietnamese army.</i>

765
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,805
<i>Enemy activity in his old
sector dropped off to nothing.</i>

766
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:48,601
<i>Guess he must have hit
the right four people.</i>

767
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:55,608
He joined the Special Forces.
And after that, his...

768
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:00,446
<i>The Army tried one last
time to bring him back into the fold.</i>

769
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,572
...methods...

770
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:04,450
<i>And if he'd pulled over,
it all would have been forgotten.</i>

771
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:05,576
...unsound.

772
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,912
<i>But he kept going...</i>

773
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,664
Now he's crossed into Cambodia...

774
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,124
<i>...and he kept winning it his way...</i>

775
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,167
...with this Montagnard army of his...

776
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,627
<i>...and they called me in.</i>

777
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:19,674
...man like a god. And follow
every order, however ridiculous.

778
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,970
<i>They lost him.</i>

779
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,056
<i>He was gone.</i>

780
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,269
<i>Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence,</i>

781
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,146
<i>mostly from captured VC.</i>

782
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,568
<i>The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared of him.</i>

783
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,864
<i>He and his men were playing hit and run,
all the way into Cambodia.</i>

784
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,831
I know where I'm going.
I'm going to the White House

785
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:56,252
to have dinner with the
President of the United States, baby.

786
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,587
That's where I'm going.

787
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,590
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.

788
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,593
Clean.

789
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:11,642
- How long has that kid been on this boat?
- Seven months.

790
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,271
He's really
specializing in busting my balls.

791
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,608
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

792
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,570
Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?

793
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,197
I don't think.

794
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,867
My orders say I'm not supposed to know
where I'm taking this boat, so I don't!

795
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,954
But one look at you, and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

796
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,677
We're going upriver about 75
klicks above the Do Luong bridge.

797
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,101
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

798
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,272
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

799
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,903
You just get me close to my destination,
and I'll cut you and the crew loose.

800
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,158
All right, Captain.

801
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,306
<i>"Dear Son,</i>

802
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,601
<i>I'm afraid that both you
and your mother will have been worried</i>

803
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,813
<i>at not hearing from me
during the past weeks.</i>

804
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:42,066
<i>But my situation here
has become a difficult one.</i>

805
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,653
<i>I have been officially
accused of murder by the Army.</i>

806
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,955
<i>The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents.</i>

807
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,542
<i>We spent months uncovering
them and accumulating evidence.</i>

808
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:06,215
<i>When absolute proof was completed,
we acted, we acted like soldiers.</i>

809
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,552
<i>The charges are unjustified.</i>

810
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,054
<i>They are, in fact,</i>

811
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:15,725
<i>and in the circumstances
of this conflict, quite completely insane.</i>

812
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,072
<i>In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.</i>

813
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:36,245
<i>There are many moments for ruthless
action, what is often called ruthless,</i>

814
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,957
<i>what may, in many circumstances,
be only clarity.</i>

815
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,085
<i>Seeing clearly what there
is to be done and doing it."</i>

816
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,211
Medevac, come in.

<i>- "... directly, quickly, awake..."</i>
- Alpha Tango Tango.

818

<i>- "...looking at it."</i>

819
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,345
...request dust-off.
Three, maybe four KIAs. Over.

mother what you choose about this letter.</i>

I am unconcerned."</i>

822
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,561
Medevac, come in.

823
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,230
<i>"I am beyond their timid, lying morality.</i>

824
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:06,734
<i>- "And so I am beyond caring."</i>
- Medevac, do you read? Over.

825
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:10,196
<i>"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."</i>

826
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,378
Shove it, fuck-up!

827
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,881
Sure sorry about that. If I had known,
I'd have taken you to New Orleans...

828
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,300
- Man, fuck you.
- ...introduce you to cooze, Bubba!

829
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,386
You're a fucking dog!

830
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,595
Come on down to New Orleans, Bubba,

831
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,348
- and I'll get you fixed up, you prick.
- Lay off, Chef.

832
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,850
You're the only fucking
prick I see around here.

833
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,978
If I want to play with a prick,
I'll play with my own!

834
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,480
- Lay off, Chef!
- What you gonna do with it, cherry boy?

835
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:47,024
- Fucking cherry boy!
- Chef, I said lay off!

836
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:51,904
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break!
What do you think I said?

837
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,614
And give your jaws a rest!

838
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:57,034
And this ain't the Army. You are a sailor!

839
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:01,789
So get out of that frizzly Army-looking
shirt and stop smoking that dope!

840
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:03,958
You hear me?

841
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,589
Lance, what's with all the green paint?

842
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:13,092
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

843
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,677
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

844
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,806
Uh-huh. I want you to stay awake up there,
man. You got a job to do.

845
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:41,328
Sampan off the port bow. Sampan
off the port bow. Let's take a look.

846
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:43,497
Lance. Bring them in.

847
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,708
Clean, on the .60. Chef, get a .16.

848
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,753
Clean, get on that .60!

849
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,340
What's up, Chief?

850
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:58,679
Ajunk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

851
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,931
Well,
let's forget routine now and let them go.

852
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,559
These boats are running
supplies in this delta, Captain.

853
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:04,769
I'm gonna take a look.

854
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,022
Chief, my mission's got priority here.

855
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,566
Hell, you wouldn't even be in this
part of the river if it wasn't for me.

856
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:14,695
Until we reach your destination, Captain,
you're just on for the ride.

857
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,657
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on, throw the rope, asshole.

858
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,951
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

859
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,134
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

860
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,852
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker!
Move it!

861
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,732
- You two, come on.
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.

862
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:52,858
I got you, Chief.

863
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,656
It's clear, Chief.

864
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:08,374
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

865
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,000
Board and search it.

866
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,837
It's just a fucking boat.
There ain't nothing on it, Chief.

867
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,213
Board it and search it.

868
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,882
Just some baskets and some ducks,
fucking bananas.

869
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,467
Ain't nothing on it.
Don't be ashamed, Chef.

870
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,927
What's wrong with you?
Go on and search it.

871
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,138
There's a goat and some fish.

872
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,348
- Chef!
- Bunch of fucking vegetables.

873
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,684
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothing on it, man!

874
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,310
- Get on it!
- All right!

875
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:32,481
Move it, asshole! Goddamn it!
Just some pigs.

876
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,983
Look, mangos.

877
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,068
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fucking rice!

878
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,779
- Look in there, Chef. Look in it.
- Some fucking fish.

879
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,783
More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.

880
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,536
What's in that vegetable basket?

881
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,914
Get out of here! Come on!
Get over there, Goddamn it.

882
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,041
Check that vegetable basket.

883
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,418
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!

884
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,420
- There ain't nothing in here.
- What's in the boxes?

885
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,546
Not a fucking thing.

886
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:56,964
- Look in that tin can.
- Nothing.

887
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,425
- That rusty can.
- Just fucking rice, that's all!

888
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,759
- There ain't nothing on it!
- Check the yellow can.

889
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,053
Check the yellow can!
She was sitting on it. What's in it?

890
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:08,934
Chef!

891
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,773
Motherfuckers!

892
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,202
- Hold it!
- Come on, let's kill them all!

893
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,913
- Fucking cocksucking mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

894
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,624
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit out of all of them.

895
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,877
- Chef, hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

896
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,963
Why the fuck not?

897
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,008
- Clean?
- I'm good.

898
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,977
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

899
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,313
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding, huh?

900
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,982
- You all right?
- See what she was running for?

901
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,780
It's a fucking puppy-

902
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,199
It's a fucking puppy-

903
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,661
Give me that dog!

904
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,579
- No, you're not gonna get it!
- Fucking give it to me!

905
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,831
Give me the fucking dog, asshole!

906
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,124
Fuck you!

907
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,127
- Chef.
- Fucking mango, too!

908
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,212
You want that?

909
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,422
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

910
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,549
- Chef!
- Yes!

911
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,343
She's moving behind you. Check her out!

912
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,095
All right. All right.

913
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,514
Come on, Clean, Goddamn it.
Give me a hand.

914
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,474
She's not dead, she's wounded.
Clean, give him a hand.

915
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,937
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Slow down and take it easy.

916
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,523
All right, Chef,
just wait a minute. Wait a minute, Chef.

917
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,066
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing, Chef?

918
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:42,695
- She's hurt. She's bleeding.
- Oh, man.

919
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,739
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

920
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,241
What are you talking about?

921
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,701
We're taking her to some friendlies,
Captain.

922
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,286
She's wounded, she's not dead.

923
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,538
- Get out of there, Chef.
- The book says, Captain...

924
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:06,427
Fuck you. Fuck him.

925
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,804
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.

926
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:12,451
<i>It was the way we had
over here of living with ourselves.</i>

927
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:16,747
<i>We'd cut them in half with a machine gun
and give them a Band-Aid.</i>

928
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,834
<i>It was a lie,</i>

929
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,420
<i>and the more I saw of them,</i>

930
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,256
<i>the more I hated lies.</i>

931
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:32,679
<i>Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again.</i>

932
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,974
<i>But I felt like I knew one
or two things about Kurtz</i>

933
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,268
<i>that weren't in the dossier.</i>

934
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:47,861
<i>Do Luong bridge was the last
Army outpost on the Nung River.</i>

935
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,535
<i>Beyond that, there was only Kurtz.</i>

936
01:21:56,662 --> 01:22:00,290
Lance! Hey, Lance, what do you think?

937
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:01,917
It's beautiful.

938
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,505
Huh? I mean, what's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.

939
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,676
Hey, you know that last
tab of acid I was saving?

940
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,345
- Yeah.
- I dropped it.

941
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,181
You dropped acid? Far out.

942
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,280
- Take me home!
- God damn you!

943
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:45,335
God damn! You'll get what you deserve!

944
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:56,305
Is there a Captain Willard on board?

945
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,764
- Yeah!
- Captain Willard?

946
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:00,851
- Yeah, who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

947
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:01,977
Get that light off me.

948
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,815
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

949
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:10,068
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

950
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,321
You don't know how happy
this makes me, sir.

951
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,072
- Why?
- Now I can get out of here,

952
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,491
if I can find a way.

953
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,456
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain!

954
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,004
Captain, where you going?

955
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,757
See if I can find some fuel,
get some information.

956
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:37,179
- Pick me up the other side of the bridge.
- Somebody go with him. Chef!

957
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:40,098
I'll go. I wanna go.

958
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:56,657
You get your ass in gear.

959
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,571
Come on, man. Listen to the music, man.

960
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:37,447
Where can I find the CO?

961
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,908
You came right to it, son of a bitch!

962
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:43,328
Lance! Get down here!

963
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,292
You still got a Commanding Officer here?

964
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,837
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

965
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,717
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills.

966
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,386
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

967
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,340
Goddamn it, you stepped in my face!

968
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,717
- We thought you were dead.
- Well, you thought wrong, damn it.

969
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,307
I told you to stop fucking with me,
didn't I?

970
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,184
You think you're so bad, huh, nigga?

971
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,102
What are you shooting at, soldier?

972
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:51,730
Gooks.
What the fuck you think I'm shooting at?

973
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,566
I'm sorry, sir.
There are gooks out there by the wire,

974
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:58,403
- but I think I killed them all.
- You ain't shot shit, man. Listen!

975
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:03,241
Oh, shit, he's trying to call his friends,
man. Send up a flare.

976
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,044
You think you're so bad, nigga?
You think you bad, huh?

977
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:17,923
They're all dead, stupid. There's
one still alive underneath them bodies.

978
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,009
Who's the Commanding Officer here?

979
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,427
Ain't you?

980
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:25,889
You think you're so bad, huh?

981
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,475
I got something for your ass now, nigga!

982
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,602
I got something for you now!

983
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:34,272
He's underneath the bodies, man.

984
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,527
- Go get the roach, man.
- Go get the roach, man.

985
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:42,072
- Go get the roach, nigga!
- I'm gonna go get the roach.

986
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:49,996
Roach. Roach. Roach.

987
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,667
Got slopes on the wire, man.
Do you hear them?

988
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,752
- Lance!
- Do you hear them?

989
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:02,426
Go bust them!

990
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:08,306
Hey, GI, fuck you!

991
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,985
You hear him out there on the wire, man?

992
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:24,114
- Yeah.
- I'll kill you, GI!

993
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,282
You need a flare?

994
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,535
No.

995
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,747
He's close, man.

996
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,332
He's real close.

997
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,523
GI, fuck you!

998
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:02,861
GI, fuck you!

999
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,243
Motherfucker.

1000
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:13,288
Hey, soldier...

1001
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,211
do you know who's in command here?

1002
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,089
Yeah.

1003
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,481
Holy shit!

1004
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:47,531
Yo, Chief, man,
two guys just got blown off that bridge.

1005
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:50,158
You hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.

1006
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,248
- What's that?
- Mail, man.

1007
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,583
Later on the mail! Watch them trees.

1008
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,922
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1009
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,590
Let's move out.

1010
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:10,220
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1011
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,392
- Let's just get going.
- Which way, Captain?

1012
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,483
You know which way, Chief.

1013
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,069
You're on your own, Captain.

1014
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:28,780
Do you wanna go on?

1015
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:33,493
Like this bridge, we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again

1016
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:36,246
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1017
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,290
Think about it.

1018
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,795
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1019
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,677
Chef, on the bow.

1020
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,722
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go.

1021
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:51,655
Whose package is that?

1022
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:56,159
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit. Wait a minute, is that it?

1023
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:57,953
- That's it for you.
- Lance!

1024
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,539
<i>Mr. LB. Johnson, there you go.</i>

1025
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:06,044
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waiting for this one.

1026
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:09,589
I got another one, got a box from Eva.

1027
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:12,509
"Lance, I'm fine. I'm fine, Lance.

1028
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:16,221
Sue and I went tripping to Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1029
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,557
- I want to get back to Antoine's.
- "I remember the time we went..."

1030
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,227
How could I fucking forget, man?
Beautiful.

1031
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,855
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1032
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:27,190
Let me know."

1033
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:30,735
Jim, it's here. It really is here.

1034
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:37,575
<i>"There has been a new
development regarding your mission</i>

1035
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:40,036
<i>which we must now communicate to you.</i>

1036
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,163
<i>Months ago,
a man was ordered on a mission</i>

1037
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,915
<i>which was identical to yours.</i>

1038
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:48,086
<i>We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Colonel Kurtz.</i>

1039
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:53,550
<i>Saigon was carrying him
MIA for his family's sake.</i>

1040
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:56,094
<i>They assumed he was dead.</i>

1041
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:59,264
<i>Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."</i>

1042
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,603
<i>Captain Richard Colby...</i>

1043
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,190
<i>he was with Kurtz.</i>

1044
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:11,776
Disneyland.

1045
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:15,530
Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.

1046
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,575
"Charles Miller Manson
ordered the slaughter

1047
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:21,953
of all in the home
anyway as a symbol of protest."

1048
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,830
That's really weird, ain't it?

1049
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,709
- Purple haze, look.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1050
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:31,421
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Chief, rainbow reality, man.

1051
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,882
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.

1052
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,801
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1053
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:40,430
She pictures me at home
having a beer and watching TV.

1054
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:44,309
Hey, Lance, man.

1055
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:45,810
Hot potato! Hot potato!

1056
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,688
<i>I'm so glad you decided to join...</i>

1057
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:51,733
Eva's not sure if she can
have a relationship with me, you know?

1058
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:55,153
Here I am, 13,000 fucking miles away,

1059
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,448
trying to keep a relationship open,
my ass.

1060
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:02,077
<i>That's much more
than I can say for some of your friends.</i>

1061
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:05,955
<i>If this tape is any good,
I will have Dad and the family</i>

1062
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:09,000
<i>- send you a tape of their own...</i>
- Hey, Lance.

1063
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:28,895
There! Over there!

1064
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,358
Motherfuckers!

1065
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:45,954
There! Over there!

1066
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,251
Lance! Chef!

1067
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:00,093
- Chef, Chef, check out Clean!
- Captain, he's hit, he's hit! Clean's hit!

1068
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,303
- Lance!
- Where'd the dog go?

1069
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,223
Lance. Lance, check out Clean!

1070
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:08,810
Where's the dog?
We got to go back to get the dog!

1071
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:09,978
Hey, Clean.

1072
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,355
<i>It's always been nice to have...</i>

1073
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,816
Hey, Bubba!

1074
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:16,651
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!

1075
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:21,197
<i>- And so, I'm hoping...
- Bubba!</i>

1076
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:26,536
<i>...that pretty soon, not too soon,
but pretty soon,</i>

1077
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:30,331
<i>I'll have a lot of grandchildren
to love and spoil,</i>

1078
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:33,751
<i>and then when your wife get them back,
she'll be mad with me.</i>

1079
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,253
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

1080
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:41,301
<i>Even Aunt Jessie and Mama
will come to celebrate your coming home.</i>

1081
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:45,346
<i>Granny and Dad are trying
to get enough money to get you a car.</i>

1082
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:48,975
<i>But don't tell her,
because that's our secret.</i>

1083
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:55,148
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing,
stay out of the way of the bullets,</i>

1084
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:59,652
<i>and bring your heinie
home all in one piece</i>

1085
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:03,907
<i>because we love you very much. Love, Mama.</i>

1086
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:16,711
Oh, man. You're so young.

1087
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,011
Clean.

1088
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:54,809
Can't see nothing. We're stopping.

1089
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:57,687
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1090
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:01,274
I said I can't see a thing,
Captain. I'm stopping this boat.

1091
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:02,942
I ain't risking no more lives.

1092
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:05,945
I'm in command here,
God damn it. You'll do what I say.

1093
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:09,782
You see anything, Chef?

1094
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:14,829
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1095
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,975
Watch it over here, Chief.

1096
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:38,895
Got a stump.

1097
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,273
Lance, on the .50s.

1098
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,151
<i>He was close.</i>

1099
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:48,863
<i>He was real close.</i>

1100
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:53,451
<i>I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him,</i>

1101
01:37:54,077 --> 01:37:56,037
<i>as if the boat were being sucked upriver</i>

1102
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,998
<i>and the water was
flowing back into the jungle.</i>

1103
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,961
<i>Whatever was going to happen,</i>

1104
01:38:04,045 --> 01:38:08,007
<i>it wasn't gonna be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang.</i>

1105
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:13,763
Arrows!

1106
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:14,972
Fire!

1107
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,143
Chef, open up! Fire!

1108
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,483
Lance, fire!

1109
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:38,663
Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.
They're just little toy arrows.

1110
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:41,040
Cut it out! Quiet!

1111
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:44,085
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1112
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,587
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1113
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,256
Quiet!

1114
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:52,093
You got us in this mess,
and now you can't get us out

1115
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,095
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do you?

1116
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:55,847
Do you?

1117
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,725
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1118
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:03,688
- Lance, get the wheel!
- Fire!

1119
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:07,900
You savages!
Come and get it, you son of a bitches!

1120
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:30,423
A spear.

1121
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:52,338
My mission
is to make it up into Cambodia.

1122
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:55,424
There's a Green Beret
colonel up there who's gone insane

1123
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:57,510
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1124
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:01,764
That's fucking typical! Shit!

1125
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:04,058
Fucking Vietnam mission!

1126
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:07,895
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1127
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:11,899
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1128
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:15,945
Shit! That's fucking crazy.

1129
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:19,031
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge

1130
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:21,993
or some fucking
railroad tracks or something.

1131
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:25,037
- Sorry.
- No, no, wait, wait.

1132
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:28,416
We'll go together on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1133
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:32,169
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?

1134
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:41,113
<i>Part of me was
afraid of what I would find</i>

1135
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:43,199
<i>and what I would do when I got there.</i>

1136
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:47,620
<i>I knew the risks...</i>

1137
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,623
<i>or imagined I knew.</i>

1138
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:57,421
<i>But the thing I felt the most,
much stronger than fear...</i>

1139
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:00,966
<i>was the desire to confront him.</i>

1140
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:14,957
Just keep moving.

1141
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:19,336
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.

1142
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:49,426
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1143
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:53,848
I ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1144
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:58,519
Zap them with your siren, man.
Zap them with your siren.

1145
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,865
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too.

1146
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:13,409
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys bite you, I'll tell you.

1147
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:16,787
That's a pretty one.
Move it right in toward me.

1148
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:22,084
I'm an American! Yeah!
An American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1149
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,295
Hi, American.

1150
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,213
American civilian. It's all right.

1151
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:29,884
And you got the cigarettes.
And that's what I've been dreaming about.

1152
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,136
Chef.

1153
01:46:32,887 --> 01:46:35,556
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1154
01:46:39,852 --> 01:46:41,478
I'm a photojournalist.

1155
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:47,067
I've covered the war since 64.
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and Nam.

1156
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:54,491
I'll tell you one thing,
this boat is a mess, man.

1157
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:56,827
Who are all these people?

1158
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:59,455
Yeah, they think you've come to...

1159
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:02,249
take him away,

1160
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:05,210
- and I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1161
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:08,589
Him!

1162
01:47:09,214 --> 01:47:10,424
Colonel Kurtz.

1163
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,011
These are all his children, man,
as far as you can see.

1164
01:47:15,304 --> 01:47:17,806
Hell, man, out here,
we're all his children.

1165
01:47:18,724 --> 01:47:19,934
Could we...

1166
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:22,102
talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1167
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:25,439
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel.

1168
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,776
Well, you listen to him.

1169
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:35,574
The man's enlarged my mind.
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1170
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,411
Sometimes you'll say hello to him, right,

1171
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:41,872
and he'll just walk right by
you and he won't even notice you.

1172
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:45,459
And then suddenly he'll grab you,
he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say,

1173
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:48,629
"Do you know that 'if is the middle
word in 'life"? If you can keep your head

1174
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:50,506
"when all about you are losing
theirs and blaming it on you,

1175
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,007
if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."

1176
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:56,553
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1177
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:59,807
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws,

1178
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:02,768
Scuttling across
the floors of silent seas."

1179
01:48:02,851 --> 01:48:04,395
Stay with the boat.

1180
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:08,524
Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.

1181
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:15,739
He can be terrible, he can be mean,
and he can be right.

1182
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:19,576
He's fighting the war. He's a great man.

1183
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:23,747
I mean...

1184
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:31,213
I wish I had words, you know?
I wish I had words.

1185
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:33,841
I can tell you something, like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

1186
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,677
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1187
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:38,762
Because I took his picture.

1188
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:42,057
He said, "if you take my picture again...

1189
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:44,768
I'm gonna kill you..."

1190
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:47,312
and he meant it.

1191
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:53,777
So you just lay cool.
Play it cool, laid back. Dig it.

1192
01:48:54,403 --> 01:48:56,113
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1193
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:00,117
But you don't judge the Colonel.

1194
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:03,162
You don't judge the
Colonel like an ordinary man.

1195
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:13,505
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1196
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:15,090
You can feel the vibe of this place.

1197
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:19,553
Let me take your picture.
Could you hold... Hello? Hello?

1198
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:21,138
Could you hold up a minute?

1199
01:49:43,494 --> 01:49:44,661
Colby.

1200
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,598
The heads. You're looking at the heads.

1201
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:08,852
Sometimes he goes too far.

1202
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,771
He's the first one to admit it.

1203
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:14,149
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1204
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:19,071
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago.

1205
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:21,740
If you could have heard him then, God...

1206
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:23,700
You're gonna call him crazy?

1207
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:25,661
Fucking A.

1208
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,539
I just wanna talk to him.

1209
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:32,459
Well, man, he's gone away.

1210
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:36,797
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1211
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,633
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1212
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,594
He forgets himself with his people.

1213
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:47,391
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1214
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:49,143
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.

1215
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:51,812
Okay, Chef.

1216
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:56,733
- We'll go back to the boat for a while.
- Yeah, stay with Lance.

1217
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:24,845
This Colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1218
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,806
That's what the man's got set up here!

1219
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:30,225
Man, it's fucking Pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1220
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:34,438
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1221
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:38,275
Help you? Fucking A, I'll help you.
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.

1222
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:39,985
Good boy.

1223
01:51:40,068 --> 01:51:41,528
We could blow all them assholes away.

1224
01:51:41,612 --> 01:51:44,239
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1225
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:49,661
I ain't afraid of all them
fucking skulls and altars and shit.

1226
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:55,417
I used to think
if I died in an evil place,

1227
01:51:56,001 --> 01:51:58,086
then my soul wouldn't be
able to make it to heaven.

1228
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:02,007
But now, fuck.

1229
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:06,511
I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1230
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:09,932
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1231
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:11,808
- No, no.
- Get out of here.

1232
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:13,518
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1233
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:17,814
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,
check the place out,

1234
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,609
see if I can find the Colonel, okay?

1235
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:25,489
- What do you want me to do?
- Damn it.

1236
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:31,578
Here, you take the radio,
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours...

1237
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,791
you call in the air strike.

1238
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:39,962
Air strike?

1239
01:52:41,713 --> 01:52:46,385
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates 0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1240
01:52:47,302 --> 01:52:48,637
It's all in there.

1241
01:52:50,305 --> 01:52:53,100
0-9-2-6-4-7-1 -2.

1242
01:53:01,817 --> 01:53:05,153
<i>Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.</i>

1243
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:15,289
<i>The place was full of bodies.
North Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.</i>

1244
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:25,882
<i>If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way.</i>

1245
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:37,227
Hey!

1246
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:02,753
<i>It smelled like slow death in there.</i>

1247
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:07,591
<i>Malaria, nightmares.</i>

1248
01:54:10,385 --> 01:54:12,679
<i>This was the end of the river, all right.</i>

1249
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:28,153
Where are you from, Willard?

1250
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:35,327
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1251
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,336
- Were you born there?
- Yes, sir.

1252
01:54:46,088 --> 01:54:49,216
- Whereabouts?
- Toledo, sir.

1253
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,891
How far are you from the river?

1254
01:55:04,856 --> 01:55:06,566
The Ohio River, sir?

1255
01:55:07,818 --> 01:55:10,779
- Uh-huh.
- About 200 miles.

1256
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:21,748
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1257
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:29,631
There's a place in the river,
I can't remember.

1258
01:55:29,714 --> 01:55:34,886
It must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1259
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:37,722
It's all wild and overgrown now,

1260
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:44,312
but for about five miles, you'd think
that heaven just fell on the Earth...

1261
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:47,691
in the form of gardenias.

1262
01:56:03,999 --> 01:56:09,045
Have you ever
considered any real freedoms?

1263
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:17,762
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1264
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:23,268
Even the opinions of yourself?

1265
01:56:39,451 --> 01:56:43,038
Did they say why, Willard?

1266
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:50,003
Why they wanted to terminate my command?

1267
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:07,854
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1268
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:13,735
No longer classified...

1269
01:57:14,986 --> 01:57:16,238
is it?

1270
01:57:22,911 --> 01:57:24,329
What did they tell you?

1271
01:57:27,332 --> 01:57:28,875
They told me

1272
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:31,127
that you had gone...

1273
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:33,713
totally insane...

1274
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:41,054
and that your methods were

1275
01:57:42,013 --> 01:57:43,223
unsound.

1276
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:48,687
Are my methods unsound?

1277
01:57:54,776 --> 01:58:00,949
I don't see any method at all, sir.

1278
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:11,668
I expected someone like you.

1279
01:58:15,046 --> 01:58:16,298
What did you expect?

1280
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:26,141
Are you an assassin?

1281
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,188
I'm a soldier.

1282
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:37,652
You're neither.

1283
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:41,323
You're an errand boy...

1284
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:44,826
sent by grocery clerks...

1285
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:50,832
to collect a bill.

1286
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:40,465
Why, huh? Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1287
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:49,057
Going down pretty good, huh?

1288
01:59:49,808 --> 01:59:50,892
Why?

1289
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:54,270
You know?

1290
01:59:55,063 --> 01:59:57,107
Do you know that the man...

1291
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,612
the man really likes you?

1292
02:00:05,907 --> 02:00:08,118
He likes you. He really likes you...

1293
02:00:10,328 --> 02:00:12,205
but he's got something in mind for you.

1294
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:15,041
Aren't you curious about that?

1295
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:19,045
I'm curious. I'm very curious.

1296
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,506
Are you curious?

1297
02:00:24,592 --> 02:00:27,387
There's something happening out here, man.

1298
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:33,727
You know something, man?
I know something that you don't know.

1299
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:35,437
That's right, jack.

1300
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,814
The man is clear in his mind...

1301
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:40,650
but his soul is mad.

1302
02:00:42,861 --> 02:00:44,154
Oh, yeah.

1303
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:49,284
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this. He hates it.

1304
02:00:50,368 --> 02:00:54,247
But the man's...

1305
02:00:57,751 --> 02:01:00,253
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

1306
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:03,339
And a voice...

1307
02:01:05,216 --> 02:01:06,468
a voice...

1308
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:10,972
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.

1309
02:01:12,140 --> 02:01:13,850
He's got plans for you.

1310
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:18,563
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.

1311
02:01:19,522 --> 02:01:21,274
You're gonna help him.

1312
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:23,818
What are they gonna say, man,
when he's gone? Huh?

1313
02:01:23,902 --> 02:01:28,573
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1314
02:01:28,656 --> 02:01:30,742
What are they gonna say about him?
What are they gonna say?

1315
02:01:30,825 --> 02:01:34,412
"He was a kind man. He was a wise man.

1316
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:38,291
He had plans. He had wisdom."
Bullshit, man!

1317
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:42,712
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1318
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:47,300
You.

1319
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,557
Almost eight hours.

1320
02:01:57,101 --> 02:02:00,563
God. I'm asleep.

1321
02:02:02,482 --> 02:02:05,235
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1322
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:18,456
Fuck.

1323
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:24,337
Has it been eight hours?

1324
02:02:27,423 --> 02:02:32,095
Hello, Almighty, Almighty,
this is PBR Street Gang.

1325
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:33,596
Radio check. Over.

1326
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:37,433
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty standing by. Over.</i>

1327
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:03,311
What the hell! Jesus!

1328
02:04:10,318 --> 02:04:12,070
Oh, Christ!

1329
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:43,805
"We are the hollow men,
We are the stuffed men,

1330
02:06:44,514 --> 02:06:49,936
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!

1331
02:06:51,479 --> 02:06:54,023
Our dried voices,
when we whisper together,

1332
02:06:54,107 --> 02:06:57,443
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass...

1333
02:06:58,486 --> 02:07:01,030
- Or rats' feet over broken glass..."
- Oh, he's out there.

1334
02:07:01,114 --> 02:07:02,615
"In our dry cellar..."

1335
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:04,242
He's really out there.

1336
02:07:04,325 --> 02:07:09,163
"Shape without form,
shade without color...

1337
02:07:10,498 --> 02:07:15,211
Paralyzed force,
gesture without motion..."

1338
02:07:15,294 --> 02:07:16,838
Do you know what the man's saying?

1339
02:07:18,172 --> 02:07:19,882
- Do you?
- "Those who have crossed..."

1340
02:07:20,508 --> 02:07:24,762
This is dialectics. It's very
simple dialectics. One through nine,

1341
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:28,224
no "maybes," no "supposes," no fractions.
You can't travel in space.

1342
02:07:28,307 --> 02:07:32,687
You can't go out into space, you know,
without like... With fractions.

1343
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:34,605
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1344
02:07:34,689 --> 02:07:37,441
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1345
02:07:37,525 --> 02:07:39,443
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1346
02:07:39,527 --> 02:07:41,612
Dialectic logic is,
"There's only love and hate."

1347
02:07:41,696 --> 02:07:43,739
You either love somebody or you hate them.

1348
02:07:44,198 --> 02:07:45,283
Mutt!

1349
02:07:47,618 --> 02:07:48,870
You mutt.

1350
02:07:49,704 --> 02:07:54,709
This is the way the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

1351
02:07:55,459 --> 02:07:57,461
"Not with a bang, a whimper."

1352
02:07:57,545 --> 02:07:59,881
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, jack.

1353
02:08:29,327 --> 02:08:32,455
<i>On the river, I thought
that the minute I looked at him,</i>

1354
02:08:32,538 --> 02:08:34,290
<i>I'd know what to do.</i>

1355
02:08:35,249 --> 02:08:36,500
<i>But it didn't happen.</i>

1356
02:08:38,461 --> 02:08:41,964
<i>I was in there with him for days,
not under guard.</i>

1357
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:44,133
<i>I was free.</i>

1358
02:08:45,051 --> 02:08:47,303
<i>But he knew I wasn't going anywhere.</i>

1359
02:08:48,554 --> 02:08:51,724
<i>He knew more about
what I was going to do than I did.</i>

1360
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:02,443
<i>If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw,</i>

1361
02:09:03,402 --> 02:09:05,988
<i>would they still want me to kill him?</i>

1362
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,116
<i>More than ever, probably.</i>

1363
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:12,495
<i>And what would his people back home want,</i>

1364
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:15,623
<i>if they ever learned just how
far from them he'd really gone?</i>

1365
02:09:18,209 --> 02:09:21,629
<i>He broke from them,
and then he broke from himself.</i>

1366
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:27,468
<i>I'd never seen a man
so broken up and ripped apart.</i>

1367
02:09:28,469 --> 02:09:32,598
I've seen the horrors,
horrors that you've seen.

1368
02:09:35,268 --> 02:09:37,311
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

1369
02:09:37,395 --> 02:09:39,188
You have a right to kill me.

1370
02:09:40,523 --> 02:09:42,858
You have a right to do that.

1371
02:09:44,652 --> 02:09:46,654
But you have no right to judge me.

1372
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:58,833
It's impossible for words to describe...

1373
02:10:01,168 --> 02:10:04,338
what is necessary...

1374
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:10,344
to those who do not know...

1375
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,640
what horror means.

1376
02:10:16,976 --> 02:10:18,185
Horror.

1377
02:10:21,188 --> 02:10:23,816
Horror has a face.

1378
02:10:26,110 --> 02:10:28,237
And you must make a friend of horror.

1379
02:10:29,947 --> 02:10:34,785
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

1380
02:10:35,369 --> 02:10:40,166
If they are not,
then they are enemies to be feared.

1381
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:43,544
They are truly enemies.

1382
02:10:48,549 --> 02:10:51,385
I remember when I was with Special Forces.

1383
02:10:55,890 --> 02:10:59,810
It seems a thousand centuries ago.

1384
02:11:03,397 --> 02:11:09,236
We went into a camp
to inoculate some children.

1385
02:11:13,824 --> 02:11:19,372
We'd left the camp after we had
inoculated the children for polio.

1386
02:11:21,832 --> 02:11:25,211
And this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't see.

1387
02:11:28,798 --> 02:11:30,466
We went back there,

1388
02:11:31,425 --> 02:11:36,889
and they had come
and hacked off every inoculated arm.

1389
02:11:39,266 --> 02:11:42,686
There they were, in a pile. A pile...

1390
02:11:44,855 --> 02:11:46,107
of little arms.

1391
02:11:48,192 --> 02:11:50,444
And I remember...

1392
02:11:54,323 --> 02:11:57,118
I cried. I wept like...

1393
02:11:59,286 --> 02:12:01,956
some grandmother.

1394
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:07,378
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

1395
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:11,382
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

1396
02:12:12,258 --> 02:12:14,093
I never want to forget.

1397
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:17,346
And then I realized...

1398
02:12:18,806 --> 02:12:23,144
like I was shot,
like I was shot with a diamond...

1399
02:12:24,353 --> 02:12:27,481
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

1400
02:12:29,567 --> 02:12:34,738
And I thought, "My God,
the genius of that. The genius."

1401
02:12:36,157 --> 02:12:38,534
The will to do that...

1402
02:12:40,202 --> 02:12:44,665
perfect, genuine,
complete, crystalline, pure.

1403
02:12:47,251 --> 02:12:49,170
And then I realized

1404
02:12:49,253 --> 02:12:52,840
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

1405
02:12:52,923 --> 02:12:56,886
These were not monsters.
These were men, trained cadres.

1406
02:12:58,345 --> 02:13:00,931
These men who fought with their hearts,

1407
02:13:01,015 --> 02:13:04,393
who have families, who have children,
who are filled with love...

1408
02:13:05,394 --> 02:13:07,146
but they have the strength...

1409
02:13:08,689 --> 02:13:10,191
the strength...

1410
02:13:14,153 --> 02:13:15,362
to do that.

1411
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:20,534
If I had 10 divisions of those men...

1412
02:13:21,619 --> 02:13:24,580
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1413
02:13:26,373 --> 02:13:30,794
You have to have men who are moral...

1414
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:36,926
and at the same time, who are able...

1415
02:13:38,802 --> 02:13:45,059
to utilize
their primordial instincts to kill...

1416
02:13:46,977 --> 02:13:48,938
without feeling, without passion...

1417
02:13:51,023 --> 02:13:53,526
without judgment. Without judgment.

1418
02:13:59,073 --> 02:14:01,700
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

1419
02:14:20,678 --> 02:14:27,476
I worry that my son might not
understand what I've tried to be.

1420
02:14:30,187 --> 02:14:34,817
And if I were to be killed, Willard,

1421
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:41,824
I would want someone to go to my
home and tell my son everything.

1422
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:48,080
Everything I did. Everything you saw.

1423
02:14:49,873 --> 02:14:55,379
<i>Because there's nothing that I detest
more than the stench of lies.</i>

1424
02:14:58,465 --> 02:15:05,472
<i>And if you understand me, Willard,
you will do this for me.</i>

1425
02:16:12,539 --> 02:16:14,708
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty. Over.</i>

1426
02:16:16,502 --> 02:16:19,630
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. Over.</i>

1427
02:16:21,882 --> 02:16:25,761
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. How do you copy?</i>

1428
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:33,894
<i>They were gonna
make me a Major for this,</i>

1429
02:16:34,645 --> 02:16:37,773
<i>and I wasn't even
in their fucking Army anymore.</i>

1430
02:16:39,942 --> 02:16:41,902
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it...</i>

1431
02:16:43,529 --> 02:16:44,947
<i>him most of all.</i>

1432
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:50,994
<i>I felt like he was up there,
waiting for me to take the pain away.</i>

1433
02:16:54,331 --> 02:16:56,709
<i>He just wanted to go out like a soldier.</i>

1434
02:16:57,543 --> 02:16:58,711
<i>Standing up.</i>

1435
02:16:59,753 --> 02:17:03,340
<i>Not like some poor, wasted,
rag-assed renegade.</i>

1436
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:09,513
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead,</i>

1437
02:17:10,472 --> 02:17:13,142
<i>and that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.</i>

1438
02:18:30,469 --> 02:18:35,682
<i>"We train young men to drop fire
on people, but their commanders...</i>

1439
02:18:36,892 --> 02:18:41,814
<i>won't allow them to write 'Fuck!'
on their airplanes</i>

1440
02:18:41,897 --> 02:18:44,900
<i>because it's obscene!"</i>

1441
02:20:08,108 --> 02:20:09,651
The horror.

1442
02:20:13,697 --> 02:20:15,073
The horror.

1443
02:25:38,104 --> 02:25:39,981
<i>Calling PBR Street Gang.</i>

1444
02:25:41,149 --> 02:25:45,111
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.</i>

1445
02:25:45,654 --> 02:25:47,572
<i>PBR Street Gang.</i>

1446
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:49,658
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty...</i>

1447
02:26:27,988 --> 02:26:29,406
<i>The horror.</i>

1448
02:26:33,827 --> 02:26:35,203
<i>The horror.</i>
