1
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:17,977
Soon after its premiere,
the film Metropolis

2
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:21,177
was severely truncated
and alterations were made.

3
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:24,337
From that time onward,
more than a quarter of the film

4
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:27,537
was assumed to have been lost.

5
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:30,738
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete
version of the film

6
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:33,977
was discovered in Buenos Aires.
What had been preserved

7
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:37,177
was, however, a heavily damaged
copy of the film

8
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:40,337
that had been printed to 16mm
film stock,

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,617
lacking the full frame
of the picture’s original aspect ratio.

10
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:49,137
A considerable amount of the film
reconstruction was able to be completed

11
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,618
and the correct sequence
of its editing

12
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:54,536
established by means
of this Argentinian material.

13
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:57,657
Spanish intertitles have been translated
into German

14
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,778
with the aid of the censor-cards.

15
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:03,817
In order to display in their correct
position on the image

16
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:06,737
the cropped elements taken
from the 16mm negative,

17
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:09,697
the missing portion of the frame
has been marked by black.

18
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:14,257
The intertitles appear
with their original graphic treatment.

19
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:18,217
Those titles which appear in a different
typeface (like the one used here)

20
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:21,777
have been added to summarise
the content of still-missing scenes

21
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:23,737
as far as is necessary
to facilitate

22
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:26,137
an adequate understanding
of the storyline.

23
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:29,377
Shorter gaps are indicated
by small segments of black leader.

24
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:36,697

00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:02,058

Epigraph:

43
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:48,337
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

44
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,697
Shift change.

45
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,737
Deep beneath

46
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:23,418
the earth lay the

47
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:27,617
City of the Workers.

48
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:42,937
As deep beneath the earth
as the City of the Workers lay,

49
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:48,657
so high above it towered the complex
known as the “Sons’ Club”,

50
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:54,378
with its lecture halls and libraries,
its theatres and stadiums.

51
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:31,777
Fathers, for whom every revolution
of a mechanical wheel meant gold,

52
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:36,656
had bestowed upon their sons
the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.

53
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:59,577
Which of you ladies shall today

54
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:04,537
have the honour of entertaining Master Freder,
joh Fredersen’s son?

55
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:47,816
Look! These are your brothers!

56
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,257
Look —

57
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:03,776
These are your brothers!

58
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:36,577
Who — was that?

59
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:28,177
But this was what happened to Freder —

60
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:31,737
the son of joh Fredersen,
the master of Metropolis —

61
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:34,537
as he sought out the girl:

62
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:45,377
To the new Tower of Babel —
to my father —

63
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:40,937
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion
from my son, and not from you —

64
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:52,177
Details —

65
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:09,858
What were you looking for
in the Machine-Halls, Freder?

66
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:19,217
I wanted to look into the faces of the people
whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...

67
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:48,257
Your magnificent city, Father —

68
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:52,537
and you the brain of this city —
and all of us within the light of this city... —

69
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:23,977
...and where are the people, Father,
whose hands built your city — ?

70
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:33,978
Off where they belong...

71
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,777
...off where they belong...?

72
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:52,377
...in the Depths...?

73
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:32,657
And if those in the Depths
one day rise against you?

74
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:09,617
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, —
with an important message...

75
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:35,537
There were two more copies
of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen...

76
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:21,497
...in the pockets of two men who met
with an accident today at the M-Machine...

77
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:42,257
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans
were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?

78
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:11,537
Apply to the G-Bank
for your remaining wages...

79
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:20,577
Father, do you know what it means
to be dismissed by you? —

80
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:24,817
It means: To be sent below! —
Father — below! Into the Depths —

81
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:44,177
Do you know what it means to be dismissed
like that by joh Fredersen?

82
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:06,697
Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?

83
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:55,537
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...

84
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:11,777
Into the Depths, —
to my brothers...

85
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:26,777
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed
of my son’s every move...

86
00:33:42,177 --> 00:33:44,217
Brother...

87
00:33:54,577 --> 00:33:59,577
...the Machine! There needs
to be someone at the Machine!

88
00:34:05,097 --> 00:34:10,057
There will be someone at the machine...

89
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:12,137
ME.

90
00:34:23,857 --> 00:34:28,817
Listen to me...
I want to trade my life with you...

91
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:05,537
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

92
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:15,137
Wait for me —
both of you...

93
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:50,497
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

94
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:06,377
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

95
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,297
In the middle of Metropolis,

96
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:05,937
there stands a strange house
that the centuries had overlooked.

97
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:17,817
The man who dwelled within
was Rotwang, the inventor.

98
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:38,337
Hel

99
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:42,937
Born to bring me happiness
and a benediction to all mankind.

100
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:47,537
Lost to joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, joh Fredersen’s son.

101
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:18,457
A mind like yours, Rotwang,
should be able to forget...

102
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:30,137
Only one time in life did I forget something:
that Hel was a woman — and you a man...

103
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:41,096
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She’s dead for you as she is for me...

104
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:53,737
For me she isn’t dead, joh Fredersen —
for me she lives —

105
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:11,777
Do you think the loss of a hand
is too high a price for recreating Hel — ?!

106
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:21,656
Do you wish to see her — ?!

107
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:26,257
Now, joh Fredersen —?!

108
00:43:26,377 --> 00:43:30,337
Isn’t it worth losing a hand
to have created the man of the future —

109
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:32,537
the Machine-Man —?!

110
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:43,977
24 more hours of work —

111
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:49,257
and no man, joh Fredersen, will be able
to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal —

112
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:14,778
The woman is mine, joh Fredersen!
Hel’s son was yours!

113
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:46,937
And what brings you my way,
joh Fredersen?

114
00:44:57,617 --> 00:45:04,256
I need your advice —
as usual, when all my experts fail me...

115
00:45:17,577 --> 00:45:20,497
Can you decipher for me these plans

116
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:25,857
that for months have been getting discovered
in the pockets of my workers?

117
00:46:01,297 --> 00:46:06,257
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...

118
00:47:32,697 --> 00:47:39,337
Father — ! Father —
Will ten hours never come to an end — ??!!

119
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:13,977
— it’s a blueprint
of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs

120
00:48:14,097 --> 00:48:18,217
deep below the lowest levels
of your Metropolis...

121
00:48:53,457 --> 00:49:01,617
I should like to glean what my workers
are doing exactly in those catacombs...

122
00:52:25,617 --> 00:52:28,057
Today I shall tell you

123
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:32,337
the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...

124
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:38,137
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL

125
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:54,337
Come! Let us build a tower
whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!

126
00:52:57,577 --> 00:53:01,177
And at the tower’s zenith we shall write:

127
00:53:01,297 --> 00:53:05,857
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!

128
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:29,097
...but those who had conceived
of the Tower of Babel

129
00:53:29,217 --> 00:53:31,497
could not build the Tower of Babel.

130
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:36,297
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...

131
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:58,657
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel
knew nothing of the dream

132
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:03,977
of which the head that had conceived it
had been fantasising.

133
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:36,776
The hymns of praise of one man
became the curses of others.

134
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:56,257
The same language was spoken,
but these men did not understand one another...

135
00:55:04,097 --> 00:55:11,936
Great is the world and its Maker
and great is Man

136
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:31,697
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.

137
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:40,377
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

138
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:14,417
And where is our Mediator,
Maria — ?

139
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:39,617
Wait for him!
He will surely come!

140
00:56:55,017 --> 00:56:59,977
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer —

141
00:58:48,937 --> 00:58:53,857
Oh Mediator,
have you finally come...

142
00:58:56,657 --> 00:59:01,616
You summoned me —
here I am!

143
00:59:32,457 --> 00:59:39,097
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man
the likeness of this woman...

144
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:52,257
I shall sow discord
between them and her!

145
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:56,497
I shall destroy their belief
in this woman —

146
01:00:23,777 --> 01:00:30,416
Leave me alone now, joh Fredersen...
You’ll find the way back without me...

147
01:00:56,377 --> 01:01:01,057
You fool! Now you shall also lose
the last remaining thing you still had from Hel...

148
01:01:01,177 --> 01:01:04,657
your son...

149
01:01:27,577 --> 01:01:31,737
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!

150
01:06:03,577 --> 01:06:07,697
END OF THE PRELUDE

151
01:06:12,257 --> 01:06:16,057
INTERMEZZO

152
01:06:53,617 --> 01:06:57,457
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit
who preaches:

153
01:06:57,577 --> 01:07:02,457
“Verily, I say unto you: the days
of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!”

154
01:07:02,817 --> 01:07:06,858
The monk’s hand points to the Bible,
in which it is written:

155
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:10,817
“And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured
beast, full of names of blasphemy,

156
01:07:10,977 --> 01:07:13,137
having seven heads and ten horns.

157
01:07:13,257 --> 01:07:16,938
And the woman was arrayed
in purple and scarlet colour,

158
01:07:17,057 --> 01:07:19,217
having a golden cup in her hand.

159
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:23,017
And upon her forehead was a name
written, a mystery:

160
01:07:23,137 --> 01:07:26,617
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother
of Abominations of the Earth.

161
01:07:26,737 --> 01:07:30,097
And I saw the woman drunken
with the blood of the Saints.”

162
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:51,737
You will annihilate joh Fredersen —
him and his city and his son —

163
01:08:36,857 --> 01:08:38,537
GLUTTONY

164
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,377
AVARICE

165
01:08:40,497 --> 01:08:42,258
PRIDE

166
01:08:42,377 --> 01:08:43,616
LUST

167

168
01:08:45,617 --> 01:08:46,937
ANGER

169
01:08:47,097 --> 01:08:48,217
SLOTH

170
01:09:03,857 --> 01:09:07,937
Had you come earlier,
you wouldn’t have frightened me...

171
01:09:08,057 --> 01:09:12,176
I now beg of you: stay away from me
and my beloved...!

172
01:10:17,097 --> 01:10:21,498
Where is the one whose clothes
you are wearing?

173
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:41,457
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

174
01:11:15,497 --> 01:11:18,817
Would you please wake Georgy up?

175
01:11:18,977 --> 01:11:22,817
He must lead me
to the Workers’ City at once...

176
01:11:41,977 --> 01:11:49,537
No. 11811, get back to the Machine
and forget that you ever left it — understood?

177
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:14,217
I have to have someone
who’s faithful to me, Josaphat, —

178
01:12:14,337 --> 01:12:18,177
otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal
of my path — ?!

179
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:48,536
I must go on, Josaphat, —
must now, on my own,

180
01:12:48,657 --> 01:12:52,458
seek out the person to whom Georgy
was supposed to lead me...

181
01:12:55,857 --> 01:13:01,057
Tonight, Josaphat —
tonight when I come back...

182
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:54,056
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

183
01:15:31,497 --> 01:15:39,138
So, what price are you demanding
for leaving this residence tonight?

184
01:16:25,337 --> 01:16:30,457
You still don’t seem to have grasped
who sent me here...

185
01:16:33,977 --> 01:16:35,177
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS

186
01:16:37,137 --> 01:16:43,297
This man doesn’t want his son
to find you still here tonight!

187
01:17:35,537 --> 01:17:41,137
In three hours’ time
I shall be calling for you!

188
01:18:37,177 --> 01:18:43,737
Come! It is time to give the Man-Machine
your face!

189
01:26:28,337 --> 01:26:32,417
Where is Maria — ?!

190
01:26:40,777 --> 01:26:45,697
She’s with your father...

191
01:27:02,537 --> 01:27:07,457
I’m telling you,
she is with your father —

192
01:27:09,217 --> 01:27:13,217
“She is the most perfect and most obedient tool
that a man has ever possessed!

193
01:27:13,337 --> 01:27:17,336
Tonight you shall see how she holds up
before the eyes of the upper hundred.

194
01:27:17,457 --> 01:27:21,577
You shall see her dance, and if only one single
person recognises the machine in her,

195
01:27:21,697 --> 01:27:25,697
I will call myself a bungler
who never succeeded at anything!

196
01:27:25,817 --> 01:27:28,856
C. Rotwang”

197
01:27:29,017 --> 01:27:33,777
“C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen
to be his guest this evening.”

198
01:28:06,457 --> 01:28:13,057
I want you to go to those in the Depths
in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!

199
01:30:04,657 --> 01:30:07,697
“C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen
to be his guest this evening.”

200
01:32:01,377 --> 01:32:08,697
Verily, I say unto you: the days
of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!

201
01:33:19,537 --> 01:33:24,457
All Seven Deadly Sins,
on her behalf —

202
01:34:10,217 --> 01:34:15,137
Death overtakes the City —

203
01:34:27,017 --> 01:34:31,937
END OF THE INTERMEZZO

204
01:34:47,137 --> 01:34:55,377
The Revelation of St. John
Avalun Publishing, Hellerau

205
01:35:13,497 --> 01:35:17,937
I escaped from the Thin Man
wearing this attire...

206
01:35:18,057 --> 01:35:22,578
But for ten days your father’s bloodhound
has been making the Workers’ City unsafe...

207
01:35:32,417 --> 01:35:35,497
The only thing keeping the workers in check

208
01:35:35,617 --> 01:35:39,817
is their expectation for the Mediator
promised unto them...

209
01:36:04,817 --> 01:36:10,136
Even stranger things
have been happening, Freder...

210
01:36:20,617 --> 01:36:25,217
On that evening when you fell ill...

211
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:40,817
...once the best of friends...
because of that woman...

212
01:36:46,537 --> 01:36:51,457
...the other man...
on that same evening...

213
01:36:59,457 --> 01:37:06,057
...the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned...
but night after night in Yoshiwara...

214
01:37:41,937 --> 01:37:48,498
And this woman,
at whose feet all sins are heaped...

215
01:37:48,817 --> 01:37:53,537
...is also called Maria...

216
01:38:01,817 --> 01:38:08,417
That same woman that those in the Depths
regard as a saint — ?!

217
01:38:22,937 --> 01:38:26,257
Many now go to the City of the Dead,

218
01:38:26,377 --> 01:38:31,217
to a woman they have judged
to be as true as gold.

219
01:38:37,017 --> 01:38:41,418
The Mediator is not likely
to miss that occasion...

220
01:39:04,257 --> 01:39:07,578
Whatever happens tonight:

221
01:39:07,697 --> 01:39:11,816
it is my express order to allow the workers
to do as they please...

222
01:39:22,817 --> 01:39:28,136
joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths
use force and do wrong

223
01:39:28,257 --> 01:39:33,577
so that he can claim the right
to use force against them...

224
01:39:51,177 --> 01:39:56,418
When you spoke to your poor brothers,
you talked about peace, Maria...

225
01:39:56,537 --> 01:40:01,937
today a mouthpiece of joh Fredersen
incites them to rebel against him...

226
01:40:25,337 --> 01:40:30,257
She will destroy their belief
in the Mediator!

227
01:41:08,537 --> 01:41:15,137
You know I’ve always talked about peace...
but your Mediator hasn’t come...

228
01:41:27,097 --> 01:41:32,017
You’ve waited long enough!
Your time has come —

229
01:41:38,697 --> 01:41:42,457
...but I’ve tricked joh Fredersen!

230
01:41:42,577 --> 01:41:46,977
Your clone does not obey his will —
only mine alone!

231
01:41:56,057 --> 01:42:02,657
Who is the living fodder
for the machines for Metropolis — ?!

232
01:42:07,257 --> 01:42:13,818
Who smears the machine-joints
with their own marrow — ?!

233
01:42:28,737 --> 01:42:33,657
Who feeds the machines
with their own flesh — ?!

234
01:42:40,457 --> 01:42:47,057
Let the machines starve, you fools —
Finish them off —

235
01:42:50,377 --> 01:42:55,297
Do them in —
these machines —

236
01:43:11,657 --> 01:43:14,497
You aren’t Maria — !!!

237
01:43:18,137 --> 01:43:20,456
YOU ARE NOT MARIA—!

238
01:43:35,017 --> 01:43:39,937
Maria talks of peace, not murder —
This is not Maria —

239
01:43:43,777 --> 01:43:48,737
joh Fredersen’s son —

240
01:43:51,257 --> 01:43:57,817
Do him in, the dog,
in his white silken hide —

241
01:44:28,937 --> 01:44:32,977
Get your women, your sons,
out of the Workers’ City!

242
01:44:33,097 --> 01:44:37,177
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines — !!!

243
01:44:47,697 --> 01:44:49,857
In the attic of his home,

244
01:44:50,017 --> 01:44:53,577
Rotwang displays
for Maria his ever-growing intoxication

245
01:44:53,697 --> 01:44:55,777
with his triumph over Fredersen:

246
01:44:56,097 --> 01:44:58,297
— and twice over did I trick joh Fredersen —

247
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:02,337
For I concealed from him that his son
wants to be the Mediator of your brothers —

248
01:45:02,457 --> 01:45:04,338
and is in love with you —

249
01:45:04,617 --> 01:45:07,137
Maria isn’t the only one listening to Rotwang.

250
01:45:07,257 --> 01:45:11,257
On the other side of the attic’s window,
joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...

251
01:45:11,697 --> 01:45:16,537
joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang’s attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.

252
01:45:16,657 --> 01:45:20,017
Maria is free.

253
01:45:46,417 --> 01:45:50,497
...faithful after all...

254
01:46:09,537 --> 01:46:12,738
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers’ City.

255
01:46:47,417 --> 01:46:50,096
Women and men,
let no-one miss out on today —

256
01:46:50,217 --> 01:46:52,338
Death to the machines —

257
01:49:01,137 --> 01:49:06,057
Not one man —
not one woman has stayed behind —

258
01:49:46,657 --> 01:49:53,977
Leave the machines —
Let them race to their death —

259
01:50:02,457 --> 01:50:05,298
To the Heart-Machine —

260
01:50:15,657 --> 01:50:18,378
DANGER

261
01:51:39,737 --> 01:51:42,056
Open the gates!

262
01:51:49,177 --> 01:51:53,057
You have to open the gates!

263
01:51:55,577 --> 01:51:58,297
If the Heart-Machine perishes,

264
01:51:58,417 --> 01:52:02,177
nothing in the Machine-District
will be left standing —

265
01:52:50,297 --> 01:52:53,816
Have you lost your minds —??

266
01:52:53,977 --> 01:52:59,417
If the Heart-Machine perishes,
the entire Workers’ City will be laid to waste —

267
01:58:50,017 --> 01:58:54,577
Where are your fathers,
your mothers?

268
01:59:47,177 --> 01:59:52,097
Do you have any idea that your son
is amongst the workers?!

269
02:01:29,937 --> 02:01:34,818
Yes — you! You’re Maria —

270
02:01:45,657 --> 02:01:52,257
To the air shafts — quickly! Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is drowning —

271
02:06:27,217 --> 02:06:32,137
We’ll take the children
to the Sons’ Club!

272
02:06:43,497 --> 02:06:48,457
Why are all the lights out?

273
02:07:11,297 --> 02:07:16,217
I need to know —
Where is my son?!!!

274
02:07:19,377 --> 02:07:23,097
Tomorrow thousands
will ask in fury and desperation:

275
02:07:23,217 --> 02:07:25,977
joh Fredersen,
where is my son — ?!

276
02:08:10,777 --> 02:08:14,857
Where are your children??!

277
02:08:23,417 --> 02:08:30,017
The city is drowned,
the shafts are totally flooded —

278
02:08:36,817 --> 02:08:45,937
Who bade you attack the machines,
without which you’re finished, you idiots — ??!

279
02:08:52,177 --> 02:08:55,737
It’s the witch’s fault — I

280
02:09:05,777 --> 02:09:10,136
We’ll be looking on
as the world goes to the devil —

281
02:09:51,297 --> 02:09:57,858
Find the witch; this is all her fault —
Strike her dead —

282
02:11:12,257 --> 02:11:17,177
Now I’m going to take you home,
my Hel —

283
02:12:30,537 --> 02:12:37,137
The witch — the witch —
There she is — there she is —

284
02:12:40,337 --> 02:12:46,937
Where are our children,
you witch, you — ??!

285
02:12:52,497 --> 02:12:59,097
Burn the witch. —
To the stake with her!!!

286
02:14:53,297 --> 02:14:56,537
To the stake with her—!!

287
02:17:22,377 --> 02:17:27,337
Hel — ! My Hel —

288
02:21:15,817 --> 02:21:20,737
Your children.., saved — !!!

289
02:25:23,137 --> 02:25:28,177
Head and hands want to join together,
but they don’t have the heart to do it...

290
02:25:28,337 --> 02:25:32,216
Oh Mediator,
show them the way to one another...

291
02:26:11,977 --> 02:26:21,057
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
