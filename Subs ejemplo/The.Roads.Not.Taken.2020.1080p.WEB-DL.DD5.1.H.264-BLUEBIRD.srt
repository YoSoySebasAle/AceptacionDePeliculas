00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:51,817
Yes?

3
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:55,317
No, no,
he's not answering the phone.

4
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,900
Well, just keep
trying the door. Keep...

5
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:02,401
Well, is the buzzer working?

6
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:05,359
Are you sure?

7
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,150
<i>¡Papá!</i>

8
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:25,067
<i>¡Papá!</i>

9
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,441
Dad, are you okay?

10
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,650
You didn't
answer the phone.

11
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,359
Or the door.

12
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,234
Dad, it's here.
It's here.

13
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:42,359
Remember?

14
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,608
- The button that opens the door.
- Mm.

15
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Everything is open.

16
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,234
Mm.

17
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,192
Well, not actually, Dad.

18
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,275
Front door was closed.

19
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,359
I see.

20
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,984
<i>Leo.</i>

21
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:18,775
Leo.

22
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,984
Leo.

23
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:33,900
Hey, listen.

24
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,942
I can't make it in
this morning.

25
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:39,692
Yeah, something came up.
I'll be in later, though. I just...

26
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:41,358
Yeah, I have to, um...

27
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:46,567
Well, I'm taking my dad
to the dentist

28
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,775
and getting
his eyes tested.

29
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:52,025
No, no. I'll be back
by lunchtime, though.

30
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:53,441
For sure.

31
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,984
I'll be there.

32
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,525
Hello, Mr. Leo.

33
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,109
You awake now?

34
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:14,358
- Are you with us?
- Who...

35
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:18,942
You're...

36
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,151
I'm Xenia.

37
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,441
And you're Leo.

38
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,525
Mr. Leo.

39
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,608
- You want water?
- Mmm.

40
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,394
Everything okay, papa?

41
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,775
He keeps looking
at something.

42
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,650
Do you wanna look
at that photo?

43
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,067
Of Néstor?

44
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,525
Look at Néstor.

45
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,400
He was such a good dog,
wasn't he?

46
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,067
Don't you remember?

47
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:10,859
No?

48
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:13,977
Leo...

49
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,267
This time let's go together.

50
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,761
Come with me.

51
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:26,542
Please.

52
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:31,928
Did you hear me?

53
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,185
I can't. I can't.

54
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,123
You know that I can't.

55
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:44,866
Try!

56
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,422
<i>M-Mi amor...</i>

57
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,392
Please.

58
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:53,067
It means nothing to me, okay...

59
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,859
No...

60
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,142
But it does to me -

61
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:00,339
- it's an old superstition, Dolores.

62
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,281
It's a...

63
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,923
My love, it's a public celebration of pain

64
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:14,100
that's become a fucking circus.

65
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,859
<i>Ay, Dolores.</i>

66
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:28,275
Dolores?

67
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:32,442
Who's that?

68
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,900
Is that someone
you used to know?

69
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:37,026
Today. <i>Juntos.</i>

70
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:38,358
Together?

71
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,775
That's right, Dad.
That's what we're going to do today.

72
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:45,275
We're going to
the dentist together.

73
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:48,775
You remember?

74
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:52,942
Maybe?

75
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:07,523
A celebration of pain
that's become a fucking circus?

76
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:13,879
Yes, Dolores.

77
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,694
A superstition?

78
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,608
<i>Ay, ya.</i>

79
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,833
That's enough, Dolores.

80
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:31,319
Please.

81
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,066
I don't know why I thought
this time would be different.

82
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:40,166
It's clear I don't matter;
you don't give a fuck.

83
00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:44,856
You can't do this for me?

84
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,392
You're leaving me alone.

85
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm not leaving you alone.

86
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,409
I simply can't do it.

87
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:58,987
I am alone.

88
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,567
Dolores.

89
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,650
Huh? Dolores!

90
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,817
You are hot, Mr. Leo.

91
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,900
It's stifling in here.

92
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,984
They still haven't
fixed the boiler.

93
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,066
I'll open a window.

94
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:47,108
Mmm.

95
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,275
This is early for you.

96
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:09,400
Not working this morning, huh?

97
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:12,317
A writer is always working,
my friend, in here.

98
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,775
- Okay.
- No. Mm-mmm.

99
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,484
- You don't want to?
- No.

100
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:22,192
Okay. Sorry, Mr. Leo.
I'm sorry.

101
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
You don't have to
if you don't want.

102
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:33,609
Uh, dressing.
Uh, your clothes.

103
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:34,900
I can help.

104
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,192
I can...

105
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,233
Yeah?

106
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,567
Okay, good.

107
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,817
Good.

108
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,734
Dad.

109
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:03,108
No, no.

110
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:04,734
Dad!

111
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,900
We have to go.
Come on.

112
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,442
Dad?

113
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:15,858
Let's go.

114
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:37,941
Dad?

115
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:43,025
Come on.

116
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:53,025
You have to get in.
Come on. It's okay.

117
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:57,067
I'm going to
close the door, yeah?

118
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:07,776
Ah.

119
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,025
I see. I see.

120
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:42,067
Yes, Dad?

121
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,275
Dad?

122
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:51,775
- Do you wanna tell me something?
- Many things.

123
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,734
Things, uh...

124
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:00,941
All...

125
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,192
No, no.

126
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,484
There.

127
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,484
Me.

128
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,317
Things.

129
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,233
It's okay.

130
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,942
Mm.

131
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,858
Are you ready
for the dentist?

132
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,442
- Ahh.
- Mm?

133
00:15:56,525 --> 00:16:00,567
You gonna open your mouth?
Ahh.

134
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,567
Ahh.

135
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:19,359
Oh, Dad.

136
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,775
Thank you. Bye.

137
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,526
Hello?

138
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,400
Can I help you?

139
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,691
Mikael? Mikael!

140
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:54,317
You have new customers.

141
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,108
And give me a cigarette,
please.

142
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,192
Your mouth.

143
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,566
Can you just bring
that hand down?

144
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,858
Good.
And just open your mouth.

145
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,400
Open.

146
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:09,442
Can you open your mouth,
please?

147
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:12,192
Good.

148
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,900
Uh-huh.

149
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:19,234
If you could sit in the chair a little bit longer.

150
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:22,192
<i>Tranquilo, papá.
Tranquilo.</i>

151
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,400
It's okay.

152
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,691
Sit back. Good, good.
There you go.

153
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,775
A little longer.

154
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,275
Good.

155
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,817
Okay. And this one might have
to come out eventually, okay?

156
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,275
Do-Don't worry.

157
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,109
Not right now.

158
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:42,775
- It doesn't have to come out right now.
- No.

159
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:46,317
Nothing's gonna happen right now. Do
you understand? This is just a check-up.

160
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,275
- Does he understand?
- Sorry?

161
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,317
I'm asking,
does he understand English?

162
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,817
Of course he does.
He's lived here for over 30 years.

163
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,317
Okay.

164
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:02,109
Would you like to
rinse your mouth out?

165
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,650
- Mm, water.
- Huh?

166
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,359
No, no, no. Don't drink it.
Don't drink...

167
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,608
No, no, no, no.

168
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,401
Oh.

169
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:24,733
Water.

170
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,401
Hmm.

171
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,858
- No. No.
- Dad? Dad?

172
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:02,983
Dad, we have to do this, okay?
We have to change your pants.

173
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,900
No, no.

174
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:09,525
- No.
- Are you shy? You're a little shy?

175
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:13,067
Look, my eyes are closed.

176
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,858
Not seeing you.
Not seeing you.

177
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:18,817
Not seeing you.
Not seeing you.

178
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,733
Whoa!
Oh, whoa!

179
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:25,025
That's why we're going
to get your eyes tested.

180
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,900
Not seeing me? Ha!

181
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:32,775
Come on.

182
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,359
Ah-ah. Stand up.
Stand up.

183
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,234
Yeah.

184
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:39,483
Okay.

185
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:42,067
- No. No.
- Oh, Dad.

186
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,608
It's normal. It's normal
to take off your pants.

187
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:48,150
See?
People do it all the time.

188
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,817
Look.

189
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,692
Whoo! See?

190
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:55,650
It's normal.
It's normal, Dad.

191
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:58,525
See? Whoop. Whoo!

192
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,942
Ha! I think
they'd fit you real nice.

193
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,984
Don't you think? Whoo!

194
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,817
Stylish, Dad!

195
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,150
Just a minute!

196
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:12,692
Ah! Oop! Okay.

197
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:15,025
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

198
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,942
Yuck, yuck.
Okay.

199
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,964
Do you realise
what you're doing doesn't help you?

200
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:16,762
It doesn't help us. Not you, not me.

201
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,505
And what are you doing
to make things better?

202
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:32,900
Hmm?

203
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:19,234
Mmm.

204
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,692
Sorry. Can I ask you a question?

205
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,151
Okay.

206
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:31,358
What kind of endings
do you prefer?

207
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:33,483
In books.

208
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,859
I'm a writer, you see.

209
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:40,859
Depends on the story.
What happens in yours?

210
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:45,900
Since you've asked...

211
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:50,692
uh, in my story,
a man sets off...

212
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,984
on a long voyage

213
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,067
and overcomes
one obstacle after another

214
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,442
until he ends up
on an island.

215
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,275
Is it about you?

216
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:00,942
About me? No, no, no.

217
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,358
And on the last page,

218
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,192
he has to decide
to continue his life in exile

219
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:11,733
or to come back home,
to what was once his home.

220
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:15,650
- And?
- Uh...

221
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:19,734
he may discover that his family
has not waited for him.

222
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,316
How long has he been away?

223
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,109
At least...

224
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:28,984
20 years.

225
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,483
- Twenty years?
- Twenty years.

226
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:34,233
No chance.

227
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:37,025
But what if he regrets
his decision to leave?

228
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,775
Bit too late, isn't it?

229
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,734
Is it?
Is it too late?

230
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,525
We should go.
Come on.

231
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,525
- Maybe see you later.
- I doubt it.

232
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:31,804
Stop, Dolores.

233
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,442
Dolores!

234
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,536
Wait.

235
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:44,509
Stop!

236
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:13,150
Mm.

237
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,057
Went...

238
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:21,775
Yes, Dad?

239
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:24,150
What
did you say?

240
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:30,567
What did you say?

241
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,536
I didn't say anything.

242
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,166
Take the left turning.

243
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:49,477
The left?

244
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:52,717
Why the left?

245
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,718
To go under the bridge.

246
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:57,692
No.

247
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,377
But I always go that way.

248
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,980
- No.
- I have to leave flowers.

249
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,233
- Leo...
- <i>Ya estuvo.</i>

250
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:11,525
Dad! No!

251
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:13,859
Dad! Dad!

252
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:15,150
Dad.

253
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:22,108
Does it hurt?

254
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:24,817
- No.
- Are you in pain?

255
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,025
No.

256
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:29,025
Look at me.

257
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:30,317
Look at me!

258
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,859
- Do you want me to call an ambulance?
- Yes. Please.

259
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:37,275
No.

260
00:27:37,358 --> 00:27:39,442
You're hurt.

261
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:43,817
Uh... pa... pers?

262
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:48,358
You don't need papers.
You live here, Dad.

263
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:50,775
- Yes.
- You're a citizen.

264
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:53,233
- You're legal.
- No.

265
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:54,775
You're safe.

266
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,690
I'm not going.

267
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,392
I can't.

268
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:35,777
I don't want to go.

269
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:35,066
Hi. Look, I may not make it in
by lunchtime after all.

270
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,484
Shit. Sorry.
Can I call you back?

271
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:43,275
- Mm.
- Sorry.

272
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:44,983
Dad?

273
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,900
So... do you know
where you are?

274
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:54,734
The...
hospital?

275
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:57,734
Do you know why?

276
00:29:57,817 --> 00:30:00,317
- Do you know why you're in the hospital?
- No.

277
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:04,275
Do you know
what day it is?

278
00:30:04,358 --> 00:30:05,525
Today?

279
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,067
Okay, he's fine,
I think.

280
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,442
- Fine?
- His head is fine. It's a superficial cut.

281
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:16,025
I wasn't referring
to his underlying condition.

282
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,484
The scan shows some further
atrophy in the frontal lobes.

283
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,025
Actually, I wanted to ask you
some questions about his symptoms.

284
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:24,192
Does...

285
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:28,352
My wife.

286
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:31,233
<i>Mi mujer.</i>

287
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,734
<i>Mi mujer.</i>

288
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:43,150
Papá?

289
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,108
<i>Papá?</i>

290
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:50,506
Forgive me.

291
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,900
Did you wanna see Mom?

292
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:11,400
Is that what you were
trying to say before?

293
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:17,108
Because I can call her and tell her
that you're here if you want me to.

294
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:18,965
Forgive me.

295
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:22,983
You're sorry?

296
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,400
Don't worry, <i>papá.</i>

297
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,359
We all have regrets.

298
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm sure she has too.

299
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,983
- <i>Rita.</i>
- <i>There. You see?</i>

300
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,900
He knows perfectly well
who I am.

301
00:32:39,983 --> 00:32:41,400
The malingering bastard.

302
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,900
- Do you know who this is?
- But he just said...

303
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:45,442
Dolores.

304
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:49,234
- Dolores.
- Dolores. Our son...

305
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:52,609
- He always wanted sons, you see.
- He did?

306
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:55,275
No. No, no.

307
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,733
No.

308
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:58,609
It's not funny.

309
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:01,691
Maybe he should've
stayed with her.

310
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:04,816
Dolores is a real person?

311
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,484
His first love.
Childhood sweethearts.

312
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,733
Very passionate.

313
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,567
He adored her, apparently.

314
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:16,484
A codependent disaster, in my
opinion, from the stories he told me.

315
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,691
My beautiful disaster.
<i>Hermoso.</i>

316
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:22,983
Does he often hallucinate?

317
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,900
Excuse me, but my father does have a
name, actually, and can hear you.

318
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:29,900
Okay. Would you
prefer to step outside to talk?

319
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:32,526
Mm?

320
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:36,691
If it's okay with you, sir, I'm just gonna
have a word outside with your family.

321
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:38,317
Two.

322
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,650
Two what?
Two words?

323
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:43,359
Two words
are okay with you?

324
00:33:43,442 --> 00:33:45,025
Two of them.

325
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,609
Mm-hmm, yes.

326
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,234
Two of them.

327
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,067
Sirens outside.

328
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,317
Yes, that's because
we're in the emergency room.

329
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,691
Emergency.

330
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:57,775
- Mmm. Urgent care.
- Urgent.

331
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:15,691
Oh! No, no, no!

332
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:37,691
<i>Wake up, Leo. Wake up, Leo.</i>

333
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:41,608
- Time to go home.
- Home?

334
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,983
With you?

335
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:46,359
No.

336
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:49,150
We divorced.

337
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,150
Quite a long time ago
now, actually.

338
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,691
- Divorced?
- Yes.

339
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:56,025
Probably because I became
more successful than you.

340
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:59,858
A lot more, actually,
which neither of us could deal with.

341
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:02,359
But we're still friends.

342
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:04,608
- Friends?
- Yes.

343
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,942
I think that's what
people call it.

344
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,234
You live in that dump
overlooking the tracks,

345
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:13,817
which you like,
apparently, alone.

346
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,359
Alone?

347
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:18,025
Yes, which for some reason
you prefer.

348
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,817
And your daughter feels
that we should respect that.

349
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,858
However, the doctor is,
as they say, concerned...

350
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:29,150
- and thinks the time has come...
- Mom!

351
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:42,942
Your hair.

352
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:47,109
- Same as it ever was.
- Mm-mmm.

353
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:51,025
Well, more or less.

354
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,275
Thanks to my colorist.

355
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:56,483
- Looks good, huh?
- No.

356
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,525
Oh, just...

357
00:36:58,608 --> 00:37:00,692
just agree with me
for once.

358
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:02,525
Upon a time.

359
00:37:02,608 --> 00:37:04,525
- Oh, Christ.
- You m-mine.

360
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:05,775
No, not anymo...

361
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:08,067
As I just mentioned,
I have a new husband now.

362
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,441
You've met him.

363
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:11,109
- N-No.
- Yes, of course you have.

364
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:13,733
Dozens of times.
Socially. Parties.

365
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,234
Parties?

366
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,900
Parties? Parties?

367
00:37:19,942 --> 00:37:22,192
We are too busy
for parties today, Dad.

368
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:24,234
Don't... Don't humor him,
sweetheart.

369
00:37:24,317 --> 00:37:25,900
Cunning bastard.

370
00:37:25,984 --> 00:37:28,817
He just pretends he doesn't remember
things so he can make me feel guilty.

371
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,733
Mom, stop it.

372
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,692
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

373
00:37:34,234 --> 00:37:37,400
I didn't even ask where you were
going when all this happened.

374
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,317
We went to the dentist,
and now...

375
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,276
we're going to the optometrist,
if we ever get there.

376
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,109
Can you manage?

377
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:53,733
Do you want me to come too? I suppose
I could rearrange some things and...

378
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:54,942
Néstor.

379
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,608
Néstor is there?

380
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:00,109
- No.
- Néstor?

381
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,400
No, Néstor
is no longer with us.

382
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:05,109
He's in heaven.

383
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:06,942
No.

384
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:08,984
- Doggy heaven.
- No.

385
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,817
He was a very good dog.

386
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,733
Oh, Néstor.

387
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:16,317
Néstor!

388
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,483
Is he getting agitated?

389
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,984
We can give him something
to calm him down.

390
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,984
Why does everyone continue
to refer to Dad as "he,"

391
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:26,733
as if he's not here?

392
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,067
Well, is he?

393
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:33,858
Oh, Néstor.

394
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:28,817
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey!

395
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:34,733
I'm sorry!

396
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,900
Hey, are you following us?

397
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:55,984
No. No, no, no.
I'm not following. No, no.

398
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:59,275
It's just that I saw you
up there and then I... I...

399
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:04,275
I can't stop thinking about
the conversation we had before.

400
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:06,859
Because it's incomplete,
like my book.

401
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:12,192
- You okay?
- Yes.

402
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:15,358
Let me help you up.

403
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,358
Thank you.

404
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:24,109
Wow.

405
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:28,316
What is it? Are you hurt?

406
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:31,567
No, it's that...

407
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:36,358
you keep reminding me
of someone that I once knew.

408
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:40,025
Do I? Who's that, then?

409
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,233
Uh, well...

410
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,775
we met at college.

411
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:48,151
And we had a daughter.

412
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:51,942
Who, by now,
will be, uh...

413
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:55,025
How old are you?

414
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:58,734
Probably the same age as your
daughter, I should think. Am I right?

415
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:04,233
Yes.

416
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:08,191
- Do you see her often, your daughter?
- No.

417
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:11,316
- No, I don't.
- Why?

418
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,775
Well, I left
when she was a baby.

419
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:16,233
- Uh...
- Why?

420
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:20,275
Because I couldn't
concentrate on my work

421
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:23,067
because of the noise
and the crying and...

422
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:24,984
You know?

423
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,483
That's sad.

424
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,151
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

425
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:33,400
- For her, at least.
- For me, too.

426
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:38,483
But you have to make sacrifices
when you are a writer.

427
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:44,734
Are you saying you sacrificed
your daughter... for a book?

428
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:53,026
<i>Dad.</i>

429
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:56,233
Dad?

430
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:58,900
Are you okay?

431
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,984
Let's quickly find you some nice pants
before we get your eyes tested, okay?

432
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,817
Okay?

433
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,900
We'll get some for me too.

434
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:15,358
Luckily for us,
we got a later appointment.

435
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:17,191
But we have to be quick.
Okay?

436
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:20,900
Other one.

437
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:23,817
Other one.

438
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,067
Huh? What other one?

439
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,692
Mmm.

440
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:29,984
Like you.

441
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:34,525
See you later, maybe.

442
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:36,483
Okay, okay, okay.

443
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,191
I'm sorry.
I meant to call back.

444
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,900
There have been
some complications in my day.

445
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:57,942
What happened
in the meeting?

446
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:03,233
They still want me to do it,
don't they?

447
00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:06,692
I've been working on it forever.
I've done all the research.

448
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:14,734
Well, that's just today.
I mean, I <i>can</i> do it.

449
00:43:20,442 --> 00:43:23,233
No, it's just been
a crazy day, but I...

450
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:32,942
Sorry. Could you hold on
for just a moment?

451
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:34,108
Sorry.

452
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,358
Dad?

453
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:28,358
Dad?

454
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:31,192
Please don't disappear
like that again.

455
00:44:31,275 --> 00:44:33,901
- Where did you get that dog?
- <i>Encontré a Néstor.</i>

456
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:35,442
Néstor.

457
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:37,650
He stole my dog!

458
00:44:37,734 --> 00:44:39,650
Him! He stole my dog!

459
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:41,358
The fucking Mexican
stole my dog!

460
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:43,275
Okay, what's going on?

461
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:45,108
- He stole my dog.
- Néstor.

462
00:44:45,192 --> 00:44:47,609
Get out of my country,
you fucking criminal.

463
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:50,442
Listen, I can explain.
This is my father. He's just confused.

464
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:51,942
- Is the dog hers?
- Yes.

465
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:54,150
- Give the lady back the dog now.
- Dad? Dad?

466
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,325
Dead!

467
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,525
- You're dead. Dead!
- Okay, please... Hey!

468
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:05,525
Stop. Get off him.
You're hurting him. Please.

469
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:07,192
<i>Okay? This is my dad.</i>

470
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:10,442
He's just confused. He's really
not well at all. Can't you see?

471
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:12,233
Néstor.

472
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:18,817
<i>Dad? Come on. Dad?</i>

473
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:21,941
It's okay. It's okay.

474
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:23,734
It's okay.

475
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:24,859
It's okay.

476
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:09,400
Hello!

477
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:21,484
Whoo-hoo!

478
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:42,983
It's just a light.
It's not gonna hurt you.

479
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:46,067
- Ah!
- No, no.

480
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,233
Look this way, please.

481
00:46:48,317 --> 00:46:49,692
For God's sake.

482
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:54,817
Okay.

483
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,817
Now, put your chin
right here for me.

484
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,484
Right here.

485
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,484
Chin right here. Right here.
There you go.

486
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:04,567
Just here.
Come on. Almost.

487
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,567
- Dad? Dad?
- Just put your...

488
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,442
There you go. Forward.
That's it. That's it. Okay?

489
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:11,108
It's not that difficult.

490
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:13,983
Just... Th-There you go.
Don't move, don't move.

491
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:16,816
Okay, good.
Now, looking here.

492
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,692
Okay, good, good.
Nice, nice, nice.

493
00:47:20,776 --> 00:47:23,108
One more thing to do here
now, and then we're done.

494
00:47:24,484 --> 00:47:29,734
Now, look straight ahead for me.
Looking up at the screen.

495
00:47:29,816 --> 00:47:32,983
Now, can you read
that for me?

496
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:35,192
No, look through here.
Looking...

497
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:38,150
Excuse me, ma'am,
but is he...

498
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:39,692
Is he what?

499
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,025
Is he all there?

500
00:47:51,525 --> 00:47:53,150
Sorry, Dad.

501
00:47:55,484 --> 00:47:58,359
Those security guards.
Brutal.

502
00:47:59,692 --> 00:48:02,941
And that stupid optometrist
was so rude, so disrespectful,

503
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:04,525
I could've killed him.

504
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:08,651
Killed... N-Néstor?

505
00:48:09,651 --> 00:48:11,567
Néstor?

506
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:12,983
No.

507
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:19,442
No. He was put to sleep, Dad.
He was sick, you know.

508
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,567
Kill the sick?

509
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,775
Kill sick people?

510
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:28,484
No. Of course not.

511
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:41,067
Hi.

512
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,400
Yes.

513
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:45,150
Oh, okay.

514
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:52,150
Oh.

515
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:53,942
That's very disappointing.

516
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:59,567
Yeah, he's a good choice.
Of course. Um...

517
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,400
You know, I've been working
on it for much longer.

518
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,858
Oh, I couldn't
call back today, you see.

519
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:15,192
I'm really sorry about that.

520
00:49:17,275 --> 00:49:19,609
No, no. No, I ge...
I understand.

521
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:21,484
Yeah.

522
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:23,691
I get it. Thank you.

523
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:30,900
Fuck!

524
00:49:53,025 --> 00:49:56,775
Went to Greece today.

525
00:49:56,858 --> 00:49:58,317
No.

526
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,234
Today we went to
the dentist. Okay?

527
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:02,567
Then to
a stupid optometrist

528
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,816
with a minor detour
to the emergency room.

529
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,900
Okay?
You hit your head.

530
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:11,983
- Tunnel.
- That was a scan.

531
00:50:13,816 --> 00:50:17,442
You were with me all day.
Okay?

532
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,567
No.

533
00:50:41,067 --> 00:50:42,359
Gone.

534
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:45,817
Alone.

535
00:50:50,442 --> 00:50:52,442
You know something,
Dad?

536
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,733
I can't pretend anymore.

537
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:06,275
I just don't know
what you're saying.

538
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:12,691
I'm lost.

539
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:15,858
I'm completely lost.

540
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,442
And as it happens,
I lost a very big job today.

541
00:51:24,317 --> 00:51:26,317
It was a big story.

542
00:51:31,025 --> 00:51:34,109
I'm gonna have to make
some hard choices.

543
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:37,817
For both of us.

544
00:51:40,192 --> 00:51:41,942
I'm sorry.

545
00:51:43,691 --> 00:51:45,691
But there it is.

546
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:48,817
Uh-huh.

547
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:17,275
Where have you been
all day, Dad?

548
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:57,067
Let the world know
that Jesus is free!

549
00:53:05,192 --> 00:53:06,566
Home.

550
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:30,817
You've been waiting.
I'm sorry, Xenia.

551
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:37,401
- Someone looks tired.
- It's my fault. We tried to do too much in one day.

552
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:44,483
You need to go.
Can I help you with anything?

553
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:46,441
It's okay. It's my job.

554
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,067
I guess I'll be off,
then.

555
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,441
Okay.

556
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,275
I'll see you soon, Dad.

557
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:15,483
Home. I want go home.

558
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,109
This is your home.

559
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:29,566
Here.

560
00:54:41,984 --> 00:54:42,984
No.

561
00:54:57,276 --> 00:54:58,525
Okay.

562
00:54:59,525 --> 00:55:00,608
Okay.

563
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:02,817
Okay!

564
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,650
I'll stay.

565
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,900
I'll stay tonight.

566
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:29,942
<i>Papá?</i>

567
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,733
Are you okay?

568
00:57:39,608 --> 00:57:41,358
Fuck.

569
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:43,817
Aah!

570
00:57:44,942 --> 00:57:46,067
No.

571
00:57:55,525 --> 00:57:56,650
Fuck.

572
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:18,233
I called the hospital
and called the police.

573
01:00:20,692 --> 01:00:22,901
Well, I just don't know
what else to do.

574
01:00:22,984 --> 01:00:24,984
I just feel so terrible,
like...

575
01:00:25,066 --> 01:00:26,984
I should've been
watching him, you know.

576
01:00:27,066 --> 01:00:29,901
I should've heard him go out.
He went out barefoot, Mom!

577
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,442
Oh.

578
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:03,452
Look, Leo.

579
01:02:08,982 --> 01:02:10,661
We are not alone.

580
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:16,332
This is why I wanted you to come.

581
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,318
Everyone here has lost someone.

582
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:30,802
But today they are coming back to visit us.

583
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:35,109
Him as well.

584
01:02:37,775 --> 01:02:39,742
He'll never come back.

585
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:41,697
Come with me.

586
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:43,643
Come closer.

587
01:02:54,322 --> 01:02:56,328
My love, don't stop there.

588
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,355
Keep walking.

589
01:02:59,504 --> 01:03:01,179
You're nearly there.

590
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:06,520
We'll all be together again.

591
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:25,192
It's not like this,
where you are, is it?

592
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:27,858
You get used to it.

593
01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:30,733
What's this?
I mean, look at his feet.

594
01:05:30,816 --> 01:05:33,067
- Home.
- Yeah, dirty.

595
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:36,025
- Your customer, not mine.
- Show some respect, Tazeem.

596
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,317
You okay, uncle?

597
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:42,651
You okay?

598
01:05:50,692 --> 01:05:53,733
Warm water. Please.

599
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:12,942
Feet.

600
01:06:14,484 --> 01:06:16,484
For your feet.

601
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:18,525
He should be at home,
Rahim.

602
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:23,433
Yes, but right now
he's here and needs our help.

603
01:06:33,108 --> 01:06:34,942
That's good, huh?

604
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:37,400
Address!
What is your address?

605
01:06:37,484 --> 01:06:38,816
Name of street?

606
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,249
No need to shout.

607
01:06:42,108 --> 01:06:44,192
Where do you live?

608
01:06:44,275 --> 01:06:45,775
Do you know?

609
01:06:46,484 --> 01:06:48,275
Water.

610
01:06:57,234 --> 01:06:59,526
I think we should
call the police.

611
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,942
<i>This the guy?</i>

612
01:08:02,484 --> 01:08:04,400
He been causing
a problem?

613
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:07,608
No problem.
No, sir, not at all.

614
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,983
I, um...
I think maybe he is lost.

615
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:13,608
Also maybe his mind.

616
01:08:13,884 --> 01:08:15,070
Be quiet!

617
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:17,775
Does he know
where he lives?

618
01:08:22,526 --> 01:08:25,150
The officer wants to know
where you live, uncle.

619
01:08:30,234 --> 01:08:31,442
Home.

620
01:08:48,484 --> 01:08:50,983
Sir. Come on.

621
01:08:53,858 --> 01:08:55,109
Come on.

622
01:09:03,192 --> 01:09:04,817
Watch your head.

623
01:09:06,566 --> 01:09:07,817
Go ahead.

624
01:09:42,654 --> 01:09:43,715
Leo...

625
01:09:45,331 --> 01:09:47,664
Even if you don't believe

626
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:50,844
could you at least act as if -

627
01:09:50,927 --> 01:09:52,397
- as if what?

628
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,112
As if he were here.

629
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:55,418
What for?

630
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,278
Try to sense him.

631
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:03,535
Say something to him.

632
01:10:04,546 --> 01:10:06,146
What can I say?

633
01:10:06,492 --> 01:10:10,291
That I can't bear
the guilt I've felt for so long

634
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:14,957
because I let him
go to school by himself that day?

635
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:19,865
And there's nothing I think more about

636
01:10:22,388 --> 01:10:27,316
than to find the driver of the fucking car

637
01:10:27,579 --> 01:10:31,707
and smash his head
on the same fucking road?

638
01:10:31,944 --> 01:10:33,256
What can I say?

639
01:10:33,757 --> 01:10:36,870
That his mama
and papa's lives are destroyed?

640
01:10:36,953 --> 01:10:37,936
No, not that -

641
01:10:39,197 --> 01:10:40,710
What can I say to him?

642
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:54,613
It should be me in there, not you, my love.

643
01:11:00,103 --> 01:11:02,606
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

644
01:11:03,412 --> 01:11:05,548
I love you so much, my son.

645
01:11:06,605 --> 01:11:08,361
Speak to me.

646
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:34,769
I can't bear the silence. I can't bear it.

647
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:40,345
I know.

648
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,541
But it's more unbearable to think

649
01:11:43,624 --> 01:11:46,291
that nothing of him exists.

650
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:51,196
Because then where can I put my love?

651
01:12:36,441 --> 01:12:39,234
Hey, Mom.
They found him.

652
01:12:41,192 --> 01:12:43,150
I know. Thank God.

653
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,567
Yeah, I'm taking him home now.

654
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:10,316
Wherever I go,

655
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,442
there I am.

656
01:14:15,316 --> 01:14:16,400
True.

657
01:14:16,483 --> 01:14:18,984
But you...

658
01:14:20,817 --> 01:14:24,191
you're not always there.

659
01:14:24,275 --> 01:14:26,483
Also very true, Dad.

660
01:14:28,275 --> 01:14:30,650
- "Dad"?
- Yes.

661
01:14:32,942 --> 01:14:34,567
You're my dad.

662
01:14:35,817 --> 01:14:37,233
<i>Mi papá.</i>

663
01:14:38,191 --> 01:14:40,316
So I chose...

664
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,275
Rita.

665
01:14:44,358 --> 01:14:48,650
Which led to me,
so I'm happy you chose her.

666
01:14:50,859 --> 01:14:54,151
One road, other... roads

667
01:14:54,233 --> 01:14:57,109
I could... I could have...

668
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:59,026
Could have what, <i>papá?</i>

669
01:15:05,442 --> 01:15:06,650
Could have...

670
01:15:08,692 --> 01:15:10,400
gone to Greece.

671
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:15,275
Mom told me you went to Greece
when I was a baby.

672
01:15:15,358 --> 01:15:18,191
To some island, to write.

673
01:15:18,275 --> 01:15:19,984
Mmm, write, write.

674
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:22,067
Many years. Many...

675
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,692
Well, not really. You...

676
01:15:25,775 --> 01:15:28,442
She said when you got there,
you changed your mind.

677
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,900
You turned around
and came straight back.

678
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,150
For you.

679
01:15:36,859 --> 01:15:38,650
Did you, <i>papá?</i>

680
01:15:39,525 --> 01:15:40,859
For me?

681
01:15:42,734 --> 01:15:44,026
F-For me.

682
01:15:48,275 --> 01:15:49,442
Well...

683
01:15:50,233 --> 01:15:52,275
thanks for doing that.

684
01:15:52,358 --> 01:15:53,942
For all of us.

685
01:15:55,108 --> 01:15:58,275
Even if Mom and you
did get divorced later.

686
01:16:00,734 --> 01:16:02,525
Alone.

687
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:05,859
You have me, <i>papá.</i>

688
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:09,900
But I have to work.

689
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:14,734
And you know
how much I love my work.

690
01:16:14,817 --> 01:16:18,775
I've been working on some
stories in honor of your story.

691
01:16:20,066 --> 01:16:22,233
And I have to travel.

692
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:25,609
So I won't always be here.

693
01:16:26,609 --> 01:16:29,358
M-M-México.

694
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:35,609
I was supposed to go
to the border, actually.

695
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:39,233
I... I crossed over.

696
01:16:39,317 --> 01:16:40,900
Yesterday.

697
01:16:41,859 --> 01:16:44,317
Does it feel like yesterday?

698
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,692
<i>Was</i> yesterday.

699
01:16:46,692 --> 01:16:47,775
And...

700
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:58,942
I went... there.

701
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:06,066
There.

702
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:16,275
And many other places
I went.

703
01:17:16,358 --> 01:17:17,525
Mm.

704
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:22,901
I'm sorry, <i>papá.</i>

705
01:17:23,901 --> 01:17:25,984
I'm trying
to understand.

706
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:29,108
I'll try harder...

707
01:17:30,775 --> 01:17:33,817
to see it
from your point of view,

708
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:35,901
to see what you see.

709
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:41,317
No.

710
01:17:47,317 --> 01:17:49,442
In the sea I died.

711
01:17:49,525 --> 01:17:51,108
Mmm.

712
01:17:51,192 --> 01:17:53,692
No, no.

713
01:17:53,775 --> 01:17:56,650
I was there.

714
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:57,942
I was...

715
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:01,192
I was there. I was...

716
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:04,317
I was... there.

717
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,901
All the same time.

718
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:08,901
And then?

719
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:11,442
And then?

720
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,859
And then come home.

721
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:16,692
This one.

722
01:18:17,942 --> 01:18:19,275
With you.

723
01:18:22,192 --> 01:18:24,192
Welcome back,
Dad.

724
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:31,275
Molly.

725
01:18:37,275 --> 01:18:40,442
Y-You said my name.

726
01:18:40,525 --> 01:18:42,983
Oh, yes, that's me.

727
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:46,941
And...

728
01:18:47,025 --> 01:18:48,734
you're you.

729
01:18:49,734 --> 01:18:52,233
However far away you go...

730
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:55,983
and whatever they say,

731
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:58,150
you are always you.
