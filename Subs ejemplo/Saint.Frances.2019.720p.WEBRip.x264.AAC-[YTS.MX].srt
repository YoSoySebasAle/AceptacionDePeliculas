2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,114
I wake up middle of the
night drenched in sweat.

3
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:27,965
My heart is racing, okay.

4
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:31,015
I reach a hand over to
Lindsey's side of the bed.

5
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:34,180
She's not there and I realize
it's not even our bed.

6
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:37,076
It's just a sad mattress on a box spring.

7
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,898
So I make my way into the hallway.

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,055
I go into Cooper's room,

9
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:41,206
that's our son,

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,418
and he's not there either.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,387
And so now I'm really nervous.

12
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:45,353
I got running into Skyler's
room, the baby's room,

13
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:46,614
and she's not in her crib,

14
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:50,206
and I realize I'm not even in my house.

15
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,366
I'm at some shitty, one
bedroom walkup in uptown,

16
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:59,403
and I turn around and
suddenly this window appears,

17
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:02,035
and I just chuck myself
right the fuck out it.

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,965
Why?

19
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,322
To kill myself.

20
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,674
I realize my life is meaningless.

21
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:10,911
I never started a family.

22
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:12,455
I never invented Wiggler.

23
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:13,318
I have no equity.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,927
I never made any choices
or moves of any kind.

25
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:19,696
I'm 34, jobless, broke, totally alone,

26
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:22,477
full of self-loathing and shame.

27
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,704
I hate myself, so I kill myself.

28
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,298
That's the nightmare anyway.

29
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:30,955
But for a minute there.

30
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:31,837
I mean, Jesus!

31
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,856
Can you imagine, fuck.

32
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:36,290
How about you.

33
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,091
What do you do?

34
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:41,957
I'm a server

35
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:46,516
at a restaurant.

36
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,934
Oh, that's cool.

37
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:53,191
You're in your 20s, gets better.

38
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:55,953
Actually, I'm 34.

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,782
You look good.

40
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:03,077
Will you excuse me a
second, I see somebody.

41
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,878
Mm hmm.

42
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:16,170
♪ Nothing could come from
nothing for you and me ♪

43
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:22,676
Hi.

44
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:23,477
Hey.

45
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:27,893
I'm Bridget.

46
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:28,694
Jace.

47
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,004
How do you know Amy?

48
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,404
Ah, she's a regular at La Mar.

49
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,829
You own a restaurant?

50
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,680
No, I'm a server.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,434
I'm gonna cum.

52
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:47,279
Ah, ah, me too.

53
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:50,837
Pull out.

54
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:05,641
Hey, I think you
might be on your period.

55
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,075
There's a little bit of blood.

56
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,861
A lot of blood.

57
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:16,635
I'll get, I'll take care
of pillows if you wanna...

58
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:18,540
Yeah, I'll do all of this stuff.

59
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:20,770
I think maybe just let's try not to.

60
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:25,138
Ah, you, you
have some on your face.

61
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,087
Really, where, ah?

62
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:27,886
Like right across here.

63
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:28,764
High up?

64
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:29,910
Like right here and right here.

65
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:30,709
On this side?

66
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,507
Oh damn, everywhere.

67
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:32,942
Oh, it's on your hand too.

68
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:34,350
Oh, yeah, okay.

69
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,122
I don't think ah,

70
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:38,977
I'd had started when you
were going down on me.

71
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,126
Yeah, I didn't, I, I couldn't tell.

72
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:44,626
Ah, you tasted ah, normal, I'd say.

73
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:45,425
Oh, good.

74
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:46,477
Mm hmm, um.

75
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,386
I know that some guys are into this.

76
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:50,534
They call themselves bloodhounds.

77
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:54,893
Oh, I'm not a bloodhound, I would say.

78
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,091
I mean sex on your period,
I'm totally cool with.

79
00:03:58,093 --> 00:03:59,693
Sure, I mean normally
I just put a towel down.

80
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:02,064
Yeah, just like ah,
you know, clean up after.

81
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,337
It's really hard
to take anything seriously...

82
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:05,153
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:05,952
With this much blood on you.

84
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,256
I swear to you I'm not a bloodhound.

85
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,927
Shit.

86
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:18,726
What?

87
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:19,871
Ah, you gotta go.

88
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,837
Oh, okay, why?

89
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,170
I have a job interview.

90
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:24,321
What for, oh.

91
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:25,131
To be a nanny.

92
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:28,786
Okay, you must really like kids.

93
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:29,792
I don't.

94
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:30,674
Oh, okay.

95
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,076

Mm hmm.

106
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:08,731
So, you'd start in June when
Franny gets off for school,

107
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,170
and in August we'd set you free again.

108
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,491
Yep, I wouldn't be here very much.

109
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:13,977
My firm doesn't give maternity leave

110
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,212
unless you do the actual birthing.

111
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:17,737
I'll be working a little from home,

112
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:20,403
but our doctor says I should
build in extra rest time

113
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,009
because of my age.

114
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,006
I have a geriatric pregnancy.

115
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:28,229
If you're over 35 that's the medical name.

116
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:32,187
No doubt coined by an
actual geriatric white man.

117
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,187
Have you nannied before?

118
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,682
Not full-time yet.

119
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:41,511
I've babysitted, sat.

120
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,621
Ah, Dana mentioned you had siblings.

121
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:44,801
Yeah, I have a younger brother.

122
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,422
He's six years younger.

123
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:50,229
Oh, that'll be the age
difference for Franny and Wally.

124
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:51,783
We were worried that it might be

125
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:54,708
too far apart for them to be friends.

126
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,290
Are you close with your brother?

127
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,158
Not really.

128
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:01,546
No, he has like a job, and a
house, and is very responsible.

129
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:02,986
We don't have a lot in common.

130
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,239
Did you have a tough
time finding the house?

131
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:25,812
You creeped out by that?

132
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,838
I am.

133
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:31,873
You Catholic?

134
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,544
Fallen, I went to Immaculate Conception

135
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:37,471
from kindergarten to eighth grade.

136
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:39,332
Maya wanted Franny to
go to Catholic school,

137
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,298
but I put my foot down.

138
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,286
That's probably a good idea

139
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:44,180
if you want her not to hate the church.

140
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,045
I'm just, I don't hate it.

141
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:56,935
I wonder where Franny is?

142
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:25,515
Hello.

143
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:27,807
Hello.

144
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,636
Did I win?

145
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,396
Did my mom help you?

146
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:40,679
No.

147
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:51,490
Just gonna give you a few minutes

148
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:52,555
to get to know each other.

149
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,121
I actually can't stay long.

150
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:54,922
Okay.

151
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:04,495
Dana told me lots of
nice things about you.

152
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:05,424
Is Dana coming?

153
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,595
No, she moved when she
had her baby, remember?

154
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,911
But she's my best friend,

155
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:11,726
and she thought that you and I

156
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:13,071
would get along really well.

157
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:27,073
Hello, Frances, no, I
don't know any Frances.

158
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:31,775
No, I don't, I don't think
there's a Frances here, is there?

159
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,052
Let me try, Frances!

160
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,145
Franny, you have a very important call.

161
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:46,299
I'm not even sure she can
understand me right now.

162
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:48,002
Here, do you wanna try to talk to her?

163
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,265
Okay, here's Frances.

164
00:09:58,128 --> 00:09:59,727
You see what I mean?

165
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:02,675
We're done.

Why?

171
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,013
Because I was honest.

172
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,209
Should've just lied and
said that I love kids,

173
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,533
and I'm CPR certified.

174

177
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:35,028
and now you can't spray pee-pee

178
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,761
into mommy's face anymore, can you?

179
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,977
Did you run into any Northwestern people?

180
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,348
No, why?

You went to school with.

184
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,112
You were there for a year.

185
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,025
It doesn't count.

186
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,612
Oh, my God!

187
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:51,524
What?

188
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,972
He just smiled.

189
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,355
It couldn't be gas, but can you smile.

190
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,515
Can you smile for momma and Bridget?

191
00:10:58,517 --> 00:10:59,474
I can't see him.

192
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:00,826
Let me get it on video.

193
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,476
Oh, film it later.

194
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:03,972
I don't know
if he'll do it again.

195
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:04,845
Ever?

196
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,578
I gotta go.

197
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:33,821
Ow!

198
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:34,622
Sorry.

199
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,509
Hi, Bridget,
this is Maya Rodriguez.

200
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:53,104
Um, Annie and I were wondering

201
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,043
if you might still be available
for the summer position?

202
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,568
Where you going?

203
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,007
You're an absolute lifesaver.

204
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,853
Now, the woman we hired came
with tons of experience,

205
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:16,650
and recommendations, but she
was older and very rigid,

206
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:20,043
and she had trouble
keeping up with Franny,

207
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,505
and Franny was coming
home even more wound up,

208
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:25,133
and so I was left with
a wild six year old,

209
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,293
and a screaming baby till
Annie got home at eight,

210
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:29,940
and I thought I was gonna lose my mind

211
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,839
if I had to go another week like that.

212
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:34,122
So ah, we let her go.

213
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,225
Well, Annie did.

214
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:36,227
I couldn't do it.

215
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,859
This is Wally?

216
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:41,434
Ah, Wallace Francisco Rodriguez Paulsen.

217
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:45,707
Wow.

218
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,972
I know and he'll get another
name when he's confirmed.

219
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:51,700
Okay, we gotta go.

220
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,691
Good job, yeah.

221
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,065
You're gonna crawl soon, yeah.

222
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:01,047
I gotta do it when he's nice and sleepy.

223
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:06,763
Oh, I, I ah, my keys are here somewhere.

224
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:10,541
Okay, um, would you mind
watching Wally for me?

225
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:13,303
Sure.

226
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,518
Hey.

227
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:23,514
Uh, found them.

228
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,091
Where's Franny?

229
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:29,981
It's quiet.

230
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:39,955
I apologize.

231
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,760
Do you know how to get to the park?

232
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,678
I don't trust Franny to guide you.

233
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,799
I apologize.

234
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:48,965
I can look it up on my phone.

235
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:51,368
Ah, for snacks, no sugar.

236
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,964
Bye, Mommy.

237
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:06,933
I'm Bridget, remember me?

238
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,138
Hey, hey!

239
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,147
Do you know how to open this?

240
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:15,946
I can walk.

241
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:17,640
Your mom wanted us to bring it.

242
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:18,439
It's for the baby.

243
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,341
Leave it on the porch.

244
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:20,920
I don't want anyone to steal it.

245
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,467
They won't, crime
rate's really low here.

246
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:26,660
Hey!

247
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,805
So, what's your favorite color?

248
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:36,658
Hey, slow down.

249
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,423
How old are you?

250
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:40,197
How old do you think I am?

251
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:40,998
52.

252
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,505
Why do you think that?

253
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,176
Because that's how old Linda was,

254
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,615
and she was as slow as you.

255
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,677
I'm 34.

256
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,413
Do you have kids?

257
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:54,671
No.

258
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:55,791
Are you married?

259
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:56,592
No.

260
00:14:57,874 --> 00:14:58,908
Do you have a boyfriend?

261
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,723
No.

262
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:00,788
A girlfriend?

263
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,252
No, do you have a
boyfriend or a girlfriend?

264
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:04,499
No.

265
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:06,638
Then we have something in common.

266
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,771
I'm tired.

267
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,167
We just started walking.

268
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,315
Will you carry me?

269
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,070
Let's go back
and get the stroller.

270
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:17,264
No, we're almost there.

271
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,436
It won't take long if you carry me.

272
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,467
The park is really close?

273
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:28,751
Come on.

274
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:35,950
You're sweaty.

275
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,499
Can I have some money?

276
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,676
Your mom said no sugar.

277
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:17,474
Please?

278
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,994
We can get an apple or
something on the way home.

279
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:20,795
Hmm.

280
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:24,276
Help, she's not my mom!

281
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:25,970
I don't know her!

282
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:27,810
Help, she's not my mom!

283
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,862
I don't know her, help!

284
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,441
Frances started crying and
then Maya started crying,

285
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:46,109
and Maya came back with even more money,

286
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,224
and told me to take the
rest of the day off.

287
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:50,465
Like that?

288
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,344
Wow.

289
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,490
Uh huh, that's for you.

290
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,765
And these are for me.

291
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:56,505
Yeah, uh huh.

292
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,135
It's sad, because Maya was this funny,

293
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:03,861
confident, sexy woman,

294
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:06,125
and now she's just like this,

295
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:07,832
she's a bare-boobed unshowered,

296
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,697
perpetually crying milk machine.

297
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:14,061
What about this conversation
is turning you on?

298
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:18,294
Unshowered.

299
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:23,090
Ah.

300
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:23,992
What?

301
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:27,530
That's okay, they just swell
up before I get my period.

302
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:28,331
I know.

303
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,647
You know?

304
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,527
Yeah, I pay attention.

305
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,402
Do you prefer them like this?

306
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:37,334
I like them at all stages.

307
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,438
I mean it.

308
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:51,339
♪ Acting like I don't really see ♪

309
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:55,486
♪ I'm just a distraction for another ♪

310
00:17:55,488 --> 00:18:00,284
♪ That's just how it is
when love a man like me ♪

311
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,919
♪ Maybe I have something ♪

312
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,679
♪ Something to offer ♪

313
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,932
♪ I can come back stronger ♪

314
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,085
I'm for
sure getting rid of it.

315
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:29,086
Okay.

316
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,812
We could talk about other options or...

317
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:35,373
No, thanks.

318
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,231
Yeah, sure.

319
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:43,486
Do you think maybe your birth control

320
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:45,011
like malfunctioned or...

321
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,205
I'm not on birth control.

322
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,336
You're not?

323
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,267
No.

324
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:51,132
Okay.

325
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:55,062
I've used this method
for like eight years.

326
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,433
This method?

327
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,394
You sure that you.

328
00:18:58,469 --> 00:18:59,265
Pulled out, yeah.

329
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,386
Every time?

330
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:01,708
Well, I think so.

331
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,698
Your sperm are probably super fast.

332
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,103
That's a compliment.

333
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:09,466
Thank you, I thank you
so much, appreciate that.

334
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,845
God, I honestly thought
I couldn't even get...

335
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,888
Why did you think that?

336
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,664
Because it's never happened before.

337
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,055
I hear it.

338
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:21,402
I hear that how it sounds.

339
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,799
I'll go with you when you go.

340
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:29,861
Okay.

341
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,414
And I'll pay for it,

342
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,231
We'll split it.

343
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:44,174
Mama said I have to try and respect you.

344
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:47,728
Get in.

345
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:54,340
Where are we going?

346
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:55,502
The library.

347
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,508
I don't wanna be quiet!

348
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,896
We'll go to the park afterward.

349
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,437
I just need some quiet time to think.

350
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,904
About your choices?

351
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:03,705
What?

352
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,034
When I'm in timeout,

353
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:09,182
I'm suppose to think about my choices.

354
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,718
Again!

355
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,255
Hey, no running, please.

356
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,366
Can't you read?

357
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:34,443
Hearing it helps my brain development.

358
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:41,496
Mama, is it springtime yet?

359
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:42,863
No, it's winter forever.

360
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,245
You skipped a bunch.

361
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,590
It's boring until the end.

362
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,457
Start over.

363
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,174
Start over!

364
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:03,593
Do your mom's leave you here
when they go to the bathroom?

365
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,393
Of course.

366
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:26,576
Mom

367
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,150
Yes?

368
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,362
I love you.

369
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:31,219
I love you too, babe.

370
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,839
Do you feel better?

371
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:35,159
Yeah, a lot better.

372
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,419
One, two, three.

373
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:41,043
You can flip it, Jeffrey.

374
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,458
Are you on your period?

375
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,178
Oh, God.

376
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:49,476
Cats in boots, cats in
boots, cats in boots, cats!

377
00:21:49,478 --> 00:21:51,984
Franny, can you be a
little more quiet, please?

378
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:56,038
We're outside, so I
can use my outside voice!

379
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:58,916
Again!

380
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:00,932
Again.

381
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,574
Again.

382
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:06,085
Shit.

383
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:11,027
She threw me out of the stroller!

384
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:13,161
We went over some bumps,

385
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:15,257
and I forgot to buckle her in, I'm sorry.

386
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:18,326
Why, it's okay.

387
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:34,219
Help Bridget, okay?

388
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:55,701
Soap.

389
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,589
Okay, how does that feel?

390
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:01,869
Does that sting?

391
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:05,405
Neosporin.

392
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:10,866
This might sting just a little bit.

393
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:15,325
Just a little more, okay.

394
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:18,430
Band-aids.

395
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,902
How do they feel now?

396
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:30,756
Last one.

397
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,904
Where do you want yours?

398
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:46,521
Thank you.

399
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,246
First time?

400
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:01,960
What?

401
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,678
Is that the one where Dumbledore dies?

402
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:07,575
Dumbledore dies?

403
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:08,433
Bridget D.

404
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:30,016
Bridget,
hi, so I understand

405
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,586
you're looking to get an abortion.

406
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,788
Yes, I'm in the market.

407
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:37,928
Well, we'll
start with an ultrasound.

408
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,338
I thought I wouldn't need one.

409
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,402
We need it to tell
how far along you are.

410
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:46,728
Don't worry, you don't have to look at it.

411
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:03,981
You wanna know if it's twins?

412
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:07,663
I guess.

413
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:10,099
It's not.

414
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:16,404
Okay, you can sit up now.

415
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,407
I got it.

416
00:25:58,409 --> 00:25:59,208
Cool, cool.

417
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:05,033
So this is probably gonna get messy.

418
00:26:05,922 --> 00:26:09,170
I know, I've done some research.

419
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:12,749
And um, I know we've encountered
a little bit of blood

420
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:13,599
in our relationship before, we just...

421
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:16,345
Oh, we're not in a relationship.

422
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:19,010
Oh, ah, okay.

423
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,502
It's just that you're 26.

424
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:23,303
Yeah?

425
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,348
Well, it's those 26 year old,

426
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,225
young, agile, super in-shape sperm

427
00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:31,766
that got us into this in the first place.

428
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:34,193
And your 34 year old eggs.

429
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:35,324
I, I just mean that your eggs

430
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:37,127
are in good shape too, that's all.

431
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,180
Thank you.

432
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,541
You're welcome.

433
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,073
I feel like you should
have to do something.

434
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:48,789
Like give yourself food
poisoning or something.

435
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:51,451
Okay, um, what do we got?

436
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:55,059
I think I have some really old chicken.

437
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:56,946
Okay, oh yeah.

438
00:26:57,979 --> 00:26:59,346
I can't tell if you're serious.

439
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,662
I have to keep them here for 20 minutes.

440
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:17,244
Cool.

441
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,076
Do I look cute?

442
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:20,142
You look very cute.

443
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:23,778
I feel cute.

444
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,447
It's a slice.

445
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:29,217
It's not exactly an
enthusiastic leaf eater.

446
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:30,855
A couple of half-hearted chews,

447
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,654
and the leaves go straight
down to its stomach.

448
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:32,455
Fuck.

449
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:36,195
Everything okay?

450
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,106
Go into the other room,

451
00:27:37,108 --> 00:27:38,995
and turn the TV up really loud.

452
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:40,175
Okay, is there anything I can get you?

453
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:42,614
You can get the
fuck away from the door.

454
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:43,812
Okay.

455
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,398
Okay, I got this printout here.

456
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,366
Um, caring for yourself after an abortion.

457
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:57,931
Okay, ah, normal side
effects, bleeding, obviously.

458
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,219
If there's heavy bleeding,

459
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:03,828
use a heavy maxi-pad
for an hour, in an hour.

460
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,642
Ah, then begin deep uterine
massaging for 10 minutes.

461
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,797
So I could, I could do
that if you need me to.

462
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,130
Do the uterine massage.

463
00:28:12,132 --> 00:28:16,927
Um, take 800 milligrams of
ibuprofen with food or milk.

464
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:19,671
Do you have any milk?

465
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:21,171
Almond milk, does that count?

466
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:22,785
No, it has to be dairy.

467
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:23,849
You're not lactose intolerant, are you?

468
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:24,648
Yeah, I am.

469
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,219
That will also cause cramps it said.

470
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,642
And then after that apply more
uterine massages frequently.

471
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:30,812
What does that mean?

472
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:32,701
It's ah, I've actually done that before.

473
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:35,607
It's ah, they're quite comfortable.

474
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:38,822
Chapter 14, Felix Felicis.

475
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,214
Harry had herbology first
thing the following morning.

476
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:45,936
Do British.

477
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:48,924
Harry had herbology first
thing the following morning.

478
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:52,381
Here's ah, discharge,

479
00:28:52,383 --> 00:28:54,347
ah it may be non-bloody

480
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:56,686
in range from a brown to a black color.

481
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:57,485
Black?

482
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,871
Yeah, do you wanna
hear the abnormal side effects?

483
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:00,670
No.

484
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,469
Okay, awesome.

485
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:02,268
Prolonged, heavy bleeding.

486
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,975
Ah, if you have blood
clots larger than a lemon,

487
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,709
that would be abnormal.

488
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:08,508
I see.

489
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,977
I wonder if they mean like
an organic lemon, or a...

490
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:13,259
Yeah, like
genetically a modified lemon.

491
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:16,587
A GMO or a lemon would be
larger probably, or presumably.

492
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,176
The weekend's brutal wind
had died out at last.

493
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:23,974
Chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, fainting.

494
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:28,661
If the bleeding continues
for more than three hours,

495
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:29,501
give us a call.

496
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,897
Um...

497
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,777
What, we're
at like two right now?

498
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:36,832
Two hours, yeah.

499
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:41,630
So if you still, yeah, I,
I, I bet in 15 minutes,

500
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,361
this is all gonna be,
you're gonna be fine.

501
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:51,726
Hey, can I show you something?

502
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:53,721
It's really gross.

503
00:29:53,723 --> 00:29:54,522
Yeah, okay.

504
00:29:58,093 --> 00:29:59,164
Do you think that's it?

505
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:00,890
I don't know.

506
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:03,429
How big is it suppose to be?

507
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,785
Online it said it's about
the size of a sweet pea.

508
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:10,754
Like a pod, pea pod?

509
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:12,849
Like an individual pea inside the pod.

510
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:15,232
Oh.

511
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:16,474
It's about this size.

512
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,035
There's been a lot of blood though.

513
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:22,619
So it could just be another clot.

514
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:27,686
I hate how they compare it
to cute things, you know?

515
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,867
Like a raspberry, a kumquat, a tomatillo.

516
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:36,161
When really it's just
the size of a rat turd.

Mm, hmm, this is Frances.

522
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:14,904
Frances, hi, okay, perfect.

523
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,736
Well, you've got a little bit of time

524
00:31:16,738 --> 00:31:17,896
before the class starts,

525
00:31:17,898 --> 00:31:20,063
so if you wanna just go play,

526
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:22,252
you can do that till you
hear the welcome song.

527
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:23,660
Are you gonna stay?

528
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:26,729
We encourage parents to stay
and play with their littles.

529
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:28,608
I don't know how, so.

530
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,488
Perfect opportunity to learn.

531
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,328
Don't tell me this old dog
can't learn new tricks.

532
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:36,147
That sounds fun,

533
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:38,870
but I have a lot of adult
important stuff to take care of.

534
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:40,884
But you're gonna have a great
time with Miss Margaret.

535
00:31:40,886 --> 00:31:42,783
No, no, I'm, I'm an administrator.

536
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:43,953
I'm not an artist.

537
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:47,765
Your teacher is gonna be
Mr. Isaac right over there.

538
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,827
He's a poet.

539
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:54,340
We sell several of his
chap books next door.

540
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:55,582
He's very good.

541
00:31:58,111 --> 00:31:59,434
Okay, bye.

542
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:01,227

I don't know how.

552
00:33:27,282 --> 00:33:28,781
Your body doesn't yet,

553
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,125
but your heart's been
playing all your life.

554
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:35,814
You guys are awesome.

555
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:39,498

See ya next week.

557
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:42,850
Practice, don't forget to practice.

558
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:53,485
Did you steal that?

559
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:55,118
No, I bought it.

560
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,517
But you don't have any money.

561
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,316
Shh.

562
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,595
I think we got a little
Joan Jett on our hands.

563
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:01,748
You Frances mom?

564
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,547
No.

565
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,346
No.

566
00:34:03,348 --> 00:34:05,090
No, I just, I watch her, I'm Bridget.

567
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:08,636
Frances showed a natural aptitude today.

568
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,415
Don't tell the other kids,
but I've got a new favorite.

569
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:14,350
The strings hurt my fingers today.

570
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,738
Well, you'll get used to it.

571
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,850
You get calluses and
you won't feel a thing.

572
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,583
Did you get that downstairs?

573
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,014
I just had them restring it.

574
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:26,702
You play?

575
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:28,515
Not for years.

576
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:30,001
Can we go?

577
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:30,914
Mm hmm.

578
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,248
Will you join us next week?

579
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:37,036
Once in a lifetime opportunity
to play with Joan Jett.

580
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:40,762
Why did he keep calling me Joan Jett?

581
00:34:40,764 --> 00:34:41,793
It's a compliment.

582
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:44,771
My name is Frances.

583
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:47,254
You wanna be Joan Jett, trust me.

584
00:34:47,256 --> 00:34:49,575
She was one of the great rock stars.

585
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:52,635
Really angry, lots of statement eyeliner.

586
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:53,835
Wonder if she's dead now?

587
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:56,375
Why was she angry?

588
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:58,187
Because she was born into a patriarchy

589
00:34:58,189 --> 00:34:59,310
and it effing sucked.

590
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:01,026
What's a patriarchy?

591
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:02,062
It's where men are in charge,

592
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:03,742
and women have to do what they say.

593
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:11,536
My guitar class is a patriarchy.

Y'all look pretty scary yourselves.

606
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:56,636
Mama.

607
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:00,678
How ya doin'?

608
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,002
Frances is over.

609
00:36:02,004 --> 00:36:04,160
I'm Joan Jett now.

610
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,888
Well, Joan, let's go get you cleaned up.

611
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:14,229
It's not coming off.

612
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:15,478
I think it's waterproof.

613
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,584
Did you use your mascara on her?

614
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:19,850
You really shouldn't have done that,

615
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:22,348
because Franny had pinkeye this weekend.

616
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,582
Pinkeye means you got poop in your eye.

617
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:28,774
Yes, it does.

618
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,432
I can never get her to nap.

619
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:34,058
I don't give her a choice.

620
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:41,793
So, you're a fan of The Runaways?

621
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:44,161
Yeah, I listened to them
all the time growing up.

622
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:45,840
You should look up what
happened to those girls

623
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:47,424
when they were making that music.

624
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:54,051
The Runaways dark side.

625
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:56,326
Oh, fuck.

626
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:28,575
Hi.

627
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:31,748
You look so nice and skinny.

628
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,775
Mom.

629
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:35,657
Oh, sorry, you look so smart.

630
00:37:38,848 --> 00:37:40,860
Can we slow down?

631
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:42,797
When Dad can't keep up I hike ahead,

632
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,322
then turn around and come back for him.

633
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:45,741
I get twice the sets.

634
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:47,770
I am keeping up just fine.

635
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,786
No point paying for gym
membership if you don't use it.

636
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,399
I'm already at 7,000.

637
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:56,722
Dennis, you go ahead.

638
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:58,305
He needs to stay in the aerobics zone,

639
00:37:58,307 --> 00:37:59,149
otherwise it doesn't help.

640
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,836
See, Bridget, this is how
I stay in the aerobics zone.

641
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:05,265
You don't have to boss
him around like that.

642
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:07,080
The doctor said if
he doesn't lose weight,

643
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:08,356
he'll have a heart attack.

644
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:11,329
He's been walking on the
treadmill four miles every night.

645
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,604
That's good.

646
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:14,004
I bought him these little gold stars

647
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:15,970
to put on the calender
each time he does it.

648
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:18,370
He doesn't go to sleep
until he's gotten his star.

649
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:21,955
Is he still retiring next year?

650
00:38:21,957 --> 00:38:24,113
We're learning Spanish.

651
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:28,639
And we'll have time to
visit you more often.

652
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,581
Be nice if there was a reason to.

653
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:34,931
I saw on Facebook that
Jill Stafford is pregnant.

654
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:36,436
Please stop friending my friends.

655
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:38,153
I'm trying to see
what's going on with you.

656
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:39,563
You can ask what's going on with me.

657
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:41,081
She's been
married for awhile now.

658
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,332
I started to wonder if
there was something wrong.

659
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,144
It's a risk waiting that late.

660
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:46,919
She's my age.

661
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:47,748
Exactly.

662
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:53,029
I don't think I'd be a very good mother.

663
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,226
You'd be a great mother.

664
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:56,097
What if I was one of
those moms who went crazy,

665
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,880
and drowned her kids in a bathtub.

666
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,664
Those are the extreme cases.

667
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:01,851
It usually doesn't get that far.

668
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:05,486
When you were a baby and
you screamed and screamed,

669
00:39:05,488 --> 00:39:08,190
and there was nothing I
could do to get you to stop,

670
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:10,904
I'd imagine taking you by the ankles,

671
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:13,831
and swinging your little head

672
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,275
into the head into the wall over and over

673
00:39:16,277 --> 00:39:18,538
until it was a bloody pulp.

674
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,255
Oh, my God.

675
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,696
But then I'd feel so
guilty from imagining it,

676
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,372
I wouldn't actually do it.

677
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:25,606
I don't know that you
should tell that story.

678
00:39:25,608 --> 00:39:29,471
It's the truth and women
should talk about it more often.

679
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:30,528
Wouldn't be as lonely.

680
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:33,720
I think it's immoral to have children.

681
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:35,417
Immoral to have children?

682
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:38,055
Yes, with climate change
and school shootings,

683
00:39:38,057 --> 00:39:39,378
and possible nuclear war,

684
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,274
it's, it's bringing them into
a world that's inhospitable.

685
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:45,420
Oh, please, the world has
always been inhospitable.

686
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:48,019
When I got pregnant with
you, it was the 80s.

687
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:51,635
Every day Reagan joked
about nuking Russia,

688
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:52,651
but we survived.

689
00:39:52,653 --> 00:39:55,020
I gambled on our survival.

690
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:56,996
That's what having kids is.

691
00:39:56,998 --> 00:39:58,252
That's reckless.

692
00:39:58,254 --> 00:39:59,082
That's optimistic.

693
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,536
Are you glad you were born?

694
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,838
I don't know.

695
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,922
Now see, that's lazy.

696
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:08,782
I expected that when you were a teenager,

697
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:11,496
but you're an adult with a
fully formed prefrontal cortex.

698
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:12,959
Actually think about it.

699
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:16,383
I know you didn't ask to be,

700
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,972
but if you had the choice
to never exist at all,

701
00:40:20,974 --> 00:40:24,611
or to have the exact
life you're having now,

702
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:27,468
would you have chosen to be born?

703
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:38,661
And when you have kids, they'll
be glad they were born too.

704
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:41,937
Mom, it's okay.

705
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:46,628
I just love you kids so much.

706
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,068
We love you too.

707
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:51,426
I'm thinking of freezing my eggs.

708
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:54,850
You
could never afford that.

709
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:58,384
Can I give you one more hug?

710
00:40:58,386 --> 00:40:59,553
You don't have to ask.

711
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:09,734
I love you, Dad.

712
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:15,336
Get your oil changed.

713
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,219
Bye.

714
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:24,738
Bye.

715
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:41,310
Don't, yeah, no, you should've heard it.

716
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:42,304
I'm not joking.

717
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:47,101
I think you're fragile.

718
00:41:48,316 --> 00:41:49,654
I need to go to the bathroom.

719
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:50,910
Okay, go ahead and go.

720
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:52,425
I'll meet you out front.

721
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,237
You're supposed to come with me.

722
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,036
You're not a baby.

723
00:41:55,038 --> 00:41:57,528
You can go to the
bathroom by yourself, go.

724
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,530
Joan quit the band?

725
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:06,255
I think she's testing boundaries.

726
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,459
She's probably jealous,

727
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,760
because I got a new favorite.

728
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:13,486
Oh yeah, Donna's pretty inspiring

729
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,169
picking up a new hobby at 50.

730
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,224
Donna's a plebe.

731
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:19,183
She's a lost cause.

732
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:20,336
She probably always was.

733
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:23,959
I was gonna ask,

734
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,908
I don't know if you teach private lessons.

735
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:29,018
Usually I don't,

736
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:34,163
but I could maybe make an exception,

737
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:36,546
if you think we might be a good fit.

738
00:42:40,706 --> 00:42:45,225
Hey, you were supposed to wait inside.

739
00:42:45,227 --> 00:42:46,650
You said outside.

740
00:42:46,652 --> 00:42:47,695
Outside the bathrooms.

741
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:50,563
You can't wait outside by yourself.

742
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:51,992
This was really expensive.

743
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,336
You have to take care of it.

744
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,346
I don't even like it.

745
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:58,356
You don't know the things you like.

746
00:42:58,358 --> 00:42:59,443
I know the things I like.

747
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:02,953
No, it takes a long time
to figure that stuff out.

748
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,143
I like reading.

749
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:05,658
I like ice skating.

750
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,579
Well, you're not gonna grow up

751
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:08,717
to be a professional ice skater.

752
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,516
Why not?

753
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:10,961
Because that's really hard.

754
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,685
Like three people out of
a million get to do that,

755
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:14,558
and you're probably not
gonna be good enough.

756
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,082
Well, you're not good at anything!

757
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:19,041
Get in the car.

758
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,647
Now!

759
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:41,930
Don't eat too much.

760
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:43,672
I'm making you lunch.

761
00:43:49,303 --> 00:43:50,102
Shit.

762
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,459
Is this underwear blood!

763
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:22,724
Franny!

764
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,255
Bridget's still on her period.

765
00:44:25,257 --> 00:44:26,056
Oh.

766
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:29,075
I am so sorry.

767
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:30,696
No, I'm sorry.

768
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:31,732
That's really gross.

769
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:32,897
No, you're, it's fine.

770
00:44:34,035 --> 00:44:37,999
Honey, you have to let people
have their privacy, remember?

771
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:43,168
You're on your period a lot.

772
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,156
Mommy uses tampons,

773
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:49,273
but mama uses a clear cup,

774
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:53,142
which is more better and
natural for the environment.

775
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:59,247
I have to find something
most comfortable for my body,

776
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:01,467
'cause every woman's body is different.

777
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:06,599
Bless us, Oh Lord, for these our gifts,

778
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,137
which we are about to receive

779
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,441
from thy bounty, through
Christ, Our Lord, amen.

780
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:24,456
I got him.

781
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,988
Oh, are you sure?

782
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,012
It's fine.

783
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:46,968
I think he likes you.

784
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:51,567
Whenever I hold him, he cries.

785
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:55,657
I can take him for awhile
if you wanna take a nap.

786
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:57,542
Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.

787
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,968
I need healing, I need
healing, I need healing now.

788
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,647

Yeah, I'm fine.

Can I read you something?

798
00:47:21,282 --> 00:47:22,081
Okay.

799
00:47:27,394 --> 00:47:28,353
What's that?

800
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,010
My emotions journal.

801
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,114
It helps me to write stuff down.

802
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:43,933
We never discussed the emotional
impact of what happened,

803
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:45,563
and I'm starting to realize

804
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:48,910
I have some unprocessed feelings.

805
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:50,474
I know we made the right choice,

806
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,209
but I think I might have some

807
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:54,473
residual sadness about our loss.

808
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:58,218
Oh, no, I don't feel a loss.

809
00:47:59,702 --> 00:48:00,759
Don't put that on me.

810
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,893
Okay, my loss.

811
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:10,882
Chad told me you can only
lose what you cling to.

812
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:15,274
Wait, you told Chad?

813
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:18,601
Yeah, he's my best
friend and a Buddhist.

814
00:48:18,603 --> 00:48:20,002
I don't want him to know that.

815
00:48:20,004 --> 00:48:20,933
Well, he's not gonna judge you.

816
00:48:20,935 --> 00:48:22,362
He's gonna look at me all weird.

817
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:25,872
Well, I needed somebody
to talk to and you won't.

818
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:27,483
We've talked.

819
00:48:27,485 --> 00:48:30,235
Yeah, about the mechanics,
but now about how we feel.

820
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:34,503
I shouldn't have to feel
anything about it, right?

821
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:38,403
You don't, but if you
did, you could talk to me.

822
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:40,133
See, this is why I
shouldn't have even told you.

823
00:48:40,135 --> 00:48:41,913
I should've just dealt with it myself.

824
00:48:41,915 --> 00:48:42,712
That's not fair.

825
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:43,681
Because you have all of these feelings.

826
00:48:43,683 --> 00:48:45,148
You're whole millennial generation.

827
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:45,992
You're a millennial too.

828
00:48:45,994 --> 00:48:46,985
I'm on the cusp.

829
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:52,727
How many pages did you write about this?

830
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:57,353
One, two, three, four, five.

831
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:01,882
Five, six.

832
00:49:01,884 --> 00:49:03,562
I'm going to sleep.

833
00:49:58,202 --> 00:50:01,019
Shit, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

834
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:03,268
Just a sec!

835
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:05,886
All right, no hurry.

836
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:08,760
Oh fuck, fuck, fuck.

837
00:50:08,762 --> 00:50:11,130
Where the fuck is the plunger?

838
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:14,840
Well, actually, if you
wouldn't mind hurrying.

839
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:15,641
Oh fuck.

840
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:23,081
Oh God.

841
00:50:26,646 --> 00:50:28,782
Bridget, where are you going?

842
00:50:28,784 --> 00:50:29,581
Home.

843
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:30,550
Why?

844
00:50:30,552 --> 00:50:32,197
Because the Buddhist just had to

845
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,587
plunge my bloody toilet water,

846
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:35,135
and now I have to go jump off a bridge.

847
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:35,934
What?

848
00:50:35,936 --> 00:50:37,414
It's not funny!

849

was allowed during class.

858

864
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:58,131
Uh huh.

865
00:52:03,241 --> 00:52:05,799
You sure you've played before?

866
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:08,189
You know, it feels like
a lifetime ago.

867
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,896
Okay, come here.

868
00:52:39,578 --> 00:52:40,681
So, did you drive here?

869
00:52:43,158 --> 00:52:44,050
I took a Lyft.

870
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:46,762
Are you heading north?

871
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:48,097
I'm just four minutes away.

872
00:52:49,629 --> 00:52:50,428

You're a really good teacher.

876
00:53:07,486 --> 00:53:08,333
I learned a lot.

877
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:18,889
Are you sure you don't wanna come over?

878
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:26,680
I want to want to come over.

Oh no, it's okay.

888
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:43,965
I think it's over now.

889

909
00:57:03,755 --> 00:57:06,141
I really don't like those things.

910
00:57:06,143 --> 00:57:08,469
I don't either, but we have to.

911
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:09,944
Aren't you on birth control?

912
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:12,241
No.

913
00:57:12,243 --> 00:57:14,161
You should really be on birth control.

914
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:16,830
Or we could just use a condom.

915
00:57:30,228 --> 00:57:31,193
Are you okay?

916
00:57:31,195 --> 00:57:32,394
Yeah.

917
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,417
We can stop.

918
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:36,826
I don't need to stop.

919
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:43,026
Um, it, it's okay.

920
00:57:43,028 --> 00:57:44,815
We can talk about it.

921
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,405
You're not wet.

922
00:57:49,148 --> 00:57:49,947
What?

923
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:52,276
You're not really wet.

924
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:56,505
It's, it's actually
kind of painful for me.

925
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,037
It's a lubricated condom.

926
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:13,276
Ah, you didn't tell
me you were on your period.

927
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,808
Could've used a warning.

928
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:17,826
Fuck.

929
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:22,396
You're slower than Linda.

930
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:23,676
Then go ahead.

931
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:26,748
You little shit.

932
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:31,590
Franny!

933
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:34,568
Franny!

934
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,166
Oh, are you okay?

935
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:36,964
Is she yours?

936
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:38,478
Yes, don't you ever do that again!

937
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,277
Do you hear me?

938
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:40,529
You have to stay where I can see you!

939
00:58:40,531 --> 00:58:41,328
She's okay.

940
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:42,127
No, she's not okay!

941
00:58:42,129 --> 00:58:43,791
You scared the shit out of me!

942
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:45,444
Don't ever do that again!

943
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,229
Oh God, you okay?

944
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:55,028
Here, let me see.

945
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,599
Are you okay?

946
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,824
Are you okay?

947
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,864
I'm so sorry.

948
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,022
Oh, oh.

949
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:39,406
What happened?

950
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:40,206
She fell in the lake.

951
00:59:41,393 --> 00:59:42,484
Oh, my God.

952
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:44,014
She was just scared I think.

953
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,975
She got out of my sight for a second.

954
00:59:56,977 --> 00:59:57,992
You left her alone?

955
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,123
No, she went up ahead.

956
00:59:59,125 --> 00:59:59,922
Don't blame this on her.

957
00:59:59,924 --> 01:00:00,850
She's the child.

958
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:01,649
I wasn't.

959
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:03,008
You're the adult, right?

960
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,600
You have to watch her every second.

961
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:05,808
All it takes is a second.

962
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,131
I know, I made a mistake.

963
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:09,171
You're not allowed to
make mistakes like that

964
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:10,852
when you're a parent.

965
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:17,462
Right, I'm sorry, I
won't let it happen again.

966
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:37,397
One, two, three, four.

967
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:45,559
Okay, I think you got me.

968
01:00:50,118 --> 01:00:51,602
Did I get the wrong day?

969
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:53,426
We're having an impromptu play date.

970
01:00:54,855 --> 01:00:56,488
This is our neighbor, Cheryl.

971
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:58,594
Bridget.

972
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:00,186
You two know each other?

973
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:01,308
Bridget and I were in the same

974
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,446
creative writing class at Northwestern.

975
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:05,374
I didn't know you went to Northwestern.

976
01:01:05,376 --> 01:01:06,173
Just for a year.

977
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,378
It doesn't count.

978
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,095
Wait, are you in the neighborhood?

979
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:09,894
No.

980
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:11,473
Oh, we all thought Bridget was gonna be

981
01:01:11,475 --> 01:01:13,104
the next Sylvia Plath.

982
01:01:13,106 --> 01:01:14,466
You're a poet?

983
01:01:14,468 --> 01:01:15,887
And severely depressed.

984
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:19,155
Well, when
the nanny gets here,

985
01:01:19,157 --> 01:01:21,064
we should go get some mommy juice.

986
01:01:21,066 --> 01:01:21,975
I have to work.

987
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:23,327
Oh, well, call in sick.

988
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:25,169
I wanna hear what you've been up to.

989
01:01:25,171 --> 01:01:27,089
I don't think my boss would like that.

990
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:31,724
I'm the nanny.

991
01:01:32,584 --> 01:01:34,550
We couldn't survive without her.

992
01:01:35,486 --> 01:01:36,924
That is so great.

993
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,892
Is that like your side
hustle or something?

994
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:43,232
No, this is it.

995
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:46,948
Good for you.

996
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:49,077
That, hard to stay sad

997
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,803
when you're around kids
all day.

998
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,328
Who's the active shooter?

999
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,399
Oh, that's my baby, Cortland.

1000
01:01:58,401 --> 01:01:59,962
He's in love with Franny.

1001
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:01,013
So he shot her.

1002
01:02:02,516 --> 01:02:04,326
Would you like some tea?

1003
01:02:04,328 --> 01:02:05,549
I would love some more.

1004
01:02:08,299 --> 01:02:09,323
Oh, no, no, I'll, I'll get it.

1005
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,699
I, I, no, that's fine.

1006
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:18,942
A nanny, good for you.

1007
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:19,995
I'm sorry?

1008
01:02:19,997 --> 01:02:23,105
Well, she is
so much more expensive.

1009
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:26,458
Is she cheaper because
she doesn't have a degree?

1010
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,686
He broke it.

1011
01:02:28,688 --> 01:02:29,645
I'm hungry.

1012
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:30,709
Oh no.

1013
01:02:30,711 --> 01:02:32,655
Cortland, apologize.

1014
01:02:32,657 --> 01:02:34,248
I'm hungry!

1015
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,336
We'll buy you another one, Franny, okay?

1016
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:39,906
Ah, Bridget, could you
run over to my house,

1017
01:02:39,908 --> 01:02:41,470
and make Cortland something to eat.

1018
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:43,318
Oh no, we have snacks here.

1019
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,383
No, we haven't got our
allergy tests back yet,

1020
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:47,540
so can't take any risks.

1021
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:48,902
There's carrots in the refrigerator.

1022
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:49,701
Just make sure you use

1023
01:02:49,703 --> 01:02:51,455
that fruit and veggie wash by the sink.

1024
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,071
Thanks.

1025
01:02:57,346 --> 01:02:58,864
Take me with you.

1026
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:05,567
Be right back.

1027
01:03:05,569 --> 01:03:06,486
Where you going?

1028
01:03:07,452 --> 01:03:08,958
To break one of his toys.

1029
01:03:59,471 --> 01:04:00,270
Oopsie.

1030
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:09,915

1031
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,855

Let's keep walking.

1035
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,698
I'm not tired.

1036
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,886
You're always tired.

1037
01:05:44,888 --> 01:05:45,973
Not today.

1038
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,171
Listen Annie, please, Annie!

1039
01:05:48,173 --> 01:05:49,656
Listen to, listen to me!

1040
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:53,974
I said, see, this
is what I'm talking about.

1041
01:05:59,196 --> 01:06:01,257
Have you ever been divorced?

1042
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:04,825
No, have you?

1043
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:05,625
No.

1044
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:11,411
Henry's mom is getting
a divorce from his dad,

1045
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:13,887
and moving in with his karate teacher.

1046
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:15,565
How do you know that?

1047
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:17,086
Henry had to get a new car,

1048
01:06:19,807 --> 01:06:23,679
'cause Henry's dad drove their minivan

1049
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:26,580
into the lake from sadness.

1050
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:31,070
Henry's mom said it
was only for attention.

1051
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:32,808
And Henry had to quit karate.

1052
01:06:34,643 --> 01:06:37,010
If mommy and mama get divorced,

1053
01:06:37,012 --> 01:06:39,211
would I have to quit ice skating?

1054
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:46,524
Okay, I might regret saying this,

1055
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:48,279
but I don't think your parents

1056
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:49,770
are gonna get divorced, Franny.

1057
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:52,278
You really don't?

1058
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,846
I really, really don't.

1059
01:06:55,617 --> 01:06:57,104
Promise they won't.

1060
01:06:58,523 --> 01:06:59,552
I can't do that,

1061
01:07:00,662 --> 01:07:03,443
but I have faith that it's not
gonna go that way for them.

1062
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:05,307
Like in God?

1063
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,248
You can have faith in people too.

1064
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:15,506
Has Maya been going to
any regular appointments

1065
01:07:15,508 --> 01:07:16,323
that you know of?

1066
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:22,114
Um, she went to the doctor
a couple of weeks ago.

1067
01:07:22,116 --> 01:07:22,953
Just once?

1068
01:07:23,851 --> 01:07:24,650
I don't know.

1069
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,215
How does she seem to you?

1070
01:07:29,932 --> 01:07:33,632
I mean you're here all the
time and I ah, I can't be here,

1071
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:35,887
and I just thought you
might have some insight.

1072
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:38,470
She's been pretty quiet,

1073
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:42,987
but I don't know what's normal.

1074
01:07:48,278 --> 01:07:50,635
I do think that Maya
is really overwhelmed,

1075
01:07:50,637 --> 01:07:51,980
and she could use some help.

1076
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:55,768
Well, that's why you're here, right?

1077
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:01,645
Thank you, ah, you can go home.

1078
01:08:01,647 --> 01:08:03,832
I've taken the rest of the day off.

1079
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:06,162
Oh, I'll just say bye to Franny.

1080
01:08:06,164 --> 01:08:06,982
I can tell her.

1081
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:13,144
Leaves
are not very nutritious.

1082
01:08:13,146 --> 01:08:16,390
The sloths way of compensating
for that is not to eat more,

1083
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:18,112
but to do less.

1084
01:08:18,114 --> 01:08:20,203
It's claws hook over the branches,

1085
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:22,705
so that the sloths can
hang without any effort.

1086
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:43,949
Can you help him?

1087
01:08:47,806 --> 01:08:49,185
I can't be near him.

1088
01:08:59,371 --> 01:09:00,170
I know.

1089
01:09:02,775 --> 01:09:04,162
There you go.

1090
01:09:04,164 --> 01:09:05,842
You remember how to do this, right?

1091
01:09:08,384 --> 01:09:09,183
Okay.

1092
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:14,990
Your pacie.

1093
01:09:17,085 --> 01:09:17,908
If you need anything,

1094
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:20,421
just say my name and
I'll be right here, okay?

1095
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:21,279
Is mommy okay?

1096
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,204
She's just sick right now.

1097
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,893
You know how you get sick sometimes?

1098
01:09:28,402 --> 01:09:29,546
And then you get better.

1099
01:09:31,615 --> 01:09:33,384
I think we should call Annie.

1100
01:09:33,386 --> 01:09:35,531
No, please.

1101
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,076
But we need to do something.

1102
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:45,135
You should talk to
somebody who can help you.

1103
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:46,272
I've been praying.

1104
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,100
I know you don't believe in that.

1105
01:09:51,102 --> 01:09:52,179
That's what helps me.

1106
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:56,653
I've been praying to the Virgin Mary.

1107
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:57,540
What'd she say?

1108
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:02,292
That I'm doing everything wrong,

1109
01:10:02,294 --> 01:10:05,366
or at least that's what I hear in my head.

1110
01:10:08,193 --> 01:10:10,070
My mom told me that when I was a baby,

1111
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,816
she wanted to grab me by the ankles,

1112
01:10:11,818 --> 01:10:13,604
and slam my head against the wall.

1113
01:10:15,222 --> 01:10:16,597
She was very graphic.

1114
01:10:18,656 --> 01:10:20,562
And she said more women
should talk about that,

1115
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:22,274
because it's really fuckin' lonely.

1116
01:10:24,228 --> 01:10:25,592
Sorry, she didn't say fuck.

1117
01:10:27,913 --> 01:10:29,745
I just don't feel like myself.

1118
01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:31,711
That's not your fault.

1119
01:10:36,369 --> 01:10:40,218
I promised Franny I'd take
her to the fireworks tonight.

1120
01:10:41,864 --> 01:10:46,660
Annie's working and taking
both kids by myself.

1121
01:10:46,804 --> 01:10:47,810
Let me go with you.

1122
01:10:48,626 --> 01:10:50,849
You don't have plans with your friends?

1123
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:52,570
You and Franny are my friends.

1124
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,301
This will be fun.

1125
01:10:56,614 --> 01:10:57,920
We'll both take showers.

1126
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,626
We'll get dressed up.

1127
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:04,390
Shit, ah, sorry.

1128
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,721
Oh, what happened?

1129
01:11:06,723 --> 01:11:08,641
I've been bleeding through my tampons.

1130
01:11:09,993 --> 01:11:12,916
Maybe I could borrow one
of Wally's diapers tonight?

1131
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:13,861
Take one of mine.

1132
01:11:15,364 --> 01:11:16,858
Since the birth, I've been peeing

1133
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,356
whenever I sneeze, cough,
or take a deep breath.

1134
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,837
I peed a little just seconds ago.

1135
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,357
And now.

1136
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:38,640
Bridget.

1137
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,237
Oh, someone's hungry.

1138
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:19,325
Um, you know what?

1139
01:12:20,272 --> 01:12:21,889
I'll just feed him right here.

1140
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:22,690
Yeah.

1141
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,557
Oh, I know, it's okay.

1142
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:27,598
Yeah, I know.

1143
01:12:29,593 --> 01:12:30,792
Almost, almost.

1144
01:12:32,991 --> 01:12:34,745
Yeah, I know, I know.

1145
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:35,878
I know, I know, sweetie, I know.

1146
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:38,956
Boo.

1147
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,170
Boo.

1148
01:12:40,172 --> 01:12:41,144
Boo.

1149
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:42,063
Boo.

1150
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:44,223
Boo, boo, boo.

1151
01:12:44,225 --> 01:12:45,377
Boo, boo, boo.

1152
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:46,690
Boo, boo, boo,
boo to infinity.

1153
01:12:48,017 --> 01:12:48,896
Boo, boo.

1154
01:12:50,354 --> 01:12:51,740
Boo.

1155
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:52,973
Boo.

1156
01:12:52,975 --> 01:12:54,186
You're just the winner.

1157
01:12:59,102 --> 01:13:00,701
Hi, hi, excuse me.

1158
01:13:01,898 --> 01:13:06,057
Could you maybe find a
restroom or go to your car.

1159
01:13:06,858 --> 01:13:10,494
Oh, um, there, there,
there aren't any restrooms.

1160
01:13:10,496 --> 01:13:11,319
Well, maybe could you just put

1161
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:13,304
a blanket over yourself?

1162
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,079
What exactly is the problem?

1163
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:17,841
There are families here.

1164
01:13:17,843 --> 01:13:19,615
My family's here.

1165
01:13:19,617 --> 01:13:21,591
Okay, but this is not your house,

1166
01:13:21,593 --> 01:13:25,149
so you can't just expose
yourself whenever you want.

1167
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:26,261
She's feeding her son.

1168
01:13:26,263 --> 01:13:28,275
Okay, well, maybe she
could've thought about that

1169
01:13:28,277 --> 01:13:30,960
before she decided to go out in public.

1170
01:13:30,962 --> 01:13:32,130
Well, she's trying to get attention

1171
01:13:32,132 --> 01:13:34,883
from all the men here I'm thinking.

1172
01:13:34,885 --> 01:13:35,713
She's gay.

1173
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:40,450
Um, you're the girlfriend?

1174
01:13:40,452 --> 01:13:41,249
Oh.

1175
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,670
No, I'm the wife.

1176
01:13:42,672 --> 01:13:44,220
Oh, okay.

1177
01:13:44,222 --> 01:13:46,027
This is disgusting, both of you.

1178
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:49,748
You know what, I really feel
for your children, I do.

1179
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:53,968
Hey, apologize to my family.

1180
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,521
I'm sorry, for what?

1181
01:13:55,523 --> 01:13:56,320
For being a dick.

1182
01:13:56,322 --> 01:13:59,501
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on.

1183
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:00,633
My kids are here.

1184
01:14:00,635 --> 01:14:01,432
So is mine.

1185
01:14:01,434 --> 01:14:03,520
And I think we have the
responsibility to show them

1186
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:06,239
that people can disagree
and still be respectful.

1187
01:14:08,413 --> 01:14:10,463
Look, I apologize if I've offended you.

1188
01:14:10,465 --> 01:14:11,262
You have.

1189
01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:12,832
But I'm not sorry for feeding my son,

1190
01:14:12,834 --> 01:14:14,273
or loving my family in public.

1191
01:14:15,174 --> 01:14:17,359
Okay, well, you can just maybe not,

1192
01:14:17,361 --> 01:14:19,133
you just don't need to rub our face in it

1193
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:20,554
when you're doing that.

1194
01:14:22,326 --> 01:14:26,978
It, it's okay, Franny, it's okay.

1195
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,793
What did your moms teach you
to do when you meet somebody?

1196
01:14:30,993 --> 01:14:32,112
I'm Frances.

1197
01:14:39,586 --> 01:14:41,415
What's your name?

1198
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:42,815
Joan.

1199
01:14:42,817 --> 01:14:43,616
Like Joan Jett.

1200
01:14:45,902 --> 01:14:47,367
Ah, yes, mm hmm.

1201
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:48,168
Cool.

1202
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:53,893
I'm Maya, this is Bridget.

1203
01:14:58,532 --> 01:15:00,318
Come on, Mom, the
fireworks are about to start.

1204
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,826
Okay, I'm gonna go get something, okay?

1205
01:15:03,828 --> 01:15:05,267
All right.

1206
01:15:05,269 --> 01:15:07,325
Bye, Joan.

1207
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:08,594
Enjoy the fireworks.

1208
01:15:08,596 --> 01:15:10,629
Yeah, you too.

1209
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:15,382
That was the most badass
thing I've ever seen.

1210
01:15:15,384 --> 01:15:16,932
Oh, my God, I think I
might bust out.

1211
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:18,862
Oh, my heart was going crazy.

1212
01:15:18,864 --> 01:15:20,255
Look, my hands are shaking.

1213
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:24,050
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

1214
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:24,849
Give me that wine.

1215
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:25,650
Here.

1216
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:30,653
Franny, you were amazing.

1217
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:35,163
You were amazing.

1218
01:15:35,165 --> 01:15:36,780
Wasn't your mama awesome?

1219
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:43,463
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

1220
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,408
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

1221
01:15:53,906 --> 01:15:56,210
Are you ready, whoosh.

1222
01:15:56,212 --> 01:15:58,106
Can Bridget sleep over?

1223
01:15:58,108 --> 01:16:00,456
Um, if she wants to.

1224
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:01,254
Yay!

1225
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,039
I really want to.

1226
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,280
And we could all sleep in the same bed.

1227
01:16:05,282 --> 01:16:06,833
Is Bridget spending the night?

1228
01:16:06,835 --> 01:16:08,274
Well, when did you get home?

1229
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,038
Frances, go to bed.

1230
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,024
I have to brush my teeth.

1231
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:12,846
Skip it tonight.

1232
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:14,587
My teeth will rot out.

1233
01:16:14,589 --> 01:16:15,388
Go.

1234
01:16:21,646 --> 01:16:22,902
Have you been drinking?

1235
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:24,949
A half a glass of wine.

1236
01:16:24,951 --> 01:16:26,522
And you drove?

1237
01:16:26,524 --> 01:16:27,692
Yes, and I was completely sober.

1238
01:16:27,694 --> 01:16:29,006
It really was just half a glass.

1239
01:16:29,008 --> 01:16:30,368
Have you been drinking?

1240
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,410
I wasn't driving.

1241
01:16:31,412 --> 01:16:32,209
You don't have to explain anything.

1242
01:16:32,211 --> 01:16:34,151
No, Maya was awesome tonight actually.

1243
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:34,950
Awesome.

1244
01:16:34,952 --> 01:16:36,065
There was this woman who tried to

1245
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:37,753
shame her for breastfeeding Wally.

1246
01:16:37,755 --> 01:16:38,551
Bridget.

1247
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:39,373
No, you were amazing.

1248
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:40,172
Amazing.

1249
01:16:40,174 --> 01:16:41,422
You were brave and strong and kind.

1250
01:16:41,424 --> 01:16:42,826
Annie, let's just go upstairs.

1251
01:16:42,828 --> 01:16:44,123
Are you having an affair?

1252
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:49,650
Are you?

1253
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:51,510
Of course not.

1254
01:16:54,931 --> 01:16:56,034
I'm gonna put him down.

1255
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:59,091
If either of you say another word,

1256
01:16:59,093 --> 01:17:02,913
I will freak the fuck out, no talking.

1257
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:12,105
Bridget.

1258
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:13,237
I don't think we're
supposed to talk right now.

1259
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:16,057
Grow up, she's not your mom.

1260
01:17:16,059 --> 01:17:17,284
No, she's my friend.

1261
01:17:17,286 --> 01:17:19,241
That's not what we hired you for.

1262
01:17:19,243 --> 01:17:20,967
You hired me to take
care of them, right?

1263
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:24,880
Franny, we hired you
to take care of Franny

1264
01:17:24,882 --> 01:17:25,805
and then to leave.

1265
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:35,707
I'm sorry.

1266
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:40,859
I don't know what's happening.

1267
01:17:47,317 --> 01:17:49,973
I feel like I'm failing my family.

1268
01:17:51,236 --> 01:17:53,176
Maya has postpartum depression,

1269
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:56,576
and she won't talk to me about it.

1270
01:17:56,578 --> 01:17:58,571
She won't go see a doctor.

1271
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,074
I think she feels like she's failing.

1272
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,758
See and I'm so proud of her.

1273
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,674
I am so proud of our family,

1274
01:18:09,765 --> 01:18:11,494
of what Maya and I have made.

1275
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:19,588
Last week, I got an Uber.

1276
01:18:20,449 --> 01:18:24,115
The driver must've seen
me hand Wally to Maya,

1277
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:27,572
because when I got in the car,

1278
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:31,696
the driver asked me if I was
happy to be getting off work

1279
01:18:31,698 --> 01:18:33,576
from my babysitting job.

1280
01:18:33,578 --> 01:18:36,563
Said if I wanted to pick up
any extra hours to call her.

1281
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,981
Oh, God.

1282
01:18:38,983 --> 01:18:41,080
You know, we knew that
kind of thing might happen,

1283
01:18:42,324 --> 01:18:44,290
and will probably continue to happen but,

1284
01:18:47,283 --> 01:18:48,738
we're prepared for that.

1285
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,789
We talk through it.

1286
01:18:50,716 --> 01:18:52,301
But I wasn't prepared for this.

1287
01:18:53,277 --> 01:18:54,377
When I got home tonight,

1288
01:18:54,379 --> 01:18:57,389
I found some clothes
with fresh blood on them,

1289
01:18:57,391 --> 01:18:59,863
and I thought for just a split second

1290
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:02,213
that Maya had tried to
maybe hurt herself or...

1291
01:19:02,215 --> 01:19:03,191
Oh, God, no, no, no.

1292
01:19:03,193 --> 01:19:03,992
Those are mine.

1293
01:19:05,082 --> 01:19:06,903
No, I had an abortion
a couple of months ago,

1294
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:08,389
and I've been bleeding
off and on ever since,

1295
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:12,403
and that's too mine, but no.

1296
01:19:14,069 --> 01:19:16,234
Have you been to the doctor?

1297
01:19:16,236 --> 01:19:18,910
I'm fine, I'm just really
tired and weak all the time.

1298
01:19:18,912 --> 01:19:20,607
Well, you might, you might be anemic.

1299
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:22,000
You need to go to the doctor.

1300
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,800
You're not like horrified?

1301
01:19:25,615 --> 01:19:26,486
That no one around here

1302
01:19:26,488 --> 01:19:28,505
knows how to go to the doctor, yes.

1303
01:19:30,775 --> 01:19:33,195
That you had an abortion, no.

1304
01:19:41,296 --> 01:19:42,445
I don't even know why I'm crying.

1305
01:19:42,447 --> 01:19:44,218
I'm an agnostic feminist.

1306
01:19:46,216 --> 01:19:48,290
I said no talking, now you're crying?

1307
01:19:51,836 --> 01:19:53,368
I'll bring this back tomorrow.

1308
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,749
No, keep it.

1309
01:19:54,751 --> 01:19:56,940
You look like a superhero, keep it.

1310
01:20:25,268 --> 01:20:26,613
Name this child.

1311
01:20:29,052 --> 01:20:31,040
Wallace Francisco Rodriguez Paulsen.

1312
01:20:33,669 --> 01:20:34,827
Wallace Francisco,

1313
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:36,827
I baptize you in the name of the Father,

1314
01:20:37,662 --> 01:20:40,779
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

1315
01:20:46,928 --> 01:20:50,205
♪ Try to hear her sooner ♪

1316
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:02,757
♪ We were often too far gone ♪

1317
01:21:02,759 --> 01:21:07,394
♪ For making out the
writings on the sand ♪

1318
01:21:14,722 --> 01:21:17,678
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

1319
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:44,520
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

1320
01:22:00,174 --> 01:22:02,978
God, is that you?

1321
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,181
My child.

1322
01:22:09,784 --> 01:22:12,119
Speak child.

1323
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:15,733
Oh, okay, well,

1324
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:19,593
bless me Father, for I have sinned,

1325
01:22:19,595 --> 01:22:24,390
it's been 21 years since
my last confession.

1326
01:22:25,013 --> 01:22:26,042
What are your sins?

1327
01:22:27,497 --> 01:22:29,274
I don't have any, I'm perfect.

1328
01:22:30,114 --> 01:22:31,473
No, play right.

1329
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:35,398
Okay, okay, I got one.

1330
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,110
I faked my first confession.

1331
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:39,071
What do you mean?

1332
01:22:39,073 --> 01:22:40,670
Well, when I got in there,
the priest wasn't there yet,

1333
01:22:40,672 --> 01:22:43,099
and so I just had a
conversation with myself,

1334
01:22:43,101 --> 01:22:45,727
and then I told everybody
how amazing it was.

1335
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:46,726
So you lied?

1336
01:22:47,723 --> 01:22:48,992
You lie a lot.

1337
01:22:50,246 --> 01:22:51,045
I do?

1338
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:54,296
Yeah, why do you do that?

1339
01:22:55,252 --> 01:22:59,652
I think sometimes it feels better

1340
01:22:59,654 --> 01:23:02,133
to pretend to be somebody else.

1341
01:23:02,135 --> 01:23:03,334
Why?

1342
01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:09,704
Because I'm not, I'm
not an impressive person.

1343
01:23:11,843 --> 01:23:15,452
I don't have like a husband
or kids or a fancy job.

1344
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:17,961
Do you have to have those things?

1345
01:23:19,566 --> 01:23:20,764
I don't know.

1346
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:25,637
I know that I wanna be better than I am.

1347
01:23:27,322 --> 01:23:28,946
I wanna feel proud of myself.

1348
01:23:30,516 --> 01:23:33,292
I'm proud of you.

1349
01:23:33,294 --> 01:23:34,125
You are?

1350
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:35,832
Yeah.

1351
01:23:36,836 --> 01:23:37,822
Why?

1352
01:23:37,824 --> 01:23:39,582
You try even when you're scared.

1353
01:23:42,236 --> 01:23:43,806
Like when?

1354
01:23:43,808 --> 01:23:48,603
Like gymnastics and ice
skating and holding Wally,

1355
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:51,570
and when that bully was mean to mommy.

1356
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:54,099
I was scared then.

1357
01:23:56,305 --> 01:23:57,736
And you were brave.

1358
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:00,383
I am proud of you.

1359
01:24:02,135 --> 01:24:03,574
I'm so proud of you, Franny.

1360
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:06,555
I'm not Franny right now.

1361
01:24:06,557 --> 01:24:07,950
Oh, sorry.

1362
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,906
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh,

1363
01:24:12,908 --> 01:24:16,063
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

1364
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:18,287
What're you doing?

1365
01:24:18,289 --> 01:24:19,888
Washing you clean.

1366
01:24:20,812 --> 01:24:23,886
Are there any other
sins you need forgiven?

1367
01:24:23,888 --> 01:24:25,697
I mean probably a lot.

1368
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:27,505
Like any big ones.

1369
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:30,651
No.

1370
01:24:34,186 --> 01:24:36,594
In the name of the
Father, and in the Son,

1371
01:24:36,596 --> 01:24:38,914
and in the Holy Spirit, amen.

1372
01:24:39,858 --> 01:24:40,657
Amen.

1373
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,816
Hey, this is Jace.

1374
01:24:42,818 --> 01:24:45,225
Leave your name and number
and I'll give you a call back.

1375
01:24:46,433 --> 01:24:49,668
Hey, it's Bridget.

1376
01:24:51,162 --> 01:24:52,085
I bled on you.

1377
01:24:56,455 --> 01:24:58,069
I think I do have some feelings.

1378
01:25:00,886 --> 01:25:03,018
I think I feel mostly relieved,

1379
01:25:05,269 --> 01:25:06,643
and I feel sad,

1380
01:25:07,715 --> 01:25:10,705
and I feel pissed that you didn't

1381
01:25:10,707 --> 01:25:12,337
have to go through it, not really.

1382
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:14,579
You were there for me,

1383
01:25:14,581 --> 01:25:16,612
but your body didn't
have to experience it,

1384
01:25:16,614 --> 01:25:19,204
and I'm pissed that I had
to deal with it for so long.

1385
01:25:20,307 --> 01:25:23,191
And I feel worried that my parents

1386
01:25:23,193 --> 01:25:24,563
will never know this thing about me,

1387
01:25:24,565 --> 01:25:26,443
and that if they did, that
they would be disappointed,

1388
01:25:26,445 --> 01:25:29,104
or that they would judge me.

1389
01:25:29,974 --> 01:25:31,353
And I'm worried that I might not ever

1390
01:25:31,355 --> 01:25:33,348
be able to get pregnant
again because I'm 34.

1391
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:35,275
I'm a year away from
a geriatric pregnancy,

1392
01:25:35,277 --> 01:25:38,105
and, and what if this was my shot,

1393
01:25:38,107 --> 01:25:42,137
but then I think that's just
what society wants me to think.

1394
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:46,942
And then I think do I even
want kids, and yes, I do.

1395
01:25:48,579 --> 01:25:50,241
But I don't think that was my kid.

1396
01:25:53,509 --> 01:25:54,947
I don't think that was my kid.

1397
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,364
I don't even actually think it was a kid.

1398
01:26:00,366 --> 01:26:01,946
I think it was a pocket of cells,

1399
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,825
and I feel pissed that anybody
wants me to think it's a kid.

1400
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:10,820
And mostly I'm worried about
other people who have to...

1401
01:26:11,814 --> 01:26:12,611
Fuck.

1402
01:26:12,613 --> 01:26:13,973
This voicemail box is now full.

1403
01:26:13,975 --> 01:26:15,795
To send this message, press one.

1404
01:26:15,797 --> 01:26:17,511
To rerecord, press two.

1405
01:26:17,513 --> 01:26:20,054
To delete this message, press three.

1406
01:26:22,376 --> 01:26:23,328
This is Bridget.

1407
01:26:24,821 --> 01:26:26,123
I have feelings.

1408
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:29,933
If you still wanna hear 'em, let me know.

1409
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,898
Hello, hey, sorry.

1410
01:26:39,054 --> 01:26:40,317
Forgot to give these back.

1411
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:41,852
You didn't have to come all this way.

1412
01:26:41,854 --> 01:26:44,863
That's okay, I don't know
when I'll be up here again, so.

1413
01:26:44,865 --> 01:26:45,842
Thank you.

1414
01:26:45,844 --> 01:26:47,717
Okay, well, I'll see ya.

1415
01:26:48,711 --> 01:26:51,409
Stay for dinner, please.

1416
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:54,347
Bless us, oh Lord, for these our gifts

1417
01:26:54,349 --> 01:26:55,709
which we are about to receive

1418
01:26:55,711 --> 01:27:00,244
from thy bounty, through
Christ, our Lord, amen.

1419
01:27:00,246 --> 01:27:02,049
Amen.

1420
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:03,604
Who wants this?

1421
01:27:03,606 --> 01:27:04,923
I'm okay, thank you.

1422
01:27:04,925 --> 01:27:05,891
Not me.

1423
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:06,712
White meat.

1424
01:27:06,714 --> 01:27:07,513
Why not?

1425
01:27:08,315 --> 01:27:09,112
Peas?

1426
01:27:09,114 --> 01:27:09,911
Here.

1427
01:27:09,913 --> 01:27:10,709
Thank you.

1428
01:27:10,711 --> 01:27:13,301
That is a nice job, Franny.

1429
01:27:15,991 --> 01:27:18,628
Oh, the act of intimacy.

1430
01:27:20,547 --> 01:27:22,200
What happened to it, remember that?

1431
01:27:22,202 --> 01:27:22,999
Oh, yeah.

1432
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:24,183
Bridget.

1433
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,517
Can Bridget sleep over?

1434
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:41,991
If she wants to.

1435
01:27:41,993 --> 01:27:43,137
Yay!

1436
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:13,587
Cute.

1437
01:28:20,566 --> 01:28:21,365
That's me.

1438
01:28:22,304 --> 01:28:23,359
I have a lot of you.

1439
01:28:26,346 --> 01:28:27,864
Who are they?

1440
01:28:27,866 --> 01:28:29,447
Those are my parents.

1441
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:30,641
You have parents?

1442
01:28:31,482 --> 01:28:33,949
Mm hmm and a little brother.

1443
01:28:35,366 --> 01:28:36,165
Just like you.

1444
01:28:38,382 --> 01:28:41,224
Mommy had a picture like this of Wally.

1445
01:28:41,226 --> 01:28:42,974
Did you have a baby?

1446
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:47,654
No.

1447
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,921
Do you want one?

1448
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,159
I don't know.

1449
01:28:55,218 --> 01:28:56,017
Do you?

1450
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,565
I don't know.

1451
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:07,621
Franny, this is the
best summer I've ever had.

1452
01:29:08,616 --> 01:29:11,117
Out of all 34?

1453
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:12,030
Mm hmm.

1454
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,764
I can't wait until next summer.

1455
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:37,265
Time for school.

1456
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:49,428
Ready, one, two, three.

1457
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,199
Say goodbye to kindergarten.

1458
01:29:58,793 --> 01:29:59,590
Come stand up here.

1459
01:29:59,592 --> 01:30:01,270
Hello, first grade.

1460
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:04,415
Have the best first day.

1461
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:11,390
All right, I'll see you guys.

1462
01:30:11,392 --> 01:30:13,058
Goodbye.

1463
01:30:38,379 --> 01:30:39,902
Look, it's Joan.

1464
01:30:39,904 --> 01:30:40,703
Hi, Joan!

1465
01:30:43,989 --> 01:30:45,695
You ready?

1466
01:30:45,697 --> 01:30:46,759
What do we say?

1467
01:30:46,761 --> 01:30:48,263
I'm smart!

1468
01:30:48,265 --> 01:30:49,634
I'm smart!

1469
01:30:49,636 --> 01:30:51,034
I'm brave!

1470
01:30:51,036 --> 01:30:52,472
I'm brave!

1471
01:30:52,474 --> 01:30:54,141
I'm the coolest!

1472
01:30:54,143 --> 01:30:55,945
I'm the coolest!

1473
01:30:55,947 --> 01:30:57,056
Now, growl like a tiger, ready?

1474
01:31:01,854 --> 01:31:02,653
Go in.

1475
01:31:28,565 --> 01:31:30,048
Put your
backpacks in the cubbies,

1476
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:31,139
and then go wash your hands,

1477
01:31:31,141 --> 01:31:33,664
and then you can come
to the table to play.

1478
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:34,860
Sure, I'll be right in.

1479
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:35,910
Come on in.

1480
01:31:35,912 --> 01:31:38,406
Put your backpacks in the cubbies.

1481
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:06,173
Bridget!

1482
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:10,569
Bridget!

1483
01:32:14,288 --> 01:32:15,287
Bridget!

1484
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:16,088
Bridget!

1485
01:32:17,025 --> 01:32:17,984
I found you!

1486
01:32:18,847 --> 01:32:21,778
Bridget, I really need you outside.

1487
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,988
I love you.

1488
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:24,388
What're you doing?

1489
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:25,879
I'll tell you.

1490
01:32:25,881 --> 01:32:27,659
You'll tell me what?

1491
01:32:27,661 --> 01:32:29,499
When I get my period.

1492
01:32:30,442 --> 01:32:33,606
I'll call you and we could talk about it.

1493
01:32:33,608 --> 01:32:35,853
Franny, that's not gonna
happen for a really long time.

1494
01:32:35,855 --> 01:32:39,023
But when it does, we
could talk about it.

1495
01:32:39,025 --> 01:32:40,848
Because we'll still be friends, right?

1496
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:45,748
Right.

1497
01:32:51,106 --> 01:32:55,289
Okay, you have to go back now, okay.

1498
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,090
I know.

1499
01:32:57,711 --> 01:32:58,510
I know!
