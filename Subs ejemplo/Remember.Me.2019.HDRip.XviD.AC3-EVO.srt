00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,174
Stop being a baby.
It wasn't that heavy.

3
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,510
You're breathing harder than I am.

4
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,055
I'm just faking it.
To make you feel better.

5
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,393
I'm just dropping it.

6
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,817
- I forgot something.
- What?

7
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,697
It's for my hypertension.

8
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,909
Whoa. What's that?

9
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,953
Amlodipine.

10
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,121
What do you take for your arthritis?

11
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,124
- Ibuprofen.
- I'm taking Fosamax.

12
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,253
And I haven't noticed
any real improvement.

13
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,712
I'll tell you something.

14
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,549
I'll tell you
what's a real revelation. Diclofenac.

15
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,636
- For your sciatica.
- My sciatica. I highly recommend it.

16
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,847
Now, tell me.

17
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,808
What do you take for your cholesterol?

18
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,103
- Crestor.
- I told you! Take Lipitor!

19
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,981
Mine was sky-rocketing
and it came right down.

20
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,816
You don't remember me telling you?

21
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,736
- No.
- I'm telling you again. Try Lipitor.

22
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,530
Or get a new doctor.

23
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,783
And while you're at it,
get yourself some Exelon.

24
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,869
Now, what the hell is that for?

25
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,287
Your memory.

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,541
You're questioning my memory?

27
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,712
Don't ever question my memory.

28
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:39,344
So, your daughter and your granddaughter
are gonna sleep here?

29
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,722
In theory, yeah.

30
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,140
The two of them together?

31
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,603
It's not the Ritz,
but it is a spare bedroom

32
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,770
and the only one I got.

33
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,066
Well, wouldn't it be more appropriate
if your son-in-law were to leave?

34
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,529
- I mean, after all...
- After all, he behaved very poorly.

35
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,741
And they have newspaper people
all over his house,

36
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,827
which they should have,
to find out what he really did.

37
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,247
So I thought the girls would
have a little more privacy here.

38
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,749
And what about you?

39
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,792
What about your peace?

40
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,216
True. However, it gives me
a chance to be with my girls.

41
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,344
Hmm.

42
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,013
And what about these girls, hm?

43
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,392
I mean, you know,
it's kind of sad to chuck 'em.

44
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,602
I mean, they're such classics.

45
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,356
Oh, I can never let
my girls know about my girls.

46
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:36,235
No. What are you doing?
Take one, for Christ's sake.

47
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,694
Be a man. Grow up.

48
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,698
You mean you haven't dicked around
since you've been divorced?

49
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,368
I'm afraid those days are over for me.

50
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,372
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,208
Nexium.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,544
It's good for my stomach.

53
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,756
All right, buddy. I got a family
waiting for a portrait.

54
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,094
The old "in the cellar" extra buck.
Love it.

55
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,220
You bet.

56
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,685
Tell me when the girls arrive.

57
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,771
- I'll stop by for a visit.
- You got it.

58
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,190
Later.

59
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,783
<i>Prostitutes paid
with taxpayers' money?</i>

60
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,493
<i>Let's go live to the press conference</i>

61
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,246
<i>with California's
Lieutenant Governor, David Addison.</i>

62
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,664
<i>I am deeply sorry</i>

63
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,500
<i>that I did not live up
to what was expected of me,</i>

64
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,462
<i>and I must take full responsibility
for my misconduct.</i>

65
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>I am therefore resigning
as Lieutenant Governor.</i>

66
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,469
<i>I now want to devote all my time</i>

67
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,181
<i>toward earning back
the trust of my family.</i>

68
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,018
<i>Words cannot express</i>

69
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,355
<i>how sorry I feel for the terrible hurt
that I have caused them</i>

70
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,191
<i>and how blessed I am</i>

71
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,568
<i>that they have found it
in their hearts to forgive me.</i>

72
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,652
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

73
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,154
<i>How many prostitutes
have you slept with?</i>

74
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,907
<i>Did your wife
find naked pics in your phone?</i>

75
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,117
<i>What message
are you sending young women?</i>

76
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,876
How long have we worked together?
Eight, ten years?

77
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,086
Twelve.

78
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,507
This man taught me everything I know.

79
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,883
Come over here.

80
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,303
His reviews were
a major cultural reference.

81
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,555
It's a pleasure.

82
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,976
But the industry's changing, Claude.

83
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,231
I mean, with a constant stream
of multi-platform readership,

84
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,859
our consumers are now more interested
than ever in what's happening.

85
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,487
They're "woke," as they say.

86
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,907
I really don't want to take advantage
of the special relationship

87
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,367
that you have with this newspaper,

88
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,079
but I really can't look the other way
as far as your family is...

89
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,163
Stop.

90
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,334
Don't go there.

91
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,420
Okay. I'll tell you what.

92
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,882
Why don't we turn this around
in your favor, huh?

93
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,679
You enlighten us on the situation
of your son-in-law, more or less,

94
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,808
so then you can call the shots before
any of those sleazy gossipmongers.

95
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,394
So we keep the focus on him,

96
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,563
instead of on your daughter and family,

97
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,899
who are already weathering
a pretty nasty storm.

98
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,777
I can guarantee fair treatment

99
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,530
and no mention whatsoever
of intimate family issues.

100
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,240
You can trust me on that, really.

101
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,118
What about the article I sent you?

102
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,203
Oh, the one on Pina Bausch?

103
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,955
Heiner Muller.

104
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,165
Oh, Heiner Mueller.

105
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,209
- Muller. East German.
- Yes.

106
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,005
Modernist playwright.
Known all over the world.

107
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,383
Oh, right. Mark?

108
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,970
Uh, we found it super interesting,
like everything you send us.

109
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,347
A little bit difficult
to put into the print edition,

110
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,893
but it might be perfect for our brand-new
cultural digital supplement.

111
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,061
What the hell is he talking about?

112
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,438
It's our online edition.

113
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,316
It allows us to print
ancillary cultural news.

114
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,318
- We even have an app.
- Take a look.

115
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:08,989
Yeah.

116
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,784
Wait a sec.

117
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,454
- Can you bring that one back down?
- Yeah, sure.

118
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,041
It sounds like this is something
you're interested in?

119
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:28,634
Well, Henry Muller was
an important figure in European culture.

120
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,429
I'm sure we can find a way
to fit him into the front page

121
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,182
of the digital edition.

122
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,520
That is, of course,
if we all do our part, huh?

123
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,983
- Of course.
- Of course.

124
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,445
- Send me the article, please.
- Sure.

125
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,480
Jesus Christ!

126
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,622
I really loved you.

127
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,585
Still do.

128
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,907
We also have
an impressive recreational room

129
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,494
with light exercise equipment.
We also have activities...

130
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:09,086
Now, our dining room serves
three well-balanced delicious meals.

131
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,046
Everything is freshly made here.

132
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:16,093
And right this way,
I'll take you out to our gardens.

133
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,722
Now, of course,
this is our outpatient facility,

134
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,309
which is separate
from the rest of the facilities.

135
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,228
It's so beautiful.

136
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,482
And you'll notice
that is very intimate, very secure.

137
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,401
I love this garden.

138
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,761
Mrs. Blanche, it's this way.

139
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,527
Sir? You all right?

140
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,781
- Huh?
- Are you all right? Are you lost?

141
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,200
No.

142
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,160
Would you like me
to take you back to your room?

143
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,370
No. I can find my room.

144
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,876
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm new here,
so I still don't know everybody yet.

145
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,044
I'm working on it.

146
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,838
I am new here.

147
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,717
I'm Zephyr.

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,595
So I'll be here. Just let me know
if you need anything, okay?

149
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,555
All right. I'll see you around.

150
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,853
Are you out of your mind?

151
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,815
You'll get caught!
If you don't kill yourself first.

152
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,028
These places can be very depressing.

153
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,280
It's a very nice place.

154
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,950
And I can think of absolutely nothing

155
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:07,621
that I want to do more
than be next to her.

156
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,914
She needs me.

157
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,458
She may not even remember you,
for Christ's sake.

158
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,337
Alzheimer's? No memory.

159
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,548
- Really?
- Hmm.

160
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,216
She'll remember me. Trust me.

161
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,759
What makes you so sure?

162
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,556
Because what she and I
shared together and lived together

163
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,809
can never be forgotten.

164
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,145
Oh.

165
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,065
Yeah. Yeah.

166
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,279
There was this girl in Ronda.

167
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,531
That's a little place in southern Spain

168
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,284
where the family used
to go for a summer vacation.

169
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,787
She was petite. A little cross-eyed.

170
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,039
- Hmm.
- But she had a gorgeous smile.

171
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:55,252
And, oh, the most contagious laugh.

172
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,754
Incredible.

173
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,509
But, of course, you know,
I had to go back to the States.

174
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,429
But we promised we'd write to one another

175
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,806
and we did, we did for a time, but...

176
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,267
I lost contact.

177
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,395
Never even kissed her.

178
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,273
So you do understand me?

179
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,151
A little. Hmm.

180
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,363
Is she now...

181
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:25,824
available?

182
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,868
What about her husband?

183
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,369
Dead.

184
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,832
You're the only person on this planet

185
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,753
who would willingly
check himself in to an old folks' home.

186
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,550
- Yeah?
- <i>Hey, Dad.</i>

187
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:47,721
Sorry I didn't call sooner
but, with all the new allegations

188
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,266
and talking to Tania
about everything, it's been a lot.

189
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,228
- Well, how is she doing?
- <i>She's pretty upset.</i>

190
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,773
And you? I know you're mad at me.

191
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,442
I don't know how many times
I have to say this.

192
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:04,071
You're making a colossal mistake.

193
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:07,699
<i>I don't know what promises
this asshole has given you</i>

194
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,035
<i>or how he did it,</i>

195
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,829
<i>but he's a son of a bitch, he's ignorant,</i>

196
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,332
and whatever he's up to doesn't hold water

197
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,502
and in the future, you're gonna
find out very quickly, madam.

198
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,797
Yeah, well, you always told me

199
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,800
that I should take my chances,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

200
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,261
Any time you and Tania get bored

201
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,930
with all the crap
that's going on at your house,

202
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,475
I got two beds upstairs
in my spare room waiting for you.

203
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,228
Thanks, Daddy.
It's not gonna come to that.

204
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,314
Well, it'll be okay 'cause you called.

205
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,109
And that's the best thing
that happened today.

206
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,611
But also I have something to tell you.

207
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,989
- Really? What?
- <i>Well...</i>

208
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,241
I'm going on a trip with Shane.

209
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,618
- No.
- <i>Really? Where?</i>

210
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,539
<i>Well, we're just doing
some Golden Years traveling, that's all.</i>

211
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,624
Maybe Spain. Maybe winging it.

212
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,836
I don't really know what he thinks
going on a trip like this is.

213
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,213
Wait. What do you mean "winging it"?

214
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:07,467
Well, you know, what old people do.
We're old people. Um...

215
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,635
Having a good time.

216
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,387
Not caring about

217
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,723
<i>keeping in touch
with folks or anything else.</i>

218
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,266
Dad, are you okay?

219
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,352
I'm okay. My stew is burning.

220
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,271
- <i>I got to go.</i>
- Okay.

221
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,277
Something wrong?

222
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,072
It's Dad. He says he and Shane
are going on a trip.

223
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,075
To Spain. Winging it.

224
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,452
Winging it?

225
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,829
Yeah, that's what he said.
Until they get tired.

226
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,372
So what's the problem?

227
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,709
Well, they're old.
Who's gonna take care of 'em?

228
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,169
Oh, Selma!

229
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,588
Grandpa's a grown-up
who can look after himself.

230
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,590
- Yeah.
- And he's going with Shane,

231
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,091
who's, like, the responsible one.

232
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:52,221
I can totally see those two hooligans
scouring Spain for Spanish widows.

233
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,310
- Um...
- Not everyone is like you, Dad.

234
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:03,649
Please, just don't misinterpret my words.

235
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,858
- It's not what I meant.
- Are you gonna say something?

236
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,781
- Honey, it was a joke.
- A joke.

237
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,200
- It was a joke, Tania.
- A joke. Yeah. Okay.

238
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,576
It was a joke!

239
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,040
- It was just a joke.
- Yeah.

240
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,979
- Look.
- What?

241
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,857
- Is that...
- Yes, sir. That's her.

242
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,484
There's no cure, is there?

243
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:53,031
Not for either of us, but for her,
there's a chance to slow it down.

244
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:58,036
But microscopically or through
all kind of scans and everything,

245
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,830
you can't detect it.

246
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,291
You can only detect it after you're dead.

247
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,004
The only way they can really diagnose it

248
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,425
is through behavioral patterns.

249
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,595
What's so beautiful about that, you moron?

250
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:18,056
What are you talking about?
They won't catch me!

251
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,310
Oh, beyond brain circuits
and neuron connections, huh?

252
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,189
You don't wanna do it?
You don't wanna help me?

253
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,276
I'll tell you what to do it for.
Do it for your cross-eyed girlfriend.

254
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,363
Do it for every goddamn girl
that never accepted any plea from us.

255
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,282
Don't push it, buddy.

256
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,827
You got me to be your alibi for Selma
and that's all you're getting from me.

257
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,374
Now, don't tell me there's more.

258
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,711
You just got an Uber license!

259
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,547
An Uber driver?

260
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,474
- How do you know it's gonna work?
- I don't. It's a chance.

261
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,683
I'm taking a chance.

262
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,228
Something you ought
to think about doing more often.

263
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,646
And you also have to remember

264
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:10,359
that I don't remember
a goddamn thing, okay?

265
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,778
But I need them
to put me in the dementia unit...

266
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,073
Yeah, I'm your neighbor and friend.

267
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,784
I tried to get in touch
with your family, but no luck,

268
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,204
so I decided to pay for your care
myself until I can reach them.

269
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,539
Bingo!

270
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,333
Well, I doubt you'll be playing bingo
in the dementia unit.

271
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,335
Oh, don't be such an asshole.

272
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,505
I already put the money
in your account. Here's your receipt.

273
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,006
- Ah...
- No, wait a second.

274
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,133
You make lists about every goddamn thing.

275
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,094
So I know you would worry about a receipt.

276
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,429
I also have the GP report here.

277
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,059
How did you get that?

278
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,061
A little thing called acting.

279
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:51,608
Yeah. I forgot you were
in the drama business.

280
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:56,405
Well, it's the first time
I'm gonna be on the other side.

281
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,867
Do you think they're gonna
put me in the slammer

282
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,618
for assisting an insane person?

283
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,495
I'm not insane.

284
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,373
I've got Alzheimer's.

285
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,833
Give me a break.

286
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,085
I will get in the home.

287
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,756
They will accept me in the home
because we're paying.

288
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,217
And paying works.

289
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,602
I can imagine this has been
a very painful decision for you.

290
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,813
Oh, you can't imagine
how painful it is for me.

291
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,358
His memory loss has been significant?

292
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,904
Yes. Particularly since
his wife died two years ago.

293
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,072
He's deteriorated fast.

294
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:42,284
We're talking... downward spiral.

295
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:47,164
I'm so sorry to hear
about your wife, Mr. Berenson.

296
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,125
Oh, here's the GP report.

297
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,631
This is a bank transfer receipt from...

298
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,216
Oh! Uh...

299
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,134
- Sorry.
- Housekeeping.

300
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,512
Do you have the neurological test results?

301
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,932
I'm afraid not. The tests were
scheduled for two months from now.

302
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,892
But he can't afford to wait that long.

303
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:10,020
He can't sit at home pissing
and shitting his pants the whole time.

304
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,188
Hm-hm.

305
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,233
And does he recognize people?

306
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:18,695
Well, he recognizes me
because I'm his next-door neighbor

307
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,030
and I see him every day.

308
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:25,410
But I guess
he doesn't recognize anyone else.

309
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,456
And what are his hobbies?
What does he like to do?

310
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,751
He likes to drink a lot.

311
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,003
- Anything else?
- Play chess.

312
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,297
He plays chess?

313
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,635
But I always beat him
'cause he thinks he's playing checkers.

314
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,971
Sometimes I suck my thumb.

315
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,308
Yeah, he also has
some kind of childhood regression.

316
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,727
Totally immature.

317
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,897
Mr. Berenson, where do you live?

318
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,859
I live at, um...

319
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:01,405
one, six, zero, zero...

320
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,781
Uh...

321
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:06,201
Pennsyl... Pennsylvania Avenue.

322
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,913
Washington, DC.

323
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:13,625
And I can't remember
the numbers after that.

324
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,711
That's the White House.

325
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,507
Why would you, suddenly,
wanna go to the White House?

326
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:24,136
Let me explain
our community to you, Mr. McDowell.

327
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:28,348
We have three units
distributed on two different floors.

328
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,560
The general unit and the dementia unit

329
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,104
are both on the ground floor.

330
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:38,525
Patients with Alzheimer's
and other non-aggressive dementia

331
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,235
are on the second floor.

332
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:44,865
Claude, for the time being,
he'll be in our general unit.

333
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,326
Uh, no.

334
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,287
He really needs to be
in the dementia unit, not the general one.

335
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,831
I mean, he's ill. He's very ill.

336
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,043
He babbles incoherently
and shits his pants the whole time.

337
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,837
Babbles, shits, babbles, shits,
babbles, shits.

338
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,506
That's all he does.

339
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,592
- Can I speak now?
- Yeah.

340
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,928
I'd like to have Alzheimer's.

341
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,013
Why?

342
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,602
Wanna play a game?

343
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,979
- Yes.
- Okay.

344
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:22,486
If I show you my wiener,
you got to take your pants off.

345
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,614
Okay.

346
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,200
You nodded at first. She wanted to do it.

347
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,085
I'll leave you to unpack.

348
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:42,464
A nurse will be coming in a minute
to help you settle in.

349
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,760
Anything you need,
don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

350
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:47,845
- Thank you.
- Okay.

351
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:58,605
What the heck are you doing?

352
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,775
Richard Burton, Peter O'Toole

353
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:06,446
had this stuff in their dressing rooms
every day of their life.

354
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,784
Maybe it's time to forget all this.
Go home.

355
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,911
Oh, sure, I get it.

356
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,416
Claude, please, listen to me.

357
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:28,260
I appreciate your nobleness, but I'm fine.

358
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,513
It's not Guantanamo. I can do it.

359
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,015
You got your pills?

360
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,685
- Your cellphone?
- Yeah, I got my cell.

361
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,395
Anything you need, just call.

362
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,024
Hm? And break a leg.

363
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,984
How about a hip?

364
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,320
Oh.

365
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,572
Here are your little blue pills.

366
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,574
- For what?
- Take them.

367
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:53,243
If opportunity knocks,

368
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,705
you'll want to rise to the occasion.

369
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:02,002
And inspirational cat posters
sure ain't gonna do the trick.

370
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,883
You and me?

371
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,593
Not gonna happen.

372
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,807
Now take a good look
at these four items on the screen.

373
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,393
Good morning, everyone.

374
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:22,439
I'd like to introduce
our newest resident, Mr. Claude Berenson.

375
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,483
Hi, Claude. I'm Alicia.

376
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,485
You can have a seat right there.

377
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,237
- There?
- No, in front.

378
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,321
Right.

379
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:34,243
So, Claude, we were just looking
at these four objects on the screen.

380
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,787
Did everyone get a good look?

381
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,705
Now, let's turn this off.

382
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,500
There we go.

383
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,378
How are we supposed
to remember them if we can't see them?

384
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,214
That's the whole point of the game.
It's a memory game.

385
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:54,721
So, Sarah, can you tell me
what object you saw on the screen?

386
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:58,183
A tennis racket.

387
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,145
- A bottle.
- Yeah.

388
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:04,398
Um...

389
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,777
- A TV set.
- Very good.

390
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,612
Claude.

391
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,614
Hm?

392
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:14,992
Do you remember
what the fourth object was?

393
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,077
Jell-O.

394
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,329
No, it wasn't Jell-O.

395
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:23,417
A clown
with a Richard Nixon false face on.

396
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,919
No.

397
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,963
Any other idea?

398
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,257
Yeah. A comb.

399
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,845
Very good, Claude. It was a comb!

400
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,647
You okay, Lillian?

401
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,317
Yes.

402
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,075
Can you pass me the salt?

403
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,043
One, two.

404
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,547
You're having way too much salt.

405
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:11,632
Hm-hm.

406
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:20,516
Mine.

407
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,143
This salt is mine.

408
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,273
Can you pass me the salt?

409
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,234
What, are you a record?

410
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,288
How are we doing here, hm?

411
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,915
Everything good?

412
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,586
He's had a third of the salt shaker.

413
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,340
Tom! You're not supposed to have the salt.

414
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,551
It doesn't work with your heart condition.

415
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:59,054
Heartbeat, heartbeat.

416
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,014
Not for long.

417
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,851
Everything okay, otherwise? Yeah?

418
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,519
- Yeah.
- Good.

419
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,000
"Good, my Lord.
I have remembrances for you."

420
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,336
"The fair Ophelia!
Nymph in thy orisons.

421
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,630
"Be all my sins remembered."

422
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,176
"How does your honor for this many a day?"

423
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,261
That was really good. Really, really good.

424
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,430
Lucy, I think we actually dropped a line.

425
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:44,057
It's like he had no idea I even existed

426
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,727
before this whole thing
with my douchebag dad.

427
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,188
That's because he didn't.

428
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,523
- Thanks.
- I'm just being honest.

429
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,859
You're not in his little theater gang.

430
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:54,985
I could be.

431
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,528
What are you gonna do?

432
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:59,448
Suddenly be the lead
in the school play with all of them?

433
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,200
Why is that so hard to imagine?

434
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:05,329
Oh, just face it. You and I have
been dorks since we were kids.

435
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,165
We're not popular. We're not losers.

436
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,083
We're just in the middle.

437
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,586
Yeah, well, maybe I'm sick
of being average.

438
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:18,008
Well, your parents' televised scandal
is certainly taking care of that.

439
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,685
She's a spy.

440
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:34,608
Don sent that bitch
to make sure I don't talk to anybody

441
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,944
about how he got that rezoning.

442
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:41,615
- She's not a real nurse, you know.
- Who?

443
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:43,992
Her!

444
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:47,371
Zephyr. But I won't be signing
that affidavit.

445
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,206
How are you doing, Miss Lillian?

446
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:53,502
Do you happen to know
what a breath mint is?

447
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:09,810
Hi.

448
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,481
Might I sit?

449
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,654
I'm Claude.

450
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,285
You don't remember me?

451
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,871
Claude Berenson.

452
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,041
I'm a theater critic.

453
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:37,588
I reviewed so many
of your fabulous performances.

454
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:41,508
I saw your Medea. That was magnificent.

455
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,636
Pure. Honest.

456
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:49,683
Your Blanche DuBois,
certainly the best I ever saw.

457
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,060
A lot of people think
it's the greatest Blanche

458
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,271
that anybody ever played.

459
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,903
Lily, it's me.

460
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,614
Claude.

461
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,174
See?

462
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,346
Are they your children?

463
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:32,059
No, that's you and me.

464
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,645
In 1978.

465
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,357
Shakespeare. Winter's Tale.

466
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,777
At the Palace Theater. In New York!

467
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,364
You don't remember that?

468
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:49,451
You remember who took the picture?

469
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:52,871
Sir John Gielgud was kind enough.

470
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:57,334
And then he invited
the whole cast to dinner.

471
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,753
You and I started talking.

472
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:04,675
And we really kind of
got into a conversation deep,

473
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,678
kind of started getting into each other

474
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,389
and, suddenly, we noticed
we were all by ourselves.

475
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,266
Everybody had gone home.

476
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:17,938
And then you and I went
to the Park Central Hotel

477
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,400
and we stayed all night.

478
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,778
We spent every night together.

479
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,948
Every night for weeks and weeks.

480
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,076
You don't remember that?

481
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,120
Yeah, it's me.

482
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,205
Oh, please, keep looking at me.

483
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:39,334
No, I'm the same guy.

484
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,295
I haven't changed.

485
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,299
I'm a little grumpier and more
of an asshole than I was before probably.

486
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,344
But I still have all the same passion.

487
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:54,057
And I care about you, Lily, still.

488
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,854
Hello.

489
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:08,197
I'm Claude. I have Alzheimer's.

490
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:11,325
Do you two know each other?

491
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,958
I don't remember things very well.

492
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,466
- Shane.
- <i>Haven't you killed yourself?</i>

493
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:31,345
Get over that, will you, please?
I have not killed myself.

494
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,348
- But I do need a couple of things.
- <i>Okay.</i>

495
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,725
- Get a pen.
- <i>Okay.</i>

496
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:42,064
Write it down. I need some lilies
and I need two Gershwin CDs.

497
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,149
<i>Well, why? Why?</i>

498
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,527
Because that's
her favorite music, okay?

499
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,198
Gershwin. Two of those CDs
and six bunches of flowers.

500
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,908
<i>Does she remember you?</i>

501
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:56,578
No, she doesn't remember me yet,
but I'm getting there.

502
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,374
I got to go.

503
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,171
Mr. Berenson, it's shower time.

504
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,340
What's a shower?

505
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,426
Claude, let's not play this game.

506
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,679
All right, get back there.
Get around the front.

507
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,431
I can do this.

508
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,141
I don't mind, sir. It's my job.

509
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:21,853
Come on, it's not your job. It's my job.

510
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,897
No, it's no trouble at all.

511
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,192
Just give me the brush.

512
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,237
- Okay.
- Out.

513
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,614
- All right.
- O-U-T means out.

514
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,784
I'll be back to check on you
in five minutes, sir.

515
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:42,498
<i>Oh, my darling</i>

516
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,877
<i>Oh, my darling, Clementine</i>

517
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,213
<i>You were lost and gone forever</i>

518
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:51,425
<i>Dreaded sorrow, Clementine</i>

519
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,844
<i>Oh, my darling</i>

520
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,639
<i>Oh, my darling, Clementine</i>

521
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:00,517
<i>You were lost and gone forever</i>

522
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:06,315
<i>Precious darling, Clementine</i>

523
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,199
You all sang so beautifully!

524
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,576
And, you, Donahue, you played marvelously.

525
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,578
Thank you!

526
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:24,208
And remember, next week,
there will be a magician coming!

527
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,377
I love magicians. They're so magical!

528
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,221
Wow, Lillian!

529
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,182
- Oh.
- These are so beautiful.

530
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:44,478
- What's that?
- They're lilies.

531
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,564
Peter really outdid himself.

532
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,572
Lily Blanche.

533
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,574
It's for me.

534
00:35:58,492 --> 00:35:59,826
Is it a note?

535
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,930
A CD. I'll play this.

536
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:25,644
"Doubt thou the stars are fire."

537
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,152
"Doubt thou the stars are fire."

538
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:40,659
<i>Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you</i>

539
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,328
<i>Embrace me</i>

540
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:48,542
<i>You irreplaceable you</i>

541
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,836
<i>Just one look at you</i>

542
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:55,591
<i>My heart grew tipsy in me</i>

543
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:58,093
<i>You and you alone</i>

544
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:03,140
<i>Bring out the gypsy in me</i>

545
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,979
<i>I love all the many charms about you...</i>

546
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:16,111
Are these your children?

547
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:21,074
Lily, no. They're, um...

548
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:22,743
They look happy.

549
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:24,912
They are.

550
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,997
They were.

551
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,458
They still can be.

552
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:37,674
They never really had
a lot of time together

553
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:44,139
because he was only near her
when her shows would come to New York.

554
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:48,143
And every night, they would stay together,

555
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:51,813
and he would take her
to the jazz clubs in the Village,

556
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:55,317
he would take her to nice restaurants.

557
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,904
She liked to go up to
the tall buildings, the skyscrapers.

558
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:02,324
And one night, they went to a club.

559
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:06,119
And the band leader knew him.

560
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,288
And all of a sudden,

561
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:13,502
they started playing
her favorite Gershwin song.

562
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,129
"Embraceable You."

563
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,384
"Embraceable You."

564
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:23,053
And she was ecstatic.

565
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:26,139
And then she went back

566
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:27,933
to be with her husband.

567
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,980
Every now and then,
he would just... Couldn't stand the fact

568
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,607
that he couldn't see her,
be with her, touch her.

569
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:39,611
One day, he summoned up enough courage

570
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:42,948
to ask her to run away with him.

571
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,952
And she wasn't surprised.

572
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,455
She wasn't surprised.

573
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,958
It was almost as if she expected it.

574
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,085
She said, "Give me some time.

575
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:59,173
"I have to go and explain to my husband.
I can't just tell him."

576
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,803
And then, she stopped writing.

577
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,433
Stopped taking his calls.

578
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,187
And he...

579
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:18,066
flew over to Paris

580
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,277
to see her.

581
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:23,572
To try to see her.

582
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:09,034
And so finally
he just threw in the towel.

583
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,870
He met another woman.

584
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,414
Another woman?

585
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,918
Yeah.

586
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:21,922
Just moved on.

587
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,092
Then, one day, came a letter.

588
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,845
And in the letter,

589
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:32,182
the key phrase was, "Doubt thou

590
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,853
"the stars are fire."

591
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:41,024
Shakespeare's most beautiful words.

592
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:45,654
Soon after that, the only stuff
he ever heard about her anymore

593
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:47,531
was what he read in the newspaper.

594
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,923
They seem happy.

595
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:42,503
<i>Embrace me, you irreplaceable you</i>

596
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:45,130
You, too, Rosie?
I cannot shake this damn song.

597
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,257
She can't stop playing it
in her room.

598
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,843
You're not getting paid to sing. Go. Work.

599
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:53,055
- Thank you. Bye.
- Don't be a naughty baby.

600
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,327
Are you sure you wanna do this?

601
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,745
What choice do I have?

602
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:00,706
It's either this or kill myself.

603
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,332
Why don't you just give it a minute?

604
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,210
The scandal will die down
and everyone at school will forget it.

605
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,212
I'm not waiting for this to blow over.

606
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:10,465
What am I supposed
to say when your parents call me?

607
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:13,010
Tell them what I told you.

608
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,179
I took a bus to New York.

609
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,433
I don't want you to go.

610
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:21,018
I'll be fine.

611
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:31,236
This place. Okay?

612
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:35,157
Yeah, it's better than okay. I like it.

613
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,909
It's much better than I thought.

614
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,870
Everybody's kind of...
There's no egos around.

615
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:44,750
And everybody's...
kind of laid back and calm.

616
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:47,044
- It makes me feel young.
- Hm.

617
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,843
They don't get on your nerves?

618
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,053
No.

619
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,597
Actually, it's the opposite.

620
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,935
We have kind of a...
I don't know, a camaraderie.

621
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,562
And it's kind of touching, actually.

622
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:08,815
Well, I guess you're all in the same boat.

623
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,859
We're certainly all in the same diapers.

624
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,739
Miss the family?

625
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,784
Not really.

626
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,411
I mean, I haven't heard from them

627
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,790
since I've been in so-called Spain.

628
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,500
You remember one day,

629
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,586
well, you were there several days,
when my daughter yells out at me,

630
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,132
"Don't forget, Daddy,
to carry your cellphone with you

631
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:36,552
"in case I need you."

632
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,595
Didn't mean shit. She never called.

633
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,390
Did you bring me something?

634
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:44,643
Yeah. Booze.

635
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:47,396
And some seasonings and spices.

636
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,816
You know, the food here sucks.

637
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:53,569
They make us eat a soup every day.

638
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,445
Tastes like the back of a stamp.

639
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,823
Well, that's what you get
for being a masochist.

640
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:03,704
So, any progress with Lillian?

641
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:08,500
Is she still not remembering
your resistible charms?

642
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,335
Not yet.

643
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,589
I'm working on her hard.

644
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,591
It is harder than I thought,

645
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:18,177
but we're getting more time together

646
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,514
and there is still a chemistry, trust me.

647
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:23,891
Is she here?

648
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:32,149
It's so good to see you
looking so much happier.

649
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,652
- Who's the fella?
- Her brother.

650
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:36,945
I love you.

651
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:45,579
- Oh. They must be close.
- Hmm.

652
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,917
- Well, yes.
- Hi, Peter.

653
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,585
How did you find her today?

654
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:56,215
A little more cheerful
than usual, actually.

655
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,968
Isn't she? It must be the flowers
you've been sending her.

656
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,596
Flowers? What flowers?

657
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,932
The lilies. That isn't you?

658
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:09,770
- Maybe your wife has a secret admirer.
- Well, she has plenty of fans.

659
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:12,523
Some of them even write
to our home address.

660
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:16,818
Those awful tabloid newspapers
are to blame.

661
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:20,113
- Well, I'll see you next week.
- Yes.

662
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:21,657
Bye, Peter.

663
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,701
"Your wife." She said, "Your wife."

664
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,453
I heard her perfectly.

665
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:27,746
I don't think I know you.

666
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:30,874
Stop! Did you know?

667
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,585
Why did you tell me he was dead?
How could you lie to me like that?

668
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:34,795
How could I tell you?

669
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,630
Every time you run a yellow light,

670
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:40,008
you go rushing
for a goddamn priest to confess it.

671
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,135
You would have never helped me,
would you have?

672
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:43,762
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

673
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:47,140
I insist you leave this place right away!

674
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:48,934
Can't you see what you're doing

675
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:52,062
is immoral, intrusive
and probably illegal?

676
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:55,941
I love her. Her husband does not love her.
Not like I do.

677
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,693
How the hell do you know
how much he loves her?

678
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:00,070
Because no husband
who really loves his wife

679
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:02,072
is gonna leave her in a dump like this

680
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,950
and only come see her twice a month!

681
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,036
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here.

682
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,454
Suit yourself.

683
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:13,834
But don't expect any more booze
or any more favors from me.

684
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:17,004
And I won't be making
any more monthly payments!

685
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:18,463
You're on your own.

686
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:23,927
I cannot be an accomplice
to this felony any longer.

687
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,972
You keep bragging about
your cross-eyed girlfriend, you know,

688
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:28,891
that had the wonderful laugh or smile

689
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,726
or I don't know what the hell it was.

690
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:33,187
I know now why she didn't ever kiss you.

691
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:49,828
Sorry about that, ma'am.

692
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:17,397
Ugh.

693
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:55,769
Are you sure?

694
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:58,397
I called the senior living place
and they confirmed it.

695
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,277
What were you doing at his house?

696
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:08,156
And why did you take your travel bags?

697
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,700
It doesn't matter.

698
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:12,661
I tried to call Shane,
but I didn't have his number.

699
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,664
How could he not tell me?

700
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:18,667
Maybe he didn't wanna upset you.

701
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,171
He's always like that.
He's always keeping things to himself.

702
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:25,090
But I don't understand. Alzheimer's?

703
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:27,843
He's always so sharp.

704
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:30,929
I realize
that this may sound a little harsh.

705
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,931
- But it kind of makes sense now.
- What?

706
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:37,352
Yeah, we all said he was getting
a little more ornery after Helen died,

707
00:49:37,436 --> 00:49:39,730
but the truth is
he was being very obnoxious,

708
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:42,441
at least with me, and I mean before the...

709
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:43,817
It doesn't matter.

710
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,280
He blamed me for global warming,
Selma, for Christ's sake.

711
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:54,828
But I guess it wasn't his fault,
you know? Poor guy.

712
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,665
That's it.

713
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:02,836
- Very good. I'll take one.
- Uh-huh.

714
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:06,798
It might be a bit of a shock
for him to see you,

715
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,885
so try to be not too disruptive.

716
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:12,012
Claude?

717
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,764
Look who's here.

718
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:18,644
Hey, Daddy.

719
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:29,446
You see? He's happy to see you.

720
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:32,658
You...

721
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,120
You're doing a jigsaw?

722
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,376
Are you sure you're okay here?

723
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:43,585
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

724
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,254
- Why?
- Well...

725
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:47,506
Are they treating you well?

726
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:50,092
- Yes.
- Okay.

727
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,970
Aren't you bothered by the other patients?

728
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,139
I mean, we know how you like your space.

729
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,100
No, they're fine.

730
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:01,186
You got to miss your home.

731
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,814
- Your library.
- Huh?

732
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,649
Your books. Don't you miss 'em?

733
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:07,317
What books?

734
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:11,780
We miss your cooking.

735
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:15,450
Okay, we're gonna come and we're
gonna bust you out of here one day,

736
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:18,662
take you back to our house
and you can destroy the kitchen.

737
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:19,872
- Huh, Tania?
- Yeah.

738
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,415
How's the food here?

739
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,709
- Good.
- Good?

740
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:26,837
Are you sure? You used
to badmouth five-star restaurants.

741
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,008
Stars? It's daytime.

742
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:36,638
You guys...
I'm gonna go see the supervisor.

743
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,184
Come on, Grandpa.

744
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:42,394
I don't understand.

745
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:46,231
A few weeks ago, he was lucid enough

746
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:48,442
to give me advice, just as he always did,

747
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:52,613
and he tells me that he's going on a trip

748
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:56,575
with his friend and they're winging it.

749
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:01,330
So now he's here with Alzheimer's.

750
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:03,790
Perhaps he was simply telling you

751
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:07,544
about a trip he made
with a friend many years ago.

752
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:14,301
Truth be told,
I've had some problems at home.

753
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:15,511
But it's not an excuse.

754
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:21,725
I hope you have the time
for your father now, Mrs. Addison,

755
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:26,438
because he's going to need
your attention and your affection

756
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,273
more than ever.

757
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,862
Nice and relaxing here, huh, Grandpa?

758
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:40,327
So what movies do you watch?

759
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:44,915
<i>No Country for Old Men?</i>

760
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:52,923
So what games do they have?

761
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,925
Not spin the bottle, I guess.

762
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,679
Card games? Dominoes?

763
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:01,849
Yeah?

764
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,819
You don't get half of what I say, do you?

765
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:22,327
What about books? Anything interesting?

766
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:29,126
God! No wonder you lose neurons here!

767
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:36,133
Don't worry, Grandpa.

768
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,051
I'm gonna smuggle in the good stuff.

769
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:41,555
Cognac?

770
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,140
Cognac?

771
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:46,852
There's the old Grandpa I know.

772
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:48,520
You want some cognac?

773
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,982
Old-time cognac.

774
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,609
Vintage.

775
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:02,576
You know, you kind of
ruined my plan to run away.

776
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:12,586
He barely recognized me.
He couldn't even name Tania.

777
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:15,964
Oh, no. What did the doctors say?

778
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:20,052
That it's Alzheimer's
and some sort of childhood regression.

779
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:21,929
Wow.

780
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,805
You know how he is about his books.

781
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,015
Yeah.

782
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:27,976
I remember one time I didn't return a book

783
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,187
and he put a rotten shrimp in my glovebox.

784
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:33,524
He probably doesn't even
remember them now.

785
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:35,400
Really?

786
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:39,321
He might not even remember me.

787
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:42,157
Or how much he hates me.

788
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,705
This is very nice. Very nice.

789
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:52,626
Hm-hm.
Our residents are very comfortable here.

790
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:56,713
Almost as if they were
in their own living room.

791
00:54:56,797 --> 00:55:00,384
Well, a lot of us would kill to have
a living room like this, Mrs. Marcos.

792
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:03,053
- Oh, thank you.
- Look at this natural light.

793
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:06,723
- This is beautiful. You think so?
- Yeah, absolutely.

794
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:08,642
Hey, cutie.

795
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:09,935
Who are you?

796
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,814
Well, I'm David. And who are you?

797
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,859
You know damn well who I am.

798
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:19,653
Don sent you to spy on me, didn't he?

799
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:22,155
Sarah, please.

800
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:25,033
I know there's a camera in that thing.

801
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:27,202
I'm sorry. Who?

802
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:31,248
Don! Tell him
to stick the affidavit up his ass.

803
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:35,752
Come on, Sarah. Leave Mr. Addison alone.

804
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:39,381
He came to see his father-in-law.

805
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:43,468
Claude?

806
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:48,432
Claude?

807
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:52,227
It's... Hey, whoa! Where are you going?

808
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:56,690
Remember me? How are you?
How are you doing in here, buddy?

809
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,776
Your son-in-law. David.

810
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:01,862
With a "D"?

811
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,698
David with a "D," yeah.

812
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:09,870
So you don't recognize me at all?

813
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,377
You always hated my guts.
You remember that?

814
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:22,591
I wanted to say that I'm very sorry
for what's happened to you.

815
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:27,721
You were a real pain in my ass,
but I never wanted to beat you this way.

816
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:31,683
I don't want your illness
to wipe my slate clean.

817
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:34,937
I want us to pick up
right where we left off.

818
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,064
Turn this whole thing around.

819
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:41,818
I want us to be a real family this time.

820
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:45,906
Selma's gonna forgive me, too.

821
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:52,329
Hello?

822
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:55,749
Worse comes to worst, I'll take Florida.

823
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:17,229
At the desk is a guy who's asking for you

824
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:21,024
and he looks very suspicious
and a bit dangerous.

825
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:22,651
God!

826
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:26,071
Thank you for the warning. Oh, God!

827
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,589
<i>At my request he would not.</i>

828
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:47,384
<i>Hermione, my dearest,
thou never spokest to better purpose.</i>

829
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:50,387
- <i>Never?</i>
- <i>Never, but once.</i>

830
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,223
<i>What! Have I twice said well?</i>

831
00:57:53,932 --> 00:57:55,392
<i>When was't before?</i>

832
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:59,062
<i>I prithee tell me,</i>

833
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:03,025
<i>cram's with praise
and make's as fat as tame things:</i>

834
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:05,694
<i>one good deed, dying tongueless,</i>

835
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:08,363
<i>slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</i>

836
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:11,033
<i>Our praises are our wages:</i>

837
00:58:11,116 --> 00:58:13,827
<i>you may ride's with one soft kiss</i>

838
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:21,168
<i>a thousand furlongs ere
with spur we beat an acre.</i>

839
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,836
<i>But to the goal.</i>

840
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:27,174
<i>My last good deed was to entreat his stay.</i>

841
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:29,259
<i>What was my first?</i>

842
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,053
<i>It has an elder sister...</i>

843
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,515
You used my dad for a PR stunt.

844
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:36,058
<i>That was not me, Selma.</i>

845
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,935
No. He'd never let you take that picture.

846
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:40,437
I swear on my mother's grave.

847
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:43,315
That had to be somebody
from the old-folks' staff.

848
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:47,402
You know they're underpaid, they see
the opportunity to make a few bucks.

849
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:50,030
That's the only explanation I can find.

850
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:53,951
I mean, I'm just
as pissed off as you, trust me.

851
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:56,161
You took advantage of him. It wasn't?

852
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:57,704
Is that your wife?

853
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,667
- We can sue them if you want.
- <i>No.</i>

854
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,127
I don't want any more publicity.

855
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:07,714
Uh...

856
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,009
Listen, I swear I had nothing to do
with it, and if you wanna sue them,

857
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:13,804
<i>I will call my lawyer immediately.</i>

858
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:26,984
To you.

859
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,868
Mom's putting on a pathetic show,

860
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,871
pretending everything is all right.

861
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:44,293
That your husband is boning whores
and you act like you don't know.

862
00:59:44,877 --> 00:59:47,045
As if all that isn't enough,

863
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:50,424
everyone at school knows.

864
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,011
They all laugh at me and...

865
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,014
Logan doesn't even know me and...

866
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:00,142
now you're like this.

867
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:04,813
I just wanna leave this town and...

868
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:07,566
You can't get upset at that, please.

869
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,444
But Dad wants us to go to Florida.

870
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:14,156
Why? Why would you go to Florida?

871
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,702
- To stay?
- Grandpa...

872
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:21,288
Are you understanding me?

873
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:23,081
Huh?

874
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:28,462
Grandpa, do you, like,
go in and out of Alzheimer's?

875
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:37,554
I don't have Alzheimer's, babe.

876
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:40,933
I faked my way into this place.

877
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:44,603
I've never had it
and I'm not gonna have it.

878
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:46,688
And I'm fine.

879
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:48,774
What?

880
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:51,193
Why would you do that?

881
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:56,240
Because there's someone
who needs me very much.

882
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,659
- Who?
- She was my first love.

883
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:04,373
And now she's here.

884
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,042
Here.

885
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,378
And she has Alzheimer's.

886
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:17,719
I don't know what to say. I mean...

887
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:21,557
So it was before Grandma?

888
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:25,394
Yes, way before Grandma.

889
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:27,563
Oh, God!

890
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:34,862
I need you to do us both a big favor.

891
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:37,030
What?

892
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:40,826
You have to keep this a secret.

893
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:44,580
Only if you promise
not to tell Mom and Dad

894
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:46,123
that I was trying to run away.

895
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:48,584
Deal?

896
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:50,752
Deal.

897
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:53,964
I'm so happy you have fake Alzheimer's.

898
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:59,845
I mean, it's incredibly weird
and possibly illegal, but... still.

899
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:05,517
A theater company comes
to put on a play for the residents.

900
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:07,144
- Really?
- Yeah.

901
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:09,897
And I'm making sure it's a specific one.

902
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,025
This one.

903
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:14,818
Ah.

904
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:16,486
<i>The Winter's Tale.</i>

905
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,199
That was
Lillian's greatest performance ever.

906
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,367
And there's my plan.

907
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,454
Your plan? For what?

908
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,373
To make her try and remember me.

909
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:33,629
"My dearest Claude.

910
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:36,798
"I am writing to you

911
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:41,970
"more hastily than I would like
and you deserve,

912
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:47,392
"as the little time I have
between rehearsals

913
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:50,312
"is filled with interviews

914
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:53,941
"for radio stations and the press.

915
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:59,112
"And this only adds to my frustration

916
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:01,990
"for not having you here with me

917
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:04,743
"because everything,

918
01:03:04,826 --> 01:03:09,915
"absolutely everything reminds me of you.

919
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:14,127
"You know what?

920
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:18,507
"I've come to the cafe
where we always meet

921
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:21,468
"when you come to Paris."

922
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:23,512
Paris!

923
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,222
Hmm.

924
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,641
"Apart from my Earl Grey,

925
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:30,143
"I've ordered the cognac...

926
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:37,150
"...you usually have after your coffee.

927
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:42,239
"So when I put my lips on the glass,

928
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:48,453
"I try to feel
that I'm putting them to yours,

929
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:52,457
"the only place where my lips
really feel alive,

930
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:57,129
"capable of igniting my whole body.

931
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:02,801
"So, you see, I look for you

932
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:07,139
"even in the most impossible places...

933
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:12,728
"...in every shadow, in my dreams,

934
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:15,189
"in every theater stall.

935
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:19,318
"And I feel like I'm glowing,

936
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:22,070
"not from the lines I recite

937
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:25,490
"or the spotlights all around me,

938
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:28,493
"but from the strength I get

939
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:32,748
"from knowing that you are thinking of me,

940
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,375
"reading me,

941
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:39,838
"listening to me, feeling me.

942
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:44,510
"Please, come very soon.

943
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:49,306
"All my love, Lily."

944
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:04,196
This letter is for you, isn't it?

945
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:06,823
- Yes.
- You are Claude.

946
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,038
And her name is Lillian.

947
01:05:14,373 --> 01:05:15,541
Lily.

948
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:18,919
Hmm.

949
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:23,257
Is that why you spend
so much time with me?

950
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:26,260
Because I remind you of her?

951
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,011
That's exactly why.

952
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:29,346
Ah.

953
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:32,891
And why can't you be with her?

954
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:35,561
She was married.

955
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:38,772
I don't think she ever...

956
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:44,403
ever wanted to get a divorce.

957
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,574
She chickened out.
I hate people who chicken out.

958
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,165
Oh!

959
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:12,306
Lily, come on. Let's go. It's raining.

960
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:13,974
Let's go inside.

961
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:17,477
Claude, come on! It's raining!

962
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,938
- Come inside!
- I like the rain.

963
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:23,192
Come on. Let's go inside.

964
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:44,880
Hey, why don't you ask Logan
and his gang of theater geeks?

965
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:47,716
- I don't wanna interrupt his clique.
- Oh, why not?

966
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,551
They all seem so lovely.

967
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:52,262
What is she wearing now?
Like, what is that?

968
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:56,225
She is so lame! Like her dad.

969
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:57,935
Oh, my God. Don't turn around.

970
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:01,230
I said don't turn around!

971
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:03,023
He's coming over here.

972
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,403
- Hey.
- Hey.

973
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:10,405
Yeah, hey.

974
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:15,369
I just wanted
to apologize about my friends.

975
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:17,871
They can be idiots.

976
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,832
Oh, we didn't even notice anything.

977
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:23,043
Sorry to interrupt.

978
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,878
Hey.

979
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:26,463
You do acting, right?

980
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:30,384
I've been in a couple of plays, yeah.

981
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:34,847
Yeah, we saw you in Our Town
and you were amazing.

982
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,557
Thank you.

983
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,686
Anyway, Tania wanted
to ask you something.

984
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:46,859
Yes?

985
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:52,322
What's going on with Florida?

986
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,867
I don't know.
Dad's still campaigning for us to go.

987
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:59,121
And Mom isn't putting up
much of a fight, so...

988
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,456
She never even mentioned it to me.

989
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,168
That's because she thinks
you have Alzheimer's, Grandpa.

990
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:05,919
Oh.

991
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:09,464
I found a theater company.
Everything's taken care of.

992
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:10,674
- Really?
- Yeah.

993
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:15,179
- Which one?
- Oh, well, a very special one.

994
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:16,971
- You'll see.
- Spare no expense.

995
01:08:17,055 --> 01:08:20,350
Props, costumes, lighting.

996
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:22,394
The whole proscenium.

997
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,313
Their <i>Winter's Tale</i>
will give you goosebumps.

998
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,986
All right. Bye.

999
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,823
Sorry, guys. The gig's off.

1000
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:39,703
I just got a call
from Longwood Nursing Home

1001
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:42,872
and they're cancelling due
to general illness of the audience.

1002
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:46,251
Food poisoning, apparently.

1003
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:48,462
We'll have to reschedule.

1004
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:01,975
"She's a bed-swerver,

1005
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:04,853
"even as bad as those
that give bold'st titles."

1006
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:08,273
"Ay, and privy to this their late escape."

1007
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,026
"No, by my life, privy to none of this."

1008
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:12,861
What do you think?

1009
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:15,029
- Better. That was better.
- You like it?

1010
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:27,376
We're the theater company
here for the play.

1011
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:29,545
- That way.
- Thank you.

1012
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:32,506
"I know it too well.

1013
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,758
"Give me the boy.

1014
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:36,301
"I'm glad you did not nurse him,

1015
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:38,220
"though he does bear some signs of me."

1016
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:40,305
"What is this? Sport?"

1017
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:42,890
"Bear the boy hence.
He shall not come about her.

1018
01:09:42,975 --> 01:09:46,937

She's not an adulteress! She's a spy!

1022
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:02,411
Don't think you can fool me.

1023
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:05,205
- Can't you ever shut up, madam?
- I'm so sorry.

1024
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:09,084
- It's important.
- You think everybody's a spy.

1025
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,837
And stop wearing that tacky green shirt!

1026

Now, please.

Is he a part of the show?

1030
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:25,976
Well, he is now.

01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:46,139
"Polixenes...

1051
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,309
"Polixenes for Leontes.

1052
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:51,728
"Oh, thou thing

"More?

1060
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,164
"She's a traitor."

1061
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:19,214
"No! By my life!

1062
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,800
"Privy to none of this!

"till heavens look

"My women, come.

01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:00,649
"You have leave."

1086
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:32,347
Claude.

1087
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:37,102
I've missed you so much.

1088
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:42,316
Oh, my Claude.

1089
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,238
You are so beautiful.

1090
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:02,044
Hmm.

1091
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,526
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Whoa!

1092
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:27,152
Oh, my God!

1093
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:34,368
- Where is she?
- Who?

1094
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:43,168
<i>My sweet embraceable you</i>

1095
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:45,712
<i>Embrace me</i>

1096
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:50,717
<i>You irreplaceable you</i>

1097
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:53,303
<i>Just one look at you</i>

1098
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:58,100
<i>My heart grew tipsy in me</i>

1099
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:00,519
<i>You and you alone</i>

1100
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:05,941
<i>Bring out the gypsy in me</i>

1101
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:12,030
<i>I love all the many charms about you</i>

1102
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:19,079
<i>Above all I want my arms about you</i>

1103
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:24,501
<i>Don't be a naughty baby</i>

1104
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:30,674
<i>Come to pappa, come to pappa do</i>

1105
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:36,722
<i>My sweet embraceable you</i>

1106
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:43,145
Mr. Berenson? Mrs. Blanche?

1107
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:44,479
Lily?

1108
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:15,093
Hi, baby.

1109
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,018
The new tests show
no sign of Alzheimer's or dementia.

1110
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:26,939
In fact, your mental faculties
are impeccable.

1111
01:17:29,066 --> 01:17:31,193
I'm well. I'm not ill.

1112
01:17:31,276 --> 01:17:32,778
Does that make you happy?

1113
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:35,072
Yeah, I'm happy.

1114
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:41,161
So am I, Claude,
but Alzheimer's is nothing to joke about.

1115
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:45,165
When did you hear me
joke about Alzheimer's? Never.

1116
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:49,253
I just said
I didn't wanna wear a diaper. I hate it.

1117
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:53,507
Now, I don't know what plans
you and your family have,

1118
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:58,428
but I'm afraid you won't be permitted
to stay here any longer.

1119
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:02,432
Well, but what about Lillian?
I love her and she loves me.

1120
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:05,102
She has a loving husband,

1121
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:07,938
who probably won't like
romantic overtures.

1122
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:12,317
But we would be playing with fire
if we let you stay.

1123
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:15,279
I hope you understand.

1124
01:18:15,821 --> 01:18:17,573
That's all I have to say.

1125
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:21,326
Thanks, Ms. Marcos, for everything.

1126
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:28,250
I don't want you to go.

1127
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,961
Thank you.

1128
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:34,965
And you and I both know
you're a lot smarter than people think.

1129
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:36,425
You know.

1130
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:41,847
Come on.

1131
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:44,224
Oh.

1132
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:48,437
My most fond memory here

1133
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:52,441
is the fact that you could
flat-out play the guitar.

1134
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:09,166
Know how special you are.

1135
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:12,169
Okay?

1136
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:26,016
- Well, sir.
- Sir.

1137
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:27,935
My guardian angel.

1138
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,693
Where are you going?

1139
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:42,241
My daughter and my granddaughter

1140
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:45,285
need to spend time with me.

1141
01:19:47,412 --> 01:19:48,956
You have a daughter?

1142
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:03,637
That's good.

1143
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:27,369
I will love you

1144
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:32,124
as long as I live.

1145
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:44,469
"Doubt thou the stars are fire."

1146
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:52,728
"Doubt that

1147
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:55,772
"the sun does move."

1148
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:07,618
Mom's not gonna say it, so...

1149
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:10,495
I was wondering
if we could stay here for a while.

1150
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:12,664
- Please.
- Book it.

1151
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,082
- Book it?
- Yes, ma'am.

1152
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:18,545
- I'll talk to your receptionist.
- Any day you want. 24/7, 365.

1153
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:21,298
Whatever it is.
I got the spare bedroom, two beds.

1154
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:24,635
They're all made up and they're
just waiting for a mom and daughter!

1155
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:25,761
How about that?

1156
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:27,429
Good. You said you were gonna cook?

1157
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:28,555
Uh...

1158
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,724
- I love this hotel!
- It's on you, Grandpa.

1159
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:32,142
This is the best hotel ever.

1160
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:35,062
You mean I have to cook all the meals?

1161
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,526
I almost lost her once.

1162
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,529
Did everything I could to make her stay.

1163
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:47,324
You got the best out of me.

1164
01:21:48,325 --> 01:21:50,577
I was surprised that she did stay.

1165
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:52,746
But this time,

1166
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:57,084
there's nothing I can do.

1167
01:21:57,835 --> 01:22:01,129
This time, I just couldn't stand aside.

1168
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:03,131
I know.

1169
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:05,634
And I'm grateful to you

1170
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:09,012
for brightening up her days.

1171
01:22:10,138 --> 01:22:13,225
This time and back then.

1172
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,983
You can come and visit her
any time you want.

1173
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,778
What you just did for me

1174
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:29,658
is the nicest thing
anyone will ever do for me in my life.

1175
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:31,952
I wanna thank you.

1176
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:35,289
Thank you so much.
Okay, who have we got next?

1177
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:37,791
Daniel. Danny. Okay.

1178
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:39,960
You ready, Danny?

1179
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,296
You're not nervous?

1180
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:45,883
Too bad my grandpa's girlfriend
isn't here to feed me lines.

1181
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:48,594
You don't need her.

1182
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:50,971
You're a natural.

1183
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:54,224
I wish I could have seen her
on stage in her heyday.

1184
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:55,601
She was beautiful.

1185
01:22:58,604 --> 01:23:00,522
- Wanna read lines?
- Yeah.

1186
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:06,111
"Doubt thou the stars are fire,

1187
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:08,572
"doubt that the sun doth move,

1188
01:23:08,655 --> 01:23:14,244
"doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love."

1189
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:37,267
- Do you want to read lines again?
- Yeah.

1190
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:51,782
Oh, my God.

1191
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:54,451
Look at you. You look fabulous.

1192
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:55,661
As do you.

1193
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,456
- Fosamax?
- Nope!

1194
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:02,251
- Diclofenac?
- Nope!

1195
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:09,800
- You dirty bastard.
- Hmm.

1196
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:14,137
Jesus! Let's have a toast to that.

1197
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:16,598
- Oh, here. Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1198
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:18,350
- Coffee.
- Some coffee.

1199
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:21,270
Mmm.

1200
01:24:22,312 --> 01:24:23,522
So, how are you doing?

1201
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:25,816
Sliding by.

1202
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:29,611
Sliding? You, sliding is good.

1203
01:24:29,695 --> 01:24:32,656
- Sliding works.
- Hm-hm. Seems to.

1204
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:34,908
- Eighty years.
- Uh-huh.

1205
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:37,411
- Still sliding.
- Yeah.
