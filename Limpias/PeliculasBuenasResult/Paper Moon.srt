
say it only a paper moon
sailing over a cardboard sea
but it wouldnt
be make-believe
if you believed in me
yes it only a canvas sky
hanging over a cotton tree
but it wouldnt
be make-believe
if you believed in me
without your love
it a honky-tonk parade
without your love
it a melody played
in a penny arcade
it a barnum and bailey world
just as hollow as it can be
but it wouldnt
be make-believe
if you believed in me
rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
let the water and the blood
from thy wounded
side which flowed
be of sin the double cure
safe from wrath
and make me pure
judge me oh lord
for i have lost
in mine integrity
i have trusted also in the lord
therefore i shall not slide
examine me oh
lord and prove me
try my reins and my heart
for thy loving kindness
is before mine eyes
and i have walked in thy truth
i have not sat with evil persons
neither will i go
in with dissemblers
i will wash mine hands
in innocency
so will i compass
thine altar o lord
that i may publish with
the voice of thanksgiving
and tell of all thy
wondrous works
