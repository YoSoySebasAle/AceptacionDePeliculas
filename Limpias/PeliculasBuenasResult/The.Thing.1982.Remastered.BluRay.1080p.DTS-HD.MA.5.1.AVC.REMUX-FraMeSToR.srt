its own cells to imitate them
this for instance that not dog

so how do we know who human
if i was an imitation
a perfect imitation
how would you know
if it was really me
is there some kind of test doc
well yeah possibly
ive been thinkin
about a blood serum test
garry  what that
we could take a sample
of each person blood
could mix it with
uncontaminated blood
i suppose if there a reaction
wed know who isnt human
weve got whole blood in storage
start working on it
keep an eye on clark
he was close to that dog
yeah yeah
mac we need blair help

somebody opened it
closed it and then locked it
great
who got access to it

and i got the only key
would that test have worked doc
oh i think so yes
norris  somebody else
sure as hell thought so
well who else couldve used that key
nobody i just give it to
copper whenever he needs it
could anybody have
gotten it from you doc
i dont see how as soon as im
finished i return it right away
great
fuchs  when was the
last time you used it
copper  a day or so ago i guess
i suppose somebody
could have lifted it off me
oh come on
that key ring of yours is always
hooked to your belt
shouting
accusing everybody
stop it it aint worth it
copper the only one
who got any business with it

garry you dont want to hurt anybody
right
on the floor

feel a little easier if
if somebody else was in charge
norris i cant see anybody
objecting to you
im sorry fellas
but im not up to it
ill take it
like hell you will
it should be somebody a little
more even-tempered childs
scoffs
all right
wind gusting
flame bursting
i know im human
and if you were all these things
then youd just attack me right now
so some of you are still human
this thing doesnt
want to show itself
it wants to hide inside an imitation
itll fight if it has to
but it vulnerable out in the open
if it takes us over
then it has no more enemies
nobody left to kill it
and then it won
there a storm
hitting us in six hours

from the helicopter
the smart sob put it
together piece by piece
where was he tryin to go
any place but here
nauls  hey you guys come here
come here
i think i saw childs outside
the main entrance of the camp
what he doin outside
i dont know
got a flare
he got back inside
and blew the generator
in six hours itll be
a hundred below in here
well that suicide
not for that thing
it wants to freeze now
it got no way outta here
it just wants to go to sleep in the
cold until the rescue team finds it
what can we do what can we do
whether we make it or not
we cant let that thing freeze again
maybe well just warm things
up a little around here
were not gettin outta here alive
but neither is that thing
generator room
explosion
the generator gone
any way we can fix it
it gone macready
panting  all right
we gotta bring this whole
place right down into the ice
garry plant yours
in the old storage room
nauls down by the generator
clicking
ah god
moaning
gurgling
gurgling stops
how it comin in there
i said how it
growling
chattering
growls
roaring
roaring continues
yeah fuck you too
screeching
you the only one who made it
not the only one
did you kill it
where were you childs
thought i saw blair
i went out after him and
got lost in the storm
chuckles
fire got the temperature
up all over the camp
wont last long though
neither will we
how will we make it
maybe we shouldnt
if youre worried about me
if weve got any surprises
for each other
i dont think were in much
shape to do anything about it
well what do we do
why dont we just
wait here for a little while
see what happens
grunts
both chuckle
