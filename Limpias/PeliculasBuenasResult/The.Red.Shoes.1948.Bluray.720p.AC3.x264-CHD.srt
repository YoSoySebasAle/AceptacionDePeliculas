theyre going mad sir
it the students
all right let them in
swine
beasts
into the valley of death
into the jaws of hell
rode the 600
hey hey ease up
youre sitting on my cloak
something up down below
not a sausage
ah here you are terry
thank you
i cant see him anywhere
programs
oh two please
one here thanks pal
quite a turnout down below
old palmer music
had better be good
boronskaja wouldnt dance
the leading role if it wasnt
boro who
who exactly is boronskaja
since youve stood in a queue for
six hours waiting to see her dance
not to see anybody to hear
have you ever heard
of professor palmer
never
you will
the program says heart of fire
music by andrew palmer
our professor
boro-what-her-name best be good
she hardly likely
to be anything else
there he is palmer
livy
come on livy
we know him
do you remember
my cytherean rhapsody
forget it
that it your rhapsody
it must be an accident
did you show him
i show him all my work
you think he lifted it
shh
she a great patron of the arts
vicky vicky
vicky
lermontov coming
i say that yours too isnt it
yes
steady old boy
well what are you waiting for
shh
please do you mind
oh really
dear professor were very proud of
you i hope youre proud of yourself
youre too kind monsieur lermontov
we meet the great man at last
enchant madame
i never imagined id succeed
in getting you here
i must be a very clever woman
if some fat harridan
is going to sing i must go
i cant bear amateurs
neither can lady neston
what do you mean
she has a niece who dances
professionally
hello professor
now please dont get up
mr lermontov
now are you prepared for a surprise
do you mean a surprise or a shock
well to take the plunge
ive asked my niece to dance tonight
what would you call that
a shock
oh well
youre certainly very candid
you know mr lermontov
i wouldnt dream of boring you
with the performance of an amateur
my niece has been dancing leading
roles for some time now
the critics think highly of her work
how would you define ballet
lady neston
wellone might call it
the poetry of motion perhaps or
one might but for me
it is a great deal more
for me it is a religion
and one doesnt really care
to see one religion practised
in an atmosphere such as this
i hope you understand
attractive brute
ill have a champagne cocktail
yes sir
champagne cocktail please
yes madam
do you know at parties everybody
is supposed to be very happy
but perhaps you dislike them
as much as i do
still i think
it might have been worse
do you
it very nearly was much worse
oh
thank you
we were to be treated
to a little dancing exhibition
but now were to be spared
that horror
mr lermontov i am that horror
mmm
it a bit late for apologies
yes a little late i think
im sorry im terribly sorry
but youre not sorry
i didnt dance are you
may i ask why
because my dear miss
victoria page
miss page if i accept
an invitation to a party
i do not expect to find myself
at an audition
yes youre quite right
why do you want to dance
why do you want to live
well i dont know exactly why
but uhi must
that my answer too
come with me
where to
were going to talk
but i dont want to talk to you
dont worry ill do the talking
can i see
mr lermontov now please
what is it dimitri
a young man called craster
he been here a hundred times
ive told him youre asleep
he will not believe me
either youre a bad liar
or he a man of good sense
show him in and serve breakfast
mr craster
what can i do for you mr craster
im sorry to bother you
mr lermontov
but it a matter
of great importance to me
yes
i wrote you a letter a silly letter
id like to have it back
before you read it
i see
that the one
unfortunately mr craster
i have already read this letter
oh
mr lermontov please
you are professor palmer pupil
you say youve written a
string quartet and a piano concerto
yes
very interesting
would you care to play me something
something of your own i mean
of course ifif you wish it
this is a study
i wrote for the piano
but im thinking of orchestrating it
and putting it into an opera
im working on
but are you finished already
it was very interesting
hope i havent ruined your breakfast
by the way
i need a new coach for the orchestra
would the idea interest you
would itinterest
i shouldnt be able to pay much
8 a week and expenses
it would be absolutely marvellous
get some breakfast
and come over to covent garden
thank you
and your letter mr craster
if you take my advice
youll destroy it immediately
and forget about it
the heart of fire
is your work isnt it
these things happen unintentionally
i know that why
that why it is worth remembering
that it is much more disheartening
to have to steal
than to be stolen from hmm

cloudy stormy night #

boronskaja at last
and today she only
43 minutes late
am i supposed to congratulate
myself on that
i tell you irina
my patience is at an end
i shall go to lermontov
and explain to him
how no theatre is big enough
to hold both you and me
i might as well start packing
oh there no hurry he might choose
to dispense with my services
he is quite crazy enough
but if we go we go together
grischa darling promise
coo buschka
who are you
victoria page
i expect mr lermontov
has spoken about me
he invited me here
no this is too much
he invites them i teach them
i get rid of them he forgets them
and now unhappy girl
please go to the far corner of the
stage where youll meet five others
to whom mr lermontov has also
extended his hospitality
quiet please
i want to rehearse the first act
of heart of fire
will everybody not concerned
leave the stage please
right-o boys
set act one hurry
is that so well i agree
where are you going my dear
im going to talk to mr lermontov
wouldnt it be better to wait
until after rehearsal
oh no you see
i know him personally
ah well that makes
all the difference of course
ratov
yes boris
stay where you are ill come up
good morning mr lermontov
good morning ratov
we must do something
about this piece
the girls have hardly room to move
ljubov was right
aha ljubov
ljubov is always right
do you really think so
yes
well well well then take it away
take it away
well you see my dear
mr lermontov is a very busy man
now why dont you go and wait
over there with the others
ivan are you ready
yes i will
sergei sergeievitch
yes
are you acquainted with the
works or person of julian craster
composer and conductor
no
nor i
which proves how sadly
we lag behind the times
for here he is in our midst
lermontov has engaged him
this morning
rond de jambe e
class dismissed
no gentlemen figure 29 sing
i think that will do
thank you gentlemen
the brass could do with
your attention craster tomorrow
gentlemen im very sorry to bring
you here so early
but ive been in front
for this ballet more than once
and i really must
there are one or two things
i really must put right
so um heart of fire
overture please
from the beginning
oh by the way trumpets
at two bars before figure two
have you got an e natural
no ive got an e flat
ah makes all the difference
should be e natural
right from the beginning
i know it hard
to get your lips set this early
but we ought to be able
to come in together
even more pianissimo less strings
a oboe
from the beginning please
that nice
mr craster
what is going on
have you taken leave of your senses
do you realise that by calling
the orchestra early we must pay them
and why are you rehearsing
heart of fire
did i ever ask you to do that
tell me im interested
im sure mr lermontov
will be interested too
well
i like it
you like it you must also like the
national anthem and the marseillaise
i hope you wont summon
the full orchestra at dawn
to practise those noble melodies
i leave this young man to you
lermontov
after all he is your discovery
not mine
mr craster i must ask you
to exercise in future
a little more control
over your natural ambitions
and why youve chosen heart of fire
for this early-morning escapade
good morning gentlemen
is a mystery
i shall never hope to solve
may i see that wrong note
in the score please
hmm however
there are passages in heart of fire
which no one need be ashamed of
thank you mr lermontov
good morning miss page
good morning edmund
is lord oldham with you

# swan lake
good morning my dear young ladies
i hope i find you all very well
there are one or two things
i would like to say
as you know the ballet
leaving saturday for paris
i cant imagine anything more
enchanting than inviting all of you
but im afraid this pleasure
must be denied me
to those whom we must
regretfully leave behind
id like to say just this -
please dont be discouraged
the fact that we cant take you
doesnt mean that youre bad dancers
it just means that
we havent got enough room
please step out miss faye
miss banes
miss hardiman and miss laughlin
yes
i thank you four ladies for
the hard work youve done this year
mr ljubov echoes my gratitude
mmmm
maybe next year we shall
meet you again good morning
vicky he means us
listen mes amis
i am fiance i get married
my dear child
all my love and best wishes
for your happiness
i wish you the greatest happiness
with your new partner
merci grischa where is grischa
im here irina
darling do you hate me
i could never hate you irina
but how can i ever forgive you
you will forgive me that i know
dont quarrel with your husband
as much as me
where is boris lermontov
he has nothing to say to me
boris
he hasno heart that man
entrez
mr craster i have a job for you
good
do i understand you have not been
altogether very happy with us so far
well i
well what
coaching an orchestra is not exactly
a young composer dream is it
im afraid the job i have may not be
a young composer dream either
still i hope you do not consider it
entirely unworthy of your talent
the ballet of the red shoes is from
a fairy tale by hans andersen
pair of red shoes
oh i beg your pardon
the ballet of the red shoes is from
a fairy tale by hans andersen
it is the story of a girl
who is devoured by an ambition
to attend a dance
in a pair of red shoes
she gets the shoes goes to the dance
and at first she very happy
at the end of the evening
she gets tired and wants to go home
but the red shoes
are not tired
in fact the red shoes
are never tired
they dance her out into the streets
over the mountains and valleys
through fields and forests
through night and day
time rushes by love rushes by
life rushes by
but the red shoesdance on
what happens in the end
in the end she dies
yes i remember
the music is by felipe beltran
he did it for us last year
during our south american tour
youll find some passages marked with
a blue pencil they are bad
i would like to see what you can do
in the way of a little rewriting
oh
you can take your time
there no hurry
thank you
on vous attend
oui je viens
thank you
ah look at our boronskaja
she in wonderful form tonight
im not interested in boronskaja
form any more
nor with any prima ballerina
imbecile enough to get married
oh come now boris
she out finished
you cannot have it both ways
the dancer who relies upon the
doubtful comforts of human love
will never be a great dancer
never
that is all very pure and fine
but you cant alter human nature
no i think you can do
even better than that
you can ignore it
boris
adieu
well irina
now youll be able to sleep
as long as you like
and eat sweets all day
and go to parties every night
and you now you will be calm
the class will start on time
no more shouting no more
hysteria backstage no more
no moreirina
oh monsieur lermontov
miss page
are you very tired
yes thank you
i mean im not very tired
monsieur je vous prsente
miss victoria page
monsieur boudin
le directeur gnral de lopra

bon soir mademoiselle
montez mademoiselle
you look dressed up
for a conference
hello is there a conference on
yes theyre all arguing
ive been here since seven
there you are miss page
will you come in here please
i was just going out mr lermontov
when i got your message
miss page
ive asked you to come here tonight
because were preparing a new ballet
and ive decided
to give you a chance
and let you dance
the principal part in it
but there one thing
i must tell you at once
my belief in your possibilities
is not shared by my colleagues here
however it is hardly
necessary for me to add
that whatever their personal belief
they will all give you their best
the rest of course is up to you
well miss pagethat all
we shall start work
early tomorrow morning
i suggest you forget all about
your party and go home to bed
yes i will
and miss page
good luck
thank you
well what happened
ive got a part in a new ballet
new what ballet
the red shoes
now listen to this it impossible
well i couldnt rewrite
that bit could i
why not
you didnt blue-pencil it
horrors like that
speak for themselves
in fact i had some ideas about that
where are they dear fellow
we need a score
if youll allow me
well it the church scene
get rid of this sentimental hymn
and take a four-square chorale
something like this
then i thought all the way through
a church bell coming in
all this on the strings
then as the priest appears
the brass
shall i play you
the dance of the red shoes
thank you mr craster thank you
i want you to change everything
i want a new score
there you are mr lermontov
and where the orchestration
when do you want it
yesterday
you wanted to work go home and work
i dont want to see you
till it done
you wont
why arent you in bed
oh you gave me quite a fright
i meant to
why arent you in bed
i was much too excited to sleep
so here i am
are you i havent seen you
thank you
by the way
you havent seen me either
has he sent you to bed too
no
im just working on the score
of my new ballet the red shoes
is that my ballet too
yes i suppose it is
i wonder what it feels like
to wake up in the morning
and find oneself famous
youre not likely to know
if you stay here talking much longer
so good luck
good luck
she putting too much into it
why dont you tell her grischa
mind your own business
she has the dance with me and
the dance at the fair earlier
and the big stuff coming up
she cant dance everything full out
she ought to know that
how do you expect her to know it
if you never danced full out
before opening night
here are the designs
for the costumes boris
one moment
sit down will you please
im so sorry something
has to be done about the music
she starts the pirouette early
the tempo wrong it too fast
it the right tempo
of course once more
shell be all right
i hope so
still unconverted sergei
well of course
she a charming girl but
i know nothing about her charms
but they wont wait till the end
theyll applaud in the middle
come now
sergei ill take a bet
oh enough enough
miss page we are trying to create
something of beauty
while you wave your arms
like a scarecrow
and bend your knees
like an old cart horse
we are unlikely to succeed
well wellit a bet
come let me see your sketches
the girl
you still think i can do it
well at the moment you look as if
you find it difficult
but when we open in two weeks
i hope itll be supremely simple
dont forget
the great impression of simplicity
can only be achieved by a great agony
of body and spirit
voil
you dont want to ruin
your breathing do you
from today
youll lunch in my office
craster
will you sit over there please
merci mr craster the piano
do you usually have musical
accompaniment to your meals
no miss page i do not
im afraid this is your fate
for the next two weeks
mr craster is going to play
the red shoes music
at every lunch tea and dinner
you take until we open
i see
yes in this way you should become
quite familiar with the music
yes i think i probably shall
the music is all that matters
nothing but the music
mr craster
certainly
bon apptit
votre service mademoiselle
some composers specialise in
lunchtime music dont they
some
you
in my time
do you mind not playing that
it the right tempo
let take the ballroom scene
that the most digestible
part of the score
the ballroom been cut
cut as a scene but it still there
in my score
i wrote this dance for a ballroom
anyone who understands anything
about music will see a ballroom
even lermontov will see a ballroom
even you
and when youre lifted
into the air by your partner
my music will transform you
into what
a flowerswaying in the wind
a clouddrifting in the sky
a white birdflying
tell that to ratov
he would love
your birds and flowers
you dont
if you were a dancer youd know
just a minute
# nothing matters but the music #
it hard enough
to get off the ground anyway
without being a bird or flower
wont you imagine anything
on the first night
yes a wall between me
and the audience
my music will pull you through it
hee-haw
miss page im not a circus conductor
and youre not a horse
it too fast
you would not find it too fast
if youd let the slow passage end
before you start your pirouette
my downbeat marks a pause
we understand it
dont we gentlemen
you come in on the second beat
impossible
one two tia tia
it quite simple
you see this baton
yes
well follow it
good luck
good luck
vicky vicky
dance whatever tempo you like
ill follow you
all right ivan
time to go down craster
good luck
thank you
nervous
no
do i
what the devil have you
got to worry about
it a fine score
a magnificent score i only wish i
go on
grischa
it chaos chaos chaos
grischa
ah boris
mon dieu the red shoes
what
the red shoes are not there
rideaut
monsieur
where are they
you havent hidden them yourself
no no no

somebody must hold it
but who

hell have nothing to do
dimitri
give it to me hold the door
best of luck miss page
i cant remember my entrance
you think you cant
what about this
that it it all right
when i hear the music
since you undoubtedly
will hear the music
it undoubtedly
going to be all right
the music is all that matters
nothing but the music
if i had any doubts
about you id be nervous
am i nervous
no
youre not dancing for an audience
youre dancing for
ljubov ratov myself
people youve danced for
many times before
i believed in you
from the very beginning
but now everybody does
dance tonight with the same ecstasy
ive seen in you only once before
at the mercury theatre
yes at the mercury theatre
in london
on a wet saturday afternoon
40 seconds
coming
good luck my dear
youre the magician to have produced
this in three weeks from nothing
a magician cant produce
a rabbit from a hat
if there isnt already
a rabbit in the hat
it a pity the theatre
only holds 300
we could have filled
the albert hall tonight
but what were creating tonight
the world will talk of tomorrow
good boy
rideau

i mean the head
all that clapping bravos roses

seems a long time since i sat down
to supper with my entire family
but it appears that the great
miss page is not with us tonight
dont you miss another member
of our happy little family
nono i cant say i do
why should you youre a busy man
have a drink lermontov
grischa ta sant
of course we all know
youre a busy man boris lermontov
but do you mean to tell me
you have noticed nothing
dont exaggerate
boris we have a little romance
in our midst
a great romance
romeo craster
and julietpage
and when
did this great romance begin
with the red shoes
charming
and where have they
taken themselves tonight
what does it matter
where theyve gone
they are young they are together
and they are in love
darling
ive decided i do believe in destiny
after all
do you my darling im very glad
cocher
cocher
youll wake him
but i want to know where we are
cocher co
one day when im old
i want some lovely young girl
to say to me
tell me where in your long life
mr craster were you most happy
and i shall say
well my dear i never knew
the exact place
it was somewhere
on the mediterranean
i was with victoria page
what she will say
do you mean the famous dancer
and i will nod yes my dear i do
but then she was quite young
comparatively unspoiled
we were i remember
very much in love
# swan lake
did you see that
she smiled at craster
i dont think so
i suppose you will be sending me
to an oculist next
watch her dancing
with pleasure
debutantesat a charity matine
yes yes
yes all right thursday
good evening mr lermontov
im afraid the score
still a bit rough
but i see you had
time to look at it
yes mr craster
i have looked at it
however it not about your music
that i wish to talk at the moment
so to come to the point
what is all this i hear
about you and miss page
oh i see
could dimitri
get out
well mr craster
yes were in love
i see
did you see miss page performance
in lac des cygnes
i was conducting
did you enjoy it
it was the loveliest thing
ive ever seen
it was impossible
and you know why it was impossible
because neither her mind nor her
heart were in her work
she wasdreaming
and dreaming is a luxury
ive never permitted in my company
miss page wants to be a great dancer
perhaps she has spoken to you
about her ambitions
oh yes
she not however
a great dancer yet
nor is she likely to become one
if she allows herself to be
sidetracked by idiotic flirtations
mr lermontov youdont understand
we really are in love
and mr craster i have had time
to look at your latest effort
yes
and find it equally impossible
that not true it good
childish
vulgar
and completely insignificant
in that case
ill relieve you of it
there are so many
first-class ballet companies
to which you may
take it with advantage
ballet work is not my great ambition
some of us think it rather
a second-rate means of expression
oui monsieur lermontov
mr craster is leaving the company
pay him two weeks salary
and get the receipt
oh hello boris
i was coming to say good night
good night
is anything the matter
no no
and before i forget dont do any
more work on the new ballet
i decided to scrap it
scrap it what do you mean
i worked out
half the choreography already
that boy julian is really gifted
it one of our finest scores
julian craster is leaving and
i dont wish to discuss it further
oh you dont well i do
do you think i dont know
a brilliant score when i hear one
do you think ive been
working day and night
for the pleasure of being told
i am wasting my time
i tell you boris ive had enough
of this lunatic asylum
i am through with it
i resign
i think youve made
a very important decision
hello you two isnt love wonderful
bonsoir julian
hello
well what did he say
ah of course he doesnt really
want you to go grischa
he is very sorry
well in that case
i will think about it
what about julian
i have never seen him
quite as bad as this
he talked a great deal about
ingratitude anddisloyalty
and he said when personal relations
start to interfere
yes i know that bit
my dear children im very sorry
boris might feel different
in the morning
the morning he leaving for paris
by the 85 train
has the famous miss page
come to see me off
id like to talk to you
i want to know
why you quarrelled with julian
may i suggest that such matters
are hardly your business
however since youve gone to
all this trouble
mr craster has been unwise enough
to interfere with plans of mine
and that is something
i do not permit
i thought once that
there would be no room in my life
for anything but dancing
youll think so again my dear
but if julian goes i shall go too
and what do you intend to do
i shall dance somewhere else
oh yes
that wont be very difficult
with the name ive given you
always provided i release you
of your contract
but even if i do
would it be quite the same
i have never pretended it would
i could make you one of the greatest
dancers the world has ever known
do you believe that
yes i do
and all that means nothing to you
you know exactly
what it means to me
the train is leaving
goodbye mr lermontov
miss page is coming
julian julian
im coming with you
hooray
the fool
the fool
no
come in you are late
i hope you didnt work too hard
all finished
i have the injunction with me
boris dont tell me youve
changed your mind again
ii dont want to stop her
doing anything
she can dance when and where
she likesexcept the red shoes
what about the boy
that different
everything written under contract
to me is mine
the red shoes and his work so far
on la belle meunire
im not interested in
anything else he writes
if you do the red shoes
youll have to pay him royalties
red shoes is no longer
in the repertoire
oh
i understand patrick trevellyan
is in paris
yes
i dined with them both last night
oh
boronskaja was with him
yes
anything i can do
how their marriage success
patrick seems to think so
would you like me to arrange
a meeting with irina
not arrange
by chance

and this is from julian
it all about his new opera
it describes the whole structure
enormous talent that boy
he says
she is an inspiration
a miracle
thank you mr boudin that all
merci bonsoir
welli see it mail day
from our two young rebels
deserters i hope theyre happy
read boris
yes read this too
it might make you sorry
to have lost that young man
i doubt it
that reminds me
jacques sent me
the new score of la belle meunire
i like it
id like you all to hear it at once
we might open with it in london
with irina

lights all gaiety fire
be good enough to glance through it
and no prejudice please
i hope you say that
to yourself sometimes
every day good night
good night
good night
on second thought i think
i would like to read those letters
my letter was only meant
to be read by me
see you later boris
good night sergei
i could hardly let him read it
she calls him a monster
a gifted cruel monster
you should have told him that
ii am sorry to be late
boris lermontov

most beautiful ratov has ever done
grischa full of enthusiasm

nobody else has ever danced
the red shoes since you left
nobody else ever shall
put on the red shoes vicky
and dance for us again
this is the bbc third program
i am at the royal opera house
covent garden london
tonight is the first night
of cupid and psyche
a new opera by british composer
julian craster
whose only well-known work has been
the score for the red shoes
the red shoes was a great success
when produced at monte carlo
with the ballet lermontov
but has not yet been seen
in this country
oh something must have gone wrong
i think somebody going
to make an announcement
ladies and gentlemen

mr julian craster the composer
who was to conduct his own opera
has been suddenly taken ill
ir hartley menzies
will conduct in his place

at the interval
all the way down from london

i havent left him
oh yes

with less than the best
if so youd never be a great artist

for a chance to win her back
because youre jealous of her
