my life happily buried at twelve oaks
but the war did come
i saw my boyhood friends blown to bits
i saw men crumple up in agony
when i shot them
and now i find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death
a world in which there no place for me
i can never make you understand because
you dont know the meaning of fear
you never mind facing realities
and you never want to escape
from them as i do

about sordid things like money
how good of you to come and see me

youre a heartless creature
but that part of your charm
you know youve got more charm
than the law allows
now i didnt come here
to talk silliness about me rhett
i came because i was so miserable
at the thought of you in trouble
i was mad at you the night you left me
on the road to tara
and i still havent forgiven you
oh scarlett dont say that

can what be possible rhett
that youve grown a woman heart
a real woman heart
i have rhett i know i have
you know it worth being in jail
just to hear you say that
it well worth it
you can drop the moonlight
and magnolias scarlett
so things have been going well
at tara have they
what have you done with your hands
i went riding last week
without my gloves

you want something from me badly enough
to put on quite a show in your velvets
what is it money

about my store

have you a store
wont you come in and look around a bit
i dont suppose it looks like much
to a lady but
l cant help being proud of it
youre not making money
well i cant complain
in fact im mighty encouraged
folks tell me im just a born merchant
it wont be long now
before miss suellen and i can marry
are you doing as well as all that
yes i am miss scarlett
im no millionaire yet
but ive cleared $000 already
and lumber too
well
that only a sideline
a sideline frank
with all the good georgia pine around
atlanta and all this building going on
well all that takes money miss scarlett
and ive got to be thinking
about buying a home
what do you want a home for
for miss suellen and me
to set up housekeeping
here in atlanta youd want to bring her
to atlanta wouldnt you
there wouldnt be much help
in that for tara
i dont rightly know what you mean
miss scarlett
i dont mean a thing
frank howd you like to drive me out
to my aunt pitty
nothing would give me
more pleasure miss scarlett
youd better stay to supper too
im sure aunt pittyd be agreeable
and id like a good long visit with you
oh you act on me just like a tonic
miss scarlett
and will you tell me all the news
all the news of miss suellen
what the matter miss scarlett
miss suellen not ill is she
oh no no
i thought surely she had written you
i guess she was ashamed to write you
she should be ashamed
oh how awful to have such a mean sister
you must tell me miss scarlett
dont leave me on tenterhooks
well she going to marry
one of the county boys next month
she just got tired of waiting
and was afraid shed be an old maid and
oh im sorry to be the one to tell you
oh it colder i left my muff at home
would you mind
if i put my hand in your pocket
but melanie you dont realize
what she done
she gone and married my mr kennedy
he my beau
and she gone and married him
she did it to save tara
you must understand that
i hate tara
and i hate scarlett she the only thing
i hate worse than tara
it all my fault
i should have committed highway robbery
to get that tax money for you
i couldnt let you do
anything like that and
well anyway it done now
yes it done now
you wouldnt let me
do anything dishonorable
but youd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didnt love
well at least you wont have to worry
about my helplessness anymore
what do you mean
im going to new york
ive arranged to get a position
in a bank there
but you cant do that
i counted on you to help me start
a lumber business ashley
and well i counted on you
i wouldnt be any good to you
i dont know anything
about the lumber business
you know as much as you do
about banking
and id give you half the business ashley
that generous of you scarlett
but it isnt that
if i go to atlanta
and take help from you again
ld bury forever any hope
of standing alone
oh is that all
well you could gradually buy the business
and then it would be your own and
no scarlett
ashley
ashley
scarlett
scarlett what is it
ashley so mean and hateful
what have you done
she wanted me to go to atlanta
to help me start my lumber business and
he wont lift a finger to help me and he
why how unchivalrous of you
why think ashley think
if it hadnt been for scarlett
id have died in atlanta
and maybe we wouldnt have had
little beau and
and when i think of her picking cotton
and plowing just to keep food
in our mouths i could just
oh my darling
all right melanie
ill go to atlanta
i cant fight you both
well here your new mill hands
mrs kennedy
the pick of all the best jails in georgia
they look pretty thin and weak to me
gallegher
halt
theyre the best you can lease maam
and if youll just give johnny gallegher
a free hand
youll get what you want out of them
all right youre the foreman
all i ask is you keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when i want it
johnny gallegher your man miss
but remember
no questions and no interference
that a bargain
start them in the morning gallegher
come on get a move on
come on move on there
but scarlett this isnt right
and you know it
it bad enough for a woman
to be in business but--
what are you complaining about
you wouldnt have owned a mill
had i not taken over
i didnt want the mill
and we couldnt have bought it
if you hadnt pressed all of our friends
for the money they owed me
isnt that right ashley
what are you running
a charitable institution
go back to the store
then go home and take your medicine
youre not looking very well
but sugar shouldnt you come home
with me
great balls of fire dont bother me
anymore and dont call me sugar
all right all right
good night ashley
she can get mad quicker
than any woman i ever saw
scarlett i dont like to interfere but
l do wish youd let me hire free darkies
instead of using convicts
i believe we could do better
darkies why their pay would break us
and convicts are dirt cheap
if we just give gallegher a free hand--
a free hand you know what that means
hell starve them and whip them
some of them are sick underfed
oh ashley how you do run on
left alone youd be giving them chicken
three times a day and
tucking them to sleep
with eiderdown quilts
scarlett i will not make money out
of the enforced labor and misery of others
you werent so particular
about owning slaves
that was different
we didnt treat them that way
besides id have freed them all
when father died
if the war hadnt already freed them
oh im sorry ashley
but have you forgotten
what it like without money
i found out that money is
the most important thing in the world
and i dont intend ever to be
without it again
ill make enough so the yankees can never
take tara away from me
ill make it the only way i know how
but were not the only southerners
who have suffered
look at all our friends theyre keeping
their honor and their kindness too
and theyre starving ive got no use
for fools who wont help themselves
i know what theyre saying about me
and i dont care
ill make friends
with the yankee carpetbaggers
and ill beat them at their own game
and youll beat them with me
that it move it a little over to that side
afternoon mrs kennedy
good afternoon
business is certainly growing aint it
it certainly is
but youre doing business
with the same people who robbed us
and tortured us and left us to starve
all that past melly
and i intend to make the best of things
even if they are yankee things
and do you know dolly merriwether
that dr meade actually saw her
peddling lumber
to those yankees herself

already been a skirmish with the yankees
i found mr wilkes wounded
and dr meade was with him
i had to prove they had been somewhere
anyplace but where they were
so i took them to belle

she by way of being
an old friend of mine
oh im sorry i--
im sorry i couldnt think up
a more dignified alibi
this isnt the first time youve come
between me and disaster captain butler

what dr meade needs
oh ashley
ashley

of your own husband mrs kennedy

you must have lost your mind
i come up here as soon
as it was dark to tell you
you mustnt even think of any such thing

why youre
well it wouldnt be fittin at all
it wouldnt be fitting to thank a kind
woman who saved my husband life
miss wilkes there aint never been a lady
in this town nice to me like you was
i mean about the money
for the hospital you know
and i dont forget a kindness
and i got to thinking about you being left
a widow with a little boy
if mr wilkes got hung
and he a nice little boy
your boy is miss wilkes
i got a boy myself and so l
oh you have does he live
oh no maam he aint here in atlanta
he aint never been here
he off at school
i aint seen him since he was little
well anyway if it had been
that miss kennedy husband by hisself
l wouldnt have lifted a finger to
no matter what captain butler said
she a mighty cold woman
prancin about atlanta by herself
she killed her husband
same as if she shot him
you mustnt say unkind things
about my sister-in-law
please dont freeze me miss wilkes
i forgot how you liked her
but she just aint in the same class
with you and i cant help it if i think so
well anyway i gotta be goin
im scared somebodyll recognize
this carriage if i stayed here any longer
that wouldnt do you no good
and miss wilkes
if you ever see me on the street
you dont have to speak to me
ill understand
i should be proud to speak to you
proud to be under obligation to you
i hope we meet again
oh no maam that wouldnt be fittin
-good night miss wilkes
-good night mrs watling
and youre wrong about mrs kennedy
she brokenhearted about her husband
great balls of fire it rhett

tell him ill be right down mammy
she says she comin
i dont know why she comin
but she a-comin
you dont like me mammy
now dont you argue with me you dont
you really dont

what
the cologne
im sure i dont know what you mean
i mean youve been drinking
brandy quite a lot
well what if i have
ls that any of your affair
dont drink alone scarlett
people always find out
and it ruins the reputation
what is it
this is more than losing old frank
oh rhett
lm so afraid
i dont believe it
youve never been afraid in your life
im afraid now
im afraid of dying and going to hell
you look pretty healthy
and maybe there isnt any hell
oh there is i know there is
i was raised on it
well far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood
tell me what youve done
that hell yawns before you
i ought never to have married frank
to begin with
he was suellen beau
and he loved her not me
and i made him miserable
and i killed him
yes i did i killed him
for the first time im finding out what it is
to be sorry for something ive done
here dry your eyes
if you had it all to do over again
youd do no differently
youre like the thief who isnt
the least bit sorry he stole
but he terribly terribly sorry
he going to jail
im glad mother dead
im glad she dead so she cant see me
i always wanted to be like her
calm and kind and
and i certainly have
turned out disappointing
you know scarlett i think youre
on the verge of a crying jag
so ill change the subject
and say what i came to say
say it then and get out
what is it
that i cant go on any longer without you
you are the most ill-bred man to come here
at a time like this with your filthy--
i made up my mind that you were
the only woman for me
the first day i saw you at twelve oaks
now that youve got the lumber mill
and frank money
you wont come to me
as you did to the jail
so i see i shall have to marry you
i never heard of such bad taste
would you be more convinced
if i fell to my knees
turn me loose you varmint
and get out of here
forgive me for startling you
with the impetuosity of my sentiments
my dear scarlett
i mean my dear mrs kennedy
but it cannot have escaped your notice
that for some time past
the friendship i have felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling
a feeling more beautiful
more pure more sacred
dare i name it can it be love
get up off your knees
i dont like your common jokes
this is an honorable proposal of marriage
made at what i consider
a most opportune moment
i cant go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands
youre coarse and youre conceited
and i think this conversation
has gone far enough
besides i shall never marry again
oh yes you will and youll marry me
you you
i dont love you
and i dont like being married
did you ever think of marrying just for fun
marriage fun fiddle-dee-dee
fun for men you mean
hush up do you want them to hear you
youve been married to a boy
and an old man
why not try a husband of the right age
with a way with women
youre a fool rhett butler when you know
i shall always love another man
stop it do you hear me scarlett
stop it no more of that talk
rhett dont i shall faint
i want you to faint
this is what you were meant for
none of the fools youve known
have kissed you like this have they
your charles or your frank
or your stupid ashley
say youre going to marry me
say yes say yes
yes
are you sure you meant it
you dont want to take it back
no
look at me and try to tell me the truth
did you say yes because of my money
well
yes partly
partly
well you know rhett money does help
and of course i am fond of you
fond of me
well if i said i was madly in love with you
youd know i was lying
but you always said
we had a lot in common
yes youre right my dear
im not in love with you any more
than you are with me
heaven help the man
who ever really loves you
what kind of a ring would you like
my darling
oh a diamond ring
and do buy a great big one rhett
you shall have the biggest
and the most vulgar ring in atlanta
ill take you to new orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon
my ill-gotten gains can buy
oh that would be just heavenly
and i think ill buy your trousseau
for you too
rhett how wonderful but
you wont tell anybody will you rhett
still the little hypocrite
rhett arent you going
to kiss me goodbye
dont you think youve had enough kissing
for one afternoon
youre impossible
you can go and i dont care
if you never come back
but i will come back
what are you thinking about scarlett
im thinking about how rich we are
rhett i can keep
the lumber business too cant l
yes of course you can if it amuses you
now that youre rich
you can tell everyone to go to the devil
as youve always said you wanted to
but you were the main one
i wanted to go to the devil
dont scrape the plate scarlett
im sure there more in the kitchen
oh rhett can i have one of those
chocolate ones stuffed with meringue
if you dont stop being such a glutton
youll get as fat as mammy
then ill divorce you
wouldnt it be nice if you bought
something for mammy too
why should i buy her a present
when she called us both mules
mules why mules
yes she said we could give ourselves airs
and get ourselves all slicked up
like racehorses but we were just mules
in horse harness
and we didnt fool anybody
i never heard anything more true
mammy a smart old soul
and one of the few people i know
whose respect id like to have
i wont give her a thing
she doesnt deserve it
then ill take her a petticoat
my mammy always said
when she went to heaven
she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that it would stand by itself
and so rustly the lord would think
it was made of angels wings
why she wont take it from you
shed rather die than wear it
that may be but im making the gesture
just the same
wake up wake up
you were having another nightmare
oh rhett
when i was so cold and hungry and
and so tired l
l couldnt find it i ran through the mist
and i couldnt find it
-find what honey
-oh i dont know
i always dream the same dream
and i never know
it seems to be hidden in the mist
darling
rhett do you think ill ever dream
that ive found it and that im safe
dreams dont work that way but when
you get used to being safe and warm
youll stop dreaming that dream
and scarlett im going to see
that you are safe

in a man who could love a child so much

finally admitted he was honored
by the confederate congress
for his services at the battle of franklin

to the association for the beautification
of the graves of the glorious dead

of our last barbecue at twelve oaks
where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaux
that girl doesnt exist anymore
nothing turned out as i expected ashley
nothing
yes weve travelled a long road
since the old days havent we scarlett

the warm still country twilights
the high soft negro laughter
from the quarters
the golden warmth and security
of those days

till you cant do anything but look back

and youll have to hurry
-has lndia dared to--
-yes india has
every woman and man in town

who tell the truth
there no time to argue now get up
i wont go i cant go
until this misunderstanding is cleared up
you wont cheat miss melly
out of the satisfaction of publicly
ordering you out of her house
there was nothing wrong
india hates me so
i cant go rhett i couldnt face it
if you dont show it tonight
youll never be able to as long as you live
while that wouldnt bother me
youre ruining bonnie chances
youre going to that party
if only for her sake now get dressed

will do for this occasion
and put on plenty of rouge
i want you to look your part tonight

-good night scarlett
-but rhett you cant--

the lions are hungry for you
oh rhett dont leave me dont

which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
for he a jolly good fellow

mrs meade

good evening
good evening
why scarlett
-good evening miss scarlett
-good evening mrs butler
ashley arent you going to get
our scarlett a glass of punch
did you have a good time tonight
at miss melly party child
yes yes
now mammy be sure and leave word
if captain butler asks for me
when he comes back im asleep
yes maam
come in mrs butler
come here
sit down
there no reason why you shouldnt have
your nightcap even if i am here
i didnt want a drink i heard a noise and--
you heard nothing of the kind
you wouldnt have come down
if youd thought i was here
-you must need a drink badly
-i do not
take it dont give yourself airs
i know you drink on the quiet
and i know how much you drink
do you think i care if you like your brandy
youre drunk and im going to bed
im very drunk
and i intend getting still drunker
before the evening over
but youre not going to bed not yet
sit down
so she stood by you did she
how does it feel to have the woman
youve wronged cloak your sins for you
youre wondering if she knows
all about you and ashley
youre wondering if she did it
just to save her face
youre thinking that she a fool for doing it
even if it did save your hide
-i will not listen
-yes youll listen
miss melly a fool
but not the kind you think
it just that there too much honor in her
to ever conceive of dishonor
in anyone she loves
and she loves you
though just why she does
im sure i dont know
if you werent so drunk and insulting
i could explain everything
-as it is though--
-if you get out of that chair once more
of course the comic figure in all this is
the long suffering mr wilkes
mr wilkes who cant be
mentally faithful to his wife
and wont be unfaithful to her technically
why doesnt he make up his mind
rhett you
observe my hands my dear
i could tear you to pieces with them
and id do it if itd take ashley
out of your mind forever
but it wouldnt
so ill remove him
from your mind forever this way
ill put my hands so
one on each side of your head
and ill smash your skull between them
like a walnut
and thatll block him out
take your hands off me you drunken fool
you know ive always admired
your spirit my dear
never more than now
when youre cornered
im not cornered
and youll never corner me
rhett butler or frighten me
youve lived in dirt so long
you cant understand anything else
and youre jealous of something
you cant understand good night
jealous am l
yes i suppose i am
even though i know youve been faithful
to me all along
how do i know
because i know ashley wilkes
and his honorable breed
theyre gentlemen
and that more than i can say
for you or for me
were not gentlemen
and we have no honor have we
it not that easy scarlett
you turned me out
while you chased ashley wilkes
while you dreamed of ashley wilkes
this is one night
youre not turning me out
how are you feeling this morning mammy
well this misery in my back aint so good
you actin mighty happy this mornin
miss scarlett
i am mammy i am
oh she wept with delight
when he gave her a smile
and trembled with fear at his frown
hello
id like to extend my apologies
for my conduct of last night
oh but rhett
i was very drunk
and quite swept off my feet
by your charms
well you neednt bother to apologize
nothing you ever do surprises me
ive been thinking things over
and i really believe that
it would be better for both of us
if we admitted wed made a mistake
and got a divorce
-a divorce
-yes
there no point in our holding on
to each other is there
ill provide for you amply
youve plenty of grounds
just give me bonnie you can say
what you please i wont contest it
