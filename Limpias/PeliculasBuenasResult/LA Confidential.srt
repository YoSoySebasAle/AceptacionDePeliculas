
come to los angeles
the sun shines bright the
beaches are wide and inviting
and the orange groves stretch
as far as the eye can see
there are jobs aplenty
and land is cheap
every workingman can
have his own house
and inside every house a
happy all-american family
you can have all
this and who knows
you could even be discovered
become a movie star
or at least see one
life is good in los angeles
it paradise on earth
that what they tell you anyway
because theyre selling an image
theyre selling it through
movies radio and television
in the hit show badge of honour
the la cops walk on water
as they keep the city
clean of crooks
yep youd think this place
was the garden of eden
but there trouble in paradise
and his name is meyer harris
cohen mickey c to his fans
local la colour
to the nth degree
and his number-one bodyguard
johnny stompanato
mickey c the head of organised
crime in these parts
he runs dope rackets
and prostitution
he kills a dozen people a year
and the dapper little
gent does it in style
and every time his picture
on the front page
it a black eye for the
image of los angeles
because how can organised
crime exist
in the city with the best
police force in the world
something has to be done
but nothing too original
because hey this is hollywood
what worked for al capone
would work for the mickster
mr cohen youre under arrest
non-payment of federal income tax
but all is not well
sending mickey up has
created a vacuum
and it only a matter of time
before someone with balls
of brass tries to fill it
remember dear readers

patrol division
internal affairs what
i was thinking detective bureau
edmund youre a political animal
you have the eye for human
weakness but not the stomach
youre wrong sir
would you be willing
to plant evidence
on a suspect you
knew to be guilty
in order to ensure an indictment
weve been over this
yes or no
no
would you beat a confession out of
a suspect you knew to be guilty
no
would you shoot a hardened
criminal in the back
in order to offset the
chance that some lawyer
no
then for the love of god
dont be a detective
stick to assignments where you
dont have to make those choices
dudley i know you mean well

way you did or my father

youre all going in my report
let go exley
bloody christmas
the press love to label
you should know this is
bigger than the police board
the grand jury convening
indictments may be handed down
will you testify
no sir i wont
district attorney loew
you and officer stensland brought
the liquor to the station
stensland was already drunk
do you see how appearing as a
voluntary witness against him
could offset the damage
youve done to yourself
sir i wont testify against
my partner or anyone else
this man is a disgrace
your badge and gun officer
youre suspended from duty
dismissed
ed
we need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the department
im asking you
justice has to be served
of course ill testify
im glad you feel that way
edmund most of the men dont
they think silence and
integrity are the same thing
not exactly the image of the new
lapd were trying to create
welcome to los angeles
the city of the future
may i make a suggestion sir
by all means
the public will expect the
department to protect its own
and sweep this under
the carpet dont
shift the guilt to men whose
pensions are secured
force them to retire
but somebody has to swing so
indict try and convict
richard stensland and bud white
secure them jail time the
message will be very clear
this department
your new lapd
will not tolerate officers who
think theyre above the law
dick stensland is an
embarrassment as a policeman
he had rotten fitness reports
from every co he served under
but bud white is a
valuable officer
white a mindless thug
no edmund
he just a man who
can answer yes
to those questions ive asked you
the department and the
public need role models
clean-cut forthright men
the public can admire
sergeant ill promote you
to lieutenant
effective immediately
detective lieutenant
ed youre 30
your father didnt make
lieutenant until he was 33
i know that sir
i also know when he made
lieutenant it was as a detective
before we start polishing
our laurels
itd look better if we had
a corroborative witness
that wont be easy to come by
the men hate a stool pigeon
jack vincennes
he hit one of the mexicans
and saw the whole thing
a veteran like vincennes might be
willing to admit his
own culpability
but hed never rat out
a fellow officer
jack the technical adviser
on badge of honour
he lives for it
that the way to get to him
id like you to observe ed
call sergeant vincennes
bright kid
you may well reap
the benefit ed
but are you prepared to be
despised in the department
yes sir i am
so be it
well sergeant well
get right to it
nine civilian witnesses
have identified
you as hitting ezekiel garcia
but we have a stellar witness
who will name names
and also testify that you hit
back only after being hit
and
and you will testify
against three officers
who have already earned
their pension
and plead ignorance to
questions at the other men
no thanks im not a snitch
ill guarantee you a slap on the
wrist a brief suspension
followed by a temporary transfer
from narcotics to vice
when you transfer out of vice
youll be back on the show
the show
badge of honour vincennes
we need to tone down
your profile for a bit
jack
i doubt youve ever taken a
stupid breath dont start now
okay ill do it
the grand jury will hear
your testimony tomorrow
dismissed vincennes
and so it goes
detective lieutenant
ace them at the grand
jury tomorrow son
wear a smart-looking
suit and ace them
and ed lose the glasses
so youre the stellar witness
i should have known what
the chief throwing you
throwing me
yeah exley what the pay-off
youre the pay-off expert
im just doing my duty
come on youre playing an angle
here college boy right
youre getting something so you
dont have to hobnob with cops
who are gonna hate
you for snitching
well if theyre making
you detective watch out
some bureau guys are
gonna burn in this
and youre gonna work
with friends of theirs
what about you
im snitching three
old-timers wholl
be fishing in oregon next week
next to you im clean
and smart
edmund j exley to chambers
and remember
bud white will fuck
you for this if
it takes him the rest of his life
captain what do you want
call me dudley
dudley what do you want
look lad i admire your
refusal to testify
and your loyalty to your partner
i admire you as a policeman
particularly your
adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job
and im most impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters
do you hate them wendell
what do you want
theyre yours
go ahead take them
there no goddamn bill on me
four witnesses recanted
their testimony
why
they had a change of heart
what about stensland
your partner through
departmental scapegoat
on the chief orders
a year from his pension
exley
exley made his play and
got what he wanted
as a politician he
exceeds even myself
the department needs
smart men like exley
and direct men like you
look lad i need you
for an assignment
the chief given
me the go-ahead on
a duty few men are fit for
but you were born for
youd be working out of
homicide down at city hall

the rest were killed
in the men room
sir
we got a total of 5 spent
2-gauge remington shotgun shells
im betting three men
five-shot capacity
pumps all of them emptying once
excuse me sir we got an
id on one of the victims
it dick stensland
when i first saw her i thought
she was rita hayworth
yeah me too
hell of a way to avoid
a prison sentence
you tell me what happened
appears three men held
up a coffee shop
the guy at the register pulled
a 38 so they killed him
then they took everyone else
out back and killed them too
lieutenant were ready
with that nite owl id
is this your daughter
mrs lefferts
i dont know
we know this is difficult
just take your time
it seems like my susan
but my susan was a
blond not a redhead
when was the last
time you saw her
just before christmas
wed fought i didnt
like her boyfriend
mrs lefferts does
your daughter have
any distinguishing
characteristics
you got the wrong idea
mister im fine
she has a birthmark on her hip
it her
my baby
im sorry mrs lefferts
who in charge of
this investigation
captain smith and myself why
the nite owl massacre
hyperbole aside
this is a heinous crime that
requires swift resolution
six victims
one of them one of our
own dick stensland
as it happens he was
a nite owl regular
in the wrong place
at the wrong time
robbery is the likely motive
we have rubber-glove
smears on the register
and preliminary forensics strongly
tend towards a trio of shooters
we do have one hot
lead so listen well
three negro juveniles
were seen discharging shotguns
last night in griffith park
a park ranger idd them as driving
a 948 to 950 mercury coupe
maroon in colour
an hour ago a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor
who saw a maroon
merc parked across
from the nite owl around  am
dmv has come up with a
registration list of merc coupes
forty-eight two-man teams will
shake three names apiece
interrogations will be led
by lieutenant edmund exley
enough on that
gentlemen just go out and get
them use all necessary force
the people of los
angeles demand it
dismissed
why not just put a bounty on them
you ready to roll
take them i got
something i gotta do
what if one of these names
get somebody else
well i got our
assignments big v
we go by this list we got zero
chance of making this collar
i got a guy who knows what
going on south of jefferson
he can put us at fifty-fifty
jack what are you doing
same sort of thing that got
you in trouble last time
ill take those odds
we got it from here
between the two of you you
should bring a photographer
i need an address on a customer
of yours her name is lynn

police charities

other guy buzz
buzz meeks no longer works for me
lefferts looked beat-up christmas
eve but didnt act it
i think shed been hit in the face
with a tennis racket she is
was a big doubles fan
youre a known associate of a
woman killed in a mass murder
wanna go downtown and
discuss this officially
is that what this is official
somehow i have the feeling this is
more personal with you mr white
all right then
are you concerned about
criminal matters
peripheral to the
nite owl murders
not at the moment
you wouldnt feel
obligated to report them
why were lefferts eyes black
i needed a rita hayworth to
fill out my little studio
what little studio
well there gardner
russell monroe turner
lynn bracken is my veronica lake
i use girls that look
like movie stars
sometimes i employ
a plastic surgeon
when the work had been done
that when you saw us
that why her mother
couldnt id her
jesus fucking christ
no mr white pierce
morehouse patchett
i sense youre on
your best behaviour
but that all im gonna tell you
if you persist ill meet
you with my attorney
now would you like
lynn bracken address
i got her address
find susan killer mr white
ill give you a handsome reward
whatever you desire
come on i know youre not asleep

right now
hey doll face tell
him to leave us alone

ive been expecting you
just not this soon

i was friendly with sue lefferts
but we werent friends
you know what i mean
you sorry she dead
of course i am
what kind of question is that
do you know why pierce
is humouring you
use words like that
you might make me mad
but do you know
yeah i know
patchett running whores cut
to look like movie stars
and judging by his
address probably
something bigger on the side
he doesnt want any attention
that right our motives are
selfish so were cooperating
so cooperate why was susan
lefferts at the nite owl
i dont know i never heard
of the nite owl till today
how did she meet patchett
pierce meets people
sue came on a bus with
dreams of hollywood
and this is how they turned out
thanks to pierce we still
get to act a little
tell me about pierce
he waiting for you
to mention money
you want some advice
miss bracken

miss bracken dont ever try to
fucking bribe me or threaten me
or ill have you and patchett
in shit up to your ears
i remember you from christmas eve

give him personality

rollo tomasi the
reason i became a cop
i wanted to catch the guys who
thought they could
get away with it
it was supposed to
be about justice

way i lost sight of that
whyd you become a cop

on an associate of vincennes
the records check has
led to a dead end
what the name
rollo tomasi

vincennes mention him
no no i havent
well
it probably nothing still
keep your eyes open boyo
i know it unlikely but
suppose just for a moment
somebody did have
that much heroin
who would they go to to move it
white in my office

habits at the victory motel

old cruel self any more
and i had such grand
plans for your future
what plans

activities and i have mine

i wanna know everything
you and jack
vincennes talked about last night
start with the id on the corpse
an ex-cop leland buzz meeks

what did jack say
did he know him
only by reputation
wendell this is sid hudgens
im willing to cooperate
there no need to tie me down
it for your own safety
now what can you tell us about
sergeant jack vincennes
hollywood jack the big v
i can tell you he on the
night train to the big adiós
i didnt have anything
to do with him
getting killed if
that what you mean
but you were business associates
what that got to
do with anything
okay okay so we worked together
it was an information exchange
i got him first-class collars
he got me good stories
we were friends for christ sake
well drop that for the moment
care to comment on
pierce patchett
patchett you think
he had something
to do with vincennes getting iced
wendell id like full and docile
cooperation on every topic
okay okay okay all right
everybody knows that patchett
worth a boatload of greenbacks
but the man has hobbies too
he bankrolls b-movies
under the table
and try this one on
he rumoured to be a
periodic heroin sniffer
all in all a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o
and
and what
reciprocity mr hudgens is the
key to every relationship
he runs call girls
cousin tail fixed up to
look like movie stars
and
blackmail shit
in my car in the
trunk under the rug
patchett got me to
photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous
slut named lynn

punches a little better

as lefferts boyfriend
stensland pretended he didnt know
meeks or her the
night that i met
lynn
stensland and meeks

i dont know but i think stens
killed meeks over heroin
what heroin
johnny stompanato told me that
meeks had heroin for sale
meeks ends up dead
stensland dies at the nite owl
it wasnt the negroes
the rape victim lied
in her statement
the first guys to the mercury
coupe were breuning and carlisle
dudley guys
they planted the shotguns
and theyd have
killed the negroes
too if jack and i
hadnt shown up
dudley framed them because they
were negroes and had records
he knew thered be no
questions asked

patchett
looks like his bodyguard had
a conflict of interest
suicide note
says he killed jack
because jack had
figured out a pornography scam
slicing himself open
wasnt his idea
two of his fingers are broken
they must have held him there

after im done theyll make
you chief of detectives
hold up your badge so theyll
know youre a policeman
you think you can talk your
way out of this lieutenant
no
but i think i can tell the truth
during our investigation
of events surrounding
the nite owl case
jack vincennes bud white and
i learned the following
your golden boy throwing
his whole life away
the three nite owl suspects
while guilty of
kidnapping and rape
were innocent of the multiple
homicides at the nite owl
the actual gunmen
were most likely
los angeles police
department officers
michael breuning and
william carlisle
and a third man
who may or may not have
been captain dudley smith
the objective
the elimination of another
police officer
richard stensland
who along with former lapd
officer leland buzz meeks
also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of captain smith
and then betrayed him over
25 pounds of heroin
the retrieval of which
was the ultimate motivation
behind the nite owl killings
beginning with the incarceration
of mickey cohen
captain smith has
been assuming control
of organised crime in los angeles
this includes the
assassinations
of an unknown number of
mickey cohen lieutenants
the systematic blackmail
of city officials
and the murders of susan lefferts
pierce patchett sid hudgens
and sergeant jack vincennes
captain smith admitted
as much to me
before i shot him at
the victory motel
that it
well
the press is gonna
have a field day
this christ itll stain
the department for years
decades
if we can get the
kid to play ball
who to say what happened
maybe dudley smith died a hero
good idea
if we get the press to play
you wanna tell me what
youre smiling about
a hero
howd he know what
were talking about
he couldnt have heard us
and
in this situation
youll need more than one
it is with great pleasure
that i present this award
to detective lieutenant
edmund exley
two-time medal of
valour recipient
next year the lapd will
move into its new facility
with leaders like edmund exley
the image of fat cops stealing
apples will be left behind
and los angeles will finally have
the police force it deserves
you just couldnt resist
theyre using me so for
a while im using them
come on
hey
thanks for the push
yeah
congratulations lieutenant exley
some men get the world
others get ex-hookers
and a trip to arizona
bye
bye
