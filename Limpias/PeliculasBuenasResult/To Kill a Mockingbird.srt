
maycomb was a tired old town
even in 932 when i first knew it
somehow it was hotter then
men stiff collars wilted
by 900 in the morning
ladies bathed before noon
after their 300 naps
and by nightfall were
like soft teacakes
with frostings of sweat
and sweet talcum
a day was 24 hours long
but it seemed longer
there was no hurry for there was
nowhere to go and nothing to buy
and no money to buy it with
although maycomb county
had recently been told
that it had nothing to
fear but fear itself
that summer i was 6 years old
good morning mr cunningham

legal work i did for him

can he has no money

well for one thing
he has a boy named boo
that he keeps chained to a bed
in the house over yonder
come on
see he lives over there
boo only comes out at night
when youre asleep
and it pitch dark
when you wake up at
night you can hear him
once i heard him scratching
on our screen door
but he was gone by the
time atticus got there
i wonder what he does in there
i wonder what he looks like
well
judging from his tracks
he about 66 tall
he eats raw squirrels and
all the cats he can catch
there a long jagged scar that
runs all the way across his face
his teeth are yellow and rotten
his eyes are popped and he
drools most of the time
oh i dont believe you
dill what are you doing here
my lord aunt stephanie you
almost gave me a heart attack
dill i dont want you playing
around that house over there
there a maniac lives
there and he dangerous

i was just trying
to warn him about
boo he wouldnt believe me
youd just better believe
him mr dill harris
tell him about the time boo
tried to kill his papa
i was standing in my yard one day
when his mama come out yelling
he killing us all
turned out that boo was
sitting in the living room
cutting up the paper
for his scrapbook
and when his daddy come by
he reached over with his scissors
stabbed him in his leg
pulled them out and went
right on cutting the paper
they wanted to send
him to an asylum
but his daddy said no radley
is going to any asylum
so they locked him up in the
basement of the courthouse
till he nearly died of the damp
and his daddy brought
him back home
there he is to this day sitting
over there with his scissors

bye bye
darn you walter cunningham
come on walter
cut that out what do
you think youre doing
he made me start off
on the wrong foot
i was trying to explain
to that darn lady teacher
why he didnt have no money for
his lunch and she got sore at me
stop it stop it
is your daddy mr walter
cunningham from old sarum
come home and have dinner with us
walter wed be glad to have you
our daddy a friend
of your daddy
scout here is crazy she
wont fight you no more
i hope that a dinner
that you enjoy
yes sir i dont know
when ive had a roast
weve been having squirrels
and rabbits lately
my pa and i go hunting
in our spare time
youve got a gun of your own
huh
how long have you had a gun
a year or so
can i have the syrup please
certainly son
cal will you bring in
the syrup dish please
yes sir
how old were you when you got
your first gun atticus
thirteen or fourteen
i remember when my daddy
gave me that gun
he told me that i should never
point at anything in the house
and that hed rather id shoot
at tin cans in the backyard
but he said that sooner or later
hed suppose the temptation
to go after birds
would be too much
that i could shoot all the blue
jays i wanted if i could hit them
but to remember it was a
sin to kill a mockingbird
why
i reckon because mockingbirds
dont do anything but make
music for us to enjoy
they dont eat people gardens
dont nest in the corncribs
they dont do one thing but just
sing their hearts out for us
how did you like school scout
all right
thank you cal that for walter
what in the sam hill
are you doing
but atticus he gone and
drowned his dinner in syrup
and now he pouring it all over
scout
what
come out here i
want to talk to you
that boy is your company
and if he wants to eat up that
tablecloth youll
let him you hear
and if you cant act
fit to eat like folks
you can just sit here
and eat in the kitchen
scout
scout
scout what in the world
has got into you
not going back
now now
not going back
atticus im not going
back to school any more
scout it just the first day
i dont care
everything went wrong
my teacher got mad
as the devil at me
and said you were teaching me to
read all wrong and to stop it
then acted like a fool
and tried to give walter
cunningham a quarter
when everybody knows cunninghams
wont take nothing from nobody
any fool could have told her that
well
maybe she just nervous
after all it her
first day too
teaching school and
being new here
oh atticus
now wait a minute
if you just learn a
single trick scout
youll get along a lot better
with all kinds of folks
you never really
understand a person
until you consider things
from his point of view
sir
until you climb inside of his
skin and walk around in it
but if i keep going to school
we cant ever read any more
scout
do you know what a compromise is
bending the law
no it an agreement
reached by mutual consent
here is the way it works
you concede the necessity
of going to school
and well keep right on
reading the same every night
just as we always have
is that a bargain
there just didnt seem
to be anyone or anything
atticus couldnt explain
though it wasnt a
talent that would arouse
the admiration of
any of our friends
jem and i had to admit he
was very good at that
but that was all he was
good at we thought
see there he is
scout jem come on inside
come on get in
mr finch this is cal

dog down the street apiece

away before he starts running
look where he is i cant
shoot that well you know it
i havent shot a gun in years
id feel mighty comfortable

do you understand
he just as dangerous
dead as alive

atticus

the best shot in this county

atticus atticus
atticus
atticus had promised me
he would wear me out
if he ever heard of
me fighting any more
i was far too old and too big
for such childish things
and the sooner i
learned to hold in
the better off everybody would be
i soon forgot
cecil jacobs made me forget
what is it scout
atticus do you defend niggers
dont say nigger scout
i didnt say it
cecil jacobs did that
why i had to fight him
scout i dont want you fighting
i had to atticus he
i dont care what the reasons are
i forbid you to fight
yes sir
anyway im simply defending
a negro tom robinson
scout
there are some things
that youre not
old enough to understand just yet
there been some
high talk around town
to the effect that i shouldnt do
much about defending this man
if you shouldnt be defending
him then why are you doing it
for a number of reasons
the main one is that if i didnt
i couldnt hold my
head up in town
i couldnt even tell you or jem
not to do something again
oh scout
youre going to hear some ugly
talk about this in school
but i want you to
promise me one thing
that you wont get
into fights over it
no matter what they say to you
yes sir
whatre you doing
im walking like an egyptian
we were studying about
them in school
teacher says we wouldnt
be no place without them
is that so
cradle of civilisation they
invented embalming
and toilet paper
that wrong scout

front of his eyebrows like you do

i found all of these
in the knothole of that old
tree at different times
this is a spelling medal
they used to award these in
school to spelling winners
before we were born
and another time i found this
and this
and scout

never told you about
that night i went back
to the radley house

i do sit down
now tom
were you acquainted with
mayella violet ewell
yes sir
i had to pass her place going to
and from the field every day
is there any other way to go
no sir none as i know of
and did she ever speak to you
yes sir
id tip my hat when id go by
one day she asked me to
come inside the fence
bust up a chifforobe for her
she gave me the hatchet
and i broke it up
and then she said i reckon ill
have to give you a
nickel wont i
and i said no maam
there aint no charge
then i went home
mr finch that was way last
spring way over a year ago
and did you ever go
on the place again
yes sir
when
i went lots of times
seemed like every time
i passed by yonder
shed have some little
something for me to do
chopping kindling and
toting water for her
tom
what happened to
you on the evening
of august 2 of last year
mr finch
i was going home as
usual that evening
when i passed the ewell place
miss mayella was on the
porch like she said she was
she said for me to come there
and help her a minute
i went inside the fence
and i looked around for
some kindling to work on
but i didnt see nothing
and then she said to
come in the house
she has a door that needs fixing
so i follows her inside
and looked at the door
and it looked all right
then she shut the door
all the time i was wondering
why it was so quiet like
then it come to me there was
not a child on the place
and i said miss mayella
where are the children
and she said they all
gone to get ice cream
she said it took her a slap
year to save seven nickels
but she done it and
they all gone to town
what did you say then
i said something like
why miss mayella it right
nice of you to treat them
and she said you think so
well i said i best be going i
couldnt do nothing for her
and she said oh yes i could
and i asked her what
and she said to just
step on the chair yonder
and get that box down from
on top of the chifforobe
so i done like she told me
and i was reaching
and the next thing i know
she grabbed me around the legs
she scared me so bad i hopped
down and turned the chair over
that was the only thing
the only furniture
disturbed in the room
mr finch i swear when i left it
and what happened after you
turned the chair over
tom
youve sworn to tell
the whole truth
will you do it
what happened after that
mr finch
i got down off the chair
and i turned around
and she sort of jumped on me
she hugged me around the waist
she reached up and
kissed me on the face
she said she had never
kissed a grown man before
and she might as well kiss me
she said for me to kiss her back
and i said miss mayella
let me out of here
and i tried to run
then mr ewell cussed
at her from the window
and said he going to kill her
what happened after that
i was running so fast i
dont know what happened
tom did you rape mayella ewell
i did not sir
did you harm her in any way
i did not sir
robinson
youre pretty good at
busting up chifforobes
and kindling with one
hand arent you
strong enough to choke the
breath out of a woman
and sling her to the floor
ive never done that sir
but youre strong enough to
i reckon so sir
how come you were so all-fired
anxious to do that woman chores
looks like she didnt
have nobody to help her
like i said
with mr ewell and seven
children on the place
you did all this chopping and
work out of sheer goodness boy
youre a mighty good
fellow it seems
did all that for not one penny
yes sir
i felt right sorry for
her she seemed
you felt sorry for her
a white woman
you felt sorry for her
to begin with
this case should never
have come to trial
the state has not produced
one iota of medical evidence
that the crime tom
robinson is charged with
ever took place
it has relied instead upon the
testimony of two witnesses
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question
on cross-examination
but has been flatly
contradicted by the defendant
there is circumstantial
evidence to indicate
that mayella ewell
was beaten savagely
by someone who led almost
exclusively with his left
and tom robinson now sits before
you having taken the oath
with the only good
hand he possesses
his right
i have nothing but
pity in my heart
for the chief witness
for the state
she is the victim of cruel
poverty and ignorance
but my pity does not extend so far
as to her putting a
man life at stake
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt
i say guilt gentlemen
because it was guilt
that motivated her
she committed no crime
she has merely broken a rigid and
time-honoured code of our society
a code so severe that
whoever breaks it is
hounded from our midst
as unfit to live with
she must destroy the
evidence of her offence
but what was the
evidence of her offence
tom robinson a human being
she must put tom
robinson away from her
tom robinson was to
her a daily reminder
of what she did
what did she do
she tempted a negro she was
white and she tempted a negro
she did something that in
our society is unspeakable
she kissed a black man
not an old uncle
but a strong young negro man
no code mattered to her
before she broke it
but it came crashing
down on her afterwards
the witnesses for the state
with the exception of the
sheriff of maycomb county
have presented themselves to
you gentlemen to this court
in the cynical confidence
that their testimony
would not be doubted
confident that you gentlemen
would go along with them
on the assumption
the evil assumption
that all negroes lie
all negroes are basically
immoral beings
all negro men are not to be
trusted around our women
an assumption that one associates
with minds of their calibre
and which is in itself
gentlemen a lie
which i do not need
to point out to you
and so
a quiet humble respectable negro
who has had the
unmitigated temerity
to feel sorry for a white woman
has had to put his word
against two white people
the defendant is not guilty
but somebody in this courtroom is
now gentlemen
in this country
our courts are the
great levellers
in our courts
all men are created equal
im no idealist
to believe firmly in the integrity
of our courts and
in our jury system
that no ideal to me that
is a living working reality
i am confident that you
gentlemen will review
without passion
the evidence that you have heard
come to a decision
and restore this
man to his family
in the name of god
do your duty
in the name of god
believe tom robinson
how long has the jury
been out now reverend
let see
almost two hours now
i think that an awful
good sign dont you
court now in session
everybody rise
gentlemen of the jury have
you reached a verdict
we have your honour
will the defendant please
rise and face the jury
what is your verdict
we find the defendant
guilty as charged
gentlemen this jury is dismissed
court adjourned

unpleasant jobs for us

what the matter atticus
tom robinson is dead

abbotsville for safekeeping

him and missed his aim

the deputy says
tom just ran like a crazy man
the last thing i
told him was not to
lose heart that wed

miss scout do you think you
could tell us what happened
i dont know
all of a sudden somebody grabbed
me knocked me down on the ground
jem found me then
then mr ewell i reckon grabbed
him again and jem hollered
then somebody grabbed
me mr ewell i guess
somebody grabbed him
then i heard someone
panting and coughing
and i saw someone carrying jem
who was it
there he is mr tate
hell tell you his name
hey boo
miss jean louise
mr arthur radley
i believe he already knows you
heck let go out
on the front porch
would you like to say good
night to jem mr arthur
you can pet him mr
arthur he asleep
you couldnt if he was awake
though he wouldnt let you
go ahead
come sit in the swing mr arthur
i guess that the thing to do is
good lord i must be
losing my memory
i cant remember whether
jem is 2 or 3
anyway itll have to come
before the county court
of course it is a clear-cut
case of self-defence
ill run down to the office
mr finch
do you think jem killed bob
ewell is that what you think
your boy never stabbed him
bob ewell fell on his knife
he killed himself
there a black man
dead for no reason
and now the man responsible
for it is dead
let the dead bury the dead
this time mr finch
i never heard tell it
was against the law
for any citizen to do his utmost
to prevent a crime
from being committed
which is exactly what he did
but maybe youll tell
me that it my duty
to tell the town all about
it not to hush it up
you know what will happen then
all the ladies in maycomb
including my wife
will be knocking on his door
bringing angel food cakes
to my way of thinking
taking the one man who done
you and this town a big service
and dragging him with his shy
ways into the limelight
to me that a sin
it a sin and im not about
to have it on my head
i may not be much mr finch
but im still sheriff
of maycomb county
and bob ewell fell on his knife
good night sir
mr tate was right
what do you mean
it would be sort of like shooting
a mockingbird wouldnt it
thank you arthur
thank you for my children
neighbours bring food with death
and flowers with sickness and
little things in between
boo was our neighbour
he gave us two soap dolls
a broken watch and chain
a knife
and our lives
one time atticus said
you never really knew a man
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them
just standing on the
radley porch was enough
the summer that had begun
so long ago had ended
and another summer
had taken its place
and a fall and boo
radley had come out
i was to think of these
days many times
of jem and dill and boo
radley and tom robinson
and atticus
he would be in jem
room all night
and he would be there when
jem waked up in the morning
