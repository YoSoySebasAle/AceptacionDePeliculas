master
your mandarin is lousy
it causes my ears discomfort
you bray like an ass
you are not to speak unless spoken to
is it too much to hope
you understand cantonese
i speak japanese very well
i didnt ask if you speak japanese
i asked if you understand cantonese
you are here to learn the mysteries
of kung fu not linguistics
if you cant understand me
i will communicate with you
like l would a dog
when l yell when l point
when l beat you with my stick
bill is your master is he not
your master tells me
youre not entirely unschooled
what training do you possess
the exquisite art of the samurai sword
dont make me laugh
your so-called exquisite art
is only fit for
japanese fat heads
your anger amuses me
do you believe you are my match
no
are you aware l kill at will
yes
is it your wish to die
no
then you must be stupid so stupid
rise and let me look at your
ridiculous face
rise
so my pathetic friend
ls there anything that you can do well
what the matter
cat got your tongue
oh yes you speak japanese
i despise the goddamn japs
go to that rack
remove the sword
let see how good you really are
if
you land a single blow
ill bow down and call you master
from here you can get
an excellent view of my foot
your swordsmanship
is amateur at best
your so-called kung-fu is really
quite pathetic
i asked you to demonstrate
what you know and you did
not a goddamn thing
let see your tiger crane
match my eagle claw
like all yankee women
all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man money
excruciating isnt it
yes
if it was my wish
l could chop your arm off
it my arm now l can do what l please
if you can stop me l suggest you try
i cant
because youre helpless
yes
have you ever felt this before
no
compared to me youre as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle
yes
that the beglnnlng
is it your wish to possess
this kind of power
your training will begin tomorrow
since your arm now belongs to me
l want it strong
can you do that
i can but not that close
then you cant do it
what if your enemy
is three inches in front of you
what do you do then
curl into a ball
or do you put your flst through him
now begin
it the wood that should
fear your hand
not the other way around
no wonder you cant do it
you acquiesce to defeat
before you even begin
if you want to eat like a dog
you can live and sleep
outside like a dog
if you want to live and sleep
like a human
pick up those sticks
elle you treacherous dog
l give you my word
