way out west
there was this fella
fella i wanna tell you about
fella by the name of
jeff lebowski
least that was the handle
that his loving parents gave him
but he never had
much use for it himself
this lebowski
he called himself the dude
now dude
that a name no one would
self-apply where i come from
but then there was a lot about the dude
that didnt make a whole lot of sense to me
and a lot about
where he lived likewise
but then again
maybe that why i found the place
so darned interesting
they call los angeles
the city of angels
i didnt find it to be that
exactly
but ill allow there are
some nice folks there
course i cant say
i seen london
and i never been to france
and i aint never seen no queen
in her damned undies as the fella says
but ill tell you what
after seeing los angeles and this here story
im about to unfold
well i guess
ive seen something
every bit as stupefying as you can see
in any of those other places
and in english too
so i can die with
a smile on my face
without feeling like
the good lord gypped me
now this here story
im about to unfold
took place back
in the early 90s
just about the time of our conflict
with saddam and the iraqis
i only mention it cause
sometimes there a man
i wont say a hero
cause what a hero
but sometimes there a man
and im talking about
the dude here
sometimes there a man
well he the man
for his time and place
he fits right in there
and that the dude
in los angeles
and even if he is a lazy man
and the dude was
most certainly that
quite possibly the laziest
in los angeles county
which would place him high in the running
for laziest worldwide
but sometimes there a man
sometimes there a man
well i lost my train
of thought here
but
hell i done introduced him
enough
with them all
for a collective action
this will not stand
this will not stand
this aggression against kuwait
where the money
lebowski

obstacles overcome
ive accomplished
more than most men
and without
the use of my legs
what makes a man
mr lebowski
dude
oh i dont know sir

brandt will fill you in
on the details
mr lebowski is prepared to make
a generous offer to you to act as courier
once we get instructions
for the money
why me man
he believes the culprits might be
the very people who soiled your rug
and you are in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm that suspicion
he thinks the carpet pissers
did this
well dude

shut the fuck up donny
so how much
did he give you
20 grand man and of course

walter if you cant

then how do you get
around on shabbos
really dude
you surprise me
theyre not gonna

theyre not gonna do shit
what can they do to her
bunch of fucking amateurs
and meanwhile
look at the bottom line
who sitting on a million
fucking dollars
am i wrong
walter
who got a fucking million fucking dollars
sitting in the trunk of our car
our car walter
and what do they got my dirty undies
my fucking whites
say dude
where is your car
who got your undies walter
where your car dude
you dont know walter
it was parked in a handicap zone
perhaps they towed it
you fucking know
it been stolen
well certainly that
a possibility dude
oh fuck it
where you going dude
im going home donny
phone ringing dude
thank you donny
yeah
green with some brown
rust coloration
and was there anything
of value in the car
oh yeah
a tape deck some creedence
tapes and there was a
my briefcase
in the briefcase
papers
just papers
you know my papers
business papers
and what do you do sir
im unemployed
my rug was also stolen
your rug was in the car
no here
separate incidents
the dude is not in
do you find them much
these stolen cars
sometimes
wouldnt hold out much hope
for the tape deck though
or the creedence
what about the briefcase
mr lebowski
id like to see you
call when you get home
and ill send a car for you
my name is maude lebowski
im the one who took your rug
well guess we can close the file
on that one
ill be with you in
a moment mr lebowski
does the female form make you
uncomfortable mr lebowski
is that what this is a picture of
in a sense yes
my art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal
which bothers some men
the word itself makes
some men uncomfortable
vagina
oh yeah
yes they dont like hearing it
and find it difficult to say
whereas without
batting an eye
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his johnson
johnson
all right mr lebowski
let get down to cases
my father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug
but as it was a gift from me to
my late mother it was not his to give
now your face
as for this kidnapping
yes i know all about it
and i know that you acted as courier
let me tell you something
the whole thing stinks to high heaven
yeah right but let me explain
something about the rug
do you like sex
mr lebowski
excuse me
sex the physical act of love coitus
do you like it
i was talking about my rug
youre not interested in sex
you mean coitus
i like it too
it a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex
it can be a natural
zesty enterprise
however there are
some people
it is called satyriasis in men
nymphomania in women
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy
oh no
oh yes mr lebowski
these unfortunate souls cannot love
in the true sense of the word
our mutual acquaintance
bunny is one of these
listen maude
im sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho
but you know i dont see
what this has to do with
you have any kahlua
take a look at this sir
oh i know that guy
he a nihilist
karl hungus
hi
hello
mein dispatcher says there is
something wrong with dein kabel
yeah come on in
im not really sure exactly
what really wrong with the cable
that why they sent me
i am an expert
the tv in here
you recognize her of course
helga bring my tools
that my friend sherry
she just came over
to use the shower
the story is ludicrous
my name is karl
ich bin expert
you must be here
to fix the cable
lord you can imagine
where it goes from here
he fixes the cable
dont be fatuous jeffrey
little matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career in pornography
nor that she has been
banging jackie treehorn
to use the parlance
of our times
however i am one of the two trustees
of the lebowski foundation
the other being my father
the foundation takes
youngsters from watts and
shit yeah the achievers
little lebowski urban achievers yes
and proud we are of all of them
i asked my father about his withdrawal
of $ million from the foundation account
and he told me
about this abduction
but i tell you
it is preposterous
this compulsive fornicator is taking
my father for the proverbial ride
yeah but my
im getting to your rug
my father and i dont get along
he doesnt approve
of my lifestyle and
needless to say
i dont approve of his
however i hardly wish to make my father
embezzlement a police matter
so im proposing that you
try to recover the money
from the people
you delivered it to
well i could do that
if you successfully do so
i will compensate you to the tune of
0% of the recovered sum
a hundred
thousand yes
bones or clams or
whatever you call them
yeah but what about my
your rug yes
well with that money
you can buy any number of rugs
that dont have sentimental
value for me
and i am sorry about
that crack on the jaw
oh that fine
that doesnt even
here the name and number of a doctor
who will look at it for you
you will receive no bill
he a good man
and thorough
that thoughtful but
please see him jeffrey

the check made out that cool
we received this
this morning
since you have
failed to achieve
even in the modest task
which was your charge
since you have
stolen my money
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust
i have no choice
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary
to recover their money
from you jeffrey lebowski
and with brandt as my witness
i will tell you this
any further harm
visited upon bunny

the charities now
and i give him
a reasonable allowance
he has no money of his own
i know how he likes
to present himself
father weakness is vanity

donny was a good bowler

he was one of us
he was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling
and as a surfer he explored the beaches
of southern california
from la jolla to leo carrillo
and up to pismo
he died
he died as so many young men
of his generation before his time
in your wisdom lord
you took him
as you took so many bright
flowering young men
at khe sanh at lan doc
at hill 364
these young men
gave their lives
and so did donny
donny who loved bowling
and so
theodore donald kerabatsos
in accordance with what we think
your dying wishes might well have been
we commit your final
mortal remains
to the bosom of
the pacific ocean
which you loved so well
good night sweet prince
