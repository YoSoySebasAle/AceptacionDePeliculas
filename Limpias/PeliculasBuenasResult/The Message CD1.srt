in the name of god the most gracious the most merciful
from muhammad the messenger of god
to heraclius
the emperor of byzantium greetings to him
who is the follower of righteous guys
i bid you to hear the divine call
i am the messenger of god to the people
accept islam for yourself
he speaks of the new prophet in arabia
was it like this when john the baptist
came to king hsrul out of the desert crying of salvation
to mephocus patriarch of alexandria
kisra emperor of persia
muhammad calls you with the call of god
accept islam for your salvation
embrace islam
you come out of the desert smelling of camel and goat
you stand as persia kneel
muhammad messenger of god
who gave him this authority
god sent muhammad as
a message to mankind
the scholars and historians of islam -
the university of al-azhar in cairo
the high islamic congress of the shiat in lebanon
have approved the accuracy and fidelity of this film
the makers of this film honour the islamic tradition
which holds that the impersonation of the prophet
offends againts the spirituality of his message
therefore the person of muhammad
will not be shown
600 years after christ died
when europe was sunk in the dark ages
and everywhere
the old civilizations were falling
muhammad was born in mecca in arabia
mecca was then a rich trading city
ruled by its merchants
whose wealth was multiplied by a
unique privilege they housed the gods
every year at the time of the great fair
the desert priests brought their idols
and the images of their gods into the custody of kabbaah
months the most holyish reign of abraham
the kabbaah has now
become a house of idology hosting
no fewer than 360 different gods
mecca in 60 ad
bilal
have the other days counted umaya
not yet but this year the gods are gold
when you put the gods and prophet together
its a pretty bit deal
oh more gods in the place of kabbaah
caravans from syria
mm they must be in running very thirsty
put 5 more men in north wells
how many sheeps will i have to kill for them 70
give them a 00
macca should keep her name
for hospitality
and 0 lambs for the leaders
bread and water do the poets have in the hakim house
where verse and prose are nightly
put to slaughter
and and the bread i swear in there
is thinner than the water
oh open the space open the space
you lovers of poetry
to abu sufian willing and which
patron of the art
when abu sufian invites the poet in there joy is
kids and love is kin
where wines and cakes abound
the skills of abu sufian
all revels and all songs begin
when abu sufian invites the poet in
roman silk worms of china my lady
a pleasure to the lin and as my lady can see
ravish to the eyes
yes 7 lengths
20 dinars
abu sufian wife 5
oh gold
the gods of the kabbaah have their needs
they are acives
who is that man who stood there
who looked into my soul
cut me away from here
why did muhammad come down here
why dont you stop him
he is your nephew
maybe he will change
change
he is 40 years old
its unnatural with a rich wife he could afford the best of mecca
if he chooses to sit shivering in a cave
it is unnatural
for a man who dares to risk the anger of
lath-uzza who keeps our health
mannat the god of our prosperity
allot the god of our family and tribes
and hubar
hubar who starts our caravans
and predicts our fate
to challenge the gods within a year
sort of the gods is dangerous
unreasonable
rebellious blasphemous
yes im afraid muhammad will harm himself
i am always sad
when the great fair is over
i might not see the next one
abu talib abu talib
catch your breath zaid
has muhammad come down from the mountain yet
he been there for 3 days
no no i havent seen him
khadija hoped he might have come to you
on his way home
maybe he still up there
3 days
im afraid for him on the mountain
because i dont know what it means
men see the world too well from a mountain
muhammad read
in the name of the lord who created
man from his sensitive drop of blood
teaches man what he knows not
read
he still trembling under the blanket but he has spoken
zaid what happened to my nephew on the mountain
he was alone in the cave
suddenly an angel came on to him
the angel said read
muhammad replied i can not read
the angle commanded again read
in the name of our lord
who created man from his sensitive drop of blood
who teaches man what he knows not read
who knows if it was gabriel
it could have been a dream
when muhammad was coming from the mountain
he saw gabriel cleanly
in the shape of a man
standing on the horizon
wherever he looked upon every turn of his head
he saw him
gabriel said to him again i am gabriel and
you muhammad are the messenger of god
who has he told about this
his wife
and ali
and his friend abu bakr
and you
i am his adopted son
be careful to whom you talk
tell him his uncle who protected him
when he was a child will protect him still
after all they say the god of moses
spoke to him under the burning bush
if you do not restrain your nephew then we will
he dividing the city heart against hopes
he dividing the generations
child against parent
the young are listening to him he attract the yound
we are arabs we obey our fathers
our children cannot be our teachers
how can we accept that
the man we met in the street yesterday
can be some god prophet today
dead ones can live again he says
because he who created man
can also make man return from the dead he says
the gods might leave us and
give their benefits to another city
tell him we will give him authority position
and key to the kabbaah
and money what money he wants
tell him we will give him anything he wants
muhammad spare yourself and me
do not put a great burden on
an old man who cant bear
in your childhood you were in my arms
i cannot see you hurt
if you refuse them they will hurt you
he said this to me
were they to put sun in my right hand
and the moon in my left
i would not renounce my message
which is from god
when i am dead you may do as you please
but last time in your life
you will believe your father
why did you hurt your father
if id be drunk every day and played dice
every night youd call it high spirits
youll be more my brother than you are now
you are all my children
i give you everything i could but it seems
not to be enough
muhammad gives me more he give all the world more
get him out of here father
its not worth it he our father
you torture him
wait hudaifa wait
how can they say its an invention musab
when it isnt new
in mecca it new
if god has said it all before to noah moses jesus to all of prophets
but people changed it turned it forgot it
now god said it to muhammad again
and it is new again
what is it
it jafar
what have you brought with you
the very word of god
when the sun is overthrown
when the stars fall
when the mountains vanish
when the camels bid with yound abandoned
when the wild beasts are herded together
when the seas rise
when the souls are sorted
when the female infant who is buried alive
asks for what crime she was killed
when the books are opened
when the sky is torn away
then every soul will know what it has done
you were there jafar when god
gave him these words
dawn is coming up
ammar you first then you jafar
ammar you keep your mother awake
all night with worry
i am sorry father
where were you
have you been with muhammad again
what will happen now
forgive him it was my fault i did it
that god has helped us all our lives
if it fell it could not help itself
what talks have you been listening to
the real god is unseen
he not made of clay
ammar we see the gods in the kabbaah every day
i am afraid for you
you are listening to people who will hurt you
im listening to muhammad mother
muhammad is generous yes he gives he shares
he pass no man without a smile
but he is spreading dangerous ideas
dangerous ideas that no man should start
that the rich should not afload the poor
the strong should not oppress the weak
are these dangerous ideas
girls should not be forced into marriage
but be able to choose or refuse
but only tonight he said to stop
the burial of new-born girls
i was fortunate always fortunate with your mother
yes but you know that you and i nearly never met yassar
and you were nearly never born
i was to be buried
like my 2 sisters
but my father couldnt do it
he couldnt do it at that time
when the second girl was buried
when my father was putting sand over her
finger raised him as do babies
told her mother afterwards
she took hold of his finger the way baby does
he told my mother afterwards that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased
and he had taken away his hand
when i was born my father ran out of the house
screaming that he couldnt do it again
that he could never do it again
sumaya it is the custom
but it is wrong
the gods that let such things be are no gods
i promised to go to muhammad house mama
and pray there
yes he is a good man
yes yes you go
two men are following him
read
muhammad can neither write nor read
muhammad can speak
what did you say
he can speak well so can you
so now you speak up yound man
what does muhammad say umm
they are god words not his
which god what words
a speaking god
your muhammad speaks only to himself
when god reveals his message to muhammad
he remembers every word and
then he tells it to those who can write
it is the quran
muhammad has starved himself into dreams
he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut
his eyes are shut but his heart is open
you kick him for his cleverness
there is no need for hasts
doesnt muhammad realize that we live by housing
to the gods
we own the kabbaah
every year the tribes of arabia come here
to mecca to pray and to buy from us
now were we to replace 300
gods with just one
whom we cannot even see was supposed to be in taif and medina
here in my house in jerusalem on the moon
where would mecca be then
the gods are both our vision and our revenue
you cannot buy and sell god
young man you are close to be whipped
ammar be sensible boy
i have a question
muhammad teaches you
a slave is equal to his master
this black bilal i paid money for is equal to me
yes muhammad says before god all
men are equal as the teeth of a gum
this is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars
it gives them pretensions
bilal teach this man the difference between the lord of mecca and a slave
take that whip
lash his face to teach an enormous lesson
whip him whip him
cut him
whip him
do it bilal
obey them they will kill you
so you want anarchy to bring
they even infected our slaves
if youre human enough to have gods
remember that there are gods for your owner
i bought humanity bilal
when i bought you
you will be corrected
one one god
there is only one god
who is stronger now your master
or this one god of yours
one god there is only one god
bring the stones
one god one god one god
crush him
are you finished with him
there is only one god
you could swear the slave was preaching
lord umaya
abu bakr will pay 00 dinars for this slave
wait now
it against our social order
to sell a slave during his punishment
the offer is to lord umaya
if the price of slaves is raised
we shall have to pay ourselves next year
take him he is no use to me anymore
kill him or take him more im finished with him
we are declaring ourselves
god has told his messenger to declare islam to all men
open the windows
let the world hear
we are coming out of the darkness
hear well the word of god
hear well the messenger of lord
there are no other gods but god and muhammad is his messenger
we have come into light join us on the way to the kabbah
god is most great god is most great
god has no partner we have come into light
join us on the way to kabbah
muhammad and his rebellion called islam
are coming out
to fall our gods
and de-throw our religion
dont let them reach the kabbaah
throw them back defend your gods
there is no gods but god and
muhammad is the messenger of god
protect the prophet
there is no gods but god and
muhammad is the messenger of god
there is no gods but god and
muhammad is the messenger of god
guards
god is great
blasphemy ldiot
god is great
there is no gods but god and
muhammad is the messenger of god
now the time to break them
there are only 30 of them
no weve done enough
more will only create sympathy for them
god is great
in the name of god most gracious most merciful
say o you who reject faith
i worship not other
get out of kabbaah
silence your a false prophet stop
back to the corner
hamza hamza
you are brave
he is the bravest man in the desert
and he meets men unarmed
muhammad is a liar
liar if you dont let him speak
where the lie and where the truth
when it hasnt been spoken yet
muhammad is a fraud
stand up hit me back if you dare
i affirm my nephew religion
and i say what he says
who ever has the courage to fight
to fight with me
muhammed when i hunt the desert at night
i know that god is not kept in a house
whod have thought that hamza hamza above all
with his wine drinking lion hunting
will come to join muhammad
more we attack more seem to join him
where does he find his words
i dont know
how can an illiterate man go up on a mountain
and come back 3 days later blazing with poetry
it wasnt just only poetry he says it god
how do we fight someone
whose strength we do not understand
muhammad promises heaven trees in the skies
it natural he found audience
then we must make that audience
less eager to listen to him
we will begin with the weaker ones
have mercy
left hand
who is your god answer me
say it say who is your god
say it
there is only one god and
muhammad is the messenger of god
ammar
your father and mother are the first martyrs of islam
you are promised paradise
how much are you men prepared to suffer
the prophet has said we must leave mecca
if we stay they will kill you
one by one
mohamed says in abinisia there is a christian king
no man is wronged in his country
we must leave now today
usman
lord is great
let us go
we found their tracks and followed them
but they just disappeared
they were there in the desert under the vultures
and you let them escape you
escape they vanished
if muhammed has stayed then only the weakest are gone
weak or strong they blacken our name
we are honest merchants  we buy and sell in good faith
we cannot afford scandal
amr
you are a friend of najjasi the king
yes
can you use that friendship
i think i can bring them back
yes
abisinia
rise up amr
please nothing you may ask for that we will not give
lion of judah i i dont know where to begin
you have our friendship begin there
certain run-away slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom
slaves go back
or you agree to return your slaves back to us
there are however some free men among them
rebels
rebels
if there are disagreements in arabia
why am i not informed
they are rebels in religion
at one time are another
all religions were rebellions
the bodies of slaves of the world
if bidden are in-disposed
but as jesus christ as a shepherd
the souls of men are his sheep
these are arabs who have betrayed
the religion of their fathers
they follow a lunatic they call prophet
but i cannot put souls into chains
without hearing them
good theyr stiff
next they will hang them
do you not now yourself before your prophet
muhammad is a man
we kneel only to god
where are muhammad miracles jafar
if he were a prophet
hed lit the sky with miracles
indeed this is true
god has given his prophets
signs of miracles that we may recognize them
the miracle of muhammad is the holy quran
a book a book written by an illiterate
attributed to god
i think the emperor heard enough
a mind full of pedicast
when god set down
tons of fire upon the heads of christ of puzzles
so that they can speak the many languages of the world
that they knew not before
but do such miracles happen in our time
ive heard enough youve made a poor case
when we suffered persecution in mecca
muhammad told us go to abyssinia
the land of the righteous king
where no man is wronged
what they call persecution was fair punishment
that is order
why did your prophet send you to me
because you believe in the book of the one god as we do
he sent us because
in your heart god will protect us
talking with him is like
drawing water from a mirage
but now theyd let the judy on me listen to them my friend
go on
for years we worshiped wood and stone
images of our own manufacture
we lived in ignorance of god
we had some earthly laws
and no heavenly laws
the rich neglect the poor
and the natural pity of man
thereby lifts up when his brother has fallen
this is described by them as upsetting
social order
to this inhumanity has come a man
whom god chose and in that we believe
youve overcome i beg you to collect yourself
i speak of the messenger of god
muhammad teaches us to worship one god
to speak truth
to love our neighbors as ourselves
to give charity even a smile can be charity
to protect women from misuse
to shelter orphans
and to turn away from gods of wood and stone
i cannot be still and hear this blasphemy
we are an ancient civilization
to call our gods wood and stone
is to speak ignorantly of them
the idol we home is not what we worship
but the spirit that resides within the form
i agree that idolatry is
not always fully understood
thank you
now let me bring him back to the women
god made woman to be the proper companion of man
she is different but equal
equal we buy them
feed them perl them
use them distorb them
women equal to us
god created man from one male and one female
amr you must respect the woman womb that bore you
why are you 300 guards so tongue-tied
what is only god is rependent
god has spoken to us before
through abraham noah moses and through jesus christ
why should we so surprised when god speaks to us now through muhammad
who taught you those names
they are named in the quran
i knew muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep
and you knew christ as a carpenter
what christ says and
what your muhammad says
is like two raised from the same land
theyr lieing to you
they deny christ
you worship 3 gods they say father son and holy ghost theyr saying
what do you say of christ
they say god can not have a son
christ is not the son of god
speak to me of christ
we say of christ what our prophet has told us
that god cast his holy spirit into
the womb of a virgin named mary and that
she conceived christ the apostle of god
apostol he says not a son not a son
what does your miracle your quran
say of the breadth by the lord jesus christ
may i relate the words
come closer to me
in the name of god most gracious most merciful
relate in the book the story of mary
how she was grew away from her family
to a place in the east
how we sent her an angel called gabriel who said
i am a messenger from your god
to announce the birth of a holy son to you
she said how shall i mary have a son when no man has touched me
and gabriel replied for your lord says
it will happen
we appoint him as a sign on to man
and a mercy from us
it is a thing or didnt
the difference between us and you
is not bigger than this line
not for a mountain of gold
will i give them up to you
you may live in abyssinia in peace as long as you wish
may god blessings be upon you when you return
lntolerable mohamed disturbs
even our foreign alliences
very well we will make him give up on him
abu talib has his arms around him
very well  we will throw uncle and nephew out
in one bundle his whole family out
we will expel them from ourselves
no merchant make trade with them
no land remain to them
no roof shelter them
no beggar pay for them
no woman marry them
until they renounce their trend
these were the worst years of muhammad life
for 3 years they suffered the hunger thirst
cruelty of the open desert
but the year of grief was still to come
when khatija muhammad wife for 24 years died
when abu talib his old protector died
with his last breath abu talib tried again
to reconsile mecca and muhammad
he never asked more from you
when one word
one one god
if it was only a question of one word
id have given him 0 words
but the word he wants would dethrown all the gods
you were afraid even to hear him
with the death of his uncle muhammad has now
lost all protection
he was no longer safe in mecca
alone with zaid his adopted son
he went to the hillside town of taif
he asked to be taken in to be allowed to preach
but the children of taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert
what are you doing
stop stop leave him alone wait
muhammad called this the bitterest day of his life
then miraculously when muhammad mission
seemed to have failed his entire situation changed
a deputation from the rich but self-destroying
city of medina met him by night at the rock of agaba
asking him to come to them to stand between their factions
to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars
muhammad agreed provided they gave him a pledge
that they worship the one god only
wait when we take this pledge
we expel ourselves from the rest of arabia
so wait
war is in this pledge
well make enemies of brothers
well make firewood of our gods
that is the meaning of the pledge
if we take it there can be no turning back
for muhammad is indeed the messenger of god
foretold to jews in our city
so if anyone has doubt in this pledge go now
and if you have no doubts then you do as i do
i pledge myself to the one and only god
and to you muhammad the messenger of god
he is of us and we are of him
leave him bring his followers
our brothers to use to medina
it was a journey that changed the world
the hijrah of flight to medina
only 70 people split up into small groups
walking 250 miles of desert
yet so profound with the consequences
so lasting with the effects of this walk
that from it the muslims take their calendar
in this moment islam found its future
muhammad himself stayed in mecca
in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely
muhammad has become a nation
he has received a city entering into pledges and treaties
and you salool who claim to be king of medina
lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed
you should worry about yourself abu sufian
every time you trade a whif of perfume of the city
you must creep past that man in medina
he is across your merchantile throats as we speak
and what do you intend to do
l intend to wait
and how long will you wait
till you and the rest of arabia remove him
to save your way of life
and while you wait
i should accept his call of course
to think i will give him my birth-rite
i will not
medina is worth the conversion
hypocrisy
of course its the healthy hypocrisy
king salool why put your head on the floor
5 times a day praying i dont believe you
he may not have to
well we do know we should have done it before
kill muhammad
come
come and see
they say that practice leads to perfection
7 young men each from a different family
my own son ikrima is with them
they will stab him together
if the responsibility for his death
is shared where lies the guilty my idea
im not sure im part of it
muhammad body contains too much
his mind his words
