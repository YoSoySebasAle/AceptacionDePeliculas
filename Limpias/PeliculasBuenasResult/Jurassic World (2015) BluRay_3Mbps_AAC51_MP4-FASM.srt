welcome to jurassic world
while year over year
revenue continues to climb
operating costs
are higher than ever
our shareholders have been patient
but let be honest
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore
twenty years ago
de-extinction was right up there with magic
these days kids
look at a stegosaurus
like an elephant
from the city zoo
that doesnt mean
asset development is falling behind
our dna excavators
discover new species every year
but consumers want them bigger
louder more teeth
the good news
our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier
weve learned more from
genetics in the past decade
than a century of
digging up bones
so
when you say you want to
sponsor an attraction
what do you have in mind
we want to be thrilled
dont we all
the indominus rex
our first genetically
modified hybrid
how did you get two different
kinds of dinosaurs to you know
oh indominus wasnt bred
she was designed
she will be 50 feet
long when fully grown
bigger than the t rex
every time weve unveiled a new asset
attendance has spiked
global news coverage
celebrity visitors
eyes of the world
when will she be ready
she already is
gray come on
zach relax
come on
dude chill
woman on pa welcome
to the innovation center
where technology
meets prehistory
<font color=#d900d9>bellowing
man on pa the triceratops can go
horn-to-tooth with the apex predators
literally meaning
three-horned face in greek
triceratops is
half as tall as t rex
as one-hundred
trillion tons of tnt
turn its head back
to look over its shoulder
to better aim the swing
of its dangerous tail
cytosine guanine
adenine and thymine
the same four things in
everything that ever lived
hey dont wander off
all right
mom not paying
me for babysitting
claire gray is that you
gray aunt claire
okay yeah

my nephews are here
hi

i really wish that i could
but tomorrow i can take you

scenes and all of that
that gonna be cool right
<font color=#d900d9>cell phone beeps
okay so i will see
you tonight at 600
no dont forget you have the
right of course
i will see you tonight at 800
what time do you go to sleep
or do you go to sleep at different times
<font color=#d900d9>cell phone continues beeping
okay so have fun
and take very good
care of them okay
yeah no im here
man  on radio it those two juvenile triceratops
theyre going at it again
should i tranq them
or are you
coming over to
take care of this
man 2 on radio
go ahead and tranq them
man  on radio
theyre running
what the live count
any incidents
lowery yes
six kids in the lost and found
28 down with heatstroke
where did you get that
oh this i got it on ebay
yeah it pretty amazing
i got it for $50
but the mint condition one goes for $300
didnt occur to you maybe
that in poor taste
the shirt
yeah no it did
i understand people died
it was terrible but that first park was legit
i have a lot of respect for it
they didnt need
these genetic hybrids
they just needed dinosaurs
real dinosaurs
okay please dont wear it again
that kind of enough
yeah i wasnt gonna
did you close the deal
claire looks like it
verizon wireless
presents the indominus rex
ugh that is so terrible
why not just go
the distance claire
and just let these corporations
name the dinosaurs
theyve got all the ballparks
why stop there
why are the west plains closed
another pachy roaming
outside his zone
but he fully sedated
and ready for relocation
pepsi-saurus
or tostito-don
security said
the invisible fences were a no-fail
that is the second
time this month
vivian well the pachys short out
their implants when they butt heads
how much longer
until they get it out of there
he just got five
milligrams of carfentanil
yes he very stoned
so why dont we show a little sympathy
i mean you do understand
these are actual animals right
clean up your workspace
it chaotic
i like to think of
it as a living system
just enough stability
to keep it from collapsing into anarchy
man on radio
inbound chopper
jurassic  eta 5 minutes
claire
mr masrani
you are flying
i got my license
two more
well two more days
okay
so
how my park doing
claire great
were up 25% over last year
a bit lower than our
initial projection
no no no how it doing
are the guests having fun
are the animals enjoying life
well guest
satisfaction is steady in the low 90s
we dont have a way to measure
the animals emotional experience
sure you do
you can see in their eyes
right
of course <font color=#d900d9>chuckles
okay now show me
my new dinosaur
<font color=#d900d9>gasps
masrani oh
got it
got it
oh my
you look tense claire
maybe you should just
focus on the controls
the key to a happy
life is to accept
you are never
actually in control
bird
you should spend a day at the beach
get some sun
uh right so
marketing thought
we could offset some of the costs by
enough about cost
john hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish
and not once did
he mention profits
spare no expense
he used to say
i appreciate that
but the reality of operating
a theme park requires
dont forget why we
built this place claire
jurassic world exists to
remind us how very small we are
how new you cant
put a price on that
now please were flying
breathe
<font color=#ffd9>facebookcom/groups/getdirectlink/
in this group you will be able to get direct download link of movies and tv shows
is he okay
are you okay
he just being dramatic
are you still building
we planned to open in may
but asset containment insisted
we build the walls up higher
it bigger than expected
it a good sign
we hit a few
speed bumps early on
it began to anticipate
where the food would come from
one of the handlers
nearly lost an arm
the others threatened to quit if
i couldnt guarantee their safety
she intelligent then
for a dinosaur
and that
it tried to break the glass
i like her spirit
<font color=#d900d9>growling
it white you never
told me it was white
think it will scare the kids
the kids
this will give the
parents nightmares
is that good
it fantastic
can she see us
they say it can
sense thermal radiation
like snakes
i thought there
were two of them
there was a sibling
in case this one didnt survive infancy
where the sibling
she ate it
<font color=#d900d9>sighs
so the paddock is
quite safe then
we have the best
structural engineers in the world
yeah so did hammond
there an american
navy man here
part of a research program
one of my companies is running
owen grady
i know who he is
masrani his animals
often try to escape
they are smart
he has to be smarter
he only thinks he smarter
i want you to bring him in
let him inspect the paddock
maybe he sees
something we cant
<font color=#d900d9>monkey chittering
<font color=#d900d9>squealing
owen hold
hey
okay
eyes on me
blue
blue
<font color=#d900d9>clicker clicking
watch it
charlie hey
dont give me that shit
delta
lock it up
good
and were moving
hold
that good
that is damn good
<font color=#d900d9>clicker clicking
very good
see charlie
that what you get
echo there you go
delta
blue
this one for you
hold
eyes up
go
<font color=#d900d9>all laughing
you finally did it man
hoskins owen
i was starting to think
i hired the wrong guys
but damn you got them
eating out of your palm
you came on a good day
it not usually a happy ending
is that why youre not
sending in your reports
weve been busy
not too busy to
cash your paychecks
what do you need buddy
a field test
hey ive just seen they can
respond to commands
we need to take the research
and get it on its feet
these are wild animals hoskins
trust me you dont
want them in the field
i just saw a bond
a real bond
between man and beast
youre in my way
come on
were the same
were dogs of war
we know that the military
needs to reduce casualties
some people think that
robots are the future
look nature gave
us the most effective
killing machines 75
million years ago
and now we know
they can take orders
we finally make progress
and that the first thing he says
make a weapon
shit
come on gents
it grown-up time
drones cant search tunnels and caves
and theyre hackable
the minute a real
war breaks out
all that fancy
tech is gonna go dark
but that tech not gonna eat them
if they forget to feed it
look at these creatures
theyve got millions
of years of instinct in their cells
instinct that we can program
their loyalty cannot be bought
these guys are gonna run
straight into the enemy
teeth and eat them
belt buckle and all
what if they decide
they wanna be in control
well then we remind them who is
we terminate the rogues
promote only loyal bloodlines
<font color=#d900d9>scoffs
what what so funny
<font color=#d900d9>whistles
i dont know
you come here
and you dont learn
anything about these animals
except what you want to know
you made them
and now you think you own them
we do own them
extinct animals have no rights
theyre not extinct
anymore hoskins
exactly were
sitting on a goldmine
and masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo
owen he just wants to teach people
some humility he doesnt make weapons
<font color=#d900d9>chuckling you think that the eighth
richest man in the world
is only into oil telecom
and family fun parks
he so diversified
he doesnt even know what he owns
how long has ingen
been practicing this pitch
since the day we hired you out of the navy
you knew the end game
these animals can replace
thousands of boots on the ground
how many lives
would that save
<font color=#d900d9>buzzes
war is part of nature
look around owen
every living thing in this jungle
is trying to murder the other
mother nature way of
testing her creations
refining the pecking order
war is a struggle
struggle breeds greatness
without that
we end up with places like this
charge seven bucks a soda
do you hear yourself
when you talk
this is gonna happen
with or without you boys
progress always wins man
maybe progress
should lose for once
<font color=#d900d9>pig squealing
man pig loose
pig loose
<font color=#d900d9>shouting
<font color=#d900d9>growling
owen no
no hold your fire
hold your fire
do not fire
put 2 amps in these animals
theyre never gonna trust me again
owen blue stand down
stand down
hey what did i just say
delta i see you
back up
okay
good
good
charlie

<font color=#d900d9>cell phone ringing
hey karen
karen on phone

<font color=#d900d9>sighs
yeah look today turned

theyre in great hands
theyre with my assistant
she british
so they invented nannies
wait are you crying
this was supposed to be
a family weekend claire
you havent seen
the boys in forever
and i know how zach will treat gray
if theyre by themselves
and he can just be so mean
okay im sorry
tomorrow im gonna spend
the entire day with them
im going to take off work
and i will not leave their side
i promise
well a promise tomorrow

ew youre using

oh my god
i am using mom lines
im sorry but you know
i have to tell you they work
youll see when you have kids
yeah if
when it worth it
bye mom
bye
what do they want now
claire mr grady
i need you to come
take a look at something
why are you calling
me mr grady
owen
if youre not too busy
im pretty busy
we have an attraction
that not what you said
the last time i saw you
im talking about
the dinosaurs mr grady
owen
a new species weve made
<font color=#d900d9>fly buzzing
you just went and
made a new dinosaur
yeah it kind
of what we do here
the exhibit opens to the public
in three weeks
mr masrani wanted me
to consult with you
you wanna consult
here or in my bungalow
that not funny
<font color=#d900d9>laughs
a little funny
wed like you to evaluate the
paddock for vulnerabilities
why me
i guess mr masrani thinks
since youre able to control the raptors
it all about control with you
i dont control the raptors
it a relationship
it based on mutual respect
that why you and i
never had a second date
excuse me
i never wanted a second date
who prints out an
itinerary for a night out
im an organized person
what kind of a diet
doesnt allow tequila
all of them
actually
and what kind of a man shows
up to a date in board shorts
it central america
it hot okay okay
can we just focus
on the asset please
the asset
look i get it
youre in charge out here
you gotta make a lot
of tough decisions
it probably easier
to pretend these animals
are just numbers
on a spreadsheet
but theyre not
theyre alive
im fully aware theyre alive
you might have made them in a test tube
but they dont know that
theyre thinking
i gotta eat
i gotta hunt i gotta
you can relate to at
least one of those things
right
ill be in the car
you might want to
change your shirt
theyre very sensitive to smell
woman on microphone
the mosasaurus
was thought to have
hunted near the surface of the water
where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into
including turtles large fish
even smaller mosasaurs
okay folks let see if she still
hungry after already eating today
she a little shy so be nice and
give her a hand when she comes out
zach zach
the mosasaurus
<font color=#d900d9>growling
<font color=#d900d9>all gasping
oh my god
that was awesome
woman hold on tight
were gonna give you
an even closer look at our mosasaurus
it had 88 teeth
<font color=#d900d9>laughs
wanna see something else cool
yeah
claire weve been
pre-booking tickets for months
the park needs a new
attraction every few years
in order to reinvigorate
the public interest
kind of like the space program
corporate felt genetic modification
would up the wow factor
theyre dinosaurs
wow enough
not according to
our focus groups
the indominus rex
makes us relevant again
<font color=#d900d9>chuckling
the indominus rex
we needed something scary
and easy to pronounce
you should hear
a four-year-old
try to say
archaeornithomimus
you should hear
you try to say it
so what this thing made of
the base genome is a t rex
the rest is classified
you made a new dinosaur
but you dont even know what it is
the lab delivers
us finished assets
and we show
them to the public
can we drop a steer please
how long has the
animal been in here
all its life
never seen anything
outside of these walls
we cant exactly walk it
and you feed it with that
is there a problem
animals raised in isolation arent
always the most functional
your raptors are
born in captivity
with siblings
they learn social skills
and i imprint on
them when theyre born
there trust
the only positive relationship this
animal has is with that crane
at least she
knows that means food
so she needs a friend
we should schedule play-dates
that sort of thing
probably not a good idea
where is it
is it in the basement
is there a downstairs
maybe it in the rec room
it was just here
we were just here
<font color=#d900d9>buzzing
guard oh shit
that doesnt make any sense
these doors havent
been opened in weeks
were those claw
marks always there
do you think it
oh god
she has an
implant in her back
i can track it
from the control room
we have an asset
out of containment
put acu on alert
this is not a drill
lowery even though i didnt
meet him until i was 3
i definitely consider carl to be
more of a dad
than my real dad
<font color=#d900d9>beeping
<font color=#d900d9>telephone ringing
yeah hello
claire lowery
get me coordinates
on the indominus
okay yeah
im doing it right now
guard that wall
is 40 feet high
do you really think
she could have climbed out
it depends
on what
what kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab
lowery wait what the hell
<font color=#d900d9>beeping
it in the cage
no that impossible
i was just there
claire im telling you
she in the cage
wait a sec
there are people in there
<font color=#d900d9>gasps
get them out of there now
now
paddock  this is control
you need to evacuate the containment area
vivian on radio
<font color=#d900d9>distorted paddock
paddock  do you copy
yeah what the problem
it in the cage
it in there with you
go
<font color=#d900d9>whimpers
<font color=#d900d9>growls softly
<font color=#d900d9>man shouting
masrani close the door
<font color=#d900d9>alarm beeping
we cant lock him in there
with that thing close it now
clare somebody talk to me
what is happening
<font color=#d900d9>growling
shit
<font color=#d900d9>whimpering
<font color=#d900d9>growling
<font color=#d900d9>sighs
<font color=#d900d9>door beeps
everyone remain calm
the implant will shock it
if it gets too close to a perimeter fence
okay it moving
really fast
this is control
put out a park-wide alert
hang up that
damn phone please
sorry im getting new information
everything fine
let asset containment
capture it quietly
the very existence of this park is
predicated on our ability
to handle incidents like this
it was an eventuality okay
you should put
that in the brochure
eventually one of these
things will eat somebody
that paddock is four miles
from the closest attraction
acu can handle this
no one else is gonna get
eaten
man on radio to all units
this is a non-lethal operation understood
<font color=#d900d9>beeping
<font color=#d900d9>speaking in french
hoskins how
fast can they run
forty
fifty when theyre hungry
ooh
you ever open them up
see what they can do
no
<font color=#d900d9>loud thud
oh shit
<font color=#d900d9>laughs
that got me
it got me
what do you think
want to take one home
hey dont joke
when i was your age
i rescued a wolf pup
<font color=#d900d9>growling
it was like two months old
it could barely walk
it used to sleep by my bed
watch over me
my wife she came at
me with a steak knife
it took a chunk
out of her arm
did you put him down
hell no
we had an unshakeable
bond you know
just like you and
what his name
delta and she a girl
can i
<font color=#d900d9>shushing
oh wow
<font color=#d900d9>beeping
<font color=#d900d9>speaking in french

they said we lost two guys
hoskins what a code 9
man 2 that indominus
asset out of containment
these people
they never learn
theyre gonna learn all kinds of things
about their new asset now
hey yeah it me
we might have an opportunity here
you guys been here before
if mom and dad get divorced
will one of us be with mom
and the other with dad
what why would
you say that
because they are
no theyre not getting
theyre not getting divorced
look you havent been around long enough
theyve always been that way
they get mail from
two different lawyers
that doesnt mean anything
i googled
theyre divorce lawyers
all right whatever
you know what
it doesnt matter okay
im gonna be gone
in two years anyway
i mean all my friends
parents are divorced
<font color=#d900d9>crying softly
hey knock it off
youre gonna cry
look youre gonna get
two of everything right
youre gonna get two birthdays
two thanksgivings two
i dont want
two of everything
yeah well
it not up to you
all right there a point
you have to grow up
<font color=#d900d9>growling
<font color=#d900d9>door beeps
guard i need to see a badge
sir i need to see a badge
what the hell happened out there
sir
there are thermal cameras
all over that paddock
she did not just disappear
<font color=#d900d9>sighs
it must have been
some kind of a technical malfunction
were you not watching
she marked up that
wall as a distraction
she wanted us to
think she escaped
hold on we are talking
about an animal here
a highly intelligent animal
400 meters to the beacon
youre going after
her with non-lethals
we have $26 million invested in that asset
we cant just kill it
those men are gonna die
vivian 300 meters
to the beacon
owen you need to call this
mission off right now
lowery theyre
right on top of it
call it off right now
you are not in control here
<font color=#d900d9>distant beeping
<font color=#d900d9>beeping accelerates
blood not clotted yet
it close
what is that
that her tracking implant
she clawed it out
claire how would
it know to do that
she remembered
where they put it in
<font color=#d900d9>squealing
<font color=#d900d9>twigs snapping
<font color=#d900d9>growling

<font color=#d900d9>beeping
<font color=#d900d9>man shouting
<font color=#d900d9>beeping
evacuate the island
wed never reopen
you made a genetic hybrid
raised it in captivity
she is seeing all of
this for the first time
she does not even
know what she is
she will kill
everything that moves
do you think the animal
is contemplating its own existence
she is learning where
she fits in the food chain
and im not sure
you want her to figure that out
now asset containment
can use live ammunition
in an emergency situation
you have an m34
in your armory
put it on a chopper
and smoke this thing
we have families here
im not gonna turn this place
into some kind of a war zone
you already have
mr grady if youre not gonna help
there no reason for you to be in here
<font color=#d900d9>clattering
i would have a word with
your people in the lab
that thing out there
that no dinosaur
<font color=#d900d9>men speaking indistinctly on radio
claire okay
im going to close everything
north of the resort
this is a phase one real world
bring everyone in
this is a phase one
real world
i repeat
this is a phase one
bring everyone back in
gray did you know
the soft tissue is preserved
because the iron in the dinosaur blood
generates free radicals
and those are highly reactive
so the proteins and the cell
membranes get all mixed up
and act as a
natural preservative
dna can survive for
millennia that way
see now even if the amber mines dry up
theyll still have bones
shut up
what do you think gonna happen
from you just staring at them
<font color=#d900d9>giggling
thanks man
youre welcome
enjoy the ride
man on pa pregnant women
and those who suffer from motion sickness
should consult with a doctor
before riding this ride
enjoy the ride
<font color=#d900d9>ringing
hello
seriously
sorry folks the ride is closed
<font color=#d900d9>all clamoring
everyone needs to proceed to
the monorail and exit towards the
<font color=#d900d9>all speaking indistinctly
come on guys
i just work here
woman on pa due to technical difficulties
all our exhibits are now closed
<font color=#d900d9>woman on pa speaking in portuguese
dr wu you know
that im not at liberty
to reveal the asset
genetic makeup
modified animals are
known to be unpredictable
it killed people henry
that unfortunate
what purpose could we
have for a dinosaur that can camouflage
cuttlefish genes were added
to help her withstand
an accelerated growth rate
cuttlefish have chromatophores that allow
the skin to change color
it hid from thermal technology
really
how is that possible
tree frogs can modulate
their infrared output
we used strands from their dna to
adapt her to a tropical climate
but i never imagined
who authorized you to do this
you did
bigger
scarier um
cooler i believe is the word that
you used in your memo
you cannot have an animal
with exaggerated predator features
without the corresponding
behavioral traits
what youre doing here
what you have done
the board will
shut down this park
seize your work
everything youve built
and hammond wont be there
to protect you this time
all of this exists
because of me
if i dont innovate
somebody else will
you are to cease
all activities here immediately
you are acting like we are engaged
in some kind of mad science
but we are doing
what we have done from the beginning
nothing in jurassic
world is natural
we have always filled gaps in the
genome with the dna of other animals
and if their
genetic code was pure
many of them would
look quite different
but you didnt ask for reality
you asked for more teeth
i never asked for a monster
monster is a relative term
to a canary
a cat is a monster
were just used
to being the cat
hey there
im jimmy fallon
welcome aboard the gyrosphere
an amazing machine
made possible by science
your safety is our main concern
which is why youre behind
our invisible barrier system
which protects you from things
like dilophosaurus venom
one drop of this
can paralyze you so watch out
is this real it is
and for added protection
each vehicle is surrounded by
aluminum oxynitride glass
so tough it can stop
a 50-caliber bullet
<font color=#d900d9>clattering
the gyroscopic technology
will keep you upright at all times
where are they
so youve got nothing to worry about
oh man

grandpa old malibu right
yeah
lowery every time this thing kills
it moves further south
it headed right for the park
why would she come here
she can sense thermal radiation
our emergency measures
just put all the warm
bodies in one place
sir
ingen
hoskins
i know who you are
then you know
why im here
ive been working
for two years
on an application
for those raptors
they can hunt and
kill that creature
but your program
was to test their intelligence
yeah it was
and we did
and in the process
we learned something
they follow orders
you see the
solution to your crisis
is standing right
in front of you
let me be
as clear as i can
no velociraptors
are going to be set loose on this island
oh shit
youre out of your mind
what are you going to do
with all these people
you got 20000 people here
what are you going to do
they have no place to go
that thing is a killing machine
and it will not stop
masran i okay
i intend to personally
look into your project
to determine its viability within
the moral principles of this company
okay boss
what your next move
sir i cant get
a hold of your instructor
never mind
he likely caught up in the evacuation
youre sure there nobody else
who can fly a helicopter
we dont need anyone else
<font color=#d900d9>twigs snapping
you think it out there
i mean i know for a fact
it is definitely not out there all right
were totally safe

we gotta go
okay
come on come on
hey you guys cant
just be walking up in
simon masrani
death was a tragedy
the new mission
is to prevent further loss of life
who are these guys
im glad you asked
youre all relieved of duty
there a new
team on the ground
<font color=#d900d9>screeching
lowery im on my
way back to you
lowery <font color=#d900d9>whispering
that a bad idea
the board assigned emergency ops
to ingen private
security division
this guy hoskins is in charge
<font color=#d900d9>knocking
and he has this insane plan to use
the raptors to hunt the indominus
what do you mean
use the raptors

to make sense to you
it not a mission
it a field test
this is an ingen situation now
okay there are
gonna be cruise ships
that show up
here at first light
everybody gonna
get off this island
youre gonna watch a news story
tomorrow about how you all saved lives
no better yet
how your animals saved lives
theyve never been out of containment
it crazy
let move it out
<font color=#d900d9>engine starts
this is happening
with or without you
we know that she
is in sector five
this is a game we call hide-and-seek
it a scent drill
weve done it about a
thousand times with these animals
when they get on target
and they will get on target
wait to engage
velociraptors are pack hunters
they like to herd
the animal into a kill zone
that when we take our shot
get a clear shot
wait on my command
and give her everything you got
we got one good target gentlemen
do not shoot my raptors
please
