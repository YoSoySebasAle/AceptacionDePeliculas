what happened was just this
the wind began to switch
the house to pitch
and suddenly the hinges
started to unhitch
just then the witch
to satisfy an itch
went flying on her broomstick
thumbing for a hitch
and oh what happened
then was rich
the house began to pitch
the kitchen took a slitch
it landed on the wicked witch
in the middle of a ditch
which was not a healthy
situation for the wicked witch
the house began to pitch
the kitchen took a slitch
it landed on the wicked witch
in the middle of a ditch

the safer youll sleep my dear
oh id give anything to
get out of oz altogether
but which is the way back to
kansas i cant go the way i came

wizard of oz himself
the wizard of oz is he
good or is he wicked
very good but very mysterious
he lives in the emerald city
a long journey from here
did you bring your
broomstick with you
no im afraid i didnt
well then youll have to walk
the munchkins will see you safely
to the border of munchkinland
and remember never let those ruby
slippers off your
feet for a moment
or you will be at the mercy of
the wicked witch of the west
but how do i start
for emerald city
it always best to
start at the beginning
and all you do is follow
the yellow brick road
but what happens if i
just follow the yellow brick road
goodbye

people come and go
so quickly here

scarecrows dont talk
it pleasant down that way too
that funny wasnt he
pointing the other way
of course people do go both ways
why you did say
something didnt you
are you doing that on purpose
or cant you make up your mind
that the trouble i
cant make up my mind
i havent got a brain
only straw
how can you talk if you
havent got a brain
i dont know
but some people
without brains do an
awful lot of talking dont they
yes i guess youre right
well we havent really
met properly have we
why no
how do you do
how do you do
very well thank you
im not feeling at all well

tedious being stuck up
here all day long with
a pole up your back

uncomfortable cant you get down
down no you see
im well im
well here let me help you
oh that very kind
of you very kind
oh dear i dont quite
see how i can
of course im not bright
about doing things
but if youll just
bend the nail down in
the back maybe ill
slip off and come

there goes some of me again
does it hurt you
no i just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again
my it good to be free
did i scare ya

you hurt yourself
but i didnt scare ya
no of course not
i didnt think so
boo scat boo
you see i cant
even scare a crow
they come from miles
around just to
eat in my field and
laugh in my face
im a failure because
i havent got a brain
well what would you do with
a brain if you had one
do why if i had a
brain i could
i could while away the hours
conferring with the flowers
consulting with the rain
and my head id be
scratching while
my thoughts were busy hatching
if i only had a brain
id unravel every riddle
for any individual
in trouble or in pain
with the thoughts
youd be thinking
you could be another lincoln
if you only had a brain
oh i could tell you why
the ocean near the shore
i could think of things
i never thunk before
and then id sit and
think some more
i would not be just a nothing
my head all full of stuffing
my heart all full of pain
i would dance and be merry
life would be a ding-a-derry
if i only had a brain
wonderful
why if our scarecrow back
in kansas could do that
the crows would be
scared to pieces
they would
where kansas
that where i live
i wanna get back
there so badly im
going all the way to emerald city
to get the wizard
of oz to help me
youre going to see a wizard
do you think if i went with you
this wizard would give me brains
i couldnt say
but even if he didnt youd be
no worse off than you are now
yes that true
but maybe you better not
ive got a witch mad at me and
you might get into trouble
witch im not afraid of a witch
im not afraid of anything
except a lighted match
i dont blame you for that
but id face a whole
box full of them
for the chance of
getting some brains
look i wont be any trouble
because i dont eat a thing
and i wont try to manage
things because i cant think
wont you take me with you

not so fast not so fast
ill have to give the
matter a little thought
go away and come back tomorrow
tomorrow but i wanna go home now
youve had plenty of time already
do not arouse the wrath of
the great and powerful oz
i said come back tomorrow
if you were really great and
powerful youd
keep your promises
do you presume to
criticise the great oz
you ungrateful creatures
think yourselves lucky that im
giving you audience tomorrow
instead of 20 years from now
the great oz has spoken
pay no attention to that
man behind the curtain
the great and oz has spoken
who are you
i am the great and
powerful wizard of oz
you are i dont believe you
im afraid it true there
no other wizard except me
you humbug
yes that exactly
so im a humbug
youre a very bad man
no my dear im a very good man
im just a very bad wizard
what about the heart
you promised tin man
and the courage you
promised cowardly lion
and scarecrow brain
and scarecrow brain
why anybody can have a brain
that a very mediocre commodity
every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth
or slinks through slimy
seas has a brain
back where i come from
we have universities
seats of great learning where
men go to become great thinkers
and when they come out
they think deep thoughts
and with no more
brains than you have
but they have one thing you
havent got a diploma
therefore by virtue of the
authority vested in me
by the universitatus
committeeatum e pluribus unum
i hereby confer upon you
the honorary degree of thd
thd
that doctor of thinkology
the sum of the square roots of any
2 sides of an isosceles triangle
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side
joy rapture
ive got a brain
how can i ever thank you enough
well you cant
as for you my fine friend youre
a victim of disorganised thinking
you are under the
unfortunate delusion that
simply because you
run away from danger
you have no courage youre
confusing courage with wisdom
back where i come from we have
men who are called heroes
once a year they take their
fortitude out of mothballs
and parade it down the
main street of the city
and they have no more
courage than you have
but they have one thing that
you havent got a medal
therefore
for meritorious conduct
extraordinary valour
conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches
i award you the triple cross
you are now a member of
the legion of courage
shucks folks im speechless
as for you my galvanised
friend you want a heart
you dont know how lucky
you are not to have one
hearts will never
be practical until
they can be made unbreakable
but i still want one
back where i come
from there are men
who do nothing all
day but good deeds
they are called philo philo
goodeedoers and their hearts
are no bigger than yours
but they have one thing you
havent got a testimonial
therefore in consideration
of your kindness
i take pleasure at this
time in presenting you
with a small token of our
esteem and affection
and remember my
sentimental friend
that a heart is not judged
by how much you love
but by how much you
are loved by others
it ticks
listen look it ticks
read what my medal
says courage
aint it the truth
aint it the truth
theyre all wonderful
hey what about dorothy
yes how about dorothy
yeah dorothy next
yeah dorothy
i dont think there anything
in that black bag for me
well you force me into
a cataclysmic decision
the only way to get
dorothy to kansas
is for me to take
her there myself
will you could you
but are you a clever enough
wizard to manage it
child you cut me to the quick
im an old kansas man myself
born and bred in the heart
of the western wilderness
premier balloonist par
excellence to the
miracle wonderland
carnival company
until one day while performing
spectacular feats of
stratospheric skill
never before attempted
by civilised man
an unfortunate phenomena
occurred the
balloon failed to
return to the fair
it did
werent you frightened
frightened you are
talking to a man
who has laughed in
the face of death
sneered at doom and chuckled at
catastrophe i was petrified
then suddenly the wind changed
and the balloon floated down into
the heart of this noble city
where i was instantly acclaimed
oz the first wizard deluxe
times being what they
were i accepted the job
retaining my balloon against
the advent of a quick getaway
and in that balloon
my dear dorothy
you and i will return to the
land of e pluribus unum
my friends i mean my friends
this is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown
be that as it may
i your wizard per ardua ad alta
am about to embark
upon a hazardous
and technically
unexplainable journey
into the outer stratosphere
to confer converse
and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards
and i hereby decree
that until what time
if any that i return
the scarecrow by virtue of
his highly superior brains
shall rule in my stead
assisted by the tin man by
virtue of his magnificent heart
and the lion by
virtue of his courage
obey them as you
would me thank you
toto come back toto
dont go without me
ill be right back
stop that dog
this is a highly
irregular procedure
this is absolutely unprecedented
ruined my exit

dont know how it works
goodbye folks
goodbye

that it wasnt enough just to want
to see uncle henry and auntie em
and it that if
i ever go looking
for my heart desire again

than my own back yard
because if it isnt there

but that so easy i shouldve
thought of it for you

it out for herself
