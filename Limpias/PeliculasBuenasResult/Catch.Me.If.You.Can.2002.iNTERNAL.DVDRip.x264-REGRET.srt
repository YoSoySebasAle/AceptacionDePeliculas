i love you dad aloha frank
hello deadhead
hello
enjoying your free ride
marci
did you drop this
must have slipped right off your neck
no
no
yes yes yes
why are you stopping
i want to tell you something marci
this is by far
the best date i have ever been on
welcome to miami mutual bank
how may i help you
my name is frank taylor
im a copilot for pan am
id like to cash this check and then
id like to take you out for a steak dinner
then we feed the checks
into the micr machine
which uses special ink to encode
the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks
and where are these numbers
theyre right here
right there
theyre called routing numbers
so where do the checks get routed to
i dont exactly know
nobody ever asked me that before
our next item up for bid is also from
the jersey central bank foreclosure
this is a micr encoder
a machine used to encode bank checks
do i have an opening bid
our unknown subject
is a paperhanger
who started working on the east coast
in the last few weeks
this unsub has developed
a new form of check fraud
which im calling the float
what he doing is he opening
checking accounts at various banks
then changing the micr ink routing
numbers at the bottom of those checks
next slide please next slide please
the remote thing is broken
youll have to do it by hand
agent mullen it should be
the square button by the side
this carousel doesnt work
it a bad carousel
thank you
move it manually
this is a map of the 2 banks
of the us federal reserve
slide
micr scanners at every bank
read these numbers
at the bottom of the check slide
and then ship that check off
to its corresponding branch
carl for those of us
who are unfamiliar with bank fraud
you mind telling us
what the hell youre talking about
the east coast branches
are numbered 0 to 06
the central branch is 07 08
so on and so forth
you mean those numbers at the bottom
of a check actually mean something
all of this was in the report i filed
two days ago if you change
a 02 to a 2 that means that check
which was cashed in new york
does not go
to the new york federal branch
but it is re-routed all the way
to the san francisco federal branch
the bank doesnt even know
the check has bounced for two weeks
which means our unsub
can stay in one place
paper the same city over and over again
while his checks circle the country
you want to talk to my wife
she the one who balances
the checkbook at our house
next slide
daddy

taking into account
the gravity of these crimes
your history of bold
and elusive behavior
and your complete lack of respect
for the laws of the united states
i have no choice but to ignore
your request to be treated as a minor
and sentence you to 2 years
in atlanta maximum security prison
and recommend strongly
that you be kept in isolation
for the entirety of that sentence
merry christmas frank
i got you some comic books
how your daughter
what was her name
grace
i dont know she lives with her mother
in chicago i dont get to see her much
what in the briefcase
im on my way to the airport
it a paperhanger
working his way through minnesota
jesus he driving us crazy
you got any of the checks
yeah i got a counterfeit he drew
in great lakes savings and loan
he using a stencil machine
and an underwood
it a teller at the bank
say again
it definitely a teller carl
banks always use hand stamps
for the dates
they get used over and over again
so they always get worn out
and the numbers are always cracking
the sixes and the nines
see they go first
thanks
id like you to take a look
at something for me
tell me what you think
that a fake
how do you know
you havent looked at it
there no perforated edge right
i mean this check was hand-cut
not fed
yeah
paper is double-bonded
much too heavy to be a bank check
magnetic ink it raised against
my fingers instead of flat
and this doesnt smell like micr
it some kind of a drafting ink
the kind you get at a stationery store
frank
would you be interested in working
with the fbi financial crimes unit

i know youll be back on monday
yeah
how do you know ill come back
look
frank
nobody is chasing you
alice has he still not called
no he hasnt
good morning
ive called this meeting to discuss
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting
the unsub is washing
and altering checks
then passing them throughout arizona
this unsub is a big dog
passing checks as large as five figures
sorry im late
sorry
we have a recovered check
on agent reiter desk
why dont we step out to the bullpen
there impressions on every line
looks like the original amount
was for $60
mind if i take a look
cashed in flagstaff a week ago
cost the bank $6000
it a real check
yeah
it been washed
the only thing original is the signature
but it perfect
i mean this isnt hydrochloride
or bleach
no
something new
a nail polish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that not been printed
how did you do it frank
how did you cheat on the bar exam
in louisiana
i didnt cheat
i studied for two weeks and i passed
is that the truth
ill bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes
he washes off their names
and puts on his own
youre saying he a local
if it were me id call the bank first
check out the balance
make sure there enough money
in there to make it worth your while
exactly
you know carl i think
this guy is pretty smart
guess all we have to do now
is catch him
