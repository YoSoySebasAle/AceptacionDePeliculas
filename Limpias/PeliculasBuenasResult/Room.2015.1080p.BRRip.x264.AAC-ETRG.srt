there seemed to be no use
in waiting by the little door

remember what your mom said
so many silly things
jokes with friends and
sure absolutely
it can get hot cant it
oh yeah yeah the lights
the lights they get very warm
just let me get this
out of the way
two touchdowns were decisive
in that game against michigan
and wouldve won in overtime
a couple of weeks ago
but i think they got
a false start
listening to you
im sure you must have felt
at times as if
god had deserted you
in those very black moments
yeah
did you consider
taking your own life
just to escape
im getting
the feeling my client very
it okay im okay
can you give her a minute
sure
im fine
can i just have a tissue
of course can we get
her a tissue please
here you go
hard to talk about
im sure
sorry
you dont have to apologize
nobody expecting you to be
you know
the pillar of strength
you can cry
you know why dont we just
go on to the next question
would that be okay
do you want to put your tissue
maybe under your chair
oh yeah
there you go huh
there snot in my nose
let see good
okay
so
when jack came along
was it different for you then
um when jack came
everything was different
he was so beautiful and
i just knew that
i had to keep him safe
of course
when he older
will you tell jack
about his father
jack not his
he not his
so are you saying that
there were other men
no
no
um
a father is
a man who loves his child
of course
that so true
in a very real sense but the
the biological relationship
that you
that not a relationship
jack is
is nobody but mine
when he was born did it
did it ever occur to you
to ask your captor
to take jack away
away
well to take him to a hospital
say leave him there
where he could found
why why would i do that
so jack could be free
now this is
the ultimate sacrifice
and i understand that
but did you think about him
having a normal childhood
but he had me
of course he did
but was that
the best thing for him
