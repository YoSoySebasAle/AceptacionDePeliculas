
pull yourself together teddy
pull yourself together
it just water
it a lot of water
come on
you okay boss
yeah im fine i just i just cant
i just cant stomach the water
so youre my new partner
that right
not the best way to meet with my head
halfway down the toilet
doesnt exactly square with teddy daniels
the man the legend ill give you that
the legend
what the hell are you boys smoking
out there in portland anyway
seattle
i came from the office in seattle
how long have you been with marshals
four years
so you know how small it is
sure
what about you you got a girl married
i was
she died
jesus i didnt
dont worry about it
there was a fire at the apartment
building while i was at work
four people died
it was the smoke that got her
not the fire so
so that important
im sorry boss
where are my goddamn cigarettes
well here have one of mine
i could of sworn they were in my jacket
when i got on
government employees will rob you blind
thanks
they give you a briefing
about the institution before you left
all i know is it a mental hospital
for the criminally insane
well if it was just folks running around
hearing voices
and chasing after butterflies
they wouldnt need us
that where were headed
yup
the other side of the island is rock bluffs
all the way down to the edge
of the water
the dock it the
only way onor off
we will be casting off as soon as
you two are ashore
id appreciate if youd hurry up about it
why
storm coming
ive never seen a marshal
badge before
im deputy warden
mcpherson gentlemen
welcome to shutter island
ill be the one taking you up to ashecliffe
your boys seem a little on edge
mr mcpherson
right now marshal we all are
remember us for we too have
lived loved and laughed
electrified perimeter
how could you tell
ive seen something like it before
all right you gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give
but during the stay you will
obey protocol is that understood
absolutely
the red brick bulding on my right
is ward a the male ward
ward b the female ward is the one
on the left
ward c is that building on the bluffs
an old civil war fort
the most dangerous patients
are housed there
admittance to ward c is forbidden without
the written consent and
physical presence of both myself and dr cawly
is that understood
you act like insanity is catching
you are hereby required to surrending
your firearms
mr mcpherson we are duly appointed
federal marshals
we are required to carry our
firearms with us at all times
executive order 39 of the federal code of
penitentiaries states that
when inside the penitentiary
the offices of that institution
have final authority
gentlemen you will not get through
this gate with your firearms
okay now that the official stuff is done
come on boys
what do you say we go find dr cawley
so when did she escape this prisoner
im afraid that dr cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation
protocol
correctional officers at a mental institution
that a weird sight
if you dont mind me saying
it the only facility of it kind in the us
even in the world
we take only the
most dangerous damaged patients
ones no other hospital can manage
and it all due to dr cawley
he created something really unique here
it a hospital for people our society normally
id gentlemen
show your badges gentlemen
dr cawley been consulted
numerous times
by scotland yard mi5 the oss
why
what do you mean
what do intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about
i guess youll have to ask him
marshal daniels
doctor
marshal aule
thank you deputy warden that will be all
yes sir
pleasure gentlemen
he had a lot to say about you
mcpherson is a good man
he believes in the work we do here
and what would that be exactly
a moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care
pardon me doc
a what between what and what
those paintings are quite accurate
it used to be that the kind of patients we
deal with here
were shackled and left in their own filth
they were beaten as if whipping
them bloody would drive the psychosis out
we drove screws into their brains we submerged
them in icy water until they lost consciousness
or even drown
and now
we treat them
try to heal try to cure
and if this fails at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives calm
these are
all violent offenders right
theyve hurt people
murdered them in some cases
in almost all cases yes
then personally doctor id have to
say screw their sense of calm
it my job to treat my patients not
their victims im not here to judge
so this female prisoner
patient
excuse me patient
one rachel solando
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours
last night between 0 and midnight
is she considered dangerous
you could say that
she killed all three of her children
she drowned them in the lake behind her house
she took them out one by one and held their
heads under until they died
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table
she ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by
and what about the husband
he died on the beaches of normandy
she is a war widow
she starved herself when first she came here
she insisted the children werent dead
sorry doctor you wouldnt happen to have an aspirin do you
prone to headaches marshal
sometimes but today
im a little more prone to seasickness
ah dehydration
you alright boss
yes
in that case youre quite right
the simpler the better
thank you so much
rachel still believes
her children are alive
she also believes this place is her home
in the berckshires
youre kidding me
she never once in two years acknowledged
that she is in an institution
she believes were all
deliveryman milkman postal workers
to sustain the illusion that her children never died
she created an elaborate fictional structure
she gives us all parts to play in that fiction
so have you searched the grounds yet
the warden and his men scoured the island
not a trace
what more disturbing is we dont know
how she got out of her room
it was locked from the outside
and the only window is barred
it as if she evaporated straight
through the walls
brought her right back here after
group therapy locked her in
i came back for a midnight round
and she was gone
seriously doctor how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her
i mean she in a
mental institution right
seems like something youd
notice from time to time
how many pairs of shoes are the patients given
two pairs
sanity is not a choice marshal
you cant just choose to get over it
so she left here barefoot
come on doc she couldnt get ten
yards in that terrain
marshal
well this is definitely rachel
handwriting
i have no idea what the law of 4 is though
it not a psychiatric term
im afraid not
who 67
fuck if i know
id have to say that quite
close to my clinical conclusion
so you think it
random scribblings
oh no not at all rachel is smart
brilliant in fact
this paper could be important
excuse me doctor but
were gonna have to hold onto this
of course
and you say she had to come through here
after lights out the orderlies play
cards in here
last night there were 7 men sitting
at the base of those stairs playing stud poker
yet somehow rachel managed
to slip past them
why
how she turns invisible
doctor were gonna need access to personnel files
of all the medical staff
the nurses the guards the orderlies
anyone who was working then
well take your request under consideration
this is not a request doctor
this is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner
patient
patient
has escaped now you will comply
all i can say is that i will see what i can do
doctor were gonna need to speak with the staff
do you understand
ill assemble them in the
common room after dinner
if you have any further questions feel
free to join the deputy warden in the search
it  miles to the nearest land
and the water is freezing
the current was strong last night
the tide pushing in
shed have drowned or been crushed on the
rocks and her body would have washed back up onshore
what about those caves down there
have you checked them
no way she could get there
the base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy live oak sumac
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick
you said it yourself marshal
she got no shoes
all right
let check the other side
what that tower
it an old lighthouse
the guards already searched inside it
what in there more patients
sewage treatment facility
it getting dark soon
im calling this off for the night
let go boys
you were on watch on the landing huh
yeah
cant nobody get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing
okay rachel solando
who else does she have to pass
to get down here
me
glen miga
sir i didnt see nothing
and you were at your post all night
yes but i didnt see a thing
glen
glen
tell me the truth
i maybe went to the bathroom
what you breached protocol christ
i wasnt gone more than a minute
all right let back up here
let all just back up
miss solando was put in
her room for lights out
does anybody here know
what she did before that
anyone
come on anyone anyone anyone
she was in a group therapy session
huh did anything unusual occur
define unusual
excuse me
it a mental institution marshal
for criminally insane
usual isnt a big part of our day
i will rephrase
did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more
let say more memorable than
normal
exactly
no im sorry
did mrs solando say anything
during group therapy
she was worried about the rain
and she hated the food here
complained constantly
last night included
so you were there
was there a doctor present
yes dr sheehan led the discussion
dr sheehan
yes he was running the session
he rachels primary
the psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care
were gonna need to speak with dr sheehan
im afraid that wont be possible
he left on the ferry this morning
his vacation was already planned
hed putting it off too long
youre in a state of lockdown
a dangerous patient has escaped
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation
of course he a doctor
do you have the phone number for
where he gone
hello hello
hello
is anybody there
im sorry sir but its all down
all the lines
the storm hitting the
mainland like a hammer
if you get it working come find me immediately
the marshalls need to make an important call
yes sir
im afraid i have evening rounds in the wards
but ill be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9
if youd care to drop by
good we can talk then right
we have been talking marshal
gotta say im thinking i got
into the wrong line of public service
it is a little overwhelming
it was constructed during the civil war
the same time as the military fort
housing ward c
this is the original commander quarters
when uncle sam got the bill
the commander was court-martialed
i can see why
nice music who is that brahms
no
it mahler
quite right marshal
forgive me gentlemen
my colleague dr jeremiah naehring
quartet for piano and strings
in a minor
your poison gentlemen
rye if youve got it
soda and ice please thanks
you dont indulge in alcohol
i am surprised
isnt it common for men in your
profession to imbibe
common enough
and yours
im sorry
your profession doctor psychiatry
ive always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks
not that ive noticed
what that iced tea in your glass there
excellent marshal
you have outstanding defense mechanisms
you must be quite adept at interrogations hmm
men like you are my specialty
you know
men of violence
that a hell of an assumption to make
no assumption not at all you misunderstand
me i said you are men of violence
im not accusing you of being violent men
that quite different
please please edify us doctor
you both served overseas
not much of a stretch doc for all you know
we were both paper pushers over there
no you were not
since the schoolyard neither of
you has ever walked away from a physical conflict
not because you enjoy it but because retreat
wasnt something you considered an option
we werent raised to run doc
ah yes raised
and who raised you marshal
me
wolves
very impressive defense mechanisms
do you believe in god marshal
im quite serious
in german
i believe so
have you ever seen a death camp doctor
in german
a concentration camp
me i was there
at dachau camp liberation
your english is very good almost flawless
his english is very good
you hit the consonants a tad hard though
youre a german
is legal immigration a crime marshal
oh i dont know doctor you tell us
now listen were gonne need those files on sheehan
and the rest of staff as well
no personnel files will be released for you
period
were gonna need those files
out of the question
bullshit out of the question
bullshit
who the hell is in charge here anyway huh
dr naehring acts as liaison to
our board of overseers
he relayed your request and it been refused
refused they dont have the authority
to refuse and neither do you sir
marshal continue your investigation
and we will do all we can to help
this investigation is over
were gonna file our reports
and hand it over to
hoover boys
hoover boys that right
well be taking the ferry back in the morning
come on chuck
nice night
youll be bunking in the orderlies quarter
hey boss we really packing it in
why
i guess i dunno i just
never really quit anything before
we havent heard the truth once yet chuck
listen rachel solando did not slip out of
a locked cell barefoot without any help
i think she had a lot of help
maybe cawley sitting up in his mansion
right now
rethinking his whole attitude
maybe in the morning
youre bluffing
i didnt say that
i found a whole stack of these teddy
jesus are you ever sober anymore
i killed a lot of people in the war
is that why you drink
are you real
no
she still here
who
rachel
she never left
remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer teddy
we were so happy
she here
you cant leave
im not gonna leave
i love you so much
im just bones in a box teddy
no
i am
you have to wake up
i wont go
youre here
im not
you have to face that
but she is
and so is he
who
laeddis
i have to go
no pleasejust let me hold you
just a little bit longer
oh teddy
you have to let me go
i cant
aint gonna be no ferry in this shit
doctor
doctor doctor
we need to interview the patients who
were in rachel group therapy session
i thought your investigation was finished
it not like we can take the ferry
now was rachel receiving any
other treatment for her illnesses
do you know the state of the
mental health field these days gentlemen
no not a clue doctor
war
the old school believes in
surgical intervention
psychosurgery
procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy
some say the patients become reasonable docile
others say they become zombies
and the new school
psycho pharmacology
a new drug has just been
approved called thorazine
which relaxes psychotic patients
you could say it tames them
and which school are you in doc
me
i have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect
listen to him
try and understand
you just might reach him
these patients
even these
what should be a last resort is
becoming a first response
give them a pill put them in a corner
and it all goes away
rachel solando was on a combination of drugs
meant to keep her from becoming violent
but it was only intermittently effective
the greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done
was
is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense doctor
look outside marshal
why do you think
next up is peter breen assaulted
his father nurse with a broken glass
nurse survived but
her face permaanently disfigured
i cant wait
shed smiles at me
she was so sweet
but i could see it in her eyes
she liked to be naked
to suck cock
okay mr breen
and then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water
alone in the kitchen
like that no big deal
why was that a big deal
it was obvious
she wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it
mr breen
we need to ask you some questions okay
when i cut her she screamed
but
she scared me
what did she expect
interesting
but we are here to talk
rachel solando okay
rachel solando
did you know she had drowned her own kids
she drowned her kids
this is a sick fucking world
we live in ill tell you that
you know what they should be gassed
all of them the retards the killers
the niggers you kill your own kid
gas the bitch
would you stop that
a nurse
please stop that
a nurse maybe maybe she had kids huh
a husband
just trying to make ends meet
to lead a normal life
and it says in your file that uh
you tore her face off didnt you
congratulations no more normal
for her not ever again no
do you know what she was afraid of
you
could you stop that please
stop that
please stop
you know a patient by the name of andrew laeddis
i want to go back
take him
ill never get out of here
im not sure that i should
excuse me for saying this
miss kearns
misses
mrs kearns
but you seem
quite normal
i mean in comparison
with the other patients here
well i have my dark days
i suppose everybody does
the difference is that most people dont kill
their husbands with an axe
although personally i think if a
man beats you and fucks
half the women he sees
and no one will help you
axing him isnt the least understandable
thing you can do
maybe you shouldnt get out
and what would i do if i did
i dont know the world anymore
they say there are
bombs that can reduce whole
cities to ash
and what do they call televisions
voices and faces coming from a box
i hear enough voices already
what can you tell us about rachel
um not much she she keeps to herself
she believed her kids were alive
she thought she was still living
in the berkshires and we were all neighbours
the milkman postmen
deliveryman
and dr sheehan was there that night
yes um
he talked about anger
tell me about him
what he like
i think he uh
okay nice
not hard on the eyes
as my mother would say
did he ever make a pass at you
no
no dr sheehan is a good
doctor he would never
could i have a glass of water please
no problem
thank you marshal
i have just one more question for you
mrs kearns
did you ever meet a patient
named andrew laeddis
no
never heard of him
she was coached
she used practically the same words as
cawley and the nurse
like shed been told exactly what to say
who is andrew laeddis
you asked every one of those patients
back there about him who is he
what the hell boss im your partner
for the christ sake
we just met chuck
youve been on the beat a long time
you got a duty got a career
what im doing
is not exactly by the book
i dont give a damn about by the book boss
i just to know what the hell is going on
when this case came over the wires
i requested it specifically do you understand
why
andrew laeddis
was the maintenance man in the apartment
building where my wife and i lived
okay
he was also a firebug
andrew laeddis lit the match
that caused the fire that killed my wife
let em out
what happened to laeddis
got away with it
laeddis got away with it and disappeared
about a year ago i opened up the
newspaper and there he is
he an ugly looking son of a bitch
he had a new scar from his right temple
down to his left lip
eyes different colors
not the type of face you forget
hed burned down a schoolhouse killed 2 people
he said voices told him to do it
first he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here
then what
then nothing
he vanished like he never existed
no record whatsoever
im sure he not in ward b
that leaves ward c
or he could be dead
so could rachel solando for that matter
lot of places to hide a body here
only one place
no one really knows
that patient bridget kearne
when she sent me for water
she said something to you back there didnt she
no
come on boss
she wrote it
boss
we gotta get indoors it turning
into fucking kansas out here
all right
now let go
watch out
jesus
come on let go back
jesus christ
damn it
are you okay boss
yes that all right
so if laeddis is here
what are you going to do boss
im not here to kill leaddis
if it was my wife
id kill him twice
when we got through the gates of dachau
the ss guards surrendered
the commandante tried to kill himself
before we got there
but he botched it
took him an hour to die
when i went outside
i saw all the bodies on the ground
too many to count
too many to imagine
so yeah
the guards surrendered we took
their guns we lined them up
it wasnt warfare
it was murder
and ive had enough of killing
that not why im here
so what is this all about
after laeddis vanished
i started doing some checking
on ashecliffe
a lot of people knew about this place but no
one wants to talk
you know it like theyre scared of something
you know this place is funded by
a special grant
from the house of
unamerican activities committee
huac and how exactly are we fighting
the commies from an island in boston harbor
by conducting experiments on the mind
at least that my guess
and you think thats going on in here
like i said no one would talk right
until i found someone
who used to be a patient here
guy name is george noyce
nice college kid
socialist
he gets offered some money to do a
psych study guess what they were testing
tooth paste
so he starts seeing dragons everywhere
almost beats his professor to death
ends up here in ashecliffe
ward c
they released him after  year right
what does he do
two weeks on the mainland he walks into
a bar and stabs three men to death
his lawyer pleads insanity
but noyce
noyce he stands up in the courtroom and
he begs the judge
for the electric chair
anywhere but a mental hospital
judge gives him life in dedham prison
and you found him
yeah i found him
well he a mess
but it pretty clear from what he tells me
what
theyre experimenting on people here
i dont know boss
how do you believe a crazy guy
that the beauty of it isnt it
crazy people are perfect subjects
they talk but nobody listens
i stood in dachau
we saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other right
for christ sake we fought a goddamn war
to stop them and now
i find out it may be happening here
on our soil
no
so what are you really here to do teddy
im gonna get the proof
im gonna go back and blow
the lid off this place
that it
wait a minute
you started asking around about ashecliffe
waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a us marshal
i got lucky there was a patient escape
it was the perfect excuse
no no no boss
luck doesnt work that way
the world doesnt work that way they got an
electrified fence around a septic facility
ward c is inside a civil war fort
a chief of staff with ties to the oss
funding from huac
jesus christ everything about this place
stinks of government ops
what if they wanted you here
bullshit
you were asking questions
bullshit
bullshit we came in for rachel solando where is
one shred of evidence that she even existed
there no way they could of known id be
assigned to this case no way
while you were looking into them
they were looking into you
all they need to do
is fake an escape to get you here
and now they have you
now they have us both here now
marshal are you out here
this is deputy warden mcpherson
marshal
how about that they found us huh
it an island boss theyre always gonna find us
i know you are in there
were getting off of this goddamned island
you and me
come on
come on
go
get dried off
dr cawley wants to talk to you now
and hurry up this thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane
i dropped those suits off to be cleaned
it should be ready by tomorrow
that is if we dont all wash away first
speaking of which im afraid your smokes were
pretty much done for
so
this is our only choice huh
got something really nice in prison already
if that dont work for you
now that you mention it these are just fine
that why i must repeat my insistence
that all ward c patients
be placed in manual restraints
if the facility floods theyll drown
you know that
that would take a lot of flooding
we are on an island
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane
a lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility
it a gamble steven
say the power fails
there a backup generator
and if that goes the cell doors
will open
where are they going to go
they cant just hop a ferry scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc
youre quite right theyre far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us
if theyre manacled to the floor theyll die
that 24 human beings
you can live with that can you
frankly if it were up to me
id put all 42 in wards a and b in
manual restraints as well
excuse me
excuse me
marshal
im sorry doctor i just have one quick question
yes i will be with you in a moment
we spoke this morning
about rachel solando note
the law of 4 i loved that
you said you had no idea what
that second line could refer to correct
who is 67
yes im afraid i still dont
none of us do
uh huh nothing comes to mind
nothing
because i believe i just heard
you say there are
24 patients in ward c
and 42 of patients in wards a and b
which means there is a total of what
66 patients here in this facility
that is correct yes
then it seems that
rachel solando was suggesting
that you have a 67th patient doctor
but im afraid we dont
this is ridiculous
what are you doing here
we are doing our goddamn job
didnt mcpherson tell you the good news
no what the good news doctor
rachel has been found
she here
safe and sound
there is not a mark on her
who are these men
why are they in my house
police officers rachel
they have a few questions
maam
there been a sighting of a known
communist
subversive in this area
passing out literature
here
in this neighborhood
yes im afraid so
now if you can tell us what you did
yesterday where you were
it would really help us narrow our search
yes
well iumm

hey
god help you
boss we got problems
mcpherson and cawley are in the building
they heard an orderly went batshit on a patient
theyre looking all over the place for him
theyre on the way to the roof
let get the hell out of here
this way
just keep going
we belong here
what happened to you
what do you mean
where were you
after we got that guy to the infirmary
i took a little detour
to patient records
did you ever find laeddis
no
no i never found him
well ive got the next best thing
his intake form
it was the only thing in his file
no session notes no incident reports
no photographs just this
it was weird
here take a look
ill look at it later
what the matter boss
ill take a look at it later
that all
ashecliffe that way
im not going to ashecliffe
im going to the lighthouse
im going to find out what
the fuck is happening on this island
here it is
damn
were too far south
were gonna have to double back
there no way we could cross those rocks
there could be a way behind those trees
maybe a path that goes around the rocks
that leads over to the lighthouse
what are we doing here
weve got the intake form
it proves there a 67th patient
which theyve said repeatedly doesnt exist
im getting to that lighthouse
do you understand
what the hell can i say to you
to stop you
why would you want to chuck
why
because climbing down there
when it dark is a thin step short to suicide that why
okay
maybe you better sit this one out then
you brought me into this boss
and now i am trapped here on this rock
on this island
without no one to rely on but each other
and now youre acting like
like what like what
how am i acting
what the hell happened back there
in those cells ted
what do you think the weather is like in portland chuck
im from seattle
seattle
ill going onalone
im going with you boss
i said alone
fine
damn it
damn it
i knew it wouldnt take long
but i couldnt get to it the tide was up
chuck
chuck
come on
chuck
where are you chuck
chuck
chuck
who are you
im teddy daniels
im a cop
youre the marshal
that right
would you mind
taking your hand from behind
your back please
why
why
i want to make sure what youre
holding wont hurt me
im gonna keep this
if you dont mind
fine by me
youre rachel solando
the real one
did you kill your children
i never had children
i was never married
and before i was a patient
in ashecliff i worked here
you were a nurse
i was a doctor marshal
you think im crazy
no i
and if i say im not crazy
well that hardly helps does it
that the kafkaesque genius of it
people tell the world youre crazy
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirms what theyre saying
im not following you
im sorry
once you are declared insane
then anything you do is called
a part of that insanity
your reasonable protests
or denial
valid fears
paranoia
survival instincts
defense mechanisms
youre smarter than you look marshal
that probably not a good thing
tell me something
yeah
what happened to you
i started asking about these large
shipments of sodium-anatol
and opium-based hallucinogens
psychotropic drugs
i asked about the surgeries too
ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy
they zap the patient with electroshocks
then go through the eye with an ice pick
and pull out some nerve fibers
makes the patients much more obedient
tractable
it barbaric
unconscionable
do you know how pain enters the
body marshal do you
depends on where youre hurt
no it has nothing to do with the flesh
the brain controls pain
the brain controls fear empathy
sleep hunger anger everything
what if you could control it
the brain
re-create a man
so he doesnt feel pain
or love or sympathy
a man who cant be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess
you can never take away
all a man memories
never
marshal the north koreans
used american pows
during their brainwashing experiments
they turned soldiers into traitors
that what they are doing here
theyre creating ghosts to go out in the world
and do things sane men never do
to have that kind of ability that kind of knowledge
that would take years
years of research
hundreds of patients to experiment on
50 years from now
people will look back
and say here this place
is where it all began
the nazis used the jews
the soviets used prisoners
in their own gulags and we
we tested patients
on shutter island
no they wont
no
you do understand
that they cant let you leave
i am a federal marshal
they cant stop me
i was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family
it didnt matter
let me ask you
any past traumas in your life
yes why why would that matter
because they can point to some
event in your past and say
it is the reason you lost your sanity
so that when they commit you here
your friends and colleagues will say
of course he cracked
and who wouldnt have
after what hed been through
they can say that about anyone
anyone at all
the point is theyre going to say it about you
how your head
my head
any funny dreams lately
trouble sleeping headaches
i am prone to migraines yes
jesus
you havent taken any pills have you
i mean even aspirin
they hit the aspirin
jesus
and you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank
coffee they gave you
you tell me at least that
youve been smoking your own cigarettes
no no
no i havent
it takes 36 to 48 hours for
neuroleptic narcotics
to reach workable levels in
the blood stream
palsy comes first
first the fingertips and then
eventually the whole hand
seen any walking nightmares
lately marshal huh
tell me what goes on in that lighthouse
tell me
brain surgery
let open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this kind
we learned it from the nazi kind
it where they create the ghosts
who knows about this
on the island i mean who
everyone
oh come on the nurses the orderlies
they couldnt possibly know
everyone
you cant stay here
they think im dead that i drowned im afraid
if they come looking for you they might find me
im sorry but you have to go
im gonna come back for you
i wont be here i move during the day
new places every night
but i could come get you
off of this island
havent you heard a word ive said
the only way off the island
is the ferry and they control it
youll never leave here
i had a friend
i was with him yesterday
but we got separated
have you seen him
marshal
you have no friends
there you are
weve been wondering when
youd show up
have a seat
come on
taking a leisurely stroll were we
i was just
just looking around
did you enjoy
god latest gift
what
god gift
the violence
when i came downstairs in my home
and i saw that tree in my living room
it reached down for me like a divine hand
god loves violence
i hadnt noticed
sure you have
why else would there be so much of it
it in us
it what we are
we wage war we burn sacrifices
we pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh
of our brothers
and why because god gave us violence
to wage in his honor
i thought god gave us moral order
there is no moral order
as pure as this storm
there no moral order at all
there just this
can my violence conquer yours
im not violent
yes you are
youre as violent as they come
i know this because im as violent as they come
with the constraints of society
we are lifted and
if i was all that stood between you and a meal you
would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts
wouldnt you
cawley thinks youre harmless that you can be
controlled but i know different
you dont know me
oh but i do oh i know you
weve known each other for centuries
if i was to sink my teeth into your eye
right now
would you be able to stop me before i blinded you
give it a try
that the spirit
where have you been
wandering just looking at your island
oh i forgot youre leaving
now that rachel has been found
sure yeah
big meeting
oh yes
apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward c yesterday
he subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily
is that so
it seems he had a long conversation with a
paranoid schizophrenic george noyce
this noyce
you said his name was
he delusional
oh extremely he can be quite upsetting
in fact two weeks ago a patient
got so wound up
by one of noyce stories
that he beat him up
cigarette
oh no thanks
i quit
so youre taking the ferry
oh yes absolutely i uh
i think weve gotten
all we came here for so
we marshal
speaking of which have you
seen him doctor
who
my partner chuck
you dont have a partner marshal
you came here alone
you know ive built something valuable here
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time
everyone wants a quick fix
they always have
im trying to do something that people
yourself included dont understand
and im not going to give up
without a fight
i can see that
so tell me again
about your partner
what partner
marshal
going somewhere
no just heading out
to the ferry so
im afraid it the other way
if you wait a moment
ill find someone who can take you
to the dock
what is this doctor
it just a sedative
it for precaution
precaution
what are you going to do
kill me marshal
you think you deserve it
for what
for provoking you
and forgive me
what doesnt provoke you
remarks
words
nazis
well that too
and of course memories dreams
did you know that the word trauma comes
from the greek for wound
and what is the german word for dream
traum
traum
wounds can create monsters
and you
you are wounded marshal
wouldnt you agree
when you see a monster
you must stop it
i agree
yes
what are you doing baby
youve got to get to the ferry
no no
no
if the world thinks that chuck is dead
then he is perfect for their experiments
there only one place theyd take him
you go there and youll die
he my partner if they are hurting him if they are
holding him against his will ive got to bring him out
i cant lose anyone else
dont go teddy
please dont do this dont go
im sorry honey
i love this thing because
you gave it to me
but the truth is
it one fucking ugly tie
no
dont move
stay where you are
are you going to kill me
no
im not gonna kill you
why are you all wet baby
what did you say
you know exactly what i said
the rifle empty by the way
have a seat
for god sake dry off
youre going to catch a cold
alright
how badly did you hurt the guard
i dont know what
youre talking about
yes he here
have drsheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up
so dr shehan
he came on the ferry
this morning huh
not exactly
you blew up my car
i really loved that car
sorry to hear about that
tremors are getting pretty bad
how are the hallucinations
get out of here teddy
this place is gonna be the end of you
not bad
theyll get worse
i know
dr solando
she told me about neuroleptics
did she now
and when was this
i found the doctor in a cave out by the cliffs
but youll never get to her
i dont doubt it
considering she not real
but your hallucinations are
more severe than i thought
you are not on neuroleptics
you are not on anything
as a matter of fact
then what the fuck is this
huh what the fuck is this
withdrawal
withdrawal
from what i havent even had a goddamned
drink since ive been on this island
chlorpromazine
im not a fan of pharmacology
but i have to say in your case
clorpro what
chlorpromazine
the same thing weve been
giving you for the past 24 months
so for the past two years
youve had somebody slipping
me drugs in boston is that it
not boston
here
youve been here for two years
a patient of this institution
after everything ive seen here doctor
you really think youre gonna
convince me im crazy huh
do you know the kind of people i deal with everyday
im a us marshal for gods sake
you were a us marshal
here a copy of the intake form
you broke into ward c for
proof of the 67th patient
if youd gotten it to the mainland
you could have blown the lid off this place
wait wait
but somehow
you couldnt find time
to look at it well read it now
go ahead
the patient is highly intelligent
highly delusional
decorated army veteran
present for the liberation of dachau
former us marshal
known proclivity for violence
shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies
that the crime ever took place
highly developed and fantastical
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions
ive had enough of this bullshit
where my partner huh
where chuck
where is he
let try this another way
your wife maiden name was
chanal am i correct
dont you even talk about her
im afraid i have to
notice anything these four names have in common
your rule of 4
andrew what do you see
if you have done anything
to my partner doctor that is a violation
focus andrew what do you see
the names
have the same letters
edward daniels has exactly the same
3 letters
as andrew laeddis
the same as rachel solando
and dolores chanal
the names are anagrams for each other
your tactics theyre not going to work on me
you came here for the truth
here it is
your name is andrew laeddis
the 67th patient at ashecliffe
is you andrew
bullshit
you were committed here by
court order 24 months ago
your crime is terrible
one you cant forgive yourself for
so you invented another self
let get down to the facts
youve created a story in which
youre not a murderer you are hero
still a us marshal
only here at ashecliffe
because of a case
and youve uncovered a conspiracy
so that anything we tell you about
who you are what youve done
you can dismiss as lies andrew
my name is edward daniels
ive been hearing this fantasy
for two years now i know every detail
patient 67 the storm
rachel solando
your missing partner
the dreams you have every night
you were at dachau
but you may not have killed any guards
i wish i could let you just
live in your fantasy world
i really do
but youre violent trained dangerous
youre the most dangerous patient we have
youve injured orderlies guards
other patients
two weeks ago
you attacked george noyce
no no i am fucking on to you doctor
you had noyce beaten
of course i didnt
give me one reason
why i would even touch him
because he called you laeddis
and you do anything not to be him
i have a transcript of that conversation
you had with noyce yesterday
this is about you and laeddis
that all it ever been about
no no he is saying that it about
me and laeddis
when youve asked him what happened
to his face
said and i quote again
you did this
no he meant it was my fault he
you almost killed him
the warden and the board of overseers
are determined something be done it been decided
that unless we can bring you back
to sanity now right now
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you cant hurt anyone ever again
theyll lobotomize you andrew
do you understand
yeah i understand
i understand just fine
if if i dont play along
with your little game here
dr naehring is gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts
what about my partner
youre gonna tell the us marshal office
that he a defense mechanism
hello boss
what the fuck is going on here
you working for him
im sorry there wasnt any other way
someone had to stick with you keep you safe
youve been watching me huh
watching me every minute
who who are you
who are you
tell me
dont you recognize me andrew
ive been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years
i am lester sheehan
and i told you about my wife
i know
i climbed down a cliff to get you
i trusted you i risked everything
to come in here after you everything
i know boss
were running out of time here andrew
i swore before the board of
overseers that i could construct
the most radical cutting edge role-play
ever attempted in psychiatry and
it would bring you back
i thought if we let you play this out
we could get you to see how
untrue how impossible it is
youve had to run of the place for two days
tell me where are the nazi experiments
the satanic or
andrew listen to me
if we fail with you
then everything weve tried
to do here will be discredited
everything
we are on the front line of a war here old boy
and right now itll come down to you
dont move dont move
andrew no
my name is edward daniels
this one is loaded
i can tell by the weight
i see and that your firearm marshal
youre sure
my initials are on the side and there a dent in the
barrel from when philip stacks shot at me
youre not going to fuck with my mind on this
one doc
then blast away because that the
only way youre ever getting off this island

rachel
rachel rachel
rachel
rachel who
rachel laeddis
my daughter
why are you here
because i killed my wife
and why did you do that
because she murdered our children
and she told me to let her go
who is teddy daniels
he doesnt exist
neither does rachel solando
i made them up
why
we need to hear you say it
after she tried to kill
herself the first time
dolores told me she
she had an insect
living inside her brain
she could feel it
clicking across
her skull
pulling the wires
just for fun
she told me that
she told me that but i didnt listen
i loved her so much
why did you make them up
because i cant take knowing
that dolores killed our children
i killed them because
i didnt get her help
i killed them
here my theory andrew
we broke through once before
nine months ago
and then you regressed
i dont remember that
i know
you reset andrew
like a tape playing
over and over on an endless loop
i hope that what weve done will be enough
to stop it from ever happening again
but i need to know
you have accepted reality
you came after me huh doctor
you tried to help me when no one else would
my name is andrew laeddis
and i murdered my wife
in the spring of 52
how we doing this morning

and you
cant complain
so what our next move
you tell me
ive gotta get off this rock
chuck
get back to the mainland whatever the
hell is going on here it bad
dont worry partner
theyre not gonna catch us
that right were too smart for them

me wonder

to live as a monster
or to die as a good man
