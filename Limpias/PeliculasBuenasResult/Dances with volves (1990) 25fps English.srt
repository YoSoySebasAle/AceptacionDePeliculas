but he dont know he busy
he figuring out why
the officer mess ran out
of ice cream
and of course you got the general
he came to see the show
all he knows is there aint no show
the major is looking at
the general
thinking i better do something
you know what that means
i dont want to be
the first across this field
theyre supposed to be
beat up like us
tucker men are as tough as cobs
only thing killed so far
is three milking cows
but that about to change
you son of a bitch
some of the boys are saying
if we aint gonna fight
we could settle all this
with a little high-stakes poker
wouldnt that be a sight a bunch
of fellows sitting in this field
drawing cards

the strangeness of life
cannot be measured
in trying to produce my death
i was elevated to a living hero
i was awarded cisco the mount
i rode across the field that day
on recovery i was given transfer
to any station i desired
the slaughter continues in the east
as i arrive at fort hays
an island of men and material
surrounded by prairie

of the realm

sir knight

to my journey
the king is dead
long live the king
what you got
somebody back east is saying

what the hell is that
why dont you put that
in your book
if not for my companion

i have ever met
get up timmons
timmons
get up
get up
come on get up
did you poke me in my butt
goddamn it
im gonna have a welt
why havent we seen any buffalo
you cant figure
the stinking buffalo
sometimes you wont see any
for days
other times theyll be thick
as curls on a whore
what about indians
indians goddamn indians
youd just as soon not see them
unless theyre dead
theyre nothing but
thieves and beggars
not what you would call much
of a going concern is it
go down there
why there nothing down there
because i said
go down there
son of a bitch
there aint nothing here
there aint nothing here
lieutenant
lieutenant
everybody run off or got killed
all right
let unload the wagon
and leave it all here
im staying too
there aint nothing here
no not at the moment
we dont know what happened
things being as they are
we might as well turn around
and head back
this is my post
this is my post
this is my post
this is my post
jesus h christ
are you crazy boy lieutenant
that son of a bitch
jesus h christ

and help me unload
were just talking put it down
ill tell them where you are
good
good luck lieutenant
thank you
have found fort sedgewick deserted
am waiting for garrison return
or word from headquarters
the post is in poor condition
i have assigned myself clean-up duty
beginning tomorrow
supplies are abundant the country
is all i dreamed it would be
there can be no place like this
on earth
bad horse
bad horse
come on cisco one more time
get up cisco
get up cisco
get up there you go
only a white man would make a fire
for everyone to see
maybe there more than one
there might be three or four
i know three or four who will not
be making the trip back home
we have nothing to show for
this trail
we have no rifles
white men are sure to have rifles
it hard to say how many
might be down there
we should forget this and go home
then go
i would rather die
than argue about a single line
of smoke
in my country
he will not quit
until we are all dead
oh look at me
dont hurt my mules
stop stop it
please dont hurt my mules
men had been living in these caves
why
were they frightened
had there been some revolt
i can make no sense
of the clues left here
perhaps my relief
will provide the answers
it been almost 30 days
still no sign of captain
cargill command
communications can take place
only if i leave and i dont want
to abandon my post
ive decided to ration my goods
as if i were part of a post
rather than the whole affair
there is a wolf who intent
on the goings on here
he not inclined to be a nuisance
and aside from cisco
he been my only company
he come each afternoon
for two days
he has milky white socks
on both feet
if he comes calling tomorrow
i will name him two socks
you there
have made first contact
with an indian
one came and tried to steal
my horse
when i appeared he became
frightened and ran off
i dont know how many there are
but where there one
there another
i have decided
to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands
my rides have been reduced
to short patrols
always in sight of the fort
i am still alone however
unless troops arrives soon
all may be lost
it been two days and nothing
my presence must have been reported
i have made all preparations
i can think of
cannot mount an adequate defense
but will try to make a big
impression when they come
waiting
postscript
the man i encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow
i do not care for this talk
about a white man
whatever he is
he is not sioux
and that makes him less
when i hear that more whites
are coming i want to laugh
we took a hundred horses
from these people
there was no honor in it
they dont ride well they dont
shoot well theyre dirty
these soldiers could not even
make it through one winter here
these people are said to flourish
i think they will all be dead soon
i think this fool is probably lost
wind in his hair words
are strong and i have heard them
it true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand
but make no mistake
the whites are coming
even our enemies agree on this
so when i see one man alone
without fear in our country
i do not think he is lost
i think he may have medicine
i see someone who might speak for
all the white people
who are coming
i think this is a person with
which treaties might be struck
i have heard
kicking bird is always
looking ahead
and that is good
but this man cannot cover
our lodges or feed our children
he is nothing to us
i will take some men
we will shoot some arrows into this
white man if he truly has medicine
he will not be hurt
if he has no medicine
he will be dead
no man can tell another
what to do
but killing a white man
is a delicate matter
if you kill one
more are sure to come
it easy to become confused
by these questions
it hard to know what to do
we should talk about this
some more
that is all i have to say
well be heroes
theyll write songs about us
what happened
what is it
i dont know my arm doesnt work
you shouldnt have fallen off
now well get in trouble
it was your idea
my idea was
to take the horse
not fall down
otter hurt himself
im the one who hurt
i will be when my father finds out
his bow will be across my back
oh god
i am wind in his hair
i am wind
in his hair
do you see
that i am not afraid of you
do you see
i realize i have been wrong
all this time ive been waiting
waiting for what
for someone to find me
for indians to take
my horse to see a buffalo
since my arrival
ive been walking on eggs
it a bad habit
i am sick of it
tomorrow i will ride out
to the indians
i do not know the wisdom of this
ive become a target
a target makes a bad impression
i am through waiting
what are you looking at
son of a bitch
wait
wait
wait
you need help youre hurt
let me help you
you need help
you need help youre hurt
let me help you
youre hurt
youre hurt
dont
she hurt
she hurt
you are not welcome here
go away from us
no she hurt
go away from us
go away
go away
you are not welcome here
stop
the soldier did not come to fight
he is going away
and we will let him
i am in agreement with kicking bird
we will go down and talk
to the white man
and find out why
he is here
i have heard ten bears
if this council decides to talk
to the white man
then let it be so
but in my mind it not right
that a chief as great
as ten bears
goes to ask the business
of a puny trespassing white man
with a smart horse and
a few white man clothes
i will not go
you will go
and you will go
that is all i have to say
welcome
welcome
hi
come
please sit down
sit down
wait just a minute
his mind is gone
tatanka buffalo
buffalo
buffalo
buf

buffalo tatanka
the fierce one seems very tough
i hope i never have to fight him
from what i know he seems to be
honest and direct
i like the quiet one immensely
he patient and inquisitive
he eager to communicate
i conclude that he is a man
of weight among his people
buffalo
i made a greater impression
on their next visit
i produced a coffee grinder
which theyd never seen
is the coffee not good
it too strong maybe
too strong
taste it
sugar
you want some
you want some
that a lot
it good to have some company
so much goes unsaid
i feel these people
particularly the quiet one
want something from me
gave away coffee and
most of the sugar
it wouldnt last anyway
you could say a foundation for
good relations is being laid
stands with a fist
we will talk awhile
your wounds are healing well
yes they are
are you happy here
with my family
i am glad to be here
i am missing my husband
perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right
perhaps
we have word from many places
that the whites are coming
they are coming into
everyone country
i think they will soon be in ours
this white man who lives
at the old soldier fort
i have visited him and believe
his heart
is a good one
what do you say
what do you say
i am afraid of the white man
at the fort
i am afraid he will tell others
that i am here
i am afraid they will try
to take me away
ive heard they take people away
every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried
i cannot make the white man
language
he cannot speak sioux
it has been a long time
since i made this talk
i want you to try
i dont know how
yes you do
i cant
yes you can
i cant it dead in me
i dont ask this for myself
i ask this for all the people
he knows things about the whites
which we do not
now you must remember
i cant
will she make
the white words
she wont try
she being difficult
well she the one who crying
perhaps the difficulty is yours

i said run
christine
mommy mommy
come on two socks bacon
two socks like cisco
has become a trusted friend
he wont eat from my hand
but his eyes and ears alert me
when something is wrong
tatanka
no i havent seen any buffalo
sorry
are you hungry
are you hungry
i have food
i have a lot of food
nothing ive been told
about the indians is true
they are not beggars and thieves
they are not bogeymen
they are polite and have
a familiar humor i enjoy
real communication is slow
and the quiet one is
as frustrated as i am
most of our progress is built on
the basis of failure not success
i thought to ask about the woman
i found on the prairie
but it far too complicated
given our limitations
one thing is clear however
there are no buffalo
and it weighs on their minds
yesterday visit was the best yet
ive been invited to the village
i am looking forward to going
we were waiting for you
we were waiting for you
now tell him we are glad
that he is here
hello

thank you i feel good
ask him why he is at
the soldier fort

an exciting breakthrough
with the indians
a woman among them speaks english
clear progress was made
im reluctant to answer
their questions
my sense of duty or something
tells me not to say too much
it was good to see
fort sedgewick again
i look forward to visiting my
neighbors but this is still home
i watch for my relief
and hope my negotiations
will bear fruit
buffalo buffalo
ive seen buffalo
buffalo
tatanka
riders were sent out
to pick up the trail
by the time id got my things
the entire tribe was on its way
the efficiency and speed
of the people would impress
any military commander
overnight i have gone from
a person of suspicion
to one of genuine standing
i am greeted with open smiles
and looks of appreciation
in short
i have become a celebrity
loo-ten-tant
scouts picked up the trail
where i said it would be
it was not hard to find
a giant swath of torn-up ground
extending to the horizon
the numbers it took to create this
impossible image was unimaginable
loo-ten-tant
who would do this
the field was proof
that it was a people
without value or soul
with no regard for sioux rites
the wagon tracks left little doubt
my heart sank as i knew
it was white hunters
voices that had been joyous
were silent as the dead buffalo
were left to rot
killed only for their tongues
and the price of their hides
as they celebrated the coming hunt
it was hard to know where to be
i dont know if they understood
but i couldnt sleep among them
there had been no looks
and no blame
only the confusion of people
not able to predict the future
are you all right
i cant
no im full
im full and i cant tell
the story any more
you want to try it
you want to try it
here
i cant
this is too much
good trade
this is a good trade
no i cant im full
im tired
tatanka
big tatanka
big tatanka
that my hat
youre wearing my hat
it my hat
i found it on the prairie
it mine
my hat
that hat belongs to the lieutenant
he left it on the prairie
he didnt want it
well you can see
he wants it now
we all know that
it a soldier hat
we all know
who wears it
if you want to keep it
that all right
but give something for it
good trade
it seems every day ends
with a miracle here
whatever god may be
i thank god for this day
to stay longer
wouldve been useless
we had all the meat
we could possibly carry
we had hunted for 3 days
losing 6 ponies
and only 3 men injured
id never known people
so eager to laugh
so devoted to family
so dedicated to each other the word
that came to mind was harmony
many times ive felt lonely
but until this afternoon
id never felt completely lonely
though only 2 days
it seems like a week
i am missing the company
of my new friends
i can see all their faces
but it is not enough
tomorrow i will make a visit
they are my neighbors
what can it hurt
go home
go
go home two socks
bad wolf bad wolf
it is autumn and i am spending
more time with my friends
they have given me my own lodge
and i feel comfortable
we talk every day
but kicking bird
is frustrated with me
he wants to know how many more
white people are coming
i tell him white people
will only pass through
this country
but i am speaking in half-truths
one day there will be too many
but i cannot tell him that
i am sure stands with a fist
knows i am holding back
but she says nothing
a war party is going against
the pawnee i have asked to go
i sensed that i made a mistake
in doing so
but i didnt take it back
they are my friends and the pawnee
have been very hard on them
i hope i have not overstepped
my bounds
come in please
sit down
kicking bird wants to know
why you want to make war
on the pawnee
they have done nothing to you
they are sioux enemies
only sioux warriors to go
tell him i have been a warrior
longer than many
of the young men who will go
on the war party
he says the sioux way
of being a warrior
is not the white way
you are not ready
i know but tell him
i cannot learn these ways in camp
he also asks that you
watch over his family
while he is gone
this thing he asks is
a great honor
for you
i would be happy
to watch over his family
he thanks dances with wolves
for coming
who is dances with wolves
it is the name which
the people are calling you now
dances with wolves
that right
that day
dances with wolves
how do you say it
keep on with the white man talk
if it pleases you
i like to make the talk
oh i cut this off today
i shaved it off
go on
grass grows on the prairie
wrong
you said
fire lives on the prairie
i did
no laughing now
how did you get your name
i was not very old
when i came to be with our people
and i was made to work
i worked every day very hard
and there was one woman
who didnt like me much
she used to call me bad names
and sometimes she
beat me
one day she was calling me
these bad names
with her face in my face
and i hit her
i was not very big
but she fell down
she fell hard and didnt move
and i stood over her with my fist
and asked
if there was any other woman
who wanted to call me bad names
no one bothered me after that day
no i wouldnt think so
show me
show me where you hit her
why are you not married
im sorry
i have to go
im sorry
can i help you
no
some of your words are wrong
but you are learning fast
so
what can i tell you today
i want to know about
stands with a fist
why is there no man with her
she is in mourning
i do not understand mourning
she cries for someone
cries for who
it is not polite
to speak of the dead
but you are new
so i will tell you
she cries for her husband
he was killed not long ago
that is how you came to find her
on the prairie
crying
how long will she cry
it is kicking bird place to say
when she is finished
he the one that found her
when she was very little
people are talking about you
what are they saying
they are proud of
the medicine you are making
with dances with wolves
i have hurt him
and i should go talk to him
you cant he is gone
he left this morning
i bet you were thinking
now why dont he write
hello two socks
come on
come on
come on you can do this
you can do this
come on
it easy
this is easy two socks
i am in mourning
no one can know
we must be careful
we must be careful
what
i dont know
the pawnee are coming
40 or 50 men
hunters found them to the north
theyre heading for our camp
stone calf wait
i will follow you
the pawnee do not come for horses
they come for blood
get your weapons
and come to my lodge
i will go
i will get them
stone calf wait
i have guns
i have many rifles
at the fort
yes
no the ride is long
and we can spare no men
guns would make one warrior
like two
take one man and go quickly
i will take smiles a lot
very well
shoot the gun
it was hard to know how to feel
i had never been
in a battle like this
there was no
dark political objective
it was not a fight for territory
or riches or to make men free
it was fought to preserve
our winter food stores
to protect the lives
of women and children right here
stone calf was a great loss
but no one could remember
such a great victory
i began to look at it
in a new way
i felt a pride
i had never felt before
id never really known
who john dunbar was
perhaps the name had no meaning
but as i heard my sioux name
being called
i knew for the first time
who i really was
where are you going
there is gambling tonight
horseback games are always good
im tired
horseback already has
a good rifle of mine
good night
how long will
stands with a fist mourn
i dont know
i hope it will not be long
has something happened
what
she has found love again
with who
who do you think
tell me
dances with wolves
are you certain of this
when you see them together
you will know
what are people saying
they like the match
no one is angry
it makes sense
they are both white
i suppose i will be the one
to say something
she your daughter now
i know
relax you cant see
everything coming
stop it
quit your playing
stands with a fist
you will mourn no more
you look good
you know the man she mourned for
he was my best friend
i didnt know that
he was a good man
it has been hard for me
to like you
i am not the thinker
kicking bird is
i always feel anger first
there were no answers
to my questions
but now i think
he went away because
you were coming
that is how i see it
this is a good day for me
and for me
stands with a fist
if you want this man
take his hand in yours
id never been married
i dont know if all grooms
feel the same
but as kicking bird described
what was expected
of a sioux husband my mind shut out
everything but her
the tiny details of her costume
the contours of her shape
the light in her eyes
the smallness of her feet
i knew the love between us
would be served
have you heard what i have said
have you heard what i have said
good then
take her inside
she is your wife
oh good
thank you
it good to be out
yes it must be
we are trying for a baby
no waiting
no waiting
i was just thinking that
of all the trails
in this life
there is one that matters most
it is the trail of a true
human being
i think you are on this trail
and it is good to see
you ride your horse often
i like that
you always ask about
the white people
you always want to know
how many more are coming
there will be a lot my friend
more than can be counted
how many
like the stars
like the stars
it makes me afraid

apprehending the hostiles
recovering stolen property

dances with wolves
is quiet these days
is his heart bad
killing the soldiers at the river
was a good thing
i did not mind killing those men
i was glad to do it
but the soldiers
hate me now
like they hate no other
they think i am a traitor
and they will hunt for me
and they find me
they find you
i think it would be wise
to move the village now
as soon as possible
i will be leaving
i must go and talk with those
who would listen
quiet
you are hurting my ears
you are the only white man
i have ever known
i have thought about you a lot
more than you know
but i think you are wrong
the man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists
now there is only
a sioux named
dances with wolves
let smoke awhile
with ten bears
it was always more than a while
everything he did had a purpose
he wanted me to stay
but i would be an excuse
all the army needed
to find this place
i pushed him to move the camp
but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures
he reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything
ten bears was an extraordinary man
you have nothing to say
what can i tell you
whatever on your mind
youve made the decision
my place is with you
i go where you go
youre not afraid
i told ten bears wed leave
when the snow breaks
did you tell everyone
not everyone
it all right
you
finish your pipe
the pipe
how
does it smoke
ive never smoked it
we come far
you and me
i will not forget you
dances with wolves
i am wind in his hair
do you see that i am your friend
i am your friend
can you see that you will
always be my friend
