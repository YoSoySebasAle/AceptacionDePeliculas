your mercy or your forgiveness
however i beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter
bitch you can stop right there
just because i have no wish
to murder you
before the eyes of your daughter
does not mean parading her
around in front of me
is gonna inspire sympathy
you and i have
unfinished business
and not a goddamn fucking thing
youve done
in the subsequent four years

is gonna change that

your mother had it coming
when you grow up if you still
feel raw about it
ill be waiting
for those regarded as warriors
when engaged in combat
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior only concern
suppress all human emotion and compassion
kill whoever stands in thy way even if that be
lord god or buddha himself
this truth lies at the heart of the art of combat
come on out to dallas

nine dead bodies
and were talking
the whole shebang
bride groom
reverend
reverend wife

fella that plays the organ
it would appear
somebody objected to this
and wasnt able to hold
their peace
good gravy marie
whatd i tell you pop
it like a goddamn
nicaraguan death squad
you better shit-can
that blasphemy boy

mexican mafia hit squad
four maybe five strong
how can you tell
well a sure and steady hand
did this
this aint no
squirrelly amateur
this is the work of a salty dog
you can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage
now a kill-crazy rampage
though it may be
all the colors are kept
inside the lines
if you was a moron
you could almost admire it
who the bride
dont know
the name
on the marriage certificate
is arlene machiavelli
that a fake
weve been calling her
the bride
on account of the dress
you can tell she was pregnant
man would have to be a mad dog
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head
look at her
hay-colored hair
big eyes
she a little
blood-spattered angel
son number one
yeah
this tall drink of cocksucker

now you saw that yourself
with your own beautiful
blue eye did you not
weve done a lot of things
to this lady
and if she ever wakes up
well do a whole lot more
but one thing we wont do
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat
and kill her in her sleep
and the reason
we wont do that thing
is because that thing
would lower us

that not only does god exist
youre doing his will
at a time when i knew the least
about my enemies
the first name
on my death list
o-ren ishii
was the easiest to find
but when one
manages the difficult task
of becoming queen
of the tokyo underworld
one doesnt keep it a secret
does one
o-ren ishii was born
on an american military base
in tokyo japan
the half-japanese half-chinese
american army brat
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9
it was at that age
she witnessed
the death of her parents
at the hands
of japan most ruthless
yakuza boss boss matsumoto
hyah
hmm
hmm
oh
mommy
she swore revenge
luckily for her
boss matsumoto was a pedophile
at  she got her revenge
look at me matsumoto
take a good look at my face
look at my eyes
look at my mouth
do i look familiar
do i look like somebody

by 20 she was one of the top
female assassins in the world
at 25 she did her part
in the killing
of nine innocent people
including my unborn daughter
in a small wedding chapel
in el paso texas
but on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake
she should have killed 0

would be mine

yet proud as i am of my life work
i have retired
then give me one of these
these are not for sale
i didnt say sell me
i said give me
why should i help you
because my vermin
is a former student of yours
and considering the student
id say you have
a rather large obligation
you can sleep here
it will take me a month
to make the sword
i suggest you spend it practicing
ive completed doing
what i swore an oath to god 28 years ago
to never do again
i have created something that kills people
and in that purpose i was a success
ive done this because philosophically
i am sympathetic to your aim
i can tell you with no ego this is my finest sword
if on your journey you should encounter god
god will be cut
yellow-haired warrior
go
domo
it was one year after
the massacre in el paso texas
that bill backed
his nippon progeny
financially
and philosophically in her
shakespearian-in-magnitude
power struggle
with the other yakuza clans
over who would rule vice
in the city of tokyo
when the final sword
was sheathed
it was o-ren ishii
and her powerful posse
the crazy 88
that proved the victor
the pretty lady
to o-ren right
who dressed like
she a villain on star trek
is o-ren lawyer best friend
and second lieutenant
the half-french
half-japanese sofie fatale
another former protegee
of bill
the young girl
in the school-girl uniform
is o-ren personal bodyguard
7-year-old gogo yubari
gogo may be young
but what she lacks in age
she makes up for in madness
do you like ferraris
ferrari italian trash
do you want to screw me
dont laugh do you want to screw me yes or no
yes
how bout now big boy
do you still wish to penetrate me
or is it i

who has penetrated you
see what i mean
the bald guy in the black suit
and the kato mask is johnny mo
the head general of o-ren
personal army the crazy 88
and just in case
you were wondering
how could a half-breed
japanese-chinese american
become the boss of all bosses
in tokyo japan
ill tell you
the subject of o-ren blood
and nationality
came up before the council
only once
the night o-ren assumed power
over the crime council
the man who seems bound
and determined
to break the mood
is boss tanaka
and what boss tanaka
thinks is
boss tanaka
what the meaning of this outburst
this is a time for celebration
and what exactly are we celebrating
the perversion of our illustrious council
tanaka have you gone mad
i will not tolerate this
youre disrespecting our sister apologize
tanaka-san of what perversion do you speak
my father
along with yours
and along with yours
started this council
and while
you laugh like stupid donkeys
they weep in the afterlife
shut up
over the perversion committed today
outrageous
tanaka it is you who insults this council
bastard
fuck face
gentlemen
tanaka obviously has something on his mind
by all means allow him to express it
i speak of the perversion done to this
council
which i love
more than my own children
by making a chinese jap-american
half breed bitch its leader
aah aah
so that you understand how serious i am
im going to say this in english
huh
as your leader
i encourage you from time to time
and always in a respectful
manner to question my logic
if youre unconvinced
a particular plan of action
ive decided is the wisest
tell me so
but allow me to convince you
and i promise you
right here and now
no subject will ever be taboo
except of course the subject
that was just under discussion
the price you pay
for bringing up either
my chinese or american heritage
as a negative is
i collect your fucking head
just like this fucker here
now if any of you
sons of bitches

except you sofie

your instrument

whom in okinawa made you this steel
this is hattori hanzo steel

silly caucasian girl

for ridiculing you earlier
i apologize
accepted

come on
that really was a hattori hanzo sword
sofie
sofie
my sofie
im so sorry
please
please forgive my betrayal
no more of that
but still
but still nothing
except my aching heart
over what she done
to my beautiful
and brilliant sofie
ive kept you alive
for two reasons
the first reason is information
burn in hell you stupid stupid blonde
burn in hell you stupid stupid blonde
ill tell you nothing
but i am gonna ask you
questions
and every time
you dont give me answers
im gonna cut something off
and i promise you they will be
things you will miss
give me your other arm
i want all the information
on the deadly vipers
if you had to guess
what theyve been doing
why she left you alive
and where i can find them
what would be your guess
guessing wont be necessary
she informed me
she said i could keep
my wicked life for two reasons
as i said before
ive allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons
and the second reason is
so you can tell him in person
everything that happened
here tonight
i want him to witness
the extent of my mercy
by witnessing
your deformed body
i want you to tell him all the
information you just told me
i want him to know what i know
i want him to know
i want him to know
and i want them all to know
theyll all soon be
as dead as o-ren
revenge is never a straight line
it a forest
and like a forest it easy to lose your way
to get lost to forget where you came in
that woman deserves her revenge
and we deserve to die
she must suffer
to her last breath
how did you find me
im the man
one more thing sofie
is she aware her daughter
is still alive
