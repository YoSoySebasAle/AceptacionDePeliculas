archaeology is the search
for fact
not truth
if it truth
youre interested in
dr tyree philosophy class
is right down the hall
so forget any ideas youve got
about lost cities
exotic travel
and digging up the world
we do not follow maps
to buried treasure
and x never ever
marks the spot
seventy percent
of all archaeology is done
in the library
research reading
we cannot afford
to take mythology
at face value
next week egyptology

of naukratis

dr jones
i trust your trip down
was comfortable dr jones
uh my men didnt alarm you
i hope
my name is donovan
walter donovan
i know who you are
mr donovan
your contributions
to the museum
over the years have
been extremely generous
some of the pieces
in your collection here
are very impressive
well like yourself
dr jones
i have a passion
for antiquities
have a look over here
this might interest you
well it sandstone
christian symbol
early latin text
mid-2th century
i should think
that was our
assessment as well
where did this come from
my engineers
unearthed it
in the mountain region
north of ankara
while excavating
for copper
can you translate
the inscription
who drinks the water
i shall give him says the lord
will have a spring
inside him welling up
for eternal life
let them bring me
to your holy mountain
in the place where you dwell
across the desert
and through the mountain
to the canyon
of the crescent moon
to the temple
where the cup that
where the cup
that holds the blood
of jesus christ resides
forever
the holy grail dr jones
the chalice used by christ
during the last supper
the cup that caught his blood
at the crucifixion
and was entrusted to
joseph of arimathea
the arthur legend
ive heard this
bedtime story before
eternal life dr jones
the gift of youth to whoever
drinks from the grail
now that a bedtime story
id like to wake up to
an old man dream
every man dream
including your
father i believe
grail lore is his hobby
he a teacher
of medieval literature
the one the students hope
they dont get
walter youre neglecting
your guests
be along in a moment dear
hard to resist isnt it
the holy grail final resting
place described in detail
what good is it
this grail tablet
speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons
it pretty vague
where do you want
to start looking
maybe if the tablet were intact
youd have something to go on
but the entire top portion
is missing
just the same an attempt
to recover the grail
is currently underway
let me tell you another
bedtime story dr jones
after the grail was entrusted
to joseph of arimathea
it disappeared and was lost
for a thousand years
before it was found again
by three knights
of the first crusade
three brothers to be exact
ive heard this one as well
two of these brothers walked
out of the desert 50 years
after having found the grail
and began the long journey
back to france
but only one of them made it
and before dying
of extreme old age
he supposedly imparted
his tale
to a to a franciscan friar
i think
not upposedly
dr jones
this is the manuscript
in which the friar chronicled
the knight story
it doesnt reveal
the location of the grail
im afraid
but the knight promised
that two markers that had been
left behind would
this tablet is one
of those markers
it proves
the knight story is true
but as you pointed out
it incomplete
now the second marker
is entombed
with the knight dead brother
our project leader
believes that tomb to be located
within the city
of venice italy
as you can now see
dr jones
were about
to complete a great quest
that began almost
2000 years ago
were only one step away
that usually
when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet
you could be more right
than you know
yes
weve hit a snag
our project leader has vanished
along with all his research
uh we received a cable
from his colleague
dr schneider
who has no idea
of his whereabouts
or what become of him
i want you to pick up the trail
where he left off
find the man
and you will find the grail
youve got
the wrong jones
mr donovan
why dont you try my father
we already have
your father is the man
who has disappeared
your father and i have been
friends since time began
ive watched you grow up indy
ive watched
the two of you grow apart
ive never seen you this
concerned about him before
dad
he an academic;
a bookworm
he not a field man
dad dad
dear god
what has the old fool
got himself into now
i dont know
but whatever it is
he in over his head
dad
it today mail
and it been opened
mail
that it marcus
venice italy
what is it
it dad grail diary
every clue he followed
every discovery he made
a complete record of his search
for the holy grail
this is his whole life
why would he have
sent this to me
i dont know
but someone must want it
pretty badly
do you believe marcus
do you believe
the grail actually exists
the search for the cup of christ
is the search for the divine
in all of us
but if you want facts indy
ive none to give you
at my age im prepared
to take a few
things on faith
call donovan marcus
tell him ill take
that ticket to venice now
ill tell him
well take two
all right tell me what going
to happen when we get to venice
dont worry dr schneider
will be there to meet you
-uh schneider
-i maintain
an apartment in venice
it at your disposal
oh well that good
thank you
dr jones good luck
now be very careful
dont trust anybody
signora
signorina
ah venice
yes
uh how will we recognize
this dr schneider
when we see him
i dont know
maybe hell know us
dr jones
yes
i knew it was you
you have your father eyes
and my mother ears
but the rest belongs to you
looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for
marcus brody
that right
dr elsa schneider
oh how do you do
the last time i saw your father
we were in the library
he was very close
to tracking down
the knight tomb
ive never seen him so excited
he was as giddy as a schoolboy
who attila
the professor
he was never giddy
even when he was
a schoolboy
fraulein will
you permit me
i usually dont
i usually
dont either
in that case
i permit you
it would make
me very happy
but im already sad
by tomorrow
it will have faded
tomorrow ill
steal you another
i hate to interrupt you
but the reason
were here
yes i have something
to show you
i left your father working
in the library
he sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan
of the city
when i got back to his table
hed gone with all his papers
except for that scrap
which i found near his chair
roman numerals
here is the library
that doesnt look much
like a library
looks like a
converted church
in this case
it the literal truth
we are on holy ground
these columns over here
were brought back
as spoils of war
after the sacking of byzantium
during the crusades
now please excuse me
the library closing
in a few moments
ill arrange for us
to stay a little longer
marcus ive seen
this window before
where
right here
in dad diary
you see
look indy
the roman numerals
dad was onto something here
well now we know
the source of the numbers
but we still dont know
what they mean
dad sent me this
diary for a reason
until we find
out why
i suggest we keep
it to ourselves
find something
uh yes
three seven and ten
that window seems
to be the source
of the roman numerals
my god
i must be blind
dad wasnt looking for a book
about the knight tomb
he was looking
for the tomb itself
dont you get it
the tomb is somewhere
in the library
you said yourself
it used to be a church
look
three
three
seven
seven ten
and ten
now where the ten
look around for the ten
three and seven
seven and seven
and ten
ten
x marks the spot
bingo
you dont disappoint
dr jones
youre a great deal
like your father
except he lost
and im not
lower me down
look after this for me
will you
come on
pagan symbols
fourth or fifth century
right
600 years before
the crusades
the christians would have
dug their own passages
and burial chambers
centuries later
that right
if there a knight of
the first crusade down here
that where well find him
what this one
the ark of the covenant
are you sure
pretty sure
watch out
it petroleum
i should sink
a well down here and retire
give me the lighter
oh rats
ugh
come on
come here
look it
it must be one of these
look at the artistry
of these carvings
and the scrollwork
it this one
this is it
we found it
look
the engraving on the shield
it the same
as on the grail tablet
the shield is the second marker
what that
it a rubbing
dad made
of the grail tablet
just like your father--
giddy as a schoolboy
wouldnt it be wonderful
if he were here now
to see this
he never would have
made it past the rats
he hates rats
he scared to death of them
get back
back against the wall
quick under it
air pocket
dont wander off
what
what
i think ive found
a way out
deep breath
ah venice
whoa
are you crazy
dont go between them
go between them
are you crazy
i said go around
you said
go between them
i said
dont go between them
no
why are you
trying to kill us
because youre looking
for the holy grail
my father was looking
for the holy grail
did you kill him too
no
where is he
talk or youre dead
damn it tell me
tell me
if you dont let go dr jones
well both die
then well die
my soul is prepared
how yours
this is your last chance
no dr jones it yours
all right where my father
if you let me go
i will tell you where he is
who are you
my name is kazim
and why were you
trying to kill me
the secret of the grail
has been safe
for a thousand years
and for all that time
the brotherhood of
the cruciform sword
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe
let me off
at this jetty
ask yourself why do you
seek the cup of christ
is it for his glory
or for yours
i didnt come
for the cup of christ
i came to find my father
in that case
god be with you in your quest
your father is being held
in the castle of brunwald
on the austrian-german border
how the head
it better
now ive seen this
it the name of a city
alexandretta
hmm
the knights of the first crusade
laid siege to the city
of alexandretta for over a year
the entire city was destroyed
the present city of iskenderun
is built on its ruins
marcus you remember
what the grail tablet said
across the desert
and through the mountain
to the canyon
of the crescent moon
but where exactly
your father would know
mm
your father did know
look he made a map
he must have
pieced it together
from clues
scattered through
the whole history
of the grail quest
a map with no names
now he knew there
was a city
with an oasis
due east here
he knew the course
turned south through
the desert to a river
and the river led
into the mountains here
straight to the canyon
he knew everything
except where to begin
the name of the city
alexandretta
now we know
yes now we know
marcus get hold of sallah
tell him to meet you
in iskenderun
what about you

the way i think
they should be done
how dare you kiss me

i dont like fast women
