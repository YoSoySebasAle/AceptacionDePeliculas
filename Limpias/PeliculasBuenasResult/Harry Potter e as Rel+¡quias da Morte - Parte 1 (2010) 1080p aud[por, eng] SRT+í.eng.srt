these are dark times
there is no denying
our world has perhaps faced no
greater threat than it does today
but i say this to our citizenry
we ever your servants
will continue to
defend your liberty
and repel the forces that
seek to take it from you
your ministry remains
strong
hermione tea ready darling
coming mom
come on dudley hurry up
i still dont understand
why we have to leave
because unh it not
safe for us here anymore
ron tell your father
supper nearly ready
is this in australia
looks wonderful doesnt it
three and a half thousand kilometers
along australia east coast
obliviate
severus
i was beginning to worry
you had lost your way
come weve saved you a seat
you bring news i trust
it will happen saturday
next at nightfall
ive heard differently my lord
dawlish the auror has let
slip that the potter boy
will not be moved until
the 30th of this month
the day before he turns 7
this is a false trail
the auror office no longer plays any
part in the protection of harry potter
those closest to him believe we
have infiltrated the ministry
well they got that
right havent they
what say you pius
one hears many things my lord
whether the truth is
among them is not clear
heh spoken like a
true politician
you will i think prove
most useful pius
where will he be taken the boy
to a safe house
most likely the home of
someone in the order
im told it been given every
manner of protection possible
once there it will be
impractical to attack him
ahem my lord id like to
volunteer myself for this task
i want to kill the boy
wormtail
have i not spoken to you about
keeping our guest quiet
yes my lord
right away my lord
as inspiring as i find your
bloodlust bellatrix
i must be the one
to kill harry potter
but i face an unfortunate
complication
that my wand and potter
share the same core
they are in some ways twins
we can wound but not
fatally harm one another
if i am to kill him
i must do it with
another wand
come surely one of you
would like the honor
mm
what about you lucius
my lord
my lord
i require your wand
do i detect elm
yes my lord
and the core
dragon ahem
dragon heartstring my lord
dragon heartstring
mm
to those of you who
do not know
we are joined tonight
by miss charity burbage
who until recently taught at hogwarts
school of witchcraft and wizardry
her specialty was
muggle studies
it is miss burbage belief that
muggles are not so different from us
she would given her way
have us mate with them
to her the mixture of magical and
muggle blood is not an abomination
but something
to be encouraged
severus
severus please
were friends
avada kedavra
nagini
dinner
hello harry

we have to use those means of
transport the trace cant detect
brooms thestrals and the like
we go in pairs
that way if anyone out there waiting
for us and i reckon there will be
they wont know which harry
potter is the real one

the last words albus dumbledore
spoke to the pair of us
harry is the best hope we have
trust him

humor and you go for im holey
that pathetic

better-looking than you
mad-eye dead
mundungus took one look at
voldemort and disapparated
head for the burrows
this is beyond
anything i imagined
seven
seven a horcrux
they could be hidden anywhere
to rip the soul into
seven pieces
if you did destroy each horcrux
one destroys voldemort
trust me
you lied to me lied
to me ollivander
going somewhere
nobody else is going to die
not for me
for you
you think mad-eye died for you
you think george took
that curse for you
you may be the chosen one mate but
this is a whole lot bigger than that
it always been
bigger than that
come with me
what and leave hermione
you mad we wouldnt last
two days without her
dont tell her i said that
besides youve still
got the trace on you
weve still got the wedding
i dont care about a wedding
im sorry no matter whose it is i
have to start finding these horcruxes
theyre our only
chance to beat him
and the longer we stay
here the stronger he gets
tonight not the night mate
wed only be doing him a favor
do you think he knows
i mean theyre bits of his soul
these horcruxes bits of him
when dumbledore destroyed the ring
you destroyed tom riddle diary
he must have felt something
to kill the other horcruxes
we have to find them
where are they
where do we start
ready when you are
please pay attention it your
brother wedding buck up
zip me up will you

reason to have it
because of everything
that going on
morning
come on keep up
all together now
one two three
how it looking
at your end boys
brilliant
bloody hell what the
minister of magic doing here
to what do we owe the
pleasure minister
i think we both know the answer
to that question mr potter
and this is
herein is set forth the
last will and testament
of albus percival
wulfric brian dumbledore
first to ronald
bilius weasley
i leave my deluminator
a device of my own making
in the hope that when
things seem most dark
it will show him the light
dumbledore left this for me
yeah
brilliant
what is it
wicked
to hermione jean granger
i leave my copy of the
tales of beedle the bard
in the hope that she find it
entertaining and instructive
mom used to read me those
the wizard and
the hopping pot
babbitty rabbitty and
the cackling stump
come on babbitty rabbitty
no
to harry james potter
i leave the snitch he caught in his
first quidditch match at hogwarts
as a reminder of the
rewards of perseverance
and skill
is that it then
not quite
dumbledore left you
a second bequest
the sword of godric gryffindor
unfortunately the sword of gryffindor
was not dumbledore to give away
as an important historical
artifact it belongs
to harry
it belongs to harry
it came to him when he needed
it in the chamber of secrets
the sword may present itself
to any worthy gryffindor
that does not make it
that wizard property
and in any event the current
whereabouts of the sword are unknown
excuse me
the sword is missing
i dont know what youre
up to mr potter
but you cant fight
this war on your own
he too strong
hello harry
ive interrupted a deep thought havent i
i can see it growing smaller in your eyes
of course not how
are you luna
very well got bitten by a
garden gnome only moments ago
gnome saliva is very beneficial
xenophilius lovegood we
live just over the hill
pleasure to meet you sir
i trust you know mr potter
that we at the quibbler
unlike those toadies
at the daily prophet
fully supported dumbledore
in his lifetime
and in his death
support you just as fully
thank you
come daddy harry doesnt
want to talk to us right now
he just too polite to say so
harry potter
excuse me sir may i sit down
mr potter by all means here
thanks
i found what you wrote in the
daily prophet really moving
you obviously knew
dumbledore well
well i certainly
knew him the longest
that is if you dont count
his brother aberforth
and somehow people never
do seem to count aberforth
i didnt even know he had a brother
ah
well dumbledore was always
very private even as a boy
dont despair elphias
im told he been thoroughly
unriddled by rita skeeter
in 800 pages no less
word has it that
someone talked to her
someone who knew the
dumbledore family well
both you and i know
who that is elphias
a monstrous betrayal
who are we talking about
bathilda bagshot
who
my god boy
she only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century
she was as close to the
dumbledores as anyone
oh im sure rita skeeter thought it
well worth a trip to godric hollow
to take a peek into that
old bird rattled cage
godric hollow
bathilda bagshot lives
at godric hollow
well that where she
first met dumbledore
you dont mean to say
he lived there too
the family moved there after his
father killed those three muggles
oh it was quite the scandal
honestly my boy are you
sure you knew him at all
the ministry has fallen
the minister of magic is dead
they are coming
they are coming
they are coming
theyre coming
nice meeting you mr potter
ginny
harry go
go
here you go sightseeing tour
leaves in 5 minutes
where are we
shaftesbury avenue
i used to come to the theater
here with mom and dad
i dont know why i thought of it
it just popped into my head
this way
we need to change
how the ruddy
undetectable extension charm
youre amazing you are
always the tone of surprise
ah thatll be the books
what about all the
people at the wedding
do you think we should go back
they were after you
wed put everyone in
danger by going back
ron right
ahem
coffee
a cappuccino please
you
what she said
same
so where do we go from here
leaky cauldron
it too dangerous
if voldemort has taken over the ministry
none of the old places are safe
everyone from the wedding will have
gone underground into hiding
my rucksack with all my things
ive left it at the burrow
youre joking
ive had all the essentials
packed for days just in case
by the way these
jeans not my favorite
down
stupefy
expulso
petrificus totalus
go
leave
lock the door get the lights
this one name is rowle
he was on the astronomy tower the
night snape killed dumbledore
this is dolohov i recognize
him from the wanted posters
so what we gonna
do with you hey
kill us if it was turned
round wouldnt you
if we kill them theyll
know we were here
ron
suppose he did mad-eye
how would you feel then
it better we wipe
their memories
youre the boss
hermione
youre the best at spells
obliviate
how is it they knew
we were there
maybe you still have
the trace on you
cant be trace breaks at 7
it wizarding law
what
we didnt celebrate
your birthday harry
ginny and i we prepared a cake
we were going to bring it out
at the end of the wedding
i appreciate the thought but given the
fact that we were almost killed
by a couple of death
eaters a few minutes ago
right
perspective
we need to get off the
streets get somewhere safe
what was that all about
probably mad-eye idea in case
snape decided to come snooping
homenum revelio
were alone
i believed another wand-
you lied to me it
makes no sense
i believed a different
wand would work i swear
there must be another way
harry hermione where are you
i think ive found something
lovely
regulus arcturus black
rab
i know i will be dead
long before you read this
i have stolen the real horcrux
and intend to destroy it
rab is sirius brother
yes
question is did he actually
destroy the real horcrux
youve been spying
on us have you
kreacher has been watching
maybe he knows where
the real locket is
have you ever seen this before
kreacher
it master regulus locket
but there were two
werent there
where the other one
kreacher doesnt know where
the other locket is
yes but did you ever see it
was it in this house
filthy mudblood
death eaters are coming
ron
blood traitor weasley
answer her
yes
it was here in this house
a most evil object
how do you mean
before master regulus died he
ordered kreacher to destroy it
but no matter how hard kreacher
tried he could not do it
well where is it now
did someone take it
he came in the night
he took many things
including the locket
who did
who was it kreacher
mundungus
mundungus fletcher
find him
my father will hear about this
hey losers
he isnt here
as your new minister
for magic
i promise to restore
this temple of tolerance
to it former glory
therefore beginning today
each employee will
submit themselves
for evaluation
you have nothing to fear
if you have nothing to hide
how much
two galleons
come on time is money
cheers pal
snatchers
move out of the way
i told you
get out
squash him
be a bit gentler
they have flesh memories
when scrimgeour first gave it to you i
thought it might open at your touch
that dumbledore had hidden
something inside it
many of you are wondering
why voldemort has yet to show
himself now that he has vanquished
the most powerful symbol of
opposition to him and his followers
get off
harry potter so long it been
get off me
as requested kreacher has
returned with the thief
expellliarmus
mundungus fletcher
what you playing at setting a pair
of bleeding house-elves after me
dobby was only trying to help
dobby saw kreacher in diagon alley
which dobby thought was curious
and then dobby heard kreacher
mention harry potter name
i just
and then dobby saw kreacher
talking with the thief mundungus
im no thief
you foul little git
im a purveyor of rare
and wondrous objects
youre a thief dung
everyone knows it
master weasley so
good to see you again
wicked trainers
listen i panicked
that night all right
could i help it if mad-eye
fell off his broom
you
tell the truth
when you turned this place
over dont deny it
you found a
locket am i right
why was it valuable
you still got it
no he worried he didnt
get enough money for it
bleeding give it away didnt i
there i was flogging me
wares in diagon alley
when some ministry hag comes
up and asks to see me license
says she a mind to lock me up
and wouldve done it too if she
hadnt taken a fancy to that locket
who was she the witch
do you know no i
well she there look
bleeding bow and all
right remember what we said
dont speak to anyone unless
absolutely necessary
just try and act normal do
what everybody else is doing
if we do that then with a bit
of luck well get inside
and then
it gets really tricky
correct

what are you doing
we have to keep it safe until
we find out how to destroy it
seems strange mate
dumbledore sends you off
to find all these horcruxes but
doesnt tell you how to destroy them
doesnt that bother you
a goblin by the name
of gornuk was killed
it is believed that muggle-born
dean thomas and a second goblin
both believed to have been
traveling with tonks cresswell
and gornuk may
have escaped
if dean is listening or anyone has
any knowledge of his whereabouts
his parents and sisters
are desperate for news
meanwhile a muggle family of five
has been found dead in their home
you know the spell harry
tell me
tell me gregorovitch
it was stolen from me
who was he the thief
it was a boy it was
he who took it
i never saw it again
i swear on my life
i believe you
avada kedavra
i thought it had stopped
you cant keep letting
him in harry
you-know-who has
found gregorovitch
the wandmaker
he wants something that
gregorovitch used to have
but i dont know what
but he wants it desperately i mean
it as if his life depends on it
dont
it comforts him
it sets my teeth on edge
what he expecting
to hear good news
who long expected it the fall
of the ministry was shocking
i think he just hopes he
doesnt hear bad news
we promise to remain
your eyes and ears-
how long before he can travel
bringing you news when we
can from wherever we can
im doing everything i can
youre not doing enough
take it off
i said take it off now
better
loads
well take it in turns okay
finch does admit his invention
currently has one short
and now other news
severus snape newly-appointed
headmaster of hogwarts
has decreed that all students must
conform to the latest house rules
hogwarts bears little resemblance to the
school under dumbledore leadership
snape curriculum is severe reflecting
the wishes of the dark lord
and infractions are dealt with harshly
by the two death eaters on staff
what that
what that smell
what you doing
it heavy
oh sorry do you
want me to carry it
yeah thank you dont
be ridiculous pick it up
numpty
snatchers
good to know your
enchantments work

ive told you
ron isnt strong
enough to apparate
well then well go on foot
and next time hermione as much as i
like your perfume just dont wear any
and now for the names of
missing witches and wizards

the sword of gryffindor
it goblin-made
brilliant
no you dont understand
dirt and rust have no
effect on the blade
it only takes in that
which makes it stronger
okay
harry youve already
destroyed one horcrux right
tom riddle diary in
the chamber of secrets
with a basilisk fang if you tell
me youve got one of those
in that bloody beaded bag of yours
dont you see
in the chamber of secrets you stabbed the
basilisk with the sword of gryffindor
it blade is impregnated
with basilisk venom
it only takes in that
which makes it stronger
exactly which is why
it can destroy horcruxes
that why dumbledore left
it to you in his will
you are brilliant hermione
truly
actually im highly logical which allows
me to look past extraneous detail
and perceive clearly
that which others overlook
yeah there only one
problem of course
the sword was stolen
yeah im still here
but you two carry on dont
let me spoil the fun
what wrong
wrong nothing wrong
not according to you anyway
look if youve got something to
say dont be shy spit it out
all right ill spit it out but
dont expect me to be grateful
because there another
damn thing weve gotta find
i thought you knew what
you signed up for
yeah i thought i did too
well then im sorry but
i dont quite understand
what part of this isnt living
up to your expectations
did you think we were gonna
be staying in a hotel
finding a horcrux every other day
thought youd be back by christmas
i just thought after
all this time
we wouldve achieved something i
thought you knew what you were doing
i thought dumbledore told
you something worthwhile
i thought you had a plan i told
you everything dumbledore told me
in case you havent noticed
we found a horcrux
yeah and were as close to getting rid of
it as we are to finding the rest of them
ron please take
take the horcrux off you
wouldnt be saying this
if you hadnt been
wearing it all day
want to know why i
listen to that radio
to make sure i dont hear ginny
name or fred or george or mom
you think im not listening you
think i dont know how this feels
no you dont know how it feels
your parents are dead
you have no family
stop stop
fine then go
go then
fine
ron
and you
are you coming or you staying

in this process
of elimination
hey little train

wildest expectation
hey little train

hermione
hermione you were right
snitches have flesh memories
but i didnt catch the first snitch
with my hand i almost swallowed it
i open at the close
what do you think that means
i dont know
i found something as well
at first i thought it was an eye
but now i dont think it is
it isnt a rune and it isnt
anywhere in spellman syllabary
somebody inked it in it isnt part
of the book somebody drew it
luna dad was wearing that
at bill and fleur wedding
why would someone draw
it in a children book
look hermione
ive been thinking
i want to go to godric hollow
it where i was born it
where my parents died
that exactly where hell expect you to
go because it means something to you
yeah but it means something
to him too hermione
you-know-who almost died there
i mean isnt that exactly the type of
place hed be likely to hide a horcrux
it dangerous harry
but even i have to admit recently ive
been thinking well have to go there
i think it possible something
else is hidden there
what
the sword
if dumbledore wanted you to find it but
didnt want it in the ministry hands
where better to hide it than the
birthplace of the founder of gryffindor
hermione
dont ever let me give
you a haircut again
i still think we shouldve
used polyjuice potion
no
this is where i was born
im not returning
as someone else
good night ha-ha-ha
harry i think it
christmas eve

river everything

who craved a daughter
least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend
ron kill it
we were better without you
happier without you
who could look at you
compared to harry potter
what are you compared
with the chosen one
ron it lying
your mother confessed she would
have preferred me as a son
what woman would take you
you are nothing

only three to go
hermione
hermione

weeks and you say hey
where my wand where my wand
i dont know
harry potter give me my wand
i dont have it
how come he got your wand
never mind why he got my wand
what is that
you destroyed it
and how is it that you just happen
to have the sword of gryffindor
it a long story
dont think this changes anything
oh of course not
i only just destroyed a bloody horcrux
why would that change anything
look i wanted to come
back as soon as i left
i just didnt know how to find you
yeah how did you find us
with this it doesnt
just turn off lights
i dont know how it works but christmas
morning i was sleeping in this little pub
keeping away from
some snatchers
and i heard it
it
a voice
your voice hermione
coming out of it
and what exactly did i say may i ask
my name
just my name
like a whisper
so i took it clicked it and
this tiny ball of light appeared
and i knew
and sure enough it floated
toward me the ball of light
went right to my chest
straight through me right here
and i knew it was gonna take me where
i needed to go so i disapparated
and came to this hillside
it was dark i had
no idea where i was
i just hoped that one of
you would show yourself
and you did
ive always liked these
flames hermione makes
how long do you reckon
shell stay mad at me
well just keep talking about that little
ball of light touching your heart
and shell come round
it was true every word
this is gonna sound crazy
but i think that why dumbledore
left it to me the deluminator
i think he knew that somehow id need it
to find my way back and shed lead me
bloody hell i just realized
you need a wand dont you
yeah
ive got one here
it a blackthorn ten inches
nothing special but
i reckon itll do
took if off a snatcher
a couple of weeks ago
dont tell hermione this but
theyre a bit dim snatchers
this one was definitely part
troll the smell of him
engorgio
reducio

nothing
we need to talk
yeah all right
i want to go see xenophilius lovegood
sorry

it a letter dumbledore wrote to
grindelwald look at the signature
it the mark again
it keeps cropping up
in beedle the bard in the
graveyard in godric hollow
it was there too
where outside
gregorovitch wand shop
but what does it mean
look youve got no idea where the
next horcrux is and neither do i
but this this
means something
im sure of it
yeah hermione right
we ought to see lovegood
let vote on it
those in favor
youre not still mad
at him are you
im always mad at him
luna
luna
keep off the dirigible plums
what is it who are you
what do you want
hello mr lovegood im harry
potter we met a few months ago
could we come in
where is luna
luna
shell be along
so how can i help
you mr potter
well actually
it was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding a symbol
you mean this
yes
that exactly
what weve wondered
is what is it
what is it
well it the sign of the
deathly hallows of course
the what
the what
the deathly hallows
i assume youre all familiar with
the tale of the three brothers
yes
no
i have it in here
there were once
three brothers
who were traveling along a
lonely winding road at twilight
midnight mom always
said midnight
but twilight fine
better actually
do you want to read it
no it fine
there were once
three brothers
who were traveling along a
lonely winding road at twilight
in time the brothers reached a
river too treacherous to pass
but being learned in
the magical arts
the three brothers simply waved
their wands and made a bridge
before they could
cross however
they found their path
blocked by a hooded figure
it was death and
he felt cheated
cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river
but death was cunning
he pretended to congratulate the
three brothers on their magic
and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him
the oldest asked for a wand more
powerful than any in existence
so death fashioned him one from
an elder tree that stood nearby
the second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate death even further
and asked for the power to
recall loved ones from the grave
so death plucked a stone from the
river and offered it to him
finally death turned
to the third brother
a humble man
he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place
without being
followed by death
and so it was that death reluctantly
handed over his own cloak of invisibility
the first brother traveled
to a distant village
where with the
elder wand in hand
he killed a wizard with
whom he had once quarreled
drunk with the power that the
elder wand had given him
he bragged of
his invincibility
but that night another
wizard stole the wand
and slit the brother
throat for good measure
and so death took the first
brother for his own
the second brother
journeyed to his home
where he took the stone and
turned it thrice in hand
to his delight the girl hed once hoped
to marry before her untimely death
appeared before him
yet soon she turned sad and cold for
she did not belong in the mortal world
driven mad with
hopeless longing
the second brother killed
himself so as to join her
and so death took
the second brother
as for the third brother
death searched for many years
but was never able to find him
only when he attained a great
age did the youngest brother
shed the cloak of invisibility
and give it to his son
he then greeted death as an old
friend and went with him gladly
departing this
life as equals
so there you are those
are the deathly hallows
im sorry sir i still
dont quite understand
where that pen i had
the elder wand
the most powerful
wand ever made
the resurrection stone
the cloak of invisibility
together they make
the deathly hallows
together they make
one master of death
that mark was on a grave
in godric hollow
uh mr lovegood does
the peverell family
have anything to do
with the deathly hallows
uh uh
ignotus excuse me and his
brothers cadmus and antioch
are thought to be the original
owners of the hallows
and therefore the inspiration
for the story uh uh
but your tea gone cold
ill be right back
let go down here
let get out of here
im not drinking any more
of that stuff hot or cold
thank you sir
