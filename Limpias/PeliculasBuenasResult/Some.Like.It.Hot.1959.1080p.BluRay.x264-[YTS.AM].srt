i have this thing about saxophone players
especially tenor sax

i dont know what it is
but they just curdle me
all they have to do is play eight bars
of come to me my melancholy baby
and my spine turns to custard
i get goose-pimply all over
and i come to em
that so
every time
you know i play tenor sax
but youre a girl thank goodness

safety first
anything to get away from those bums
yeah
you dont know what theyre like
you fall for em you really love em
you think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin
the next thing you know
theyre borrowing money from you
theyre spending it on other dames
and betting on horses
you dont say
then one morning you wake up
the guy gone the saxophone gone
all that left behind is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out
so you pull yourself together
you go on to the next job
the next saxophone player
it the same thing all over again
you see what i mean
not very bright
brains arent everything

and his own toothpaste
youre entitled
maybe youll meet one too josephine
with money like rockefeller
and shoulders like johnny weismuller

in the wall street journal
that bass fiddle

in the newspapers or magazines

youre blocking my view
your view of what
they run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht
when it time for cocktails
you own a yacht
which one is it
the big one
certainly not
with all the unrest in the world
i dont think anybody should have
a yacht that sleeps more than 2
i quite agree
tell me who runs up that flag
your wife

who mixes the cocktails your wife
no my cocktail steward
look if youre interested
in whether i am married or not

a bunch of us girls are appearing at the hotel
sweet sue and her society syncopators

thank you and thank you for the flowers
i wanted them to fly some orchids
from our greenhouse
but unfortunately
all of long island is fogged in
it the thought that counts
ah
hmm i seem to be out of gas
it sort of funny you being out of gas
i mean shell oil and everything
mm-hmm oops there
uh it seems to be stuck
in uh in reverse
uh i ju i just got this motorboat
it an experimental model
it seems like theyre on the wrong track
do you mind riding backwards
it may take a little longer
it not how long it takes
it who taking you
hmm yes
it looked so small from the beach
but when youre on it
it more like a cruiser or a destroyer
it just regulation size
we have three like this
three
yes mother keeps hers in southampton
daddy got his in venezuela
the company is laying a new pipeline
my dad more interested in railroads
baltimore and ohio
hmm
which is the port
and which is the starboard
well that depends
that depends on whether
youre coming or going
i mean normally normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern
th and that the bridge
so that you can get from one side
of the boat to the other
would you like a glass of champagne
love it
which way
oh you have an upstairs and a downstairs
yes that the hurricane cellar
and another nice thing about this yacht
lots of closet space
now let me see where do you suppose
the steward set it up
in here
oh yes of course how silly of me
on thursdays
they always serve me in the small salon
it exquisite
like a floating mansion
well it all right for a bachelor
what a beautiful fish
i caught him off cape hatteras
what is it
it a member of the herring family
a herring
isnt it amazing how they get
those big fish into those little glass jars
they shrink when theyre marinated
champagne
i dont mind if i do
well down the hatch as we say at sea
bon voyage
look at all that silverware
uh trophies
you know skeet shooting
dog breeding water polo
water polo isnt that terribly dangerous
ill say
i had two ponies drowned under me
where your shell collection
mmm
yes of course
now where could they have put it
you see on thursdays
im sort of lost around here
what on thursday
it the crew night off
you mean were alone on the boat
completely
you know ive never been
completely alone with a man before
in the middle of the night
in the middle of the ocean
oh it perfectly safe
were well-anchored
ship in shipshape shape
and the coast guard promised to call me
if there were any icebergs around
it not the icebergs
but there are certain men who would try
to take advantage of a situation like this
youre flattering me
of course im sure youre a gentleman
oh it not that
it uh just that im um harmless
harmless how
well i dont know how to put it
but ive got this thing about girls
what thing
they just sort of leave me cold
you mean like frigid
well it more like um a mental block
when im with a girl
it does absolutely nothing to me
have you tried
have i
im trying all the time
see nothing
nothing at all
complete washout
that makes me feel just awful
oh my dear it not your fault
it just that every now and then
mother nature throws somebody a dirty curve
something goes wrong inside
you mean you cant fall in love
not anymore
i was in love once
but i would rather not talk about it
would you like a little cold pheasant
what happened
i dont want to bore you
oh you couldnt possibly
well it was my freshman year
at princeton
there was this girl her name was nellie
her father was the vice president
of hupmobile
she wore glasses too
that summer we spent our vacation
at the grand canyon
we were standing on the highest ledge
watching the sunset
when suddenly we got this impulse to kiss
i took off my glasses
she took off her glasses
i took a step toward her
she took a step towards me
oh no
yes
eight hours later
they brought her up by mule
i gave her three transfusions
we had the same type blood type o
but it was too late
talk about sad
ever since then
numb no feelings
like my heart was shot full of novocaine
you poor poor boy
yes all the money in the world
and what good is it
mint sauce or cranberries
how can you think about food
at a time like this
what else is there for me
is it that hopeless
my family did everything they could
hired the most beautiful
french upstairs maids
got a special tutor to read me all those books
that were banned in boston
imported a whole troupe
of balinese dancers
you know with those bells on their ankles
and those long fingernails
what a waste of money
have you ever tried american girls
why
was that anything
thanks just the same

i have
i spent six months in vienna
with professor freud flat on my back
then there were the mayo brothers
injections hypnosis uh mineral baths
if i wasnt such a coward id kill myself
dont say that
there must be some girl someplace
that could
if i ever found the girl that could
id marry her just like that
would you do me a favor
certainly what is it
i may not be dr freud or a mayo brother
or one of those french upstairs girls
but could i take another crack at it
all right if you insist
anything this time
im afraid not
terribly sorry
would you like some more champagne
maybe if we had some music
how do you dim these lights
look it terribly sweet of you
to want to help out but it no use
i think the light switch is over there
that the radio
it like taking someone to a concert
when he tone deaf
youre not giving yourself a chance
dont fight it
relax
it like smoking without inhaling
so inhale
daphne
hmm
youre leading again
sorry
well
im not quite sure
would you try it again
i got a funny sensation in my toes
like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame

i think youre on the right track
i must be
your glasses are beginning to steam up
i never knew it could be like this

you made the right choice
let look at the record
in the last fiscal year
we made $2 million before taxes
only we aint pay no taxes
of course like in every business
we had our little misunderstandings
uh let us now rise and observe
one minute of silence
in memory of seven of our members
from chicago north side chapter
who are unable to be here with us tonight
on account of bein rubbed out
you too spats up
easy now

second time they sing

which nobody can deny
okay
and dont mess up the cake

to bring back a piece to my kids
now fellow delegates there comes a time
in the life of every business executive
when he starts thinking about retirement
no no
in lookin around
for somebody to fill my shoes
ive been considerin several candidates
for instance
there a certain party from chicago
south side chapter
now some people say
he gotten a little too big for his spats
but i say he a man wholl go far
some people say he gone too far
but i say you cant keep a good man down
of course he still got a lot to learn
that big noise he made
on saint valentine day
that wasnt very good for public relations
and lettin them two witnesses get away
that sure was careless
dont worry about those two guys
theyre as good as dead
i almost caught up with them today
you mean you let em get away twice
some people would say that real sloppy
but i say to err is human
to forgive divine
and just to show you
what i think of you spats
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday
so we baked you a little cake
my birthday
why it aint for another four months
