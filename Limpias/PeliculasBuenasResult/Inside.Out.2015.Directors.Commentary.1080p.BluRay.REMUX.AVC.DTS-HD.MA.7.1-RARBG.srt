
hi im pete docter
i was the director of inside out
hi my name
is ronnie del carmen
im the co-director of this amazing movie
from the mind of pete docter
you like it
no no no
it was a very collaborative effort
and that actually what were going
to talk to you about today
ronnie and i are gonna talk about
three things on this commentary track
history invisible story
and cinematography
these are all things that
are pretty much just not apparent at all
when youre watching the movie
the first is history
now i know from personal experience
that when youre watching a film
it can seem like
it just appeared fully formed
and that not true is it ronnie
no it not actually
when we start
it just pete and myself across a table
telling each other stories
not knowing where to start
what do you do
what do you feel should be
in this movie is a question
yeah so
well talk a little about
where it came from and the making of it
were also going to talk about
invisible story elements
now there a lot of things that we
as filmmakers
worked really hard on
for months even years
only to have them basically invisible
as you watch the film
now dont feel bad this is intended
it kind of like a magician
if you watched him practice
for seven months
the trick would be given away right
so this is an intended thing
but were going to lift the hood a little
bit and let you look at the engine
the third is cinematography
now of course to students
of live-action filmmaking
all this sort of talk of camera lenses
and camera placement and movement
that part of
your everyday conversation
but a lot of people dont know
how much we in animation
pay attention to that stuff as well
so ronnie had
a major contribution in that
were also going to drag in
our director of photography patrick lin
to talk for a bit
so those will be in a nutshell
the things that were going to
be mentioning today
as well as a couple other
little nuggets of goodness
so the film begins with a scene
which i was actually
very much opposed to
it was a concept
that was brought up several times
that we would see the birth of our kid
and the emotion
well i was there with you
because we were actually
starting this movie
from when riley
was about seven years old
yeah
we were having a good
time doing that it seemed to work
and then there was a note that said like
oh you know
what if we find out
when joy started her job
and the reason
i was against it is just
it i think in danger of becoming
a cliché for us here at pixar
weve done a lot of films
where we show them young
to get the audience on board
and then we jump ahead
and i always feel like
man just cut to the chase
i dont need to know
that this person grew up in detroit
in order to understand them
if we do our job right and you
have a good actor and everything
so i was very much against
this whole thing
and i was with you man
and then ronnie goes off
and he boards this thing
i was trying to prove
that maybe it couldnt work
but there no way to say no
to something until you see it
and once we started exploring it
it felt like
you know this is kind of charming
and i come in
with my arms folded like
let see it
so i can say no to it
and then i totally fall in love with it
it also sort of
the birth of headquarters
and you see this dark space
that through light is revealed
we use this a couple times in the film
as the lighting in a sort of
almost like a broadway musical
or an mgm musical
where the lighting defines that space
and it just falls off into darkness
until the light hits it and it grows out
so it ended up being a really cool way
of introducing joy what she all about
and again even here
most babies when theyre born
the first thing they do is cry
so we were really playing with that too
it was great actually
to introduce our two characters first
yeah
and it is going to be about them
such a complex idea
that this was a way
of reducing and just saying
okay it about this baby and joy
and even by the fact
that she not crying says something
that this kid is unique
she is a joyful kid
and she one of those kids
and we all have examples of these
of kids that are just happy all the time
the voiceover here was another
thing i was against
shows you what i know
i was thinking okay this is
a cheap kind of cheat
it too easy let dramatize it
we got to introduce the audience
to all this stuff through action
as opposed to somebody
blah-blah telling us
as it turned out i think it works because
a amy makes it so fun to listen to
b it actually kind of
fun information to learn
it doesnt feel like
youre at school or something
youre having a good time
taking it all in
and c it just makes it like
here the information
you need to know to enjoy this film
yes
it over quick
i thought we could
talk about the concept
so we got together
it was ronnie and me
and michael arndt the writer
and jonas rivera
and we spent a couple days
up at the ranch
remember this skywalker ranch
yes i do
we were there actually
working on another movie
and pete had this idea
he wanted to pitch us
yeah so the basic concept
that i had at that point was
the idea of emotions as characters
i had a lead female emotion that i think
i called optimism at that time
mmm-hmm
and we had joy and fear
and from the get-go it just felt like
this is an ensemble comedy
so it going to be all about
the interplay of these different guys
and the way they talk
to each other and stuff
i remember ronnie saying
you know if this is going to be
a movie about emotions
with the guys who made up
it had better be emotional
you remember that
yeah
most of it was a threat to ourselves
yes
but to talk
about actual emotions
that kind of trying to
elevate the game even higher
so that was a challenge
but it was fun
and i think the whole film
allowed for this freedom
it was a made-up world
it didnt actually exist
and yet everybody familiar
with it in some way right
everybody thought about
where do dreams come from
and how do i store my memories
i dont know maybe obliquely anyway
people have thought about that
yeah actually
i looked at it from the other side
because i tend to be more pessimistic
the freedom that you were
talking about pete to me was like
boy we have so many options to go
in trying to tell
this story about emotions
that is true
that it was
going to be so difficult
to just contain it
there were so many avenues
to explore
and we knew that we actually
have to explore
almost everything about this concept
and it was
quite a bear to tackle
so at about that time ronnie
i remember you were dealing
with the empty nest syndrome
both kids were in college
yes
my daughter was about
and she was starting to get quiet
i remember telling you guys
we just talked to her teacher
and they said she a quiet kid
im like what
what kid are you talking about
and ronnie like
yeah i know about that
and so we looked to ronnie
as the expert in all this
i was the cautionary tale
meanwhile jonas rivera
the producer
had three and five-year-old kids
i think who were just screaming
and running around all day
were both looking back going
yeah i remember that
those were good days
i know so each of us
had sections of experience to tell
about our character
i actually can see further ahead
because of having experienced it
pete right in the middle of it
jonas and josh cooley
were right at the very beginning
so as we started talking
about that i was like
yeah i remember that being
a really hard time for me growing up
so it was a really difficult time
and i was seeing my daughter
going into that and thinking
oh boy this is going to be hard
so that really became
the emotional core of the movie
yeah which we took like a way
to workshop our concept of the movie
is to use our own experiences
as a laboratory
can i talk about that
one thing i was talking about earlier
yeah jump in
about questions i would get
so did you guys get a script
and then people told you
the story department
to just illustrate the script
yeah that how it works right
no that not how it works
most people think that
there a genius person
that locked in an ivory tower
that going to go
and write all three acts perfectly
id like to meet that guy
id like
to meet that person yes
but what i do know is this is how weve
grown up making animated features
is that we dont start out with a script
pete and i when we started this movie
pete would tell me
what he yearning to see in this movie
and experience in this movie
it would be a big list of things
that all of us would be excited about
but we dont know where to start
we dont know what to do
other than tell each other stories
of maybe our lives our families
what we did when we were kids
i heard a lot of stories about you pete
growing up in minnesota
mmm-hmm
as a basis
of what can we build with
yeah if there something
that meaningful and truthful to us
largely thatll help inform
possible directions to go in the stories
yeah like one of the
stories that i remember hearing from you
is that your family had taken
a lot of summer vacations
packed in a car and you guys
would drive to california
yup
how many times
did you guys do that
uh it was pretty much
once a year
once a year
maybe once every other year
we always went on a lot
of road trips though
yes and you see that
in the movie
when riley family gets in the car
and they drive
all the way to san francisco
yeah
and that fascinating
we are the yokels who are
in charge of telling the story
yeah
this is all you got
what were going to be coming up with
is what will eventually show up
in the movie
and it starts with telling stories
to each other
and then drawing out characters
pete had drawn all the emotions
these marker drawings
very quick shapes
anger was this box character
with his eyes glowering at you
at the top of his head
and there smoke
coming out of his head
that the basis of anger
that you see now in the movie
it would seem like
every day and very common
just another person drawing
on a white piece of paper
and will that turn into a movie
we dont know
some of the elements did
and other ones didnt
and i always feel like having an idea
is like whistling
on the steps of carnegie hall
that not going to get you on stage
just cause you whistle nicely
you got to practice put in tons of hours
work for years and years
and that ronnie and josh
and the whole story crew
various writers
all these amazing people
who are contributing an embarrassment
of riches to this thing
and youll take one idea out of
a thousand that make it in the movie
that is very accurate
we try many ways to actually illustrate
draw and tell the story
we have more stories to tell
about this amazing concept
than we can fit into an hour and a half
and that may be obvious
to some people
but if you think about the concept
how vast it is
we had even more exploration
than we really could afford to do
but we did it anyway
because there was no way to be sure
that we are actually using
every part of this concept
to the best effect
so there stories that we had explored
it would be
you remember
when we explored the mind
and one of the things
that you were fascinated with was
why is it that human beings
can remember faces
but not remember names
oh yeah
the names and faces gag
yeah
we had envisioned that
there are two different departments
and they dont like each other
that right
faces they were very organized
and the names guys were like
uh where did we put that stuff
let check in that sort of blue pile
over there
i think it over there
yeah it right
over there just shuffle around
move that shelf it somewhere there
and we were laughing
we were having such a great time
but it didnt stay in the movie
didnt make it
even though we were enjoying it
that right
josh and i were
talking about it yesterday
about when at one point
the punchline of the joke
is that they were eating chinese food
in takeout boxes
i was like this is really funny
wait where did they get
the chinese from
yeah
does this mean that
when we go outside of the mind world
there going to be chinese restaurants
or italian restaurants burger joints
um
that may be too much who knows
yeah so we tried it all
all right let talk a little bit
about cinematography
weve dragged patrick lin in here
hello
patrick is our
dp in charge of layout
so of course the way layout works
is you guys just take
the storyboards from story
and make that framing right
yeah exactly docter no
no it doesnt work that way
almost we can
push a button and do it
yeah it that easy
youre being facetious
of course because that not quite it
layout is in charge of actually
for me anyway
experiencing what the actual movie
will look and feel like
using cameras and the actual sets
the actual size of the characters
the limitations of their movement
and how fast the camera can move
all starts becoming clear
or not move
or not move yeah
stillness also means something
yeah without that
and if you follow just the board slavishly
it would be a big holy mess
so then why do you bother
to draw it at all
ah drawing and story
is about storytelling and character
and trying to uncover what is authentic
what is funny
and what is meaningful
in our characters
we test that in story
over and over again
drawing is cheap
so we can actually draw
these characters over and over again
and throw out the bad ideas
keep the good ones
that an oversimplification
but we dont have to
think about the sets literally
we will put in a stand-in version
of the set in our minds
and draw it kind of loosely
we dont have to
be too slavish with that
we want to discover the story there
in layout
you guys are actually handling
the physical reality of the movie
yeah but we digest
what you give us
we take the essence of it
as our foundation
and we build it up from there
yeah layout is part of
our storytelling team
that wants to make sure
that the storytelling
and the characters
and their emotions that in our reels
start their journey being translated
so theyre storytellers as well
and theyre guardians of
what is happening in the story reel
you want to just talk a little
about the camera work
the sort of rules you guys set up
between headquarters inside the mind
and riley world outside
sure yeah one thing
i love about the inside out world
is the contrast between
the inside and the outside world
so there a camera structure
that we developed
that is based on that contrast
uh-huh
we developed two
very distinct visual styles
one for the inside world
and one for the outside world
for the outside world
the idea is pretty simple
for the outside world it real locations
so it should be very realistic
the camera movement everything
everything steadicam kind of
yeah steadicam
it should be flawed too
cause real world is flawed
the inside is an imagined world
so it could be perfect and virtual
so for the outside world we tend to
use more camera movements
such as steadicams
and hand-held cameras
and the inside is very structured
usually it more like a studio camera
with track and crane
a very controlled type
of camera movement
i remember you talking
about classic hollywood films
from the 40s and stuff
yeah in act  inside world
we tend to treat the camera
as really big
and so the movement
and how we use the crane
everything is very controlled
and a little bit slower
when we move to act 2 and act 3
we treat the camera
as a more modern camera
mmm-hmm
so it smaller and
the track and crane moves a lot quicker
it still very controlled
it still on track and crane
but the pan and tilt is much quicker
to follow the actions
just so that there a progression
from act one to act two to act three
on the outside we started off
whenever we move the camera
we tend to use steadicam
mmm-hmm
riley growing up
everything is very happy kind of lyrical
and when we get to act 2
that is when her emotions start to get
clamped down and become unstable
so we changed
the camera style right there
so we basically put the camera
on a tripod
and the only movement
that comes from the camera
is the pan and tilt on lock head
mmm-hmm
it just to emphasize
riley unstable emotions
hmm
and when we get to act 3
then we take the intensity up a little bit
when we go hand-held
so in some sense the worlds
kind of come together a little bit
yeah so i think during
act  and act 2
both worlds have very distinct
camera movement styles
and i think the payoff is in act 3
when were cutting back and forth
really quick between the two worlds
and that when the intensity
comes to a crash
also it both worlds coming together
mmm-hmm
ronnie and i worked with patrick
on up as well which is fun
because now when we get to this one
we kind of know what each other
are thinking and how to work together
you guys just talk about
how to toss this back and forth
from story and boards to layout
like that transition
yeah well in story
we kind of have a general intention
of what to feature
a lot of the times
we probably have to just feature
the characters right in the center
of the frame
just to be able to tell the story
but because patrick and i
worked before
we know that by the time
we get to layout
we know that were going to make sure
that we feature the cutting framing
and the camera work to be very specific
for us it like screen direction
when you leave headquarters
we have to go to screen right
and if the characters are trying to
make their way back to headquarters
theyre going to go to screen left
just in general
we break that rule every now and then
but in the aggregate
that what we want to do
then we had to design
the set to basically support that
that was involving the art department
yes
so we had those rules
very early in story
and i conferred with patrick
all along the process
that how we worked in up
we started very early
when we were still storyboarding
designing the camera
and the film language
but going back
to what youre saying
about we always draw
something in the center
that actually helped me in this film
cause riley is always drawn
in the center flanked by the parents
i actually took that as how riley
sees her as always in the center
so i actually used that
when she got disconnected
when she feels disconnected
from the parents
i just physically move her to the side
mmm-hmm
it was all planned
yeah
it was all planned
same with the first time
you pitched me memory dump
you said keep this shot for joy
to be the closest shot
when she learned her lesson
yeah right
so i kind of take that idea
and what if i have
some adult-type cameras
when i frame the parents
when riley was born
when dad is yelling at riley
those are all parents things
that theyre doing
what if those are super-tight close-up
to represent adulthood
and i never get close to joy
until the moment she learns
that when we push in for the close-up
and that when she grows up
see
and at the end
when riley is embracing the parents
that when we go in the tightest shot
of her and that when she grows up
so all those just come together
oh there you go
see there method
in what seemingly is madness
but actually
like pete was saying earlier
a lot of it is invisible
if you start to notice it
then i think we did a bad job
yeah lin mmm-hmm
when we were telling the story
we had done only a few sequences
that we started to fall in love with
one of them was dinner
and the other one was memory dump
where joy learns the biggest lesson
that she has to learn in her journey
and it felt like we should be close to her
when she is essentially owning up
to what mistakes she made
and trying to understand
what she learning out of that
and when we did that it felt like
we had to be so intimate with her
but i love what youre talking about
that you also related that to the parents
so you used that same camera work
yeah that framing
more structure and more meaning
fascinating
yeah
patrick
is there any shot in particular
that you feel youre especially proud of
that kind of
invisible and not noticed by
uh this shot were watching
right now joy plan
i think this is one of the more
complicated shots ive ever built
uh it is one of the moving master shots
and it is very long extended length
but instead of using cuts
to create energy
we used character blocking and staging
to create that energy
with the character moving
around the camera
and there a rhythm to it too
you first start with a wide shot
we go into two medium shots
with joy and fear talking
and it goes into two full shots
with joy and disgust
and then there evolution
throughout the shots and staging
and also character too
go from one to two to five
and then goes back to just joy
there a good rhythm to it
and it was a hard shot to build
it took me two weeks to build
yeah
so you guys built the whole thing
then animation came in right
did you guys cycle through
with animation
no i think travis did a really
good job following the timing
oh okay
cause it was how kevin cuts it too
right
it was really tightly timed
and there a good rhythm to it
yeah in general we didnt
allow the animation staff a lot of leeway
because the comedy of this really
necessitated a certain rhythm to things
so we couldnt just put extra frames in
not one frame no not two
can i have two more frames
they kind of got mad
at us sometimes
no pete has to say no
and kevin has to raise his hand up
no it would ruin the
it ruined the whole movie
no
the whole movie
but you give animation
a lot of breathing room
because being an animator yourself
you know where the opportunities are
and when it time
to actually give a frame
or two or five here and there
but this one shot
when we were talking about it
we were inspired by a lot of
vincente minnelli
direction and musicals
like singin in the rain
and it felt like this would be our chance
to do a shot like that
yeah im inspired by kurosawa
those moving master shots
like in the bad sleep well
there something classy about it
it easier to do cuts
it would probably take me half
the time to do all the shots
but this is like so much more
elegant and classy
i know i wish we could
do more of those in the movie
it funny
there is a sort of rhythm to cutting
and a comedy to cutting
that you get used to
mmm-hmm
and sometimes it hard
to create that without that rhythm of
you know bang bang bang bang
there kind of a surprise even
one of the staples of
character animation is
it fun to see an expression change
so to go from happy
to depressed or something
but sometimes
the cutting will give you that
so you cut away from the character
and then bang
by the time you cut back
theyre already in the depressed face
you dont watch them melt and that
there something kind of funny
about the surprise of that sometimes
anyway not to argue your point at all
it just i think there a lot of
different ways to shoot things
yeah sometimes it works
we also tried that at the end
in the epilogue
when they are coming up
to the console
yeah
and we tried that in one shot too
but the energy
just doesnt really feel right
it drags things down
yeah
in that case you know
the cutting works
but i was we tried it
yeah
there different ways of doing it
excellent lin yeah
all right
well thanks patrick that was great
thank you for
having me on the show
thank you
all right
okay so let talk about
some practical filmmaking things
one of the difficulties
of this whole concept
is that the main relationship
that at stake
joy and riley
do not exist in the same world
and therefore
cannot be seen onscreen together
that is correct
ronnie you struggled with that
and came up
with a bunch of different things
you wanna talk about any of the ideas
yeah we were always wondering
because pete has loads of experience
of making toy story
the relationship of woody to andy
is very challenging
when you watch it it feels like
well of course it beautiful
all the toy story movies
you already know the rules
but here we were trying to
make up our own rules
and it was doubly hard
because we cannot have
the two characters
be in the same actual reality
the same plane together
yeah youre right
toy story woody couldnt be alive
in front of andy
but at least he could hug him
and they could be together
in this movie
they cant even see each other
and not only that
woody can actually move objects
and influence events
and the environment around andy
joy has no such luxury
and we were struggling on how to
actually make that happen
one of the things that we had right away
was that front viewing screen
that they were actually going to
see the world through riley eyes
but riley would never be in that view
unless she was staring at a mirror
so we were maybe
well maybe shell be staring
at mirrors all the time
yeah we thought
about having glass
and reflective surfaces everywhere
any kind of visual cue
to make riley show up
on that inside headquarters
and that was very contrived
after a couple of tries
and then one of the things that we have
also as an element in the movie
are memories
we had memories with riley in them
so that if you play a memory
of riley on the front screen
riley would be in the room so to speak
and that was the closest
that we can get joy to riley
play a memory of riley
there on the screen
joy when everybody asleep can
kind of walk up to the screen and talk
it a one-way conversation albeit
but still it was the only way
that she can express how she feels
what her goals are what her hopes are
to that riley on the screen
in fact the skating scene was
something that ronnie came up with
a way of getting the two of them
on the screen at the same time
joy is replaying this memory
and joy has seen it so many times
she can perform along with it
and it a chance for her
to be with her kid
in a way that she cant
really in real life
so it a really beautiful scene
the other interesting thing about that is
as joy turns the nightmare off
she looks up at the screen
and we cut to riley
and we cut back to joy
and she has this sort of pained look
and she says
im not gonna end the day like this
all that sort of magic of cutting
which of course
doesnt really mean anything in real life
if you think about it
she didnt see riley
but through the miracle of editing
we sort of
imply that this connection is made
and that something
we do throughout the film
thank goodness for film language
that was figured out years
and years ago
dinner
this was the first scene
that was approved
it was approved like three years
before the film was done
and ronnie boarded
and wrote most of this
this was very early
we didnt even have
kevin nolting in yet
we didnt have josh yet
and pete and i were riffing on
what would dinner be like
and how can we cut from three heads
inside and outside
three sets of emotions
and i started workshopping with pete
pete office is right next to me
this is the same way that we did up
so i would write and sketch and draw
and then i would go
and barge into his office and pitch
and then if it fun and funny
then okay that encouragement
i can go back to my room
and then he would build on it
and then he would come into my room
okay what if he said
this that and the other thing
so both of us were trying
to make this sequence dinner
just the germ of it to happen as a pitch
yeah
i was just looking at the first version
where they were humanoid
they were human characters
they were totally different
yeah we thought of
these characters as
what if the same actors played
riley mom and dad
sadness or fear or whoever
we actually even recorded
all of our main cast
phyllis and amy and everybody
doing all these other characters
with like a gravelly voice
or a high-pitched voice
for mom or something
and it seemed funny in concept
but it got kind of confusing
and not as funny
it was hilarious to us though
if you can hear lewis black in falsetto
ridiculously fun
yeah
and it felt like it started to work
and one of the things that i did
was actually
just to make sure that this read in board
is to give all of dad
emotions mustaches
yes
when we actually cracked dinner
it was kind of emblematic
of what the experience in a movie
about emotions was going to feel like
because we didnt solve everything
right in the beginning
this was the one sequence
that demonstrated
what cutting from inside to outside
was going to be like
yeah
and how many
characters heads can we get into
without failing to actually make it
entertaining or a coherent sequence
the other thing
that is interesting to point out
about the dinner scene
is the number of different sets
were in four sets
constantly cutting back and forth
you have all these
different sets of characters
who look pretty similar
so something that ronnie
did in his boards very early on
which we echoed in final production
is just staging the inside world
the same as mom
so mom is on the left
looking to the right
when we zoom in her emotions
are on the left looking to the right
dad on the right looking to the left
riley is center
so all that stuff kind of echoes and
helps the audience orient themselves
so we were trying to make sure
that we lessen the confusion
john was starting
to respond to it and he says
this is why you make this movie
yeah
from the very beginning
he was intrigued by the idea
of going into multiple people heads
and seeing the differences
in what their characters act like
and the design of the place was sort of
a norad kind of thing for dad versus
i think we modelled it on
chat shows for mom
so it was definitely
something that showed
how fun the promise
of this film could be
the sort of boring
of what going on outside
and the excitement of inside
and almost a call to nuclear war for dad
that what it coming to
we felt like
we were so lucky to actually
have this sequence very early
of course it didnt make it easier
for the next couple of years
because not everything else
revealed itself
yeah people will be like
the dinner scene
is still your best scene
the other ones should be
getting up to that level
let talk a little bit about joy
for my money anyways
i look back at the film process
the most difficult thing
to lock in on was joy
there was all sorts of logic issues
designing the world
i dont wanna say that that was easy
that was not really easy
but joy as a character
was just a tough nut to crack
people that are always
chipper and happy
and you spend a lot of time around
it not very fun
which is counterintuitive in a sense
cause you think
joy i want happiness in my life
but if there too much of it
youre just like my teeth hurt
that was notes we got on the first
four five versions of the film
that people were like
okay the concept is great
i really dont like joy
yeah
i think a big big key to discovering
the character of course
was amy poehler
once we started working with her
it just immediately
like this enormous burden lifted
when i first met with her
jonas and i went to new york
and we described the film and
all the fun that were gonna have
and then we said
but we have this challenge
and she said
i know what youre going against
and i think i can help you
she was really amazingly perceptive
it took us four years to figure this out
and she was like in 5 minutes
she got it all
and the challenges of it
and it was really something
that she was able to play
on parks and rec
her character leslie knope
is really an overachiever
and i think that why you forgive her
and why you like her is that
she done all this happy peppy work
but she has worked so hard
all right i stayed up all night
and prepared like 8000 versions of it
she didnt need to do that
but she was working really really hard
an overachiever
that you can relate to
yeah
this right here im
this was my suggestion
to do these flash cuts
which im proud of
cause it i think worked out really
it gets me anyway
if you think of it again
from a logical standpoint
i dont know what were cutting to
joy is looking down over the edge
and were just randomly
almost cutting to these scenes of riley
what inferred of course
is that theyre joy memories
of these wonderful goofy things
that riley did as a kid
that shell no longer do anymore
now that that island is gone
and again it kind of echoes
what happens to our own kids
and something i definitely miss
about my kids when they were little
of just this goofball activity
that they would do
it happens less and less as we get old
and this scene
dad coming over to tuck her in
after a very difficult moment
there at dinner
dad noticing that
his daughter changed
yeah
this scene i think
was one of the last ones to lock
because we always seem to
get to these places
where weve built
various sections of the film
now they have to attach in some way
that doesnt go on for too long
and this scene was really draggy
until we cut it way down and way down
this little bit where joy
does this happy laugh
was something
that we dug up in editorial
i dont even remember
where amy did it originally
somewhere way else in the film
but we found that and like
okay put that in there
because we need some way to show
she happy
we dont have a line
that weve recorded
even though we recorded this scene
like four times
we were throwing stuff out
and trying to get it to work and
but that kind of fun
when you can spelunk
and find these little bits
and put em together in ways that work
im glad that
you remember those things
kevin kevin nolting
our editorial lead and guru in editorial
would know where to look for these
yeah
this is what we came to call a gilligan
it from that gilligan island thing
where he says
im not gonna dress up like a girl
you cant make me
and then
you cut and he dressed up like a girl
so this is joy saying this is working
and then you cut and
this is not working
this is not working
the other thing i remember is that
we actually played joy
very frustrated in these scenes
for a very long time
just to kind of like mirror
what we would get to
if we were in her shoes
but her being joy actually
her reaction to it is to
try and put a positive spin
this is not disastrous
we can make this work can we
and she desperately
trying to find an upside
i like that her hair
all messed up though it funny
this is seeing the forgetters
and this grew out of the idea that okay
out of all these millions of memories
some of them are gonna be forgotten
and i think this came pretty early on
that the brightness
and the clarity of the image
would equate to how clear that memory
is in our own heads
there are gonna be some
that are just too faded
and so those need to be thrown out
the forgetters have a job
they know what they need to do
this was i think a combination of
josh cooley and simon rich
who wrote on the film for quite a while
just coming up with examples of
weird stuff that makes sense
because it equates to our own
lack of memory
the forgetters is very interesting to me
those characters did not exist
in our cast of characters
pete was the one who would come
into the room
he like
you know what would be funny
is if you have forgetters
back then it was kind of like
but what would they do
then you werent convinced
we werent sold right away
and then he would come back again
he like
you know what would be great here
is if we have these characters
called forgetters
and he would try over and over
and over again
until one day
actually he was right all along
forgetters should be here
this idea of replaying
the memory of actually sending it up
came later as a way to show that
when you do this to the memory
it goes up that tube
it shows up in headquarters
which is gonna be what
joy and sadness are gonna attempt
late in act 2
so that was a way of setting that up
and also hopefully getting
a bit of a laugh
and luckily we recorded
everybody on the cast
humming the tripledent gum song
so when you cut to riley
and she talking to her friend
we had that from kaitlyn dias
who the voice of riley
yes
and pete docter wrote that song
oh it a wonderful song
no no he wrote it as if
like he been hearing it all his life
and he wrote it you actually
i had to sing it for people
you had to sing it for people
but you also directed the way
that they sang it in terms of
because pete a musical genius
ill sing it for you right now
okay never mind
uh the friendship island
we wanted to make it clear
that it was going down
in some different way
to experience it in a different way
than goofball did
so the scale of it
and of course goofball they were
running across it when it went down
when goofball island went down
we were sort of aware that we have
a number of these islands
that could feel repetitive you know
once you establish a pattern of
uh-oh the island went down
i have a flash cut
of what that means to me
in terms of riley who like
oh man this could get old
so we worked hard to stage it
in a different way
to show the memory
as opposed to flash cuts
anything we could do
to kind of differentiate it
from the first one from goofball
let talk about bing bong
bing bong was a character that
was born out of another scene
that joy found all of these forgotten
imaginary friends
characters that riley had created
like mrs scribbles who kind of
a crude kid drawing of a person
in crayon
yeah
and the sun who is you know
the classic quarter of the sun
poking in the corner of the page
the corner sun
but then as you reveal
the character that all it was
and bing bong
was one of those characters
that hung out with these
out-of-work actors essentially
yeah they were
kind of like camping out
in one forgotten corner of the mind
but as the story refined
we realized bing bong
could be really cool in that
he is joy to the extreme
so sadness is
kind of the opposite of joy
in terms of what she knows
joy is trying to hold on to childhood
sadness already sort of intuitively
knows that we need to move on
so what if we took bing bong
and made him even more like joy
in that he basically acts
like a three-year-old
and he thinks riley should still be
basically three years old
and joy could then come
in the course of the film to realize
gee that kind of crazy talk you know
maybe ive been taking things too far
and bing bong being
an imaginary friend
when riley was little
he was very vital in riley life then
but riley a little older now
and he doesnt have a job anymore
yeah
the bing bong introduction
at the very beginning
was something we tacked on
at the last minute
josh wrote this little thing of him
muttering to himself
which i thought was very fun
oh this scene here when he says
well there not much call
for imaginary friends lately so
there was a whole second part
of that line
it just one of many examples
where you overwrite stuff
and then the performer the actor
is able to infer all that
in just one part of a line
so when he says
there not
much call for imaginary friends lately
you already get the second half
of the line was something like
im starting to think
ill never be part of riley life again
and then hed start to cry
so um we just didnt need that
you cut it off
and there so many examples
of those kind of things
and that also
the magic of the great richard kind
yeah it is
and he could actually make you
experience a whole range of emotions
and behavior just by his vocalizations
this is kind of interesting
the magic bag here
grew out of the fact that
joy was gonna have to
walk through the entire movie
carrying these five bowling balls
so that was really limiting for her acting
she couldnt ever gesture
or hold anything other than those
so we thought
well let make this bag
well are we gonna be able to buy
that she stuffed all of those
in this little bag
let make it an imaginary bag
all right
and then
we ended up using it for the third act
so hopefully
it all kind of comes together
it sounds like
we planned it all along
but it was a long time
when we tried to actually make sure
that the bag only held five
yeah
and then it became
even more cumbersome
to actually make that real
actually that bag
is gonna be really big
yeah yeah
so it an imaginary bag
bing bong spelling of d-a-n-g-e-r
that was something cooley wrote
josh cooley again
our head of story and writer
he wrote that and then
it came under scrutiny
because people were like
well if joy joy knows how to spell
and if she follows this guy willingly
into a danger place
does it make her dumb
and the answer is yes
but we dont care because it funny
yes and actually
joy just wants to get through
even if she like
oh yeah well whatever
yeah
whatever gets me back home
yeah
so this is ronnie big part
in the movie ready
there it is
let cut this part out
im sure that
somebody was gonna cut this part out
that ronnie saying
loneliness which is fun
and elissa knight who is
she the voice of eve in wall-e
and she did all of our scratch recording
our temporary recording for joy
we put her through the wringer
yeah
she is such a trouper
she was our joy for the longest time
in our temp tracks
and informed a lot of our discoveries
about joy
abstract thought was
one of those we came up with early on
we made remember we made
a list on the white board
of all the different places in the mind
that you could go
and this was one we circled
we were like
we got to go there i wanna see
cause we can bring the audience
and visualize this stuff in ways
that you could never do
in any other way
yeah we were jonesing on
we can do 2-d
yeah
what thatd be awesome
yeah and if you
listen to the track
the audio actually reflects
the visuals as well
it starts in surround
and then when it goes 2-d
it all goes to the front
and then when it goes abstract
it all goes to the center speaker
and it very compressed and confined
so that was a really fun sequence to do
we actually put together
a separate team a special team
that did all the modelling
the design work
the lighting and everything in there
so that it would be as efficient as
we could be
yes we isolated them
we kept them from food
and human contact
and that why that sequence
is so insane
well weirdly that
one of those because it different
it is hugely expensive
it looks simple
it looks simple
you know anything outside
sort of the normal production pipeline
makes for difficulties
so it was one of those sequences
that was not easy to actually make work
but one that when we started
working on it it was so fun
and it proved that
it definitely has to be in the film
at first it really just felt
kind of gratuitous
and so we came up
with this idea of four stages
this was the first
and it became a ticking clock thing
so every time they abstract
yeah it fun to look at
but it also tightening the wrench and
more dangerous
the longer they stay there
of course it also the first
test of bing bong ability as a guide
which he flunks right
so joy starts
to check in with sadness
which is kind of a little tick
in her relationship with sadness
imagination land was
one of those examples of childhood
of holding on to childhood
and so this scene
i think we initially designed it as
again echoing that idea that joy loves
and relishes all those childhood things
um but in our first script
they were being torn down
making way for new stuff like
the imaginary boyfriend generator
and things like that
that why you notice
that the design of these
the whole place
is not so colorful or shiny
everything a little disheveled unused
it kind of like
an abandoned theme park
bing bong rocket was something
that we had
many long discussions about as well
because we knew
i think we designed it early on
and we were using it as a way
to get out of the dump
but we hadnt really folded it in
in any real way
so we had one version where
well let just have him
introduced with it
so when we first meet him
as he scavenging
through the memory shelves
he would have that rocket
but then we were like
well wait a minute
if he has the rocket why dont they
just use it to get back to headquarters
so we had to say well okay
let wait to reveal it till later
and how much can we get away with
like if you introduce it
right before they throw it away
then it doesnt really have any value
so it just one of these things
that happened in the course
of making the movie
that you kind of just accept
as an audience
but you dont know
all this incredible work
that went into making it play
oh yes
speaking of which
we used to end imagination land
with bing bong
kind of getting distracted
like hey hey let go this way
i want you to see this thing
come over here
and joy going yeah but
shouldnt we hey bing bong wait
that was a cliffhanger which seemed
like an interesting idea
then we realized well were starting
the scene negative
so we should reverse it
and make it a positive ending
and everything is all good
on that subplot
meanwhile
riley is here playing hockey
and having a tough time of it
hockey is one of those things
that was definitely part of
my childhood in minnesota
minnesota being kind of
the annex of canada
hockey was really big in minnesota
so even though i cant even
stand up on the ice
it felt like something that we could use
as a representation of riley childhood
and the things she loved
that now she going to give up
or at least have
some different relationship with
and it was a chance
for us to show headquarters again
they are kind of discovering
along with the audience
how things work
cause this is a state
that riley never really been in before
theyve never lost
all the core memories
so maybe if we put one of these
other ones in that would work no
so were trying to close the doors
for the audience
like the only solution
is to bring these things back
yes
so this is bing bong now
at a big turn in his arc
so if you think of him
as being completely innocent
and kind of blind to reality
when we met him
this beat here shows
that no longer is he valued
that his stuff ready to be thrown away
and he says
riley cant be done with me
and it a big big turn for him
yeah actually
every time i watch this sequence
im amazed that we actually show
the history of imagination land
in one sequence
when you walk through the gates
it seems like everything
is so beautiful and so playful
and then you see it being torn down
oh my gosh
it had a life cycle already
ed catmull president of pixar
had some interesting notes
for us on this scene
because he felt like we were giving
away the punchline with this scene
that the fact that sadness
in fact at the first pass through this
we had much deeper discussion
at the end of it
remember that
yes
so joy says
how did you do that to sadness
and she says well i dont know
he was sad
so i listened to what he was sad about
and she walks away
and joy like hmm
because of that especially ed felt like
the ending is not really a surprise now
because we know
from that reaction there
what going to happen
so we cut it way back
we actually went through a whole pass
of trying to disguise this even more
to the point of actually breaking the
scene which was kind of working
i guess
that the usual process
and almost every scene does that
i think it our way of
getting really close to the solution
and then at 0% that not working
well work on that forever
yeah sometimes you have
to drive way way around into the woods
before you come back
to meet the mainland
oh we did that
a lot on this movie
oh boy every movie
the one thing that changed here
was the fact that joy
she used to just walk off screen
and be on a stage wait a little bit
and now she walks off and continues
to try to urge them onward
which is her goal
come on we got to get to the train
come on sadness
dont make him worse
dont make him feel worse
so that helps as well
really between those two things
cutting off sadness
right there at the end
and that other adjustment
yes
and it really
quite an emblematic scene
of what sadness is effective at
in this world
this is the very first time
wherein you can see
that she really able to
manifest empathy
ronnie talk for a minute
about screen direction
cause as we watch the train here
head towards headquarters
im just reminded
of all the backflips we did
because
this world is actually circular
and for the longest time
we were trying to make sure
that we also know if were cutting
from this journey to that journey
so headquarters is always
going to be on screen left for us
when you were doing story
just to make sure that that is foolproof
and then the journey
when joy and sadness
are thrown out of headquarters
they go towards screen right
so when they have to head back home
they have to head back home
towards screen left
that set up
right there in that first shot
when they first get plonked out
into long term
theyre going the wrong way
if the characters are going screen right
that means that joy is having to take
the long way to go home
eventually when they meet bing bong
bing bong actually starts moving them
towards screen left
so every time that
we actually zig and zag
it actually supposed to mean
that theyre either getting closer
or farther away from each other
kevin nolting our editor
thinks were too persnickety about that
he right
he is right
but in general i think
it just helps orient the audience
this little bit here as fear runs away
this was boarded
some really funny stuff
that the story guys came up with
and then when we recorded with bill
i could tell
as he was recording
he was seeing this all in his head
and he was acting it out
just right there in front of the mic
remember that he was just like
yeah
you know
all these great sounds
and i could see it coming to life
in his brain
and so when we animated it
i just told the animators
go back look at that footage of bill
and youll get exactly
what were talking about
i know bill seems to
have a mind that built for cartoons
when he walking around
here at pixar
he home
he unfettered
and when he here
in a recording studio
it almost feels like
were giving him these lines
that seems like it just not enough
to let him loose
yeah
you remember bill came to pixar
yes
i think he flew himself
to pixar just to visit
i know
which is kind of would he do that
i think so
that was the feeling
it felt like he was
just any one of those people
who wanted to visit pixar and he
i wonder what he would say
we should just call him
you want to just call him
and see what he says
okay let call him
hang on a second
hello hello
hello bill hader
yes
this is pete docter calling
hey pete
and ronnie here too
and right now were recording
the director commentary
and we thought
we have a couple questions for bill
hi bill
hi ronnie
we were just
starting to talk about
you being a major element in this film
and remembering you coming to pixar
why was that
did you just want to show up or what
yeah im a big pixar nerd
and i asked my agent
i had a flight back from la to new york
and i said oh can i make a quick stop
to san francisco
and just take a tour of pixar
they said
sorry pixar doesnt give tours
yeah they dont give tours
but they were nice enough
to give me a tour
and i met you and jonas
i met everybody i think that trip
and we had lunch
and then they showed me around
it was amazing
and then i thought well that that
and then i think i extended an invitation
to you and ronnie
if you guys ever wanted to come
to snl and see our creative process
cause we do a show in a week
and you guys take
a little longer yeah
of course we said
no of course not
we said watch out
were going to take you up on that
i remember this one moment
i was thinking
okay i guess he says he a pixar fan
but well whatever
and then you were talking
and then you interrupted yourself
and youre like
is that ralph eggleston
yeah i saw ralph eggleston
i was like that ralph eggleston
no you didnt just say
ralph eggleston
i think you rattled off
all of his movie credits right after
that right
in chronology
that how big a nerd you were
but then we realized
bill knows that much about everything
one of the other things
i was going to ask is
ronnie and i werent in the room
with you and cooley a lot of times
but in addition to doing voice work
we were able to con you
into doing some writing
you didnt have to con me at all
you said do you want to write
i go i can write in a pixar movie yes
all right
just to see the process too
of how you guys produce stories
and now you know the secret
that it an absolute mess
yeah it a mess no one knows
it just like everywhere
no one knows what going on
thank you
see that that amazing
we try to tell people that and they
feel like oh yeah yeah right
you just dont want to talk
about your secrets
so you and cooley wed give you
specific sequences to work on right
yeah mostly i remember working
on dream production
that was a big one
and then we had written
a whole sequence
for the clown where there was
all this dental equipment
oh yeah
sharp objects
it was a forest of dental equipment
of scrapers and awful dentist things
and then there was this thing
where the clown made
balloon animals that came to life
and he sicced them
on joy and sadness
yeah
they were pursued out of there
and they ran after them
like it was a pack of balloon animals
and then they would get caught
on the dentist equipment
yes
and they would break
and then i think we made it so
that joy purposely steered them there
right
yeah yeah
joy purposely ran
through the dentist equipment
i remember pitching you guys that
and you guys went yeah
see that a cool idea
is it too late to go back and change that
then i remember
we also had a character
that was a weird girl from school
that was in her night gear
who sat on the monkey bars
yeah and she turned around and
looked down and she just went mine
yeah
oh yes
yeah
that was so creepy and scary
i remember working on that sequence
i actually remember
when i first came in really early on
you guys had a version of the movie
where riley was knocked out
remember that
yes
yeah she was out in the woods
she fell down and she got knocked out
it was more about waking her up
and i remember us talking about that
and we were all saying
well im not really worried about
these emotions in her head
im more worried about the young girl
out in the elements
lying unconscious in the woods
i dont know if anybody gonna really
care about the emotions in her head
we were like get her up
a wolf going to come and get her
i remember that went out the window
it was so cool for me
to be able to get a sequence
then we would talk it through
and then having cooley there
who also has such a great story brain
and ronnie does you guys all do
i cant draw to save my life
but just how quickly
they put up boards
just the immediacy
of visual storytelling like that
where i would go
you know it kind of like
you know these
kind of dentist equipment
and then cooley is looking at me
while he drawing
uh-huh is it something like that
im like exactly exactly like that
that was such a cool experience
well i was going to say
all these ideas sound great
and why did we cut them
but not all of them were great i guess
no that the other thing you learn
is that you got to stay
with the main characters
and kind of what theyre doing
you cant get bogged down
in all these other things
all they care about is joy and sadness
yeah and that was actually
why we initially were like
we got to get bill
cause you do such great characters
i think that was one of the first things
we plumbed your brain for
is like who is sadness and
oh right
remember i did all the characters
yeah
you guys put me in the studio
and you said
what would a sadness person
sound like
yeah i did em all
oh it so bad that
for a long time
that what sadness sounded like
gosh my oldest daughter was one
so that was four or five years ago
yeah
it been a long road
it been a long road but it was fun
and you guys came to snl
and you guys watched us
and you sat in the rewrite table
at the table-read
yeah we did
yes
i remember you guys sitting there
watching us shoot
going into where the director is
in the booth and all these things
and then when you watch
dream production
a lot of that ends up in there
yeah
yeah we even did the
cards
the cards
which i guess you guys said
nobody else really does cue cards
with actual physical cards anymore
yeah
but we put that in
we got to sit
and watch the writers sweat
as they perform the skits
yeah it was
a great learning experience
we actually were so inspired
that when we came back
we actually had a lot of that glow
of having been in snl
and how they create
and youre right
there was a lot of the cues too
when we have a dream production
the makeup people
that you were riffing that
the director would say
okay were ready
makeup get out of there
that all from you just workshopping
and we had to put it in
it felt so natural
cause watching you go
from one sketch to another
it would be like
an entire wardrobe change
new hair new everything
and 4 seconds later
blam youre in somewhere else
also you have snl
paula pell
as the voice of the director right
paula pell is one of
the great snl writers
and one of
the loveliest people on earth
yeah amy suggested
when we asked her
who should we get to play
the director
i think pretty immediately
she was like paula
paula is amazing i think all of us just
if we could put paula in every project
we would she great
she one of the
in the mount rushmore of snl writers
she would be
on the cliff chiseled in
yes shed be chiseled in
right next to jim downey
and people like that
cool
all right well thanks bill
we wont take any more of your time
thanks guys
cool
ill talk to you guys later
see you
so obviously the music
was a huge part of the film as well
and working with michael
as we had on up
was an absolute joy
it a dream
he great to work with
and just watching his process
is really cool
in fact why dont we give him a call too
really
let call him let call him
he can speak for himself
about the process
it will be fun
here i think i have his number
he probably going
what number is that
im not answering that phone
youve reached the office
of michael giacchino
were not able to answer
the phone right now
so if youll please leave us a message
well return your call
as soon as possible
if this is an emergency you can
contact michael assistant david
well i guess he wasnt there
hey michael this is pete
we were just making the commentary
for the dvd
and thought wed give you a call
and talk about it
but youre not there
so now we have your
voicemail all right see you bye
all right so he wasnt there
i think it because
i think you owe him money
i made him mad
he not taking my call
so this is where anger of course
plugs that idea in
i had one pass where
the first time he thought of it
was when he plugged it in
yeah yeah
it used to happen quicker
but the tension and the escalation
we didnt feel it
that why we had to parse it out
a little more
the other thing we realized
well if this is the threat
if riley personality
and riley safety is what at stake
let introduce that threat
earlier in act 2
and use it as kind of
a sword of damocles hanging over us
for the longest time
we were trying to find out
what was the worst thing
that could happen to riley
we went well she could be
actually knocked out
or she could get lost somewhere
eventually we landed on the fact
that the worst thing that could happen
is if she actually
just wanted to run away
we had that idea early
but we doubted that it would be enough
well the reason i think was
joy and sadness
are the protagonists of this thing
joy being the protagonist that is
so if riley is in physical danger
joy has no power right
she cant affect that at all
so we have to somehow
design this in a way
that the emotions
can come to the rescue
and save this kid
rather than
putting her in physical danger
we wanted to make it
an emotional choice
or the reason that
all of these things are going wrong
is because joy and sadness
are not back in headquarters
if only they were back in headquarters
things would turn around
so there
they go off to screen left
this déjà vu gag was something
that we wrote originally
for elsewhere in the film
but we needed some sort of levity here
because we had
some large stretches of dark stuff
i just relocated it
and it seemed to work pretty well
it works much better here
this sequence this was born
out of the memory dump
so this is just another example
of how everything jumps around
like you dont just move forward
through a film
and interestingly this sequence
in the memory dump
was there from the very very beginning
as a placeholder of what would happen
joy needed to have an epiphany
and learn something deep
but it was never really clear what it was
that she was learning or how
it wasnt till pretty late that ronnie
went off and reboarded that
as a part of that you went backwards
to this scene to say
this is setting up this idea
of the twisty tree and joy loves it
which were then going to come back to
and understand why
this is the way we make movies
we arrive at the dark night
of the soul of joy
coming to terms
with learning what really important
but we also try to solve all of it
in that one sequence
because it was like
oh my god this is going to work
but people were wondering well
it feels like that would be the solution
but we didnt earn
that solution just yet
so that why it like oh where can
we find ways to plant the seed
of where her epiphany would begin
this beat here
where riley steals the credit card
is our tribute to hitchcock
when we were making it
it felt like it needed a lot more tension
and im such a big fan of hitchcock
specifically the scenes in marnie
when she stealing from the safe
and the cleaning lady comes in
i remember you
talking about that
so we kind of
made room for it to be
that kind of tension of like
will she get caught
there really an interesting
lesson when we were mixing this
on a gut instinct i said
bring the music way back
and bring all the little creaks and pops
things you think of as foley
bring that all forward
because that the way
when youre sneaking around
youre hyper-attuned hyperaware
and that really to me
made the tension ratchet up
yeah it worked
which is pretty cool
the train of thought derailing was
i tried forever to get
a joke in there of
like cutting to riley
in the middle of saying something
and then
im sorry i lost my train of thought
but it just felt like the wrong place
because it was
a high drama moment
but if it wasnt quite like that
it would have worked
yeah
this piece right here is this great piece
of music by michael giacchino
and i remember talking to him about
this repeating phrase
that just drives this whole sequence
and he was saying well
you know how when youre exercising
or really focused for some reason
you kind of get this one piece
of music caught in your head
and it loops and it loops
and so it very psychologically based
i thought
it pretty neat
and it does a great job
of driving this whole sequence
as riley is now running away
the worst thing possible
for our characters
theyre trying to stop her
from doing that
but obviously it doesnt work out
this was another scene that took
a lot of redoing like all of them
but were focusing on the ones
that seemed especially hard to crack
how do i put this
because it difficult it painful
yeah yeah
because we did it
over and over again
we knew what it needed to do
this was going to be joy choosing
she actually backsliding
yeah
when she starting
to actually relate to sadness already
things are seemingly working
between them the duo
she reverts to
a former version of herself
that one that chooses poorly
youre right pete
we did it over and over again
and i think it worked in various ways
but towards the end
we wanted to make sure that it ironclad
that she makes the worst decision
at the wrong time
at some point we sort of
realized it was a mechanical problem
we need to design something
that does not allow sadness and joy
to fit into the same space
without changing the memories
so joy has to choose
do i either bring my friend up
and change riley
or do i preserve riley
and abandon my friend
and of course
she then chooses poorly
riley walks out into the fog
i remember ralph eggleston
our production designer
having a couple ideas of how to connect
the real world and the mind world
and fog was another of those
that just feels very psychological
and it was inherent in san francisco
that this fog would be across the city
that would kind of equate to
what going on in riley head
the fog of the mind
yeah exactly
all right so now the memory dump
one of the first pieces of artwork
i remember you doing
was that one of joy standing there
and it blue-green
as all the memories are falling
into the memory dump
remember this
yes yes
this is going back in time
when pete and i
were the only people in production
actually back then
we wanted to find a way
maybe riley herself
can be in the journey
and we had versions of that too
yeah
but our process between pete and i is
we will talk about things
and then i would draw something
or i would talk about something
and pete would suggest something
that makes me think of these pictures
and these images
and that was one of those things
that made us think about
how we can isolate joy
in a desolate place
that also brings in this rain of memories
that coming from the sky
yeah and i think
the point there was just emotionally
in this world of the mind
the concept of memories
being forgotten
just seemed very potent
and something to mess with
and that all of course
comes from pete observations
of his daughter changing
you would talk about looking at pictures
of them when they were younger
yeah
and
aw they were so cute back then
yeah kind of
breaks your heart in a way
right i remember
when you talk about that
it reminds me of my kids too
and sort of like yeah youre right
because there would be
like a stretch of just weeks
wherein they already look different
and then you as a parent start thinking
it like wait i dont think
im paying attention enough
theyre growing up
and i didnt notice them change
yeah
this is what turned out to be
the longest shot in the film
it was one of the very last
in fact i think it was
the last shot to be final
because this sequence even though
it was there from the very beginning
came under a lot of scrutiny
of how heavy do we get
how long is it
and so there was
a lot of back and forth
we animated all around this shot
this one shot
because it was a lot of debate
about how deep should we get
how long should we allow her
to sit there and reminisce
and how to make it
the most emotional that it could be
so it really only crystallized
at the very very end of production
and then of course the animators
had to crank through it
and it really well the good thing was
it forced us to really
break down the beats
so if you look at any animated shot
i like to think of it in beats
so you have these very clear phrases
of what going on throughout the shot
and you can break it down
and talk about each beat
and what emotionally important
and then what brings you
to the next beat and so on
so the animator did a fantastic job
of making that all very clear
and of course amy performance
i remember for this sequence
we turned the lights down
we cleared the room out
and we talked a lot about her kids
and watching them grow up
and kind of getting her in the mood
and she did it a couple of times
and i kind of felt bad but i said
im not quite buying it yet
can you just really go for it
and she said okay
and she took a moment and she
gave us this great great performance
which just makes me cry
even just to think about it
amazing amazing
actually wed done
many attempts of this very sad moment
and each time when she gets to it
she starts tearing up
and it makes me tear up
yeah and all the specifics of
do you remember when she used to
stick her tongue out and whatnot
those all came from
i think we learned on up that the more
specific and truthful you can be
the more meaningful the scene will be
so that my daughter would stick
her tongue out when she was coloring
and so those were all kind of things
that we pulled from
i know all of our
family stories are somehow nested
in all these sequences
yeah that true
the sadness voiceover
i remember that was something
that you added ronnie
and bridging back to that scene
in the train
yeah that always fun
when pete and i were
working together we would be
just to push production
outside of our rooms
wed just go and hole up
and were trying to
make these elements play
yeah
and when
were pitching to each other
these kinds of epiphanies
and solutions show up
because the pressure of production
is like just at bay
we have half an hour
let work on this
yeah go go
and then
kind of stepped to the left
and to the right of something
and then oh wait what did you say
and then yeah
and it a lot of it is somehow
yearning for something
yeah
i remember
that i wished that joy
could hear again
what sadness had said
mmm-hmm
i wished that she could hear
oh so that what
brought that idea out
it kind of like those
conversations you have with people
youre kind of like
your ears are taking the data in
but it not really sinking in
yeah i know what you mean
right so
and this is the only time
it actually comes home for her
yeah
this is what she meant
yeah
this cue was one of the very few
that we redid
i think michael originally wrote it
a little more peppy and upbeat
not that it not peppy
it has a great energy to it now
but i think it was basically
the same thing in a major key
so it felt like hey were gonna
make it from the get-go
and so we went back
and redid it in a minor key
so as to imply like
we may not make it
yes
and bing bong disappearing
mmm-hmm
is one of those thematic things
that we wanted from the beginning
because he is that symbol of childhood
that is fading away
he already an out-of-work
imaginary friend
he doesnt have a role in riley life
yeah
and here he is
in the worst place in the mind
wherein if youre in there
you are gonna disappear
and this is the last moment
that he gonna be solid
and it his chance
to be back with riley
in a way that
you wouldnt have thought of
like it his way to save riley
like his sacrifice is
what gets joy back up there
we know that riley gonna be okay
and when he disappears
i remember
this is one of those moments
that you live for in this business
because so much of it believe it or not
so much of what we do
is work work work
and drudgery a little bit
but once in a while you have these
moments where you look at each other
and youre kind of
completing each other sentences
and youre so excited about
oh my gosh we have this character
who represents childhood
of course he needs to disappear
just like childhood does
and it all symbolic
and yeah perfect
and i knew this would be
well i hoped that
it would be emotional for people
and sure enough i mean
weve had a lot of people say
isnt there some way to maybe
bring bing bong back at the end
cause we dont like
that he disappears he so sad
like well childhood cant come back
so he has to die
yes
we like to torture people
yeah
no actually
pete this moment was
working very well when he disappears
when he actually does
back then we had him do a somersault
yeah
and he was
very high-energy and peppy
and then he waves silently
and disappears
and then you had put in another recall
of what he wanted to do
when he gets back with riley
his hopes and he knows
he not gonna be able to do it
so you put in that line
he saying he like
well take her to the moon for me
which to me kind of says
make sure she has a little bit
of childhood as she grows up
you know hang on to that
i know i know
that was perfect
and i know that people their heart
breaks a little bit when they see that
oh no i love bing bong
so then
were into the third act now
how do we get joy
back to headquarters
and this was actually
a really tough nut to crack
i guess we keep saying that
the whole movie was tough
yeah everything was so tough
yeah yeah you draw and
you make cartoons how hard can it be
yeah
it is trust me
because every day
you have this problem to solve
and it doesnt yield answers for years
even though you get really close to it
and that frustrating
i think one of the keys to this
was realizing
if joy has been trying to keep
sadness away from headquarters
now she wants to get sadness
to headquarters
so let not make that easy for her
let make the characters
not just the situation in opposition
so we went backwards
and even though
it a little bit loose i think
as to why sadness is trying to run away
she sort of feeling guilt-ridden and
responsible for all these bad things
but joy now has to work
to get her and bring her back
so that then really helped
shape the whole thing
we also had this concept
from pretty early on that
hey we have this great place
imagination land
we also have dream production
we have all the bucket of cool places
weve been to
how can we use some one
or all of those things to get them back
for a while weve tried
bringing the clown out of subconscious
oh yeah
and he was gonna
sit on a giant whoopee cushion
which was gonna propel them up
we knew that we didnt wanna
repeat the same thing with the wagon
cause wed just seen them
fly out of the dump
so it had to be something else
one of the things that the biggest
laughs in the making of the film
was the boyfriend thing
and so we thought
let try to use that again
which is a little bizarre but you know
i know well and also that
that what you want
the cloud town
it seemed like it was there
and that those puffy clouds could float
i wonder if that could be a conveyance
oh of course not it cant
wait a second
what if
the boyfriends
who are voiced by
one of our story artists tony maki
who just seemed like he had that
sort of overly dramatic kind of
he has a handsome voice
yeah he does
and he a handsome fellow
this blew me away the ha-ha
blew me away
the balloon blowing those cards over
that was the effects department
and they used this simulation tool
which approximates
what would happen if you actually had
all these cards stacked up
and generated
so it pretty neat-looking
there goes joy
and then the boyfriends
we contemplated several times
because she says time to prove it
the boys say we would die for riley
should we show them
actually falling down into the dump
you know
we decided not to go for gruesome
but it sort of implied
that they do they
it implied
that they sacrificed themselves
hey theyre imaginary so
yes
and all of that is fun
workshopping with a story crew
coming together brainstorming
dog-piling on this problem
and then this happens
and then this happens
yeah the story crew was
and that would happen
when you can find
these kind of ideas like this
where we know basically
where were trying to go
but how why where all that stuff
is really fun for them to involve them in
and they had some great ideas
yeah
this was another one
where we rewrote many times
disgust speech to anger
trying to upset him
and provoke him into anger
and i dont remember how many
different versions of that we did
and tortured
mindy
poor mindy was rerecording them
but i think it turned out really well
she a trouper
so then having held sadness
back from the console
joy now urges her forward
and this was john and andrew
helping us quite a bit
trying to make it as much of a surprise
not only to the audience
but to these other characters
so they assume joy is gonna
step forward and save the day
and instead joy now has learned
that it gonna be sadness
so she able to step up
and remove that idea
something that i remember
when we boarded this
it was a little unclear as to when
exactly she is able to clear the console
and make it usable again
and in layout this is one of those
you never quite know as things
you kind of figure things out
we pushed the idea of sadness
actually touching the console
until the moment when joy actually
once she replays the memories
mmm-hmm
so early on
i think she had touched the console
cooled it down got the memory out
but that sort of implied
that riley was already feeling sad
so we separated those concepts
and made that different
this is the payoff that joy has been
trying to prevent the whole film
sadness dont touch the memories
dont touch the core memories
stay away
and now she willingly
gives them over to her
and it sad for her
i think she knows
she doing the right thing on one level
but it also painful
just like watching your kids grow up
the replay here of the memories
we double-printed frames so it kind of
an inferred slow motion
we could have animated it
or rendered it in slowmo
but i think this really
cements the idea that
i dont know this is the way i feel about
when you think about nostalgic
memories that are bittersweet
and i love this last shot
skating away from the camera
kind of represents this is minnesota
it going away
going away
this was kind of a gut instinct
that i thought id try
is when sadness
finally touches the console
it has this warm rich
resonant tone to it
i guess what i was going for
one of the psychologists
we talked to dacher keltner
he pointed out the vagus nerve
which is in your chest
and it that warm rich feeling
when you really love someone
or something good happens
you have this blooming feeling
from your chest
and i think that what
i was going for with that tone
that when sadness
even though it counterintuitive
cause sadness
doesnt really usually feel like that
finally after all this time
of holding her back
were finally gonna allow her forward
and then that the last sound
that we hear before it all drops out
and we just have the silence of riley
talking to her parents
and admitting finally that she sad
which is something joy would
never wanna do prior to this journey
and it ultimately
what brings them together
there a lot of orchestration
about memories
that we had been trying to find
ways to loop back in
mmm-hmm
this blue memory
i remember from the very beginning
the story guys were like well
it went to the dump you recover it
shouldnt you bring it back
mmm-hmm
i was like yeah
we have so many memories to track
where is what where
but it now becomes
emotionally satisfying
that that was where
all of these problems began for joy
now she willing
to give it back to sadness
yeah i also felt like
the core memories were for riley
this one was for sadness
for sadness
it like a
little offering for her
i love that this whole ending reverses
the sort of usual loud action thing
that usually
traditionally happens in movies
you build build build to this big climax
and here weve pulled back
and it just the quietness
and the sadness of riley
that able to complete the whole thing
and also
if you notice this is a bookend
wherein we began the movie with joy
and then sadness comes in
the fly in the ointment as pete had said
and then here at the resolve
we have joy and sadness
but they are actually
embracing each other
yeah
we had a lot of different ideas for
different islands that could be out there
somehow it seemed funnier
to just hear their names
than to go for close-ups or anything
the new console
was meant to symbolize
the complexity of adult emotions
i dont think this is really true
but our experience of it
is that children have very pure
simple emotions
probably very loud ones too
and as adults they become
much more complex and nuanced
so the console
was symbolizing all of that
yes and confusing
look at those buttons
yeah
of course after the dinner scene played
so well in some of our early screenings
here at work there was a desire
for callbacks from mom and dad
so we have the face painting
we can sense that things
are gonna work out all right
mom not gonna go off with
the brazilian helicopter pilot after all
and then i dont remember
who came up with the boy thing
was it josh was it you
oh probably was josh
i dont remember
anyway that
after this sort of melancholy sweet
wonderful sad moment
this is a way to kind of bring
some energy back in
and leave on an uptick
and great acting on riley
yeah
i love it
and then
we also really wanted to show
even though the primary relationship in
the film was between joy and sadness
we wanted to demonstrate
to the audience
that all of the emotions are now
involved in a very sort of team-like way
so from one to the other
we switch off back and forth
in this one shot here
watching riley play hockey
and then this last shot we go
from a very close-up here on riley
all the way to a wide shot
and i love that
even after this whole journey
joy after everything she learned
she ends the film
with essentially the same thing
she said at the beginning
which what could happen
she an eternally optimistic character
kind of clueless but that the way
that the way we all are
that the way joy is
we move forward
hoping for the best
the credits here we added
to address a concern
that a lot of folks had
that the movie was too sad
which not everybody agreed with
but i cant disagree that this whole
ending really brings a lot of humor
and people love it
so it was a fun chance to play
with one of these great ideas
that the film offered up
which is what going on
inside people heads
so this is our chance
to have some fun with that
and meet random people
yes exactly
and actually very early in the process
we had experimented
going inside a baby head
yes
inside a dog head
and a goldfish head
goldfish yeah
and we cant fit it in
we didnt know
it was so funny
how about a credit sequence
it like oh i dont know wait
we can use it there
yeah
in the end im proud of this movie
and the statement that it makes
that in a world where
we try to generally avoid sadness
we see sadness as a bad thing
we even medicate it
people will take drugs
to avoid feeling sad
this movie asserts
the necessity of sadness
and the importance
that it plays in our lives
and the richness that it brings
and i think as an adult especially
you tend to experience
all these different emotions
that you initially tried to avoid
because they add a richness to your life
and a real warmth
and complexity to things
ah im so happy
to have been on this movie
because i learned so much
about emotions
but not only that
this is one of the most complex
and most difficult movies
i have ever worked on
yeah me too
i dont think ronnie i dont think we
would have been able to do this movie
even like five years prior
oh goodness me no
it just took every ounce
of our training and
experience
yeah
patience
yes
climbing tepuis is much easier
that true
that true yeah we got to explore
the world out there on up
and then we went inside on this one
and it was quite a journey
it was yes
but im so happy and so grateful
to be part of it
me too
i think working with everybody
i mean it been a fantastic journey
and everyone on the film from the story
crew all the way down to rendering
was wonderful
i think the film fundamentally
changed me in a lot of ways
the experience of the film itself
is of course really
it always ends up
having an effect on you
but just doing the research
and thinking day after day
about our emotions
and what driving us
and what going on under the hood
i think it really
made me think more deeply
about the way i interact with people
and what going on in their heads
and like a lot of times you think
man this guy such a jerk
or so mean or whatever
and likely he not
theyre not trying to do that
it their emotions
and this whole other system
that is unconsciously
below their even conscious control
it kind of driving them through life
and theyre just doing the best they can
based on what they have
and in the long run
i think the thing that really
affected me was this idea
that emotions
are the key to relationships
that those things
that we sometimes try to avoid
anger fear disgust whatever
are ultimately the very thing
that make for the deepest relationships
in our lives
and i feel like that the basic thesis
of the film and the statement of the film
and it pretty powerful
im so glad you thought of it
well it wasnt me
it was a big crew so it was
anyway were sort of rambling here
so i think were probably done
