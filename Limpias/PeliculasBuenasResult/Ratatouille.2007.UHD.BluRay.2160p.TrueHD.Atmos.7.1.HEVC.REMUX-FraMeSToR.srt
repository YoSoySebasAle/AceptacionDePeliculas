
although each of the world countries
would like to dispute this fact
we french know the truth
the best food in the world
is made in france
the best food in france
is made in paris
and the best food in paris some say
is made by chef auguste gusteau
gusteau restaurant
is the toast of paris
booked five months in advance
and his dazzling ascent to the top
of fine french cuisine
has made his competitors envious
he is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating
chef gusteau cookbook
anyone can cook
climbed to the top of the bestseller list
but not everyone
celebrates its success
amusing title anyone can cook
what even more amusing is that
gusteau actually seems to believe it
i on the other hand
take cooking seriously
and no i dont think
anyone can do it
this is me
i think it apparent i need
to rethink my life a little bit
what my problem
first of all im a rat
which means life is hard
and second i have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell
flour eggs sugar vanilla bean
oh small twist of lemon
whoa you can smell all that
you have a gift
this is emile my brother
he easily impressed
so you can smell ingredients
so what
this is my dad
he never impressed
he also happens to be
the leader of our clan
so what wrong with having
highly developed senses
whoa whoa whoa dont eat that
what going on here
turns out that funny smell
was rat poison
suddenly dad didnt think
my talent was useless
i was feeling pretty good
about my gift
until dad gave me a job
clean
clean
that right poison checker
cleanerific
cleanerino
close to godliness
which means clean
you know cleanliness is close to
never mind move on
well it made my dad proud
now dont you feel better remy
youve helped a noble cause
noble were thieves dad
and what were stealing is
let face it garbage
it isnt stealing if no one wants it
if no one wants it
why are we stealing it
let just say we have
different points of view
this much i knew
if you are what you eat
then i only want to eat the good stuff
but to my dad
food is fuel
you get picky about what you put in the tank
your engine is going to die
now shut up and eat your garbage
look if were going to be thieves
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen
where nothing is poisoned
first of all we are not thieves
secondly stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans
it dangerous
i know im supposed to hate humans
but there something about them
they dont just survive
they discover they create
i mean just look at what
they do with food
how can i describe it
good food is like music you can taste
color you can smell
there is excellence all around you
you need only be aware
to stop and savor it
oh gusteau was right
oh yeah
oh amazing
each flavor was totally unique
but combine one flavor with another
and something new was created
so now i had a secret life
the only one who knew
about it was emile
hey emile emile
i found a mushroom
come on youre good at hiding food
help me find a good place to put this
he doesnt understand me
but i can be myself around him
why are you walking like that
i dont want to constantly
have to wash my paws
did you ever think about
how we walk on the same paws
that we handle food with
you ever think about what
we put into our mouths
all the time
when i eat i dont want to taste
everywhere my paws have been
well go ahead
but if dad sees you walking like that
he not going to like it
what have you got there
you found cheese
and not just any cheese
tomme de chèvre de pays
that would go beautifully
with my mushroom
and
this rosemary this rosemary
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass
well throw it on the pile i guess
and then well you know
we dont want to throw this in
with the garbage this is special
but were supposed
to return to the colony
before sundown or
you know dad gonna
emile
there are possibilities
unexplored here
we got to cook this
now exactly how we
cook this is the real
yeah
the key is to keep turning it
get the smoky flavor
nice and even
that storm getting closer
hey remy you think that
maybe we shouldnt be so
you got to taste this
this is it got this kind of
it burny melty
it not really a smoky taste
it a certain it kind of like a
it got like this ba-boom zap
kind of taste dont you think
what would you call that flavor
lightning-y
yeah it lightning-y
we got to do that again
okay when the next storm comes
well go up on the roof
i know what this needs saffron
a little saffron would make this
saffron why do i get the feeling
it in the kitchen
it in the kitchen
saffron
not good
saffron
dont like it
she going to wake up
ive been down here a million times
she turns on the cooking channel
boom she never wakes up
youve been here a million times
im telling you saffron will be just the thing
gusteau swears by it
okay who gusteau
just the greatest chef in the world
wrote this cookbook
wait you read
well not excessively
oh man does dad know
you could fill a book a lot of books
with things dad doesnt know
and they have which is why i read
which is also our secret
i dont like secrets
all this cooking and reading
and tv-watching
while we read and cook
it like youre involving me in crime
and i let you
why do i let you
what taking those kids so long
laquila saffron italian huh
gusteau says it excellent
good thing the old lady is a food love
forget mystique
this is about your cooking
hey that gusteau emile look
great cooking is not
for the faint of heart
you must be imaginative
strong hearted
you must try things
that may not work
and you must not let anyone
define your limits
because of where you come from
your only limit is your soul
what i say is true anyone can cook
but only the fearless can be great
pure poetry
but it was not to last
gusteau restaurant lost
one of its five stars
after a scathing review by france
top food critic anton ego
it was a severe blow to gusteau
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards
which according to tradition
meant the loss of another star
gusteau is dead
run
no youll lead her to the colony
help remy help
emile start swinging the light
try to grab you
emile swing to me
evacuate everyone to the boats

we needed a garbage boy
oh garbage well
im glad it worked out
i cant believe it
a real gourmet kitchen
and i get to watch
youve read my book
let us see how much you know huh
which one is the chef
oh that guy
very good
who is next in command
the sous chef there
the sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef not around
saucier in charge of sauces
very important
chef de partie demi chef de partie
both important
commis commis theyre cooks
very important
you are a clever rat
now who is that
oh him he nobody
not nobody
he is part of the kitchen
no he a plongeuror something
he washes dishes or takes out the garbage
he doesnt cook
but he could
uh no
how do you know
what do i always say
anyone can cook
well yeah anyone can
that doesnt mean that anyone should
well that is not stopping him see
what is he doing
no no no this is terrible
he ruining the soup
and nobody noticing
it your restaurant do something
what can i do
i am a figment of your imagination
but he ruining the soup
we got to tell someone that he
table five coming up right now
coming down the line

hot open oven
coming around
oui chef
one fillet mignon three lamb two duck

it has a wonderful finish
ready to go on table seven
come on let go
oui chef
remy what are you waiting for
is this going to become
a regular thing with you
you know how to fix it
this is your chance
the soup where is the soup
out of my way
move it garbage boy
you are cooking
how dare you cook in my kitchen
where do you get the gall
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic
i should have you
drawn and quartered
ill do it
i think the law is on my side
larousse draw and quarter this man
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head
what are you blathering about
the soup
soup
stop that soup
waiter
linguini
youre fired
f-i-r-e-d fired
she wants to see the chef
but he
what did the customer say
it was not a customer it was a critic
ego
solene leclaire
leclaire what did she say
she likes the soup
wait
what do you mean wait
youre the reason im in this mess
someone is asking about your soup
what are you playing at
am i still fired
you cant fire him
what
leclaire likes it yeah
she made a point of telling you so
if she write a review to that effect
and find out you fired
the cook responsible
he a garbage boy
who made something she liked
how can we claim to represent
the name of gusteau
if we dont uphold his
most cherished belief
and what belief is that
mademoiselle tatou
anyone can cook
perhaps i have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy
he has taken a bold risk
and we should reward that
as chef gusteau would have
if he wishes to swim
in dangerous waters
who are we to deny him
you were escaping
oh yeah
since you have expressed such
an interest in his cooking career
you shall be responsible for it
anyone else
then back to work
you are either very lucky
or very unlucky
you will make the soup again
and this time ill be paying attention
very close attention
they think you might be a cook
but you know what i think linguini
i think you are a sneaky
overreaching little
rat
rat
get the rat
linguini get something to trap it
it getting away get it get it get it
what should i do now
kill it
now
no not in the kitchen are you mad
do you know what
would happen to us
if anyone knew we had
a rat in our kitchen
theyd close us down
our reputation is hanging
by a thread as it is
take it away from here far away
kill it dispose of it go
dont look at me like that
you arent the only one who trapped
they expect me to cook it again
i mean im not ambitious
i wasnt trying to cook
i was just trying to stay
out of trouble
youre the one who was
getting fancy with the spices
what did you throw in there oregano
no what rosemary
that a spice isnt it rosemary
you didnt throw rosemary in there
then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the
i need this job ive lost so many
i dont know how to cook and now im
actually talking to a rat as if you
did you nod
have you been nodding
you understand me
so im not crazy
wait a second wait a second
i cant cook can i
but you
you can right
look dont be so modest
youre a rat for pete sake
whatever you did they liked it
yeah this could work
hey they liked the soup
they liked the soup
do you think you could do it again
okay im going to let you out now
but were together on this right
okay
so this is it
i mean it not much
but it you know
not much
it could be worse
there heat and light
and a couch with a tv
so you know what mine is yours
are you
is this a dream
the best kind of dream
one we can share
but why here
why now
why not here
why not now
what better place to dream
than in paris
morning little chef rise and
oh no
idiot i knew this would happen
i let a rat into my place and
tell him what mine is his
eggs gone
stupid he stolen food and hit the road
what did i expect
that what i get for trusting a
hi is that for me
that good
what did you put in this
whered you get that
look it delicious but dont steal
ill buy some spices okay
oh no were going to be late
and on the first day
come on little chef
though i like many other critic
had written off gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef death
the soup was a revelation
a spicy yet subtle taste experience
solene leclaire
yes
against all odds
gusteau has recaptured our attention
only time will tell if they deserve it
well
you know
look i know it stupid and weird
but neither of us can do this alone
so we got to do it together right
you with me
so let do this thing
i
welcome to hell
now recreate the soup
take as much time as you need
all week if you must
soup
you little
you son of a
you got
this is not going to work little chef
im going to lose it
if we do this anymore
weve got to figure out
something else
something that doesnt involve
any biting or nipping
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet
the biting no scampering no
no scampering or scurrying
understand little chef
little chef
oh youre hungry
okay so let think this out
you know how to cook
and i know how to appear
human
we need to work out a system
so that i do what you want
in a way that doesnt look like im
being controlled by a tiny rat chef
would you listen to me im insane
im insane im insane
in a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant
i will never pull this off
linguini
we gotta communicate
i cant be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a
the rat i saw it
a rat
yes a rat right next to you
what are you doing in here
im just familiarizing myself with
you know the vegetables and such
get out
one can get too familiar
with vegetables you know
that was close
are you okay up there
how did you do that
that strangely involuntary
one look and i knew we had
the same crazy idea
okay
where are you taking me wait
wait im sorry
okay
okay
all right
that should do it
congratulations you were able
to repeat your accidental success
but youll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen boy
colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here
listen i just want you to know
how honored i am to be
studying under such
no you listen i just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with
how many women
do you see in this kitchen
well i
only me why do you think that is
well i
because haute cuisine is
an antiquated hierarchy
built upon rules written
by stupid old men
rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world
but still im here
how did this happen
because well because you
because i am the toughest
cook in this kitchen
ive worked too hard
for too long to get here
and i am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky
got it
wow
easy to cook easy to eat
gusteau makes chinese food
chine-easy
excellent work françois as usual
it good isnt it
i want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept
gusteau corn puppies
theyre like corn dogs only smaller
bite size
what are corn dogs
cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried you know american
whip something up
maybe gusteau in overalls
and huckleberry tom hat
or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up
yes but please with dignity
get my lawyer
well the will stipulates
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death
no heir appears
gusteau business interests
will pass to his sous chef you
i know what the will stipulates
what i want to know is if this letter
if this boy changes anything
there not much resemblance
there no resemblance at all
he is not gusteau son
gusteau had no children
and what of the timing of all this
the deadline in the will
expires in less than a month
suddenly some boy
arrives with a letter
from his recently deceased mother
claiming gusteau is his father
highly suspect
this is gusteau
yes yes yes
may i
of course
but the boy does not know
she claims she never told him or gusteau
and asks that i not tell
why you what does she want
a job for the boy
only a job
well yes
then what are you worried about
if he works here
youll be able to keep an eye on him
while i do a little digging
find out how much of this is real
i will need you to collect
some dna samples
from the boy hair maybe
mark my words
the whole thing is highly suspect
he knows something
relax he a garbage boy
i think you can handle him
what are you doing
im cutting vegetables
im cutting vegetables
no you waste energy and time
you think cooking is a cute job
like mommy in the kitchen
well mommy never had to face
the dinner rush when
the orders come flooding in
and every dish is different
and none are simple
and all of the different cooking times
but must arrive
on the customer table
at exactly the same time
hot and perfect
every second counts
and you cannot be mommy
what is this
keep your station clear
when the meal rush comes
what will happen
messy stations slow things down
food doesnt go orders pile up
disaster
ill make this easy to remember
keep your station clear
or i will kill you
your sleeves look like you
threw up on them
keep your hands and arms in
close to the body like this see
always return to this position
cooks move fast sharp utensils
hot metal keep your arms in
you will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean
mark of a chef
messy apron clean sleeves
i know the gusteau style cold
in every dish chef gusteau
always has something unexpected
i will show you
i memorize all his recipe
always do something unexpected
no follow the recipe
but you just said that
no no no
it was his job to be unexpected
it is our job to
follow his recipes
follow the recipe
how do you tell how good
bread is without tasting it
not the smell not the look
but the sound of the crust
listen
symphony of crackle
only great bread sound this way
the only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day
and there are only
two way to get first pick
grow it yourself or bribe a grower
voilà the best restaurant get first pick
people think haute cuisine is snooty
so chef must also be snooty

remy
emile
i cant believe it youre alive
you made it
i thought id never see you guys again
we figured you didnt
survive the rapids
and what are you eating
i dont really know
i think it was some
sort of wrapper once
what no
youre in paris now baby my town
no brother of mine eats
rejectamenta in my town
remy you are stealing
you told linguini he could trust you
and he can it for my brother
but the boy could lose his job
which means i would too
it under control okay
more wine
i shouldnt but okay
so where did you train linguini
train all right
surely you dont expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking
it not
i knew it
it my second third fourth
fifth time
monday was my first time
but ive taken out the garbage
lots of times before that
yes yes have some more wine
tell me linguini
about your interests
do you like animals
what animals what kind

i have got to teach you about food
close your eyes
now take a bite of
no no no
dont just hork it down
too late
here
chew it slowly
only think about the taste

creamy salty sweet
an oaky nuttiness
you detect that
oh im detecting nuttiness
close your eyes now taste this
whole different thing right
sweet crisp slight tang on the finish
okay
now try them together
okay
i think im getting
a little something there
it might be the nuttiness
see
could be the tang
that it
now imagine every
great taste in the world
being combined into
infinite combinations
tastes that no one has tried yet
discoveries to be made
i think
you lost me again
yeah
but that was interesting
most interesting garbage i ever
what are we doing
dad doesnt know youre alive yet

everyone will be thrilled
yeah but
what
thing is i kind of have to

at some point
nopety nopety no
you know something about rats
you know you do
you know who know do whacka-doo
ratta-tatta
hey why do they call it that
what
ratatouille it like a stew right
why do they call it that
if youre going to name a food
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious
ratatouille doesnt sound delicious
it sounds like rat and patootie
rat patootie
which does not sound delicious
regrettably we are all out of wine
my son has returned
and finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster
nothing been poisoned thank god
but it hasnt been easy
you didnt make it easy
i know i am sorry dad
well the important thing
is that youre home
yeah well about that
you look thin why is that
a shortage of food
or a surplus of snobbery
it tough out there in the
big world all alone isnt it
sure but it not like
im a kid anymore
hey hey boy what up
i can take care of myself
ive found a nice spot not far away
so ill be able to visit often
nothing like a cold splash
of reality to make you
visit
i will i promise often
youre not staying
no it not a big deal dad i just
you didnt think i was going
to stay forever did you
eventually a bird got
to leave the nest
were not birds were rats
we dont leave our nests
we make them bigger
well maybe im a different kind of rat
maybe youre not a rat at all
maybe that a good thing
hey the band really on tonight huh
rats all we do is take dad
im tired of taking
i want to make things
i want to add something
to this world
youre talking like a human
who are not as bad as you say
oh yeah what makes you so sure
oh man

at a close-ish sort of range
yeah how close
close enough
and theyre you know
not so bad as you say they are
come with me
i got something i want you to see
you know im going to stay here
make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up
wait you want me to stay and clean
is that a problem
no
good boy see you tomorrow
were here
take a good long look remy
now this is what happens
when a rat gets a little
too comfortable around humans
the world we live in
belongs to the enemy
we must live carefully
we look out for our own kind remy
when all is said and done
were all weve got
no
what
no dad i dont believe it
youre telling me that the future is
can only be more of this
this is the way things are
you cant change nature
change is nature dad
the part that we can influence
and it starts when we decide
where you going
with luck forward
hey yeah
stop it
good morning
good morning
so the chef
he invited you in for a drink
that big
that big what did he say
what
what you cant tell me
forgive me for intruding on your deep
personal relationship with the chef
oh i see how it is
you get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me
wake up wake up
i thought you were different
i thought you thought
i was different
i thought
i didnt have to help you
if i looked out only for myself
i would have let you drown
but
i wanted you to succeed
i liked you
my mistake
colette wait wait colette
it over little chef
i cant do it anymore
colette wait wait
dont motorcycle away
look im no good with words
im no good with food either
at least not without your help
i hate false modesty
it just another way to lie
you have talent
no but i dont really it not me
when i added that extra ingredient
instead of following the recipe
like you said
that wasnt me either
what do you mean
i mean i wouldnt have done that
i wouldve followed the recipe
i wouldve followed your advice
i wouldve followed your advice
to the ends of the earth
because i love your advice
but
but i
dont do it
i have a secret
it sort of disturbing
i have a
what you
i have a
you have a rash
no no no i have this
this tiny little
little
a tiny chef who tells me what to do
a tiny chef
yes yes he
he up here
in your brain
why is it so hard to talk to you
okay here we go
you inspire me
im going to risk it all
im going to risk looking like the biggest
idiot psycho youve ever seen
you want to know why
im such a fast learner
you want to know why
im such a great cook
dont laugh
im going to show you
no no
what is it ambrister
gusteau
finally closing is it
no
more financial trouble
no it
announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls
what what spit it out
it come back it popular
i havent reviewed gusteau in years
no sir
my last review condemned it
to the tourist trade
yes sir
i said gusteau has finally found
his rightful place in history
right alongside another
equally famous chef
monsieur boyardee
touché
that is where i left it
that was my last word
the last word
yes
then tell me ambrister
how could it be popular
no no no no no no no
the dna matches the timing works
everything checks out
he is gusteau son
this cant just happen
the whole thing is a setup
the boy knows
look at him out there
pretending to be an idiot
he toying with my mind like a cat
with a ball of something
string
yes playing dumb
taunting me with that rat
rat
yes he consorting with it
deliberately trying to make
me think it important
the rat
exactly
is the rat important
of course not
he just wants me to think that it is
oh i see the theatricality of it
a rat appears on the boy first night
i order him to kill it
and now he wants me
to see it everywhere
it here no it isnt it here
am i seeing things am i crazy
is there a phantom rat or is there not
but oh no
i refuse to be sucked
into his little game of
should i be concerned about this
about you
i cant fire him
he getting attention
if i fire him now
everyone will wonder why
and the last thing i want
is people looking into this
what are you so worried about
isnt it good to have the press
isnt it good to have gusteau
name getting headlines
not if theyre over his face
gusteau already has a face
and it fat and lovable and familiar
and it sells burritos
millions and millions of burritos
the deadline passes in three days
then you can fire him whenever
he ceases to be valuable
and no one will ever know
i was worried about
the hair sample you gave me
i had to send them back to the lab
why
because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair
no no no
what
try this it better
well because you
rat
disgusting little creatures
i was reminded how fragile it all was
how the world really saw me
and it just kept getting better
remy
hey hey hey little brother
we were afraid you werent going to
you know show up
hey remy how you doing

bottoms up linguini
cheers ja
chef chef
chef linguini
your rise has been meteoric
yet you have no formal training
what is the secret to your genius
secret you want the truth
i am gusteau son
it in my blood i guess
but you werent aware of
that fact until very recently
no
and it resulted in your taking
ownership of this restaurant
how did you find out
well some part of me just knew
the gusteau part
where do you get your inspiration
inspiration has many names
mine is named colette
what
something stuck in my teeth
health inspector
i wish to report a rat infestation
it taken over my
gusteau restaurant
gusteau eh
i can drop by let see
first opening is three months
it must happen now
it a gourmet restaurant
monsieur i have the information
if someone cancels ill slot you in
but the rat you must
it stole my documents
it past opening time
he should have finished an hour ago
bonjour ma chérie
join us
we were just talking
about my inspiration
yes he calls it his tiny chef
not that dearest i meant you
it him
ego
anton ego
is that ego
i cant believe it
you are monsieur linguini
hello
pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration
but i thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance
as you are new to this game
game
yes
and youve been playing
without an opponent
which is as you may have guessed
against the rules
youre anton ego
youre slow for someone
in the fast lane
and youre thin for someone
who likes food
i dont like food i love it
if i dont love it i dont swallow
i will return tomorrow night
with high expectations
pray you dont disappoint me
listen we hate to be rude
but were french and it dinnertime
she meant to say
it dinnertime and were french
dont give me that look
you were distracting me
in front of the press
how am i supposed to concentrate
with you yanking on my hair all the time
and that another thing
your opinion isnt the only one
that matters here
colette knows how to cook
too you know
all right that it
you take a break little chef
im not your puppet
and youre not my
puppet-controlling guy
the rat is the cook
you cool off and get
your mind right little chef
ego is coming and i need to focus
you stupid
wow i have never seen that before
yeah it like youre his
fluffy bunny or something
im sorry remy
i know there are too many guys
i tried to limit
you know what
it okay ive been selfish
you guys hungry
are you kidding
all right dinner on me
well go after closing time
in fact
yeah
tell dad to bring the whole clan
little chef
this is great son
an inside job i see the appeal
little chef
little chef
hey little chef
i thought you went back
to the apartment
then when you werent there
i dont know
it didnt seem right to leave things
the way that we did so
look i dont want to fight
ive been under a lot of
you know pressure
a lot has changed in not
very much time you know
im suddenly a gusteau
and i got to be a gusteau or you know
people will be disappointed
it weird
you know ive never
disappointed anyone before
because nobody ever
expected anything of me
and the only reason anyone
expects anything from me now
is because of you
i havent been fair to you
youve never failed me
and i should never forget that
youve been a good friend
the most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask
what is this
what going on
hey
youre
youre stealing food
how could you
i thought you were my friend
i trusted you
get out
you and all your rat buddies
and dont come back
or ill treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests
youre right dad who am i kidding
we are what we are
and were rats
well hell leave soon
and now you know how to get in
steal all you want
youre not coming
ive lost my appetite
do you know what you
would like this evening sir
yes id like your heart
roasted on a spit
come in
today the big day
you should say something to them
like what
you are the boss inspire them
attention attention everyone
tonight is a big night
appetite is coming
and he going to have a big ego
i mean ego
he coming the critic
and he going to order something
something from our menu
and well have to cook it
unless he orders something cold
just cant leave it alone can you
you really shouldnt be here during
restaurant hours it not safe
im hungry
and i dont need
the inside food to be happy
the key my friend is to not be picky
observe
no wait
oh no no no what do we do
ill go get dad
you might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat
sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place
sure it probably killed dad
this is very bad juju right here
but ill tell you one thing
ego is here
ego he is here
anton ego is just another customer
let cook
yeah let
okay
so i have in mind
a simple arrangement
you will create for me a new line
of chef skinner frozen foods
and i in return will not kill you
au revoir rat
do you know what you
would like this evening sir
yes i think i do
after reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook
you know what im craving
a little perspective
that it id like some fresh clear
well seasoned perspective
can you suggest a good wine
to go with that
with what sir
perspective fresh out i take it
i am
very well
since youre all out of perspective
and no one else seems
to have it in this bloody town
ill make you a deal
you provide the food
ill provide the perspective
which would go nicely
with a bottle of cheval blanc 947
im afraid i
your dinner selection
tell your chef linguini that i want
whatever he dares to serve me
tell him to hit me with his best shot
i will have whatever he is having
so we have given up
why do you say that
we are in a cage
inside the car trunk
awaiting a future
in frozen food products
no im the one in a cage
ive given up
you are free
i am only as free as you
imagine me to be
as you are
oh please im sick of pretending
i pretend to be a rat for my father
i pretend to be a human
through linguini
i pretend you exist
so i have someone to talk to
you only tell me stuff
i already know
i know who i am
why do i need you to tell me
why do i need to pretend
but you dont remy
you never did
no my other left
dad dad im in here
im inside the trunk what the
dad
hey little brother
emile
i love you guys
where are you going
back to the restaurant
theyll fail without me
why do you care
because im a cook
it your recipe
how can you not know
your own recipe
i didnt write it down
it just came to me
then make it come to you again ja
because we cant serve this
where my order
cant we serve something else
something i didnt invent
this is what theyre ordering
make them order something else
tell them were all out
we cannot be all out
we just opened
i have another idea
what if we serve them what they order
we will make it
just tell us what you did
i dont know what i did
we need to tell
the customers something
then tell them tell them
dont do it
remy remy
dont stop
theyll see you stop
were not talking about me
were talking about what to do right
rats
remy
get my knife
dont touch him
thanks for coming back little chef
i know this sounds insane but
well the truth sounds
insane sometimes
but that doesnt mean
it not the truth
and the truth is
i have no talent at all
but this rat
he the one behind these recipes
he the cook the real cook
he been hiding under my toque
he been controlling my actions
he the reason i can cook the food
that exciting everyone
the reason ego is outside that door
youve been giving me
credit for his gift
i know it a hard thing to believe
but hey you believed
i could cook right
look this works
it crazy but it works
we can be the greatest
restaurant in paris
and this rat this brilliant little chef
can lead us there
what do you say you with me
dad
dad i dont know what to say
i was wrong about your
friend and about you
i dont want you to think
im choosing this over family
i cant choose between
two halves of myself
im not talking about cooking
im talking about guts
this really means that much to you
were not cooks but we are family
you tell us what to do
and well get it done
stop that health inspector
delta team go go go go
the rest of you stay and help remy
team three will be handling fish
team four roasted items
team five grill team six sauces
get to your stations let go go go
those handling food
will walk on two legs
we need someone to wait tables
im sorry for any delay
but were a little short tonight
please take all of the time you need
he came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he
make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized
work it yeah stick and move
stick and move
easy with that sole meunière
less salt more butter
only use the mimolette cheese
whoa compose the salad
like you were painting a picture
not too much vinaigrette
on that salade composée
dont let that beurre blanc separate
keep whisking
gently poach the scallops
taste check spoons down
good too much salt good
dont boil the consommé
itll toughen the pheasant emile
sorry
colette wait colette
you came back colette
dont say a word
if i think about it
i might change my mind
just tell me what
the rat wants to cook
ratatouille it a peasant dish
are you sure you want
to serve this to ego
what i am making ratatouille
well how would you prepare it
ratatouille they must be joking
no it cant be
who cooked the ratatouille
i demand to know
i cant remember the last time
i asked a waiter to give
my compliments to the chef
and now i find myself
in the extraordinary position
of having my waiter be the chef
thanks but im just
your waiter tonight
then who do i thank
for the meal
excuse me a minute
you must be the chef
if you wish to meet the chef
you will have to wait
until all the other customer have gone
so be it
at first ego thinks it a joke
but as linguini explains
ego smile disappears
he doesnt react beyond asking
an occasional question
and when the story is done
ego stands thanks us for the meal
thank you for the meal
and leaves without another word
the following day his review appears
in many ways
the work of a critic is easy
we risk very little
yet enjoy a position over those
who offer up their work and
their selves to our judgment
we thrive on negative criticism
which is fun to write and to read
but the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful
than our criticism designating it so
but there are times when
a critic truly risks something
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new
the world is often unkind to new talent
new creations
the new needs friends
last night
i experienced something new
an extraordinary meal from
a singularly unexpected source
to say that both the meal
and its maker
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking
is a gross understatement
they have rocked me to my core
in the past i have made
no secret of my disdain
for chef gusteau famous motto
anyone can cook
but i realize only now do i
truly understand what he meant
not everyone can become
a great artist
but a great artist can come
from anywhere
it is difficult to imagine
more humble origins
than those of the genius
now cooking at gusteau
who is in this critic opinion
nothing less than
the finest chef in france
i will be returning to gusteau soon
hungry for more
it was a great night
the happiest of my life
but the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability
well we had to let skinner
and the health inspector loose
and of course they ratted us out
the food didnt matter
once it got out there were
rats in the kitchen
oh man the restaurant was closed
and ego lost his job and his credibility
but dont feel too bad for him
he doing very well
as a small business investor
he seems very happy
how do you know
got to go dinner rush
you know how he likes it
thanks little chef
can i interest you
in a dessert this evening
dont you always
which one would you like
surprise me
can i interest you
in a dessert this evening
hey believe me that story
gets better when i tell it okay
come on bring some food over here
were starving
