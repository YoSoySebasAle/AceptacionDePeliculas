have you heard that as couples get older
they lose their ability to hear each other
no
well supposedly men lose their ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds
and women eventually
lose hearing on the low end
i guess they sort of nullify each other
i guess
nature way of allowing couples to grow
old together without killing each other
what are you reading
ah yeah
how about you
um
mmm chuckles
hmm
man woman speaking german
look i was thinking about going
to the lounge car sometime soon

yeah yeah yeah i get it i get it
so im the crude dumb vulgar american
who doesnt speak any other languages
who has no culture right
but i tried
i took french for four years
in high school
when i first got to paris
i stood in line at the metro station
i was practicing -
une billet sil vous pláît
une billet sil vous pláît
un billet
un whatever un un -
un billet sil vous pláit
un billet sil vous pláit
and i get up there and i look at this woman
and my mind goes completely blank
and i start saying ah listen i need
a ticket to get to um - you know
so anyway um -
so where are you headed
well back to paris
my classes start next week
youre still in school where do you go
yeah la sorbonne you know

yeah i was visiting my grandmother
ah how is she
laughing she she okay
she all right
she fine yeah
how about you where are you going
im going to vienna
vienna what there
i have no idea im flying out of there tomorrow
ah youre on holiday
uh
uh i dont really know what im on
okay
im just traveling around ive been riding
the trains the past two three weeks
mm-hmm you were visiting friends
or just on your own
yeah i had a friend in madrid but um -
madrid that nice
yeah i got one of those
eurail passes is what i did
that great
so has this trip around europe
been good for you
yeah sure
yeah it been um it sucked
you know
what
-laughing no it it isnt -
-laughing
it had its um well ill tell you
sitting you know for weeks on end
looking out the window
has actually been kinda great
what do you mean
well uh you know for inst -
you have ideas
that you ordinarily wouldnt have
what kind of ideas
you wanna hear one
yeah tell me
all right
uh i have this idea okay
mm-hmm
for a television show some friends of mine
are these cable access producers
do you know what that is cable acc
anybody can produce a show real cheap
and they have to put it on right
i have this idea for this show that would last
24 hours a day for a year straight right
what you do is you get 365 people
from cities all over the world
to do these 24-hour documents of real time
capturing life as it lived
you know it would start
with a guy waking up in the morning
and uh you know taking a long shower
um eating a little breakfast
making a little coffee
you know and uh reading the paper
wait wait all those mundane boring things
everybody has to do
every day of their fucking life
i was gonna say
the poetry of day-to-day life
but you say it the way you say it
ill say it the way i say it
who gonna want to watch this
but think about it like this -
why is it that a dog
sleeping in the sun is so beautiful
you know it is it beautiful
but a guy standing at a bank machine
trying to take some money out
looks like a complete moron
so it like a national geographic program
but on people
yeah
hmm
what do you think
i can i can see it -
like 24 boring hours sorry
and like a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after no
yeah you know -
-i mean that would be a great episode
yeah
people would talk about that episode
-laughing
you and your friends
could do one in paris if you wanted to
oh sure
the key the thing that kinda
haunts me is uh is the distribution
getting these tapes from town to town
city to city so that it would play continuously
cause itd have to play all the time
or else it just wouldnt work
thank you
thanks
you know what
theyre not service-oriented
chuckles
just an observation about europe
my parents have never really spoken
of the possibility of my falling in love
or getting married or having children
even as a little girl
they wanted me to think as a future career
as a you know interior designer
or lawyer or something like that
id say to my dad i want to be a writer
and hed say journalist
id say i wanted to have a refuge for stray cats
and hed say veterinarian
id say i wanted to be an actress
and hed say tv newscaster
it was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition
into these practical
moneymaking ventures
mmm
i always had a pretty good
bullshit detector when i was a kid
i always knew when they were
lying to me you know
by the time i was in high school
i was dead set on listening to what
everybody thought i should be doing with my life
and just kinda   doing the opposite
nobody was ever mean about it
it just i could never get very excited
about other people ambitions for my life
hmm but you know what
if your parents never really
fully contradict you about anything
-and are basically nice and supportive -
right
it makes it even harder
to officially complain
you know even when theyre wrong
it this passive-aggressive shit
you know what i mean it
i hate it
i really hate it
-chuckling
well you know despite all that kind
of bullshit that comes along with it
i remember childhood as this
you know this magical time
i do
i remember when uh my mother
first told me about death
my great-grandmother had just died
and my whole family
had just visited them in florida
i was about three
three and a half years old
anyway i was in the backyard playing
and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose
and do it in such a way that
uh it sprayed into the sun
and it would make a rainbow
right
so i was doing that
and through the mist
i could see my grandmother
you know and she was
just standing there smiling at me
and uh i held it there for a long time
and i looked at her
and then finally i-l let go of the nozzle
you know and then i dropped the hose
and she disappeared
so i run back inside
and i tell my parents
and they uh sit me down
and give me this big rap
on how when people die you never
see them again and how id imagined it
but i knew what id seen
i was just glad that i saw it
ive never seen anything like that since
but i dont know
it just kinda let me know
how ambiguous everything was
you know even death
youre really lucky you can
have this attitude toward death
i think im afraid of death
24 hours a day
i swear
that why im in a train right now
i could have flown to paris but im too scared
oh come on
i cant help it i cant help it
i know the statistics say na na na
it safer whatever
when im in a plane i can see it
i can see the explosion
i can see me falling through the clouds
-imitates explosion
and im so scared of those few seconds
of consciousness before youre gonna die
you know when you know
for sure youre gonna die
i cant stop thinking that way
it it exhausting
yeah i bet
laughs really exhausting
i think this is vienna
yeah
you get off here no
yeah what a drag
i wish i had met you earlier
i really like talking to you
yeah me too laughs
it was really nice talking to you
man on pa speaking german
i have an admittedly insane idea
but if i dont ask you this
it gonna haunt me the rest of my life
what
um   i want to keep talking to you
i have no idea what your situation is
but uh   but i feel like we have
some kind of a connection right
yeah me too
yeah right well great
so you should get off the train with me here
in vienna and come check out the town
what
come on itll be fun come on
what would we do
i dont know
all i know is i have to catch an austrian
airlines flight tomorrow morning at 930
and i dont have enough money for a hotel
so i was just gonna walk around
and itd be a lot more fun
if you came with me
and if i turn out to be some kind of psycho
you just get on the next train
all right think of it like this um
uh jump ahead ten 20 years
okay and youre married
only your marriage doesnt have
that same energy that it used to have
you start to blame your husband
you start to think about all those guys
youve met in your life
and what might have happened
if you picked up with one of them right
well im one of those guys that me
so think of this as time travel
from then to now
to find out what youre missing out on
see what this really could be is a gigantic
favor to both you and your future husband
to find out that youre not
missing out on anything
im just as big a loser as he is
totally unmotivated totally boring
and uh you made the right choice
and youre really happy
i
-mouthing words
let me get my bag
yeah
giggles
we should get a locker for all this stuff

bell tolling
-i got an idea are you ready
yeah
it q & a time
weve known each other a little while now
were stuck together so were gonna
ask each other a few direct questions
all right
so we ask each other questions
and you have to answer 00% honestly
of course
okay all right first question
you
german accent describe for me -
yes im going to ask you
describe for me your first
sexual feelings towards a person
my first sexual feelings oh my god
um
i know i know
jean-marc fleury giggles
jean-marc fleury
we were at this summer camp together
and he was a swimmer
yeah
he had bleached-out chlorine hair
and green eyes
and to improve his times
hed shave the hair off his legs and arms
that disgusting
oh no he was like this gorgeous dolphin
and my friend emma
had a big big crush on him
so one day i was cutting across the field
back to my room
and he came walking up beside me
and i told him you should date emma
because she has a big crush on you
and he turned to me and said
well that too bad
because i have a big crush on you
so yeah it scared the hell out of me
because i thought he was so fine
and then he officially
asked me out on a date
you know i pretended i didnt like him
you know i was so afraid
of what i might do
uh   well
i went to see him swim a few times
at the swimming competition
he was so sexy really
i mean really sexy
you know we kind of wrote these
little declarations of love to each other
at the end of the summer
and promised we would keep writing forever
and like meet again very soon
did you
of course not
then i think this is
the opportune time to tell you
that i happen to be a fantastic swimmer
really
yeah
ill make note of that
okay uh
so it my turn no
all right yes your turn
hit me
um
have you ever been in love
yes next question
what was the first -
wait a minute
so we can give one-word answers
sure why not
no no after i went into such private details
about my first sexual feelings
i know but those are
two very different questions
i could answer the sexual feelings thing
no problem but love -
what if i asked you about love
-giggles
i would have lied but at least
i would have made up a great story
you wouldve lied  great
love is a complex issue
i mean it like um -
yes i have told somebody that i
loved them before and i had meant it
but was it totally unselfish giving love
was it a beautiful thing not really
it like love -
i mean i dont know
you know
yeah i know what you mean
but as far as sexual feelings go
ill have you know it started with an obsessive
relationship with miss july 978
do you know playboy magazine
yeah ive heard of it
do you know crystal
no
you dont know crystal
well i knew crystal
um is it my turn now
okay tell me something
that really pisses you off
really drives you crazy
pisses me off everything pisses me off
okay list a couple
um   wait i know
i hate being told by strange men
a strange man in the street -
yeah
you know like to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life
um what else
i hate -
i hate that 300 kilometers from here
there a war going on people are dying
and nobody knows what to do about it
or they dont give a shit i dont know
i hate that the medias you know
theyre trying to control our minds
the media
yeah the media
it very subtle
but it a new form of fascism really
um   um
i hate chuckles
i hate when im in a foreign country
especially in america theyre the worst
each time i wear black or lose my temper
or say anything about anything
they always go
oh it so french it so cute
makes gagging noise
i hate that i cant stand it really
is that all
well there a lot of things but
so it my turn
okay
youre gonna answer
yes ill answer
uh what a problem for you
you probably
laughing what
no i had a thought the other day
that kind of qualifies as a problem
what is it
it was a thought i had on the train
so okay all right
um do you believe in reincarnation
yeah yeah it interesting
yeah right
most people talk about past lives
and things like that
you know and even if they dont
believe it in some specific way
people have some kind of notion
of an eternal soul right
yeah
okay well this was my thought
50000 years ago there were not
even a million people on the planet
0000 years ago there like
two million people on the planet
now there between five
and six billion people on the planet
now if we all have
our own individual unique soul
where do they all come from
are modern souls
only a fraction of the original souls
cause if they are
that represents a 5000-to- split
of each soul
in just the last 50000 years
which is like a blip in the earth time
so at best were like these
tiny fractions of people walking
is that why were so scattered
is that why were all so specialized
wait a minute im not sure i dont agree -
i know i know
it a totally scattered thought
which is kinda why
it makes sense you know
i agree with you
let get off this damn train
rock
continues
speakers man singing
walking through my life
walking through the signs
walking through my new dream
this place is pretty neat
yeah
there even a listening booth over there
have you ever heard of this singer
i think she american
a friend of mine told me about her
do you wanna go and see
if that listening booth still works
yeah okay
she gave me a look
and a smile
guitar
woman singing
there a wind that blows in
from the north
and it says that loving
takes its course
come here
come here
no im not impossibie to touch
i have never wanted you so much
come here
come here
have i never laid down by your side
baby let forget about this pride
come here
come here
continues
look at this this is beautiful
quick it leaving
well im in no hurry
-chattering
you dont have to run away this time
whoa
i know that youre timid
but it gonna be allright this time
celine oh look there a rabbit
yeah
-laughs ohh
hey there rabbit
-laughs
it so cute
gasps i visited this
as a young teenager
i think it left a bigger impression on me
at that time
than any of the museums we went to
yeah it tiny
i know
there was this little old man that talked to us
he was the groundskeeper
he explained that most of the people
buried here
theyd washed up on the bank
of the danube
how old are these
around the beginning of the century or so
it called cemetery of the no-name
because they often didnt really know
who those people were -
maybe a first name that all
why were all the bodies washing up
i think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that
but most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river
i always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world
when i was a little girl i thought that if none
of your family or friends knew you were dead
then it like not really being dead
people can invent
the best and the worst for you
ah here she is i think
yeah this is the one i remember the most
she was only 3 when she died
that meant something to me
i was that age when i first saw this
hmm
now im ten years older
and she still 3 i guess
that funny
celine that the danube over there
jesse that a river right
-chuckling yeah
this is gorgeous
yeah this is beautiful
and we got uh   we got a sunset here
yeah
we got the ferris wheel -
it seems like um
this would be uh
what
uh you know um
are you trying to say you want to kiss me
yes
dance
-beeping
yakety sax
laughing
punching sound bell rings
speaking german
celine but you know what
what
i dont think it really matters
what generation youre born into
look at my parents
they were these angry
young may 68 people
revolting against everything -
the government
their conservative catholic backgrounds
i was born not long after
then my father went on
to become this successful architect
and we began to travel all around the world
while he built bridges and towers and stuff
i mean i really cant
complain about anything
you know they love me more
than anything in the world
ive been raised with all the freedom
they had fought for
and yet for me now
it another type of fight
we still have to deal with the same old shit
but we cant really know
who or what the enemy is
i dont know if there really is an enemy
you know
everybody parents fucked them up
rich kids parents gave them too much
poor kids not enough
um you know too much attention
not enough attention
they either left them or they stuck around
taught em the wrong things
i mean my parents are just these two people
who didnt like each other very much
who decided to get married and have a kid
and they try their best to be nice to me
did your parents divorce
yeah finally
they shouldve done it a lot sooner
but they stuck together for a while
for the well-being of my sister and i
thank you very much
-chuckling
i remember my mother once -
she told me right in front of my father -
they were having this big fight -
that he didnt really want to have me
that he was really pissed off when he
found out that she was pregnant with me
that i was this big mistake
that really shaped the way i think
i always saw the world as this place
where i really wasnt meant to be
that so sad
well i mean i eventually took pride in it
like my life was my own doing or something
like i was crashing the big party
laughing that the way to see it
my parents theyre still married
and i guess theyre very happy
but i think it a healthy process to rebel
against everything that came before
yeah yeah but
ive been wondering lately
do you know anyone
who in a happy relationship
uh yeah sure
i know happy couples
but i think they lie to each other
-giggles
yeah
people can live their whole life as a lie
my grandmother
she was married to this man
and i always thought she had
a very simple uncomplicated love life
but she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life dreaming about
another man she was always in love with
she just accepted her fate it so sad
in the same time i love the idea
that she had those emotions and feelings
i never thought she would have had
i guarantee you it was better that way
if shed ever got to know him im sure
he would have disappointed her eventually
how do know you dont know them
yeah i know
it just people have these romantic
projections they put on everything
that not based on any kind of reality
romantic projections
yeah
oh mr romantic
up there on the ferris wheel -
-oh kiss me the sunset oh it so beautiful
all right all right
tell me about your grandmother
what were you saying about her
-giggling
-shouts

oh
so you have been on a journey
and you are a stranger to this place
chuckles you are an adventurer
a seeker
an adventurer in your mind
you are interested
in the power of the woman
in a woman deep strength and creativity
youre becoming this woman
but you need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life
only if you find peace within yourself
will you find true connection with others
he is a stranger to you
mmm i guess so
sighs
you will be all right he learning
chuckles okay
money
youre both stars
dont forget
when the stars exploded
billions of years ago
they formed everything that is this world
everything we know is stardust
so dont forget you are stardust
laughing
i mean that very nice and all
i mean that were all stardust
and youre becoming this great woman
but i hope you dont
take that any more seriously
than some horoscope
in a daily syndicated newspaper
what are you talking about
she knew i was on vacation
and that we didnt know each other
and that i was going to
become this great woman
but what was that
i am learning bullshit
that way condescending you know
she wasnt even doing me
i mean if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth
it would put their asses out of business
just once id love to see
some little old lady
save up all her money
to go to the fortune-teller
shed get there all excited about hearing
her future and the woman would say
uh-huh   tomorrow
and all your remaining days
will be exactly like today
a tedious collection of hours
and you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts
and no new travels
and when you die
youll be completely forgotten
you know
fifty schillings please
that id like to see
-laughs
it so funny how she almost
didnt notice you huh
it weird i wonder why
she was really wise and intense
wi yeah
i really love what she said

you pay your money you hear something
that makes you feel good about yourself

i love it
la voie ferrée that great
i love the way the people seem
to be dissolving into the background
look at this one
it like the environment
you know stronger than the people
his human figures
are always so transitory
it funny transitory
transitory
-footsteps
-bell tolling

horn honking
i was in an old church
like this with my grandmother
a few days ago in budapest
even though i reject
most of the religious thing
i cant help but feeling
for all those people
that come here lost or in pain guilt
looking for some kind of answers
it fascinates me how a single place
can join so much pain and happiness
for so many generations
you close with your grandmother
yeah
i think it because
i always have this strange feeling
that im this very old woman
laying down about to die
you know that my life is just
memories or something
that so wild
i mean i always think that
im still this 3-year-old boy
who doesnt really know
how to be an adult
pretending to live my life taking notes
for when ill really have to do it
kind of like im in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play
that funny
then up there in the ferris wheel
was like this very old woman
kissing this very young boy
right
mmm
do you know anything about the quakers -
the quaker religion
no not much
no
i went to this quaker wedding once
it was fantastic
what they do is the couple comes in
and they kneel down
in front of the whole congregation
and they just stare at each other
and nobody says a word
unless they feel that god moves them
to speak or say something
and then after an hour or so of just uh
staring at each other
theyre married
that beautiful i like that
this is a horrible story
what
it not the appropriate place to tell it but -
what
i was driving around with this buddy of mine
he a big atheist
and we came to a stop
next to this homeless guy
my buddy takes out a hundred-dollar bill
he leans out of the window and he says
do you believe in god
the guy looks at my friend
he looks at the money
says uh
yes i do
my friend says wrong answer
we drove away
that mean no
yeah yeah
ow laughing
would you be in paris by now
if you hadnt gotten off the train with me
no not yet
what would you be doing
id probably be hanging around the airport
reading old magazines
crying in my coffee
cause you didnt come with me
oh oh
actually i think id probably gotten off
the train in salzburg with someone else
oh yeah oh i see
so im just a dumb american
momentarily decorating
your blank canvas huh
im having a great time
really
yeah
me too
im so glad because no one knows im here
and i dont know anyone that knows you
that would tell me
all the bad things youve done
ill tell you some
yeah im sure
you know you hear
so much shit about people
i always feel like the general of an army
when i start dating a guy
plotting my strategy and maneuverings
knowing his weak points
what would hurt him seduce him
it horrible
if we were around each other all the time
what would be the first thing about me
that would drive you mad
mmm uh no no
im not going to answer this question
what
no
i just i dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that
-what about me bugs you
uh-huh
so finally i said well i dont think
you handle criticism too well
she flew into a rage and broke up with me
that a true story
all she ever really wanted to do
was to have an excuse
to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me
is that what you want
what
something about me bugs you
no
tell me what is it about me bugs you
nothing at all
if it had to be something
what would it be
if it had to be something
if i had to think about it
i kind of didnt really like this reaction
back at the palm reader
you were like this rooster prick
rooster prick
what the hell is a rooster prick
you were like a little boy whining because
all the attention wasnt focused on him
listen this woman robs you blind okay
you were like a little boy
walking by an ice cream store
crying because his mother wouldnt
buy him a milk shake or something
i dont care what the charlatan has to say -
-man speaking german hello
-speaking german
what
-german
oh i understand a little bit
but he doesnt at all im sorry
okay so um
may i ask you a question
yeah
so i would like to make a deal with you
i mean instead of just asking you for money
i will ask you for a word
you give me a word ill take the word
then i will write a poem
with the word inside
and if you like it if you like my poem
if you feel it adds something
to your life in any way
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like
i write in english of course
okay
all right great
so
pick a word
oh um -
a word um   milk shake
milk shake oh good i was gonna say
rooster prick but great milk shake
milk shake okay milk shake
all right so well
good
jesse gotta say i like this
viennese variation of a bum
i like what he said about
adding something to your life no
yeah
so uh were we having
our first fight back there
no
yeah i think so
i think we were
even if we were a little bit why does
everyone think conflict is so bad
there a lot of good things
coming out of conflict
yeah yeah i guess so i dont know
i always think if i could just accept the fact
that my life was supposed to be difficult
that what to be expected
then i might not get so pissed off about it
and id be glad when something nice happens
maybe that why im still in school
it easier to have something to fight against
yeah well weve all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us
i can be doing the most nothing thing
i can be throwing some darts
shooting some pool
and all of a sudden
i feel it come over me -
i have got to win
celine is that why you tried to
get me off the train competitiveness
jesse what do you mean
okay
got your poem
oh all right
will you read it to us
sure okay
daydream delusion
limousine eyelash
oh baby with your pretty face
drop a tear in my wine glass
look at those big eyes

sweet cakes and milk shakes
im a delusion angel
im a fantasy parade
i want you to know what i think
dont want you to guess anymore

we have no idea where were going
lodged in life like branches in the river
flowing downstream caught in the current
ill carry you youll carry me

he wrote it but he probably
just plugs that word in -
whatever milk shake you know
what do you mean
nothing i loved it it was great
laughing
jesse you know what drives me crazy
what
there all these people talking about
how great technology is and how it saves time
but what good is saved time if nobody uses it
if it just turns into more busy work
yeah
right
you never hear somebody say with the time
ive saved by using my word processor
im gonna go to a zen monastery
and hang out
-celine laughs

yeah
all right
you think old milwaukee is expensive here
rock on jukebox
beeping
merde
well um -
we havent talked about this yet
but are you dating anyone
you got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in paris or anything like that
no not right now
not right but you did
we broke up about six months ago
six months
yeah
oh im sorry
i mean im not that sorry
but tell me about him
oh no no way i cant
it really really boring
come on tell me about him
okay i was really disappointed
i thought this one would last for a while
i mean he was very stupid
ugly bad in bed
alcoholic you know
a real prizewinner
yeah laughing
i was kind of giving him a favor
but he left me
saying i loved him too much
and you know i was blocking
his artistic expression and stuff
shit like that you know
but anyway i was traumatized and became -
sighs and became
totally obsessed with him
and so i went to see this shrink you know
and it came up that i had written
this little stupid story about this woman
trying to kill her boyfriend
and how she was gonna do it
you know all the intricate details
how to do it and not get caught
she was gonna kill her boyfriend
yeah laughing
yeah she was i mean -
it nothing i would do
but it was just some writing
no i understand
anyway this stupid shrink believed
everything i was telling her
it was my first time seeing her
she said she had to call the police
she had to call the police
she was ― merde she was totally
convinced i was really gonna do it
even though id explained to her
it was just some writing and stuff
she said looking deep into my eyes
the way you said it
i know you are going to do it
the way you said it
she was totally out of her mind
aaah
it was my first and last session
so what happened then
hmm
i totally got over him you know
but now im obsessed that he gonna die
from an accident a thousand kilometers away
oh right
im gonna be the one accused
why is it you become obsessed with people
you dont really like that much
you know what i mean
i dont know
so how about you
what
are you with anyone
um -
it funny how we managed
to avoid this subject for so long
yeah but now you have to tell me
well i kind of see love
as this escape for two people
who dont know how to be alone you know
or uh you know what funny
people always talk about how love
is this totally unselfish giving thing
but if you think about it
there nothing more selfish
yeah i know
so who just broke up with you
what
you sound like youve just been hurt
or something
oh do i
yeah
all right um -
a big confession you know
i should have told you this earlier
or something but
i didnt come to europe just to hang out
and read hemingway in paris
and shit like that you know
i saved up my money all spring
to fly to madrid
and spend the summer
with my girlfriend who has been -
your girlfriend
my ex-girlfriend
who been in this asinine
art history program for the last year
anyway i got here right
and we were reunited at long last
and we went out to dinner our first night
with six of her friends -
pedro antonio gonzalo
maria suzy from home you know
she pretty much managed to avoid being
alone with me for the first couple of days
and i stuck around for a while
just to kinda let it really sink in
that she wished i hadnt come
so i bought the cheapest flight
out of europe
this one leaving out of vienna tomorrow
but it didnt leave for a couple of weeks
so i bought this eurail pass you know
you know what the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you
yeah
it when you remember how little you thought
about the people you broke up with
and you realize that that is how little
theyre thinking about you
oh chuckling
you know
youd like to think that youre both
in all this pain but really theyre just
-hey im glad youre gone
-laughing
believe me i know
you should look at bright colors
what
that what the shrink told me you know
i was paying her 900 francs an hour
to hear that i was a homicidal maniac
but i could perhaps shift my obsession
if i would concentrate on bright colors
well did it work
well -
it didnt help your pinball
well no laughing
yeah well you know
i mean i havent killed anyone lately
not lately
mmm
well that good youre cured then
i mean there these breeds of monkeys right
and all they do is have sex like all the time
and uh they turn out to be the least violent
the most peaceful the most happy -
you know so i mean
maybe foolin around not so bad
are you talking about monkeys
yes im talking about monkeys
ah i thought so yeah you know
why
i never heard this one
but it reminds me of this perfect you know
male argument
to justify them fooling around
no no no
women monkeys are foolin around too
everybody fooling around
-groans
ooh ooh
yeah that cute
you know i have this awful paranoid thought
that feminism was mostly invented by men
so they could like
fool around a little more
you know woman free your mind
free your body sleep with me
were all happy and free as long
as i can fuck as much as i can
ah all right all right
im sure
but maybe maybe there
some biological things at work here
biological
-if you had an island right
yeah
and there were 99 women on the island
and only one man
in a year youd have
the possibility of 99 babies
right
but if you have an island with 99 men
and only one woman
in a year you have the possibility
of only one baby
so -
so you know what
what
on this island you know
i think there will be only
like maybe 43 men left
because they would have killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman
you know what i mean
and on the other island
there would be 99 women 99 babies
and no more men
because they would have all
gotten together and eaten him alive
oh yeah yeah
see i think there something to that
i think on some level women dont mind
the idea of destroying a man
like i was once walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend right
we just walked by these real ―
four thuggy-looking guys next to a camaro
and uh one of em sure enough
says hey baby nice ass
so im like all right no big deal
im not gonna get uptight about this
yeah plus you know there were four of them
yeah exactly there four of em
but she turns around
she says fuck you dickheads
and im like
okay wait a minute here right
theyre not gonna come and kick her ass
know what i mean
so who just got pushed to the front line
on that one you see what im saying
i mean women say they hate it
if youre all territorial and protective
but if it suits them then theyll tell you
youre being all unmanly or wimpy
you know what i dont think women
really wants to destroy men and if -
even if they want to they dont succeed
you know what i mean
im sure even men are destroying women -
or are capable of destroying women
much more than women
well anyway -
it depressing you know what
what you wanna stop talking about this
yeah i hate it
okay well over it
you know man-woman there no end to this
like you know
it like a skipping record you know
laughs yeah
every couple been having
this conversation forever
and nobody came up with anything
i saw a documentary on that
it a birth dance
a birth dance
yeah
should i give her some money
yeah
jesse everything that interesting
costs a little bit of money
so a birth dance huh
looked a little bit like a mating dance to me
no but really
women used it when giving birth
in some part of the world
they still do it
yeah
yeah
the woman in labor enters a tent
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance
and they encourage the birthing woman
to dance with them
-so as to make the birth less painful
yeah
and when the baby born
they all dance in celebration
wow i dont think my mom
wouldve gone for that
celine i like the idea of dancing
as a common function in life
something everybody participates in
mmm i know i heard about this old guy
who uh was watching
some young people dance
and he said how beautiful
theyre trying to shake off their genitals
and become angels
-i like that
all right one question back there -
when the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff right
where are the men
are we out food gathering
are we not invited
yall dont need us what
men are lucky we dont bite off their head
after mating
certain insects do that you know
like spiders and stuff
mm-hmm
we at least let you live
what are you complaining about
yeah
see youre officially kidding
but there somethin to that
you keep bringing stuff like that up
what
yeah
no no no wait a minute
talking seriously here
i mean i always feel this pressure
of being a strong and independent icon
of womanhood
and not making making look like
my whole life is revolving around some guy
but   loving someone and being loved
means so much to me
i always make fun of it and stuff
but isnt everything we dream in life
a way to be loved a little more
yeah
i dont know
sometimes i dream
about being a good father
and a good husband
and sometimes that feels really close
hmm
but then other times
it seems silly
like it would uh ruin my whole life
and it not just a a fear of commitment
or that im incapable of caring or loving
because   i can
it just that
if im totally honest with myself
i think id rather die knowing
that i was really good at something
that i had excelled in some way
you know than that id just been
in a nice caring relationship
yeah
but   i had worked for this older man
and once he told me
that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career and his work
and   he was 52
and it suddenly struck him
that he had never really given
anything of himself
his life was for no one and nothing
he was almost crying saying that
you know i believe
if there any kind of god
it wouldnt be in any of us -
not you or me
but just this little space in between
if there any kind of magic in this world
it must be in the attempt of understanding
someone sharing something
i know it almost impossible to succeed
but   who cares really
the answer must be in the attempt
chattering
man speaking german

well he convinced me
i mean actually i was -
i was ready to get off the train with him
after talking to him a short while
he was so sweet i couldnt help it
we were in the lounge car
and he begin to talk about him as a little boy
seeing his great-grandmothers ghost
i think that when i fell for him
just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams
he trapped me
mm-hmm
and he so cute
he has beautiful blue eyes
nice pink lips
greasy hair laughing i love it
he kind of tall
and he a little clumsy
i like to feel his eyes on me
when i look away
he kind of kisses like an adolescent
it so cute
what
yeah we kissed
it was so adorable
as the night went on
i began to like him more and more
but im afraid he scared of me
i told him the story about the woman
that kills her ex-boyfriend and stuff
he must be scared to death
he must be thinking
im this manipulative mean woman
i just hope he doesnt
feel that way about me
because you know me
im the most harmless person
the only person
i could really hurt is myself
i dont think he scared of you
i think he crazy about you
really
ive known you a long time
and i got a good feeling
you gonna see him again

uh you know lisa and i
had our long-overdue meltdown
oh too bad i told you no
yeah yeah yeah
the long-distance thing just never works
i was only in madrid for a couple days
and i got a cheaper flight out of vienna
but uh
you know it really
wasnt that much cheaper
i just uh -
i couldnt go home right away
i didnt wanna see anybody i knew
i just wanted to be a ghost
completely anonymous
so are you okay now
yeah
yeah no no yeah
im great im great that the thing
im rapturous
and ill tell you why
i met somebody on my last night in europe
can you believe that
that incredible
i know i know
and you know how they say were all
each others demons and angels
well she was literally a botticelli angel
just tellin me that
everything was gonna be okay
how did you meet
on the train
hmm
she was sittin next to this very weird couple
that started fighting so she had to move
she sat right across the aisle from me
so we started to talk
and uh she didnt like me much at first
she super-smart very passionate
um and beautiful
and i was so unsure of myself
i thought everything i said
sounded so stupid
aw man i wouldnt worry about that
nah
nah im sure she was not judging you
no and by the way
she sat next to you no
im sure she did it in purpose
oh yeah
yeah laughs
us men are so stupid
we dont understand anything about women
mm-mmm
they act kind of strange
the little i know of them
dont they
yeah
i feel like this is some dream world
were in you know
yeah it so weird
it like our time together is just ours
it our own creation
it must be like im in your dream
and youre in mine or something
mm-hmm
and what so cool is that this whole evening
all our time together
shouldnt officially be happening
yeah i know maybe that why
this feels so otherworldly
but then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins right
aaah
-laughing i know
but at this time i think youre supposed to
produce the glass slipper and see if it fits
yeah
yeah
itll fit
jesse this friend of mine had a kid
and it was a home birth
so he was there
helping out and everything
but he said at that profound
moment of birth -
uh he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time
trying to take its first breath
all he could think about was
that he was lookin at somethin
that was gonna die someday
he just couldnt get it out of his head
and i think that so true
you know everything is so finite
i mean but but dont you think
that what um
makes our time and specific moments
so important
yeah i know
it the same for us tonight though
after tomorrow morning were probably
never gonna see each other again right
you dont think
well ever see each other again
what do you think
well um -
gosh i dont know uh -
-i mean i hadnt planned another trip to -
uh me too
i mean i live in paris
you live in the us i totally understand -
id hate to make you fly
you hate to fly right
im not so scared of flying
i mean i could
well if you were gonna come to the us
or if you know i mean if i -
or you know i mean
i could come back here
what what
no let just be rational adults
about this
we -
maybe we should try something different
i mean it not so bad
if tonight is our only night right
people always exchange
phone numbers addresses
they end up writing once
calling each other once or twice
right fizzles out
yeah i mean i dont want that
i hate that
i hate that too yeah
why do you think everybody thinks relationships
are supposed to last forever anyway
yeah why it stupid
but you think tonight it huh
i mean that   tonight our only night
it the only way no
well all right
let do it
no delusions no projections
well just make tonight great
violin accordion
okay let do that
okay
continues
we should do some kind
of handshake you know
give me your hand
all right
to our one and only night together
and uh the hours that remain
kisses
what
it just it depressing no
now the only thing were gonna think of is
when were gonna have to
say good-bye tomorrow
we could say good-bye now
then we wouldnt have to
worry about it in the morning
now
yeah say good-bye

good-bye romance
for the greatest night in your life
thank you very much
trapeze
so often in my life ive been with people
and shared beautiful moments
like traveling or staying up all night
and watching the sunrise
and i knew those were special moments
but something was always wrong
i wished id been with someone else
i knew that what i was feeling
exactly what was so important to me
they didnt understand
but im happy to be with you
you couldnt possibly know
why a night like this
is so important to my life right now
but it is
this is a great morning
it is a great morning
do you think well have others like this
what
what about our rational adult decision
oh yeah yeah
i know what you mean about wishing
that somebody wasnt there though
hmm
it just usually it myself
that i wish i could get away from
seriously think about this
i have never been anywhere
that i havent been
hmm
ive never uh had a kiss
when i wasnt one of the kissers
you know ive never um gone to the movies
when i wasnt there in the audience
i never been out bowling if i wasnt there
you know makin some stupid joke
i think that why so many people
hate themselves seriously
it just that they are sick to death
of being around themselves
let say you and i
were together all the time
youd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms
and the way uh the way every time
that we would have people over uh
id be insecure
and id get a little too drunk
or uh the way i tell the same stupid
pseudo-intellectual story again and again
you see ive heard all those stories
so of course im sick of myself
but
being with you uh
has made me feel like i was somebody else
and the only other way
to lose yourself like that is um
you know dancing or alcohol or
drugs and stuff like that
fucking
fu ― fucking yeah that one way yeah
yeah
do you know what i want
what
to be kissed
well i can do that
wait wait
sighs heavily
i have to say something stupid
all right
it very stupid
okay
i dont think we should sleep together
i mean i want to but since were
never gonna see each other again
itll make me feel bad
ill wonder who else youre with
ill miss you
i know it not very adult
maybe it a female thing
i cant help it
let see each other again
no i dont want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid
i dont wanna just get laid
i want to um -
i mean i mean i think we should
i mean we die in the morning right
i think we should
no then it like some male fantasy
meet a french girl on the train
fuck her and never see her again
this great story to tell
i dont wanna be a great story
i dont want this great evening
to just have been for that
okay
okay
okay we dont have to have sex
it not a big deal
okay
you dont wanna see me again
no of course i do listen
if somebody gave me the choice right now
of to never see you again or to marry you
i would marry you all right
and maybe that
a lot of romantic bullshit
but people have gotten married
for a lot less
actually -
sighs i think i decided i wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train
now that weve talked so much
i dont know anymore

in the city began to whir and chime
oh let not time deceive you
you cannot conquer time
in headaches and in worry
vaguely life leaks away
and time will have his fancy
tomorrow or today
-chuckles
somethin like that
it good
when you talked earlier
about after a few years
how a couple
would begin to hate each other
by anticipating their reactions
or getting tired of their mannerisms
i think it would be the opposite for me
i think i can really fall in love
when i know everything about someone -
the way he gonna part his hair
which shirt he gonna wear that day
knowing the exact story
