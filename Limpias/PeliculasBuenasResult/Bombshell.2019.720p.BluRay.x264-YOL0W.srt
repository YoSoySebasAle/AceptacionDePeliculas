welcome
to the kelly file everyone
im megyn kelly
breaking tonight polls are
moving the race is changing
and more than a dozen
republican candidates
are trying
to make themselves heard
with a little more than
one week left
till the debate
that could change everything
and were the gateway
we the questioners
are the gateway
we at fox and cnn
and everybody else
who gets a chance
to actually moderate
a presidential debate
with these guys
i mean these guys
they deserve to face
tough questioning
as chris says and i agree
they want
george washington job
and they better earn it
they better show
the american people
theyre worthy of it
a lot of folks assumed
donald trump
would flame out by now
they have been proven wrong
now wait
here we gotta get to this
because this is just breaking
on the daily beast
the headline is
ex-wife donald trump made me
feel violated during sex
ivana trump once accused
the real-estate tycoon
of quote rape
somebody who speaks
for donald trump
has come out
and denied it as well
and added that legally
he says
you cannot rape your spouse
here the one thing
you probably know about me
i have a big mouth
roger
you have megyn on line one
megyn
morning roger
whatd you do
to piss off trump
we did a segment
on recent coverage
of his ex-wife rape claim
youre giving that oxygen
before the first
goddamn debate
roger we had a full-screen
of ivana recantation
which is soft
she accused him
during a divorce
well his lawyer
michael cohen
claims you cant
rape a spouse
it pissed me off
great the future of fox news
is now a goddamn feminist
no im not a feminist
im a lawyer
we need him
clean this up now
unfortunately
when it comes to
politicians and the media
roger ailes knows his shit
appointed head of
the fox news channel
by media mogul rupert murdoch
roger transformed cable news
pushing fox to the forefront
years before
to get nixon elected
he created the modern
town-hall debate
to get reagan elected
he made him address
the elephant in the room
i will not make age
an issue of this campaign
i am not going to exploit
my opponent youth
and inexperience
to get
george hw bush elected
somebody did
the willie horton ads
roger denies it was him
a lot
i have been astounded
at the number of americans
who are fine with our country
moving
in a socialist direction
here we go
their views on capitalism
are quite alarming
im a
news is like a ship
you take your hands
off the wheel
and it pulls hard to the left
hey look at this
james murdoch
tell me those lips
havent sucked cock
this is what
nepotism gets you
roger rules fox
from behind these doors
on the second floor
when employees say
the second floor
they mean roger
or the many vps
paid to enact his will
without qualms or questions
now i know what some of you
are thinking and no
roger does not tell us
what to say on air
he doesnt have to
love that dress megyn
thank you
no really i love it
he not horny
he just ambitious
roger is always watching
the eagles
postponed their appearance
because co-founder
glenn frey
is too ill to travel
in a statement
the band announced
morons
the phone in his office
connects directly
to the control room
which is down
on the first floor
yes sir
you fucking idiots
that not glenn frey
it don henley
dump the b-roll
dump it dump it
back to anchor
that not glenn frey
that don fucking henley
oh shoot
what the fuck kayla
im sorry
i dont know secular music
the eagles
only the biggest band
of the 70s
when my mom was a toddler
they all look the same
theyre just old
oh my god
down in the basement
is the fox newsroom
all our shows have crews
who work in these pods
this is my staff
hey guys
were below the city
so it smells like mold
but there hasnt been
a rat sighting
in four months
four months
the anchors and their
key producers have base camps
here on 7 and 8
often decorated
with viewer art
and everyone in this building
even roger answers to eight
the eighth floor is home
to ceo rupert murdoch
and his sons
this is the power
behind the power
the actual studios are
scattered around the building
most anchor
and show offices are here
above are fox business radio
new york post
and the wall street journal
most of the american
conservative establishment
in one building
the stage is finally set
for tonight republican
debate in cleveland
all the
candidates are looking
for a boost tonight
but only ten of them
have a chance
to appeal to voters
in prime time
trump has a real problem
with women
i wanna ask about it
you can back that up
yes
good morning
morning chris
excuse me
do you think that it
sorry
it probably nerves
no when im nervous
i hear my heart
i cant hear it
that your first question
is this some feminist thing
she not a feminist
it goes to his electability
did you run it
past tom lowell
we can go after trump
the second floor
said that
no
the eighth the murdochs
rupert called roger and said
about trump enough is enough
look all trump does
is watch fox
roger gave him air
for his crazy theories
and idiot grievances
why cause roger shares
a lot of them
are you sure
you wanna take that on
yes
it the new
look of politics
okay i dont know
if these are strong enough
but they help me
uh-huh nausea
yeah
you go live in five hours
ill be fine
okay
okay
donald trump
feeds his own narrative
oh fuck
so nauseous
if you can try
to keep them down
yeah
fuck
stop making that face julia
im not making a face
five hours
yeah
okay
dont worry
were behind you
way behind you
there a blanket
on the chair
and just in case
a trash can beside it
welcome to the first
republican primary debate
tonight moderators
will be bret baier
chris wallace and megyn kelly
mr trump one of the things
people love about you
is you speak your mind
and you dont use
a politician filter
however that is not
without its downsides
in particular
when it comes to women
youve called women you dont
like fat pigs dogs
slobs
and disgusting animals
what is she doing
your twitter account
only rosie odonnell
great tv
she knows what she doing
your twitter account
for the record it was
well beyond rosie odonnell
yes im sure it was
your twitter account has
several disparaging comments
about women looks
you once told a contestant
on celebrity apprentice
it would be a pretty picture
to see her on her knees
does that sound to you
like the temperament
of a man we should elect
as president
and how will you
answer the charge
from hillary clinton
she calling him out
who is likely
to be the democratic nominee
that you are part of the war
on women
call me stupid but i thought
hed respect the challenge
trump is pissed
he was up all night tweeting
crap really
what was he tweeting
fox viewers give low marks
to bimbo @megynkelly
ugh i hate that word
yeah it says youre too sexy
to be smart
but not smart enough
to be sexy
240 am wow @megynkelly
really bombed tonight
people are going wild
on twitter funny to watch
307 am dear @megyn
go trump donald trump
okay
how many times did he tweet
like 5
yeah
he never gonna be president
wait am i gonna be the story
no
im gonna be the story
no
no no
i cant let you go without
talking about donald trump
gretchen giving
this two blocks
it that
far down the food chain
we should get you
a security team
think it over
trump called me
before the debate
he said he knew that your
first question was harsh
how could he know that
no idea
i sure didnt
it was good tv unexpected
goddamn tough
proud of you megyn
thanks roger
heard you were sick
yeah
i think it was my coffee
whered you get it
my driver
he insisted
on some fancy coffee joint
you know this guy
no he a driver roger
did you know him
no
you know
better than that
okay yes
roger ailes is paranoid
but his parents were nuts
as he drove off to college
they filed for divorce
and didnt tell him
at christmas he came home
to find strangers in his house
and all his things
photos and yearbooks
and trophies thrown out
i mean is it any wonder
the man created
a nostalgia machine
for lost america
this is crazy
were sitting here wondering
if a candidate for president
poisoned my coffee
it only crazy
until it happens
and it happens
i hate being the story
ill call trump
you go on vacation
stay above it all
he wont dent your ratings
nobody stops watching
because of a conflict
they stop watching
when there isnt one
some viewers will listen
to him
well some but as long
as he keeps saying
megyn kelly is unwatchable
that means he watching it
they know that
and theyll watch
what he watches
youll be okay
see you in a week
drink up buddy boy
thank you
here to a week
of no kids but my own
cheers
cheers
okay
frank bruni in the times
boo
the debate was riveting
it was admirable
it compels me
to write a cluster of words
i never imagined writing
hooray for fox news
wow
well that gotta
make you happy
praise all tangled up
in an insult
it does make me happy gil
and you know
you could see there was
blood coming out of her eyes
blood coming out of her
wherever
no oh my god
did he just accuse me
of anger-menstruating
yes are um yeah
yeah
im calling roger
no ill talk to him
take your vacation
ill handle this
oh my god
do you hear the phones
doug
i have to call you back
would you like to
correct yourself
on that other talking point
about men being dominant
we dont have any time
i wish we did
were running over
were running over
yeah well hr is on the phone
cause you called me a skirt
i gotta read
that manual again
ill bring it to your
office right after the show
some guy came up
to me and said
i saw you on fox & friends
this morning
is gretchen as cute in person
as she is on tv
oh come on
and what did you answer him
beautiful dress
you look wonderful
great color
in summary
gretchen beautiful
beautiful you look beautiful
well you look fabulous too
cause you gotta wax
does the waxing hurt
uh he looks at me for that
well try that
women are everywhere
were letting em play golf
and tennis now
it outta control
you know what
you know
she out
you read the headlines
since men are so great
she needed a shower
the attitude off-camera
was even worse
steve simply started
ignoring me
what did mr ailes say
when you complained
he said you act
like it only rains on women
stop getting goddamn offended
by everything
youre a man-hater
and um learn to get along
with the boys
then he took me off the show
but gave you your own
well in the afternoon
dead zone
i mean it was a demotion
and we both knew it
even though i did increase
the ratings by 5%
he moved me
to second base
back in minnesota
before i graduated
summa cum laude from stanford
before i was crowned
miss america
i played second base
in the sixth-grade
softball league
i hate second base
did he ever offer
to reverse that decision
if you made yourself
sexually available
not directly
with roger
it always about loyalty
he says he can fix things
if youre loyal
and you can guess the ultimate
expression of loyalty
we dont guess
oral sex
roger likes to joke
to get ahead
you gotta give a little head
really
but mr ailes
never unambiguously
asks for oral sex
i mean it was always
just a joke a put-down
like youre sexy
but youre too much work
youre i mean
i have a whole list in here
because that just
how roger is
what do you want
out of a lawsuit
what do i want
i want this behavior to stop
someone has to speak up
someone has to get mad
well that may not be you
your contract
will have a clause
requiring secret
mandatory arbitration
you familiar
with rudi bakhtiar case
yes
well youre supposed to be
my first act as
dc bureau chief
i want you down here
full-time
oh my god
that amazing yes
you do know
what this means for you
shit
he doesnt think im ready
brian
i will not let you down
im gonna bust my ass for you
well rudi come on
that a given
so what the problem
but um
look you do get
how i feel about you right
oh fuck
fuck fuck fuck
well im glad
you said that brian
because i really respect
you too
no no i mean
how i really feel
just look confused
all i want from you rudi
is to see the inside
of your hotel room
god damn it
that all it gonna take
dont react
make it your fault
brian if ive done anything
to make you think
i feel that way about you
i apologize
friends
were friends
professionals
we have
a great professional vibe
now sell it
i just dont do that
ive never had to do that
for a job
i know i know
you know id kill for dc
but there no way
im showing you my hotel room
this is gonna
ruin my career
well now i feel
like a creep
no
no youre so not
fucking creep
they fired me
im a lousy reporter
apparently assholes
she proved
what they wanted her to prove
no one really wins
by suing fox news
it been our experience
that once you go public
in your job
no one will hire you
if youre able
to stick it out at fox
gather more evidence
you might be able to sue
ailes himself instead of fox
and that is why im here
because marty hyman told me
that over here in new jersey
i can avoid arbitration
by suing roger personally
he says that youve managed
to change the law
and that we could
call other women
and show a pattern
will other women come forward
yes they will
you live and work in new york
roger has a house
in bergen county
where he stays
when he cant make it upstate
you do
your homework ms carlson
no fingerprints
that how much i practiced
the violin as a child
if roger finds out
you came to us
he wont just fire you
mmm
he will bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit
he will attack you personally
these men they care
more about their reputations
than they do money
roger wont stop
oh i know mmm-hmm
you know that
colleagues you admire
will say publicly
youre a superior
ambitious woman
who suing
because her career stalled
let em
okay
if we work hard
you might be lucky enough
to watch
the most powerful man in tv
go after you
with everything he got
thank you
im telling you
other women will come forward
let hope
frankly
i think you have a gap
in the network mr shine
there are millions of young
conservatives in this country
i mean you can look at my
instagram account there are
they dont have a voice
on our network
i see myself as an influencer
in the jesus space
and dont get me wrong
ive learned a ton
from gretchen
i truly have of course
but no judgment here
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial
it just not that helpful
to her
i mean to be honest
mr shine
she sort of establishment
with a capital e
that why i wanted
to talk to you in private
kayla before we
move you up
i want to ask you
something personal
mmm
what do you think
of our slogan
fair and balanced
im glad you asked
look our news shows
and our opinion shows
are very different
our news is impartial
it top-of-the-line
our opinion shows
roger gave a voice
to people who didnt have one
and he balanced
the american conversation
so our newspeople are fair
our entertainers are a very
necessary form of balance
attagirl perfect
but today
were sticking up for girls
on international day
of the girl
and for the first time
on cable news here i am
makeup-free for a reason
tomorrow ill be back
in my regular makeup
and i thank
the other brave women
who came on today show
sans makeup
but let continue to tell
our girls just be yourself
shep
and clear
yes
great show
get me some makeup
i have some bad news
kayla is leaving us
for the asshole
oreilly
mmm-hmm
it is our
highest-rated program
and we cant be
no i believe
in real story i do
did you just see that segment
did you see it did you see
were doing
something unique here
mmm-hmm
together all of us
can you just
sure
listen to me
i can get you
where you wanna be
i can protect you
just dont get ahead
of yourself
you have a lot to learn
i can teach you
im not getting ahead
of myself gretchen
im taking the next step
no listen
i learn by doing
come on come on please
im confused
you want me to pass on
a promotion
so you can help me
get the same promotion
on a show with worse ratings
no i just
i want a little loyalty
i need loyalty
women together
im loyal to the network
all right
it not us versus them
gretchen
miss america
roger
hi there
this is a treat
what the fuck are you doing
a segment on how
we oversexualize women
i mean you said
be more myself so ta-da
you know
what makeup does
keeps everybody
from seeing you sweat
well it most of
the mean tweets that i receive
are about my appearance
so it is important
that we fight back
against this kind of bullying
bullying isnt meanness
bullying is
people with more power
hitting people with less
these jackasses
have cellphones
you have a fucking tv show
we have to fight
the objectification of women
oh bullshit
listen
mouth shut ears open
nobody wants to watch
a middle-aged woman
sweat her way
through menopause
what
not on
national fucking television
thank you for the advice
objectification
all right
gretchen
i really appreciate
shut up
good luck
drift
go go go
whoo good one honey
ooh ooh ooh
hey
it a zoo here
the phone ringing
off the hook
anyone care
he called me a bimbo
not really
he tweeted the gq photo
i saw
and
torn
god id love
to be slut-shamed
gil wants to ask again
if we should make a statement
no no response zero
doug just lost
i gotta go
next time honey
nice
good game
trump 6
excuse me
you talk to my wife again
i will beat you
to a fucking pulp
that was weird
mmm-hmm
youre getting some action
oh really
oh man
asshole
you dont have to worry
about trump
youre tougher
than all those guys okay
you just gotta worry
about the crazies
i can handle a few crazies
i know
mommy
trump will stop once he feels
he won the argument
i feel like
he less interested
in winning the argument
than just having the argument
with you in public
to prove he can
take on the establishment
im not the establishment
honey get real
you are the establishment now
mommy
not yet
you do understand i have
to be above this right
i have to be an anchor first
then a woman
you know the entire country
is talking
about your period right now
mommy
what
there a man
what
yardley
look he right there
yardley where is he
look there he is
oh jesus
he got a fucking camera
come here honey
no no no
dont open the door
they cant sell them
if were inside
get out get out of here go
are you okay
what were
you guys doing
mommy and daddy
mmm-hmm
um
it was a crossword
mommy was just taking
a quick little nap
quick one
it wasnt that quick
im gonna have to
call roger about security
it as clear as a bell
that mayhem kelly has
gone over to the dark side
the more she sells out
the wider
her nostrils have become
listen to
what ive just said to you
he here
this woman was once pretty
and the more she has sold out
the wider
her nostrils have become
theyre almost porcine
she snorts her insults
at america
roger
and as i say it now
the portrait of dorian kelly
not the portrait
of dorian gray
give me a day to figure out
how we hit trump back
stop by later
i dont want my kids
hearing this crap
ignore the damn morons
im old fat and ugly
christ
they call me jabba the hutt
hemophilia swells my joints
cant exercise
i feel fine
but i look like shit
i look the opposite
of how i feel
do i let it affect me
no i do not
this isnt entirely true
roger is also fat
because hell get
a room-service menu
and order page two
no goddamn orange on fox
but he cares a lot
about looks
fucking idiots
let turn our attention
to south korea
south korean officials say
talks with the north have
adjourned until tomorrow
early on he realized
for a network to stay on
24 hours a day
you need something
to hold an audience
joining me to discuss
the korean peninsula
is seth choy
that something is legs
there a reason
for clear desks
we need you
in a shorter dress
but you know
that theyre gonna take
wide shot wider
go to the wide shot
i want to see
her goddamn legs
why the fuck
do you think i hired her
but this might
be seen by racial activists
purely
through the racial prism
uh stand up
and give me a spin
really
yeah it a visual medium
yeah
that good sit down
i support the wall i do
but mass deportations
come on
thatll never work
because of the 4th amendment
you want me to quote it
if you were born in america
youre an american period
period
get me
a demographically friendly
hispanic woman on immigration
but hey she needs to be
very demographically friendly
okay uh new girl up
kayla
hi sir
so i was listening to
rush limbaugh this morning
he said something kind of cool
about anthony weiner
how he an exhibitionist
in every aspect
of how he presents himself
politically
oh my god
is she the best
you can do
bill shine asked us
to give her a try so
okay let not lose
focus back to immigration
oh my gosh
i cant get fired
this is the only job
i have ever wanted
i dont wanna be on tv
i wanna be on fox
uh-huh
my family every day
every holiday
especially holidays
they watch fox news
were like addicts
fox is how we do church
you know when they made
the corner logo turn
the bug
because folks had fox
burned into their tv screens
that us
kayla
youre not getting fired
he cannot scale his anger
he a perpetual
outrage machine
that why crazies love him
no offense to your family
you want to do the folders
no crying at fox
no crying
let me explain
your mistake here
so rush is on hannity team
theyre the competition
theyre gop party hacks
so he thinks
he way ahead of them
so steal from drudge
and breitbart not talk radio
okay
also stop worrying
if the story legit
if you cant source it
just go with
some are saying
seriously
you have to adopt
the mentality of
an irish street cop
the world is a bad place
people are lazy morons
minorities are criminals
sex is sick
but interesting
ask yourself what would
scare my grandmother
or piss off my grandfather
and that a fox story
are you writing this down
oh it makes
so much sense
frighten titillate
right
frighten titillate
frighten titillate
when youre starting
the story
you need to start
with a clear villain
liberal judge
pinhead mayor
vermont hollywood
uh-huh
conservatives
want to conserve
uh-huh
youre the last defense
against jesus-hating
trans-loving
clinton-controlled
armageddon baby
oh come on
you do believe
some of that right
yeah
uh
that quite a face
you have
really
thank you
im drunk
im drunk as well
you have a hillary poster
in your house
i guess i do
okay my parents
would be horrified
if i went home
with a democrat
the lesbianism however

political pressures
at play here as well

im not trying to be critical
i just
well you are

the republican candidate
for president

look for the record
no you know what
it been a shitty year

and im allowed
to want it over
you are
fuck
so what im saying is
do we really need ar-5s
to be able to hunt deer
protect our families
im in favor of people
being able to carry handguns
some of these mass shootings
would have been less deadly
if that had been the case
but im also with
the majority today
taking a stand against
semiautomatic assault weapons
which brings us back
to the question of the day
should congress reinstate
the assault weapons ban
i know a lot of you
dont agree with me
that fine
huh
89% of you say no
and that what makes
america great

id never heard of her
more importantly no one heard
from her after she was fired
wait not even to
negotiate a severance

what
fox news host gretchen carlson
has filed a lawsuit against
the network ceo roger ailes
claiming she was fired
because she was
fox news chairman roger ailes
is responding to a lawsuit
filed by lawyers
for gretchen carlson
alleges she was fired
after turning down
sexual advances
carlson claimed in the lawsuit
that ailes took her off
the popular morning show
fox & friends in 203
cut her pay and placed her
in a less desirable
afternoon time slot
because she refused to have
a sexual relationship
with him
the lawsuit was filed
in new jersey state court
champ making his rounds
good boy
are you okay
no
beth
i just talked to thewrap
it an online publication
i said how sad it is
weve got this woman
making these complaints
when there are real victims
out there
i know roger
i told people magazine
weve been in your office
alone a lot over 5 years
ive never seen anything
like what im reading about
i said i dont think
gretchen carlson
has a friend
in the building
i know roger
someone wouldve told me
theyre gonna quote me
on that
not a ring of truth
maria bartiromo
sent variety a stock chart
oh hey were up
whoo-hoo
hannity tweeted i talked to
hundreds of women at fox this week
both on air and off
they say it all bs
brit hume too
brit
why didnt gretchen
quit and sue
instead of suing
only after she got fired
why didnt she complain
why didnt she complain
really
he means
the anonymous hotline
there a hotline
yeah
i did
the harassment seminar twice
i never heard about a hotline
because it bullshit
they have a contractual right
to monitor our communications
a hotline in this building is like
a complaint box in occupied paris
it like were telling women
go on speak up for yourself
just know the entire network
is with roger
no one will believe you
theyll call you a liar
oh and as for your career
you want assignments and air time
go ahead
call the paranoid man
who decides your salary
a pervert
and do that on a fucking
anonymous hotline he controls
on a phone he has
a contractual right to record
jesus fucking christ
do you think women are idiots
it like
somebody stripped you naked
and they want you
to walk through this office
just to fucking prove it
okay
can i see you for a minute
what the fuck was that
i dont know but i liked it
i wont call you a feminist
but say there a spectrum
you are
roger harassed me
ten years ago
i had turned down
a law-firm partnership
for an entry-level job
here at fox
roger would call me up to
new york to dangle prospects
i wanted his help
did you
do anything
no
will you talk
megyn
i dont know
i dont know
i mean going on the record
jesus
it basically admitting youre
the weak one in the herd
no it admitting
youre the hot one
it has nothing
to do with that gil
say women
oh my god
look there is a reason
certain women
can defend roger
if i report this and it leaks
it will follow me
for the rest of my career
i dont wanna be defined
by roger bullshit
i refuse to be the fucking poster
girl for sexual harassment
he cant still be doing
that crap right
i mean the man has a walker
viagra
gil
help me here
please how do i play this
well you only ask
when you already know
if i learned anything
this year
it to not get sucked
into a fight
with someone who has better
reason to be in it than you do
okay
okay
so what is it you wanna do
for right now nothing
good
good
there she is
hi roger
hello sweetheart
hi
sit sit
youve met mayor giuliani before
of course
there
an internal investigation
but im not gonna wait for it
to clear me
the republican convention
is less than two weeks away
this is bullshit
im gonna fight it
the charges are absurd
im in roger
i love that fate has given me
a chance to repay you
for when i was
in intensive care
roger called my idiot doctors
every day for four weeks
told them
hed put me on the air
live from the hospital bed
if they didnt fix
every stitch of damage done
but im also here as someone
who has dealt with this issue
for years
years on the side of women
i dont wanna see
sexual violence trivialized
i dont wanna see it become
some damn political football
in that spirit i need to ask
will an investigation
find anything
well uncomfortable
well define uncomfortable
roger quote
i think you and i
should have had
a sexual relationship
a long time ago
and then
youd be good and better
and id be good and better
did you say that
no im not a fool
you missed your chance for me
to harass you come on
i think theyll argue
it solicitous
telling a woman she was
fuckable a long time ago
who the hell thinks
that works
why she suing roger
gretchen is
a very competitive woman
facing a severe
likability issue
one that i shielded her from
for years
her career over im afraid
and she cant take
a joke
roger is very salty
i find it amusing
it my fault i encourage it
james murdoch
could be behind this
his wife
openly supports hillary
and it could go deeper
i have good reason to believe
that inside
the obama white house
there have been discussions
on what level i do not know
of having me killed
oh jesus
hi there
hey
roger needs you
your silence is being noticed
well the whole point
of an investigation
is to find the truth jeanine
until that happens
i dont have a lot to say
if this charge sticks
the working assumption
will be
every woman at fox got down
on her knees
even you
if we sweep this thing
under the rug jeanine
and it happens again
under title seven
fox will be liable
for compensatory
and punitive damages
that could be
hundreds of millions
let worry about the law
before we do the pr okay
does roger want us
yes he a man
he also gave us time
he gave us opportunity
we benefited
from that kind of attention
i mean jeanine pirro
she the founding member
of team roger
youre not answering
your phone
no im holding it
okay well everybody
still looking for you
where were any of these people to defend me from trump hmm
excuse me
bill shine told them not to
what the fuck
our boss
why are you guys in the hall
i got a call
from roger lawyer
saying to quote relax
theyre convincing rupert
to limit the investigation
to gretchen and her team
that only five or six women
are you gonna let that happen
i like roger i do
i know
even if he can be controlling
and vindictive
those sins arent really
the problem meg
i mean there were
hundreds of stories
of roger paying
an employee rehab
or keeping somebody
terminally ill on payroll
you remember
when shep came out
all roger said was
i dont care
where you put your pecker
as long as you dont tell me
where to put mine
again not the most redeeming
he promoted me
he looked past the rejection
he looked past the risk
of this exact conversation
he handed me the power
to hurt him
morning
hi megyn
we need to get
gerson zweifach on the phone
gerson im calling for roger
he wants me to be
part of your investigation
weve decided
on an outside firm
no why gerson we can
handle this ourselves
im asking paul/weiss
paul/weiss
you tell them that
i can actively participate
mr giuliani
youre an old friend of roger
you married them
sharing information with you
will remove the cloak
of attorney-client privilege
making the testimony
of any woman
who comes forward
subject to discovery
i understand
you get me a waiver
i will not structure
this investigation
so roger isnt perceived of
as its target
you want him to look guilty
well that depends
on what we find
you know a reporter
gabe sherman
no
youre about to
he found six women
who claim roger ailes
harassed them
all from before roger
founded fox news
this was years ago
he said he would
put me on the show
but i had to go to bed
with him
and i just said yeah right
you and who else
and he said just me
and a few of
my preferred friends
i came in
and he closed the door
turned and kissed me
like i was his girlfriend
like he knew it was coming
he grabbed my tits
and he said
look no girl gets a job here
unless theyre cooperative
if you wanna make it
in new york city
in the tv business
youre gonna have to fuck me
and youre gonna have to
do that
with anyone i tell you to
he finishes the test
which is me
pretending to cook
then he pulls out
a garter belt and stockings
and says put these on
so yeah well i put them on
and he said
you know
i can really help you
but if you wanna play
with the big boys
you have to lay
with the big boys
it was very transactional
it was quiet
he stared at me
he undid his pants
and took out his penis
very gingerly
i had never seen one
i was scared
then he said kiss it
i was 6
former anchor
gretchen carlson
filing a sexual-harassment
lawsuit
against fox news
chief roger ailes
more women are coming forward
ailes is denying
the allegations
and getting
some high-profile support
the accusations
against roger ailes are growing
i have never run
a goddamn dairy queen
you dont get to go
and get whatever you want
everybody on my shows
knows the meaning of decency
and i do mean everybody
a tv outfit needs tough
confident women
do i push them
you bet your ass i do
but have i ever demanded sex
during a casting session
have i offered extra pay
for blowjobs
give me a goddamn break
why the hell would i do that
you know the look in a woman
eye when she interested
walk into casting
back then as the decider
there was a look
they gave
i did not always
look like this
i never had to harass anybody
and it fucking offensive
to say that i did
well theyre trying
to change history
for their families some of them probably
dont even remember what happened
that gracious of you beth
but this is political
i defy you
to find any evidence
that a single part of what
these women are saying is true
get ready more will come
we need to let rupert know
what it means if i lose
gretchen carlson
could kill fox news
this is a fight for your jobs
if i go you go
if youd asked me what type of
sexual fetish roger ailes had
i never would have come up
with garter belts
but it fucking perfect
their stories are so similar
that doesnt prove much
sherman met them all
through gretchen lawyer
they could have been coached
the blowjob thing
feels real to me
does roger seem like a guy
who would get off
on that particular
power dynamic yes
a guy who maybe thinks
oral doesnt
really count maybe
a guy who has
reasons to prefer
a sex act that lets him
keep his clothes on
sure
still doesnt make it true
well if true
these incidents all happened
before fox started
should that matter
no
yes
i talked to gerson zweifach
and
he asked me to encourage women
who have claims
to come forward
you remember what happened last time
you got between rupert and roger
before i speak out
i need to know if this
happened to other women at fox
you understand that
is this one
where you really wanna know
or you wanna look like
you really wanna know
but dont
i really wanna know
im not always like that
no one around here believes
roger would want
to harass gretchen
i will send you some of
her soapy notes to roger
last night
sandra filled in for megyn
why not me smiley face
who sends a harasser
a smiley face
martin
hey nancy
thanks for coming
of course
hi nancy coffee
thank you
so what do you got
so um no one from fox
has come forward
no one
rudi bakhtiar
but no one who still there
there been nothing
but praise for roger
except from megyn kelly
she been unusually silent
right well
something mustve happened
to megyn in the past
with roger
she way too ambitious
not to support him
possibly
should you call
tell her this is a spotlight
youd be happy to share
megyn share
no she wouldnt do it
what makes you say that
because i wouldnt
i mean roger plays his women
off against each other
he always done it
hell say
megyn thinks that
lisa should get your spot
or megyn suspects
that youre screwing cal
and then hell offer advice
on how to get back at her
as if you brought it up
she renegotiating her deal
i can think of roughly
5 million reasons
to stay quiet
we do need some collaboration
well
that would certainly help
with the other networks
oh god what
what marty
well weve not had um
a lot of incoming
job interests from them
what not a lot
none
theyre afraid of roger
no
no woman gets to sue her boss
rule number one
of corporate america
you dont sue your boss
i jumped off a cliff
i thought one of them
would stand with me
hey mom
hey were home
god uh hey honey
there a snack
in the kitchen
okay
thanks
were gonna get him
megyn doesnt want
to release a statement
it could be seen as
influencing the investigation
have her say that
to roger face
look let us know who else
hasnt spoken up for him
and maybe she can
encourage them privately
no jesus we need
our anchors we need her

roger can sense
vulnerabilities
in those days our meetings
were career-strategy sessions
mixed with good advice
and comments like
the most basic thing
is confidence
feel at home in your own skin
if youre confident
youre sexy
im sure you have
some sexy bras
id love to see you in those
it was a cat-and-mouse game
but he always gave me
good advice
and let me deflect
tell him to dream on
the more i let him
get away with
the more he pushed my buttons
i dont know if women
can be good interviewers
men have that killer instinct
we do bad things
and we do not
feel guilty about it
how can i be sure
you have that kind of drive
finally in january
this is 06
yes
he grabbed me
tried to kiss me
i pushed him away twice
as i was leaving he asked
when your contract up
after the third time i left
and he never tried
anything again
no
i ignored his calls
stayed in dc
two years later i had a show
any long-term consequences
yeah um
am i witness w
yes why
it the 23rd letter
in the alphabet
have 22 other women
come forward
since i first spoke to you
have they
will there be more
a major bombshell
this morning
star anchor megyn kelly
has informed lawyers
that fox news ceo
roger ailes
sexually harassed her
for her to level
these allegations
is devastating against ailes
we are seeing
the end of an era at fox news
the dagger in his heart
in some ways
was the notion
that megyn kelly
was among his accusers
what
what
yes yes
roger what the matter
megyn claiming
i harassed her
what
you saw gabe sherman post
james has been
feeding him bullshit
comb through megyn press
find every single positive
thing she said about me
and get it out now
roger i cant discredit
an anchor im paid to promote
glad im not in a foxhole
with you
well well leak something
to breitbart or to drudge
im sorry roger
well do something
at least get some shit
about gretchen out there

that you dont already know

at this point
we will be emailing you guys
please just hold tight
thanks
hey gil
hey greta
what megyn endgame
this part of her
contract negotiation
it not economic
or political
okay gil
no this is scaring me
it like
the whole world on fire
and no one can be trusted
hey geraldo
cnn line six
cant talk
these are the end-times
why arent you on the phone
to comment
on sexual harassment
we work for bill
team roger
hey we need you to wear it
no
are you kidding
no
are you kidding
doesnt she have a job
get it on
megyn kelly has no comment
she traveling
to cleveland
for the republican convention
remember
look ive known him
for 40 years
and he about as flirty as
the grizzly from the revenant
let me
tell you something
i called these allegations
sick cause they are sick
hey why wasnt i let in
on the pact
what pact
breitbart is saying
there a pact
among our
top 50 on-air talents
that if roger gets fired
we all walk
great where do i sign
wait i never heard of a pact
me either
roger placed it
fake news
come on
how bad
does it look for roger
bad
doesnt feel
like i imagined it would
gretchen you achieved
something remarkable
yes i did
mom
i think it time
we finish this
okay ill let you know
mom are you done with that
mmm-hmm im done
i made the murdochs
5 billion in profit
last year
pure profit
fox news
is the most successful
cable franchise in history
gretchen carlson lawyers
she wants to settle
it a lot less appealing
to sue you personally
without rupert money
behind you
hey ken
ken
hey look who here
oh my gosh
i brought you some small people
yard yatesy
oh my gosh
ive missed you guys so much
we practiced that scare
for two weeks
look at you
hi
hi
i love you mama
my little chubble-wubbles
we got her
all right
she was so scared
thank you
how are you sweetheart
im either damned for doing it
or damned
for not doing it sooner
tell me my big mouth
didnt ruin our life
not yet
can i speak
to roger alone please
are you sure
you want beth here
well of course
gretchen taped
your conversations
that a goddamn lie
for over a year
but
you dont believe her
your quotes in her lawsuit
theyre from tapes
why didnt they
tell us before
so youd issue
complete denials
so youd have no credibility
apparently
she did her homework
god bless our
next president donald trump
and god bless
the united states of america
usa
mr giuliani fired up
when we come back
well discuss his speech
with the man
who helped write it
clear
dont react okay
mmm-hmm
roger out
is that sourced gil
yeah the new york post
they put him on the cover
rupert telling him
to let go
then it a scoop
were gonna win
were gonna win so big
thank you very much
everybody
there is some
breaking news tonight
in the worlds of
media and politics
a blockbuster shakeup
at fox news
a dramatic fall from grace
roger ailes is out
as top boss
they want us
to circle the block
no hold on
what going on
go around
ive been shut out
it true
everything gretchen said
it all true
roger lied to me
why
because im a manager here
so i have concerns
my public defense of roger
could be construed
as coercive
hey huh pants
fuck off neil
sorry to keep you waiting
no no no no no sit down
appreciate you
driving up here roger
susan estrich
susan
i hate that it come to this
me too
we gave these women jobs
put them on the air
made them famous
do you think
for a goddamn second
i did any damage
to any of them
no you dont
you dont rupert
there no audience
for that side of the story
to begin with
half this you already owe him
from last year bonus
and were paying it
and paying off your contract
consider yourself lucky
it a contractual obligation
i created the murdoch family
most profitable asset
a third of your margin
there are three of you
i guess that means
i pay for the food
that one of you puts
in your mouth
what if it you
id have fired you for cause
roger
you built an amazing business
no one can take that
away from you
but under the circumstances
this is a lot of money
and it wont look good
to the people
that dont know your worth
take it
honor your non-compete
i never cared about the money
we know roger
okay
okay
id like to go
to the newsroom with you
id like us to announce
my leaving together
no
the end of the leg man
i wont miss him
boys
hope you two know
what youre doing
once roger office is cleared
of handguns ill move in
ill run the network
till the ship aright
donald
how our speech coming
yeah
megyn gotta go ho ho ho
megyn gotta go ho ho ho
convention
downstairs folks
what going on at fox
would you say
people are shocked
can rupert
afford to dump roger
what did he do to you
megyn come on
of all the ways
this could end
i didnt see this one coming
gretchen carlson
got the murdochs
to put the rights of women
above profit
if only temporarily
and i found myself
with a job i didnt want
or couldnt really leave
even when i did
you should keep that out
people can i get
your attention please
mr murdoch
is joining us today
he has a very important
statement hed like to say
excuse me everyone
i wont take long
roger ailes is leaving fox
now i want to start
by thanking roger
for his
remarkable contribution
to our company
and to our country
twenty years ago
roger shared
here the thing about
being sexually harassed
at work
it condemns you to questions
you keep asking yourself
what did i do
what did i say
what did i wear
what did i miss
am i seen as weak
will they say
im after money
will they say
im after attention
will i be left out
will i be defined by this
for the rest of my life
i will take over
as chairman and acting ceo
with the support of our
existing management team
under bill shine
if i stay do i just
have to put up with it
will the next place
be different
or can i make it different
roger always said
everyone on television
only has one real job
to be likable
well i dont care
if you like me
only that you believe me
a lot of people even women
are skeptical
of harassment claims
until they experience it
themselves
or know someone who has
let me be that person for you
as you can see
it 20 million
plus the apology
mmm
correct
i cant believe
fox agreed to the apology
i mean it unheard of
i mean that never happens
but you will have to
sign that
it a strict confidentiality
agreement
money will establish
you told the truth
but no one can ever hear it
directly from you
you will be muzzled gretchen
maybe
