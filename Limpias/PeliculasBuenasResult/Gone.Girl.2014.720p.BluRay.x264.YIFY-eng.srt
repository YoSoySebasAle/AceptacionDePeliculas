when i think of my wife
i always think of her head
i picture cracking her lovely skull
unspooling her brains
trying to get answers
the primal questions of any marriage
what are you thinking
how are you feeling
what have we done to each other
the irish prince
graces us with his presence
his majesty prefers not to be moistened
i got you a present
i hated this game
you loved it
you loved it
thank you
ill add it to the collection
can you pour me a bourbon
what up jitters
well if youre not going to talk

with another excruciating story
by margo dunne
i could tell you about
my recent customer service experience
changing internet service providers
i like that one
or how about the time i saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend monica

where you put down that
monk-brewed belgian wheat beer
because the party down to three
beast lights and a bottle of pucker
it might attract
some desperate characters

of my artisanal meat platter

how to pronounce that word
meat
yes meat  one syllable

perfect brilliant amazing amy
who getting fucking married
when i was 0 i quit cello
in the next book
amazing amy became a prodigy
did you play volleyball
i got cut freshman year
she made varsity
when did you have a dog

wow
i love your parents
but they really can be assholes
nick
sir
hey thanks for coming man
no problem
hey sweetheart
big night for your mom
it would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters
bloggers give them a little amy color
people wanna hear from you
we cant stay long
fantastic
fifteen minutes tops
this is why i have my brownstone
my trust fund i know i cant complain
your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood
no they improved upon it
and then peddled it to the masses
i thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme
i thought that would be creepy
if it worth doing
it worth doing
hold up i know how this ends
dont tell me
youre very cute nick
amy you know
what would make dad night
im on it
i love having strangers
pick at my scabs
im curious whether
it difficult for you to see
amazing amy heading down the aisle
and this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding
because it my understanding
you are not married
is that correct
correct amazing amy has always been
one step ahead of me
excuse me im sorry
i just have a few questions
it you
im here in a
strictly journalistic capacity
now you had the distinct pleasure
of dating nick dunne for how long
two magical years
two magical years
in the course of that time
youve had the opportunity
to perform such gracious gestures as
not correcting nick when he
pronounced quinoa as kween-o-a
an understandable mistake
he also thought it was a fish
he thinks velveeta is a cheese
you also manage to appear
shocked and delighted
when nick elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition
of new york new york
every time she sees you
these bag of bone shoes
that just frightening
you also bought nick
his very first pair of scissors
and matching stapler
amy elliott you are more than amazing
you are brilliant
yet entirely un-snobby
you challenge me you surprise me
and fun fact for the readers
you have a world-class vagina
my colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married
is that correct
im not
isnt it time we fixed that
and then
the night wasnt so bad anymore
and it done crossed off the list
now normally we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick
but given the scene at your house
and given our spike
in violent crime of late
we are gonna take this
very very seriously
okay good
weve got forensics over at your place
you got somewhere to stay
i could stay at my sister
okay
were tracking amy phone
her credit cards
we will organize searches
put up flyers
were gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow
youre having a
press conference
i wanna get the word out right
yeah it just all of a sudden
i feel like im on a law & order episode
time is of the essence in these cases
but that said
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer
absolutely not i just wanna help
so you and amy
have been here two years
you tend bar
i own the bar
and i teach creative writing at mvcc
no kids
not yet
so what does amy do most days
a woman with all those degrees
what does she do
i dont know she keeps busy
doing what
she a voracious reader
so she always got a book in her hand
well days can get long
i know a few housewives that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon
or prescription pills
just last week we had a soccer mom
nice lady got her teeth kicked in
over some oxycontin
ever since that mall went bust
half the town is out of work
we cannot keep up
with the drug violence
im pretty sure that not it
has amy got friends we can talk to
no not really
no friends this whole town
she was very close with my mom
before she passed away
you know we have a pretty serious
homeless problem
in our neighborhood
i think maybe you guys
should check that out
well look into that
you got to the bar around 00 today
where were you before that
just to cross that out
well i was home
i left at 930
i got a cup of coffee a newspaper
i went to sawyer beach
and read the news
did you visit with anyone there
i kind of go to sawyer beach
for the solitude
so your wife has no friends here
is she kinda standoffish
ivy league rubs people the wrong way
she from new york
she complicated
she got very high standards
type a
that can make you crazy
if youre not like that
you seem pretty laid-back type b
speaking of which amy blood type
god i dont know
id have to look it up at the house
you dont know if she has friends
you dont know what she does all day
and you dont know
your wife blood type
sure you all are married
maybe it type o
where are her folks new york
yeah
can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow

your wife parents yet

in here
she was all in pink
it was valentine day

nick wants me gone
but he wont ask for a divorce
in his mind im the owner of his bar
his only line of credit
the bitch with the prenup
i could go home to my parents

i thought writers hated clichés
im not a writer
boo-hoo i got laid off
i guess ill fuck a teenager
it wasnt like that okay you have
no idea how shitty it was with amy
how fucking terrible she made me feel
flyover boy
i would get knots in my stomach
just coming home
knowing she would be sitting there
dissatisfied before i even
walked in the fucking door
this is so bad
if anybody finds out
youre totally fucked
boney found a pair of panties
in my office
where occasionally andie and i
i dont know what the fuck it means
are they super-twat
her name is andie
she not entirely sure
so we are dealing with a 20-year-old
who isnt sure
where she leaves her undies
if theyre not andie
that means that theyre amy
and she left them there for me to find
nick i was scared for you before
and now im fucking petrified
were having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife
and this morning youre kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye
can you imagine
have you watched television lately
cable news is all over your shit
i mean what is wrong with this barkeep
his wife nowhere to be found
and here nick dunne for you flirting
cute pic huh
who is that
some fucking tragedy groupie
who the fuck is that
i dont know
she was trying to give me a casserole
on the show today
we have defense attorney tanner bolt
patron saint to wife-killers everywhere
tanner bolt would you actually consider
defending nick dunne
well let me just say
as always ellen
thank you for such a warm welcome
but of course id defend nick dunne
listen just because this guy
isnt walking around weeping
that doesnt mean that he not hurting
tanner the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy
but the truth is
youd have to be a sociopath
to behave normally in this situation
because it the most
abnormal situation in the world
tanner are you trying to tell me
that this photo
is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior
im so sick
of being picked apart by women
you need to hire tanner bolt
i dont deserve this
innocent until proven guilty
that exactly what you deserve
go home nick
hey buddy
i cant believe
we havent arrested this guy
were not gonna arrest anybody
just because some blonde dunce says so
why are you going so easy on him
you got a crush
one i am conducting an investigation
not a witch-hunt
and two
dont talk to me that way ever
she was trying to buy a gun
we dont know who
or what was scaring her gil
give me the update
no drug angles panned out yet
so cross that off the list
i talked to the nurses
who care for nick father
the guy a bastard but he weak as
a kitten so cross that off the list
hey
hey
so luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of july
whoa
yeah
the blood is profuse
it is amy type b
and we should have dna soon
thoughts on a weapon
trajectory indicates blunt force
maybe a club or a two-by-four
she fell there
but i doubt she got back up
amy medical records come in
no well have them later tonight
my wife says he a killer
well if tiffany says
hey
hey
thank you all for coming out
hey donnie how are you
rich thank you so much
hey

thank you for being here tonight
it just means the world to our family
and to amy
as you all know
my wife amy elliott dunne
disappeared three days ago
and i want to implore anyone
who has any information at all
please come forward help us
so hot
he is so creepy
i wanna say something because i think
some of you might be wondering
and are too polite to ask
i had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife
im cooperating with the police
i havent hired a lawyer
i have nothing to hide
amy is my soul mate
she is brilliant
she charming and wise
i love you amy
asshole
i love my wife
so much
and i may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to
and if they wanna punish me for that
that okay
but i just wanna ask you in the media
please harass me
but dont harass
the people of this town
if you need to mock somebody mock me
nick
but please dont turn this investigation
into a circus
where your wife nick
let the police do theirjobs
what did you do to your pregnant wife
did you tell them that nick
did you tell them
amy was six weeks pregnant
thank you for your support tonight
let find amy
go ahead
if you guys wanna say something
gil go go
nick where are you going
stop him
no questions right now thank you
why are you running away
dont run
everybody stay back
guys come on you know better
get off the grass get down to the curb
hey gil
on it
all right
all right yall heard her no pictures
hello
hello
fuck
you scared me want a drink
did you know she was pregnant
i told you
noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy
she doesnt even know amy
they look like pretty good friends
to me
look i dont know but it certainly
doesnt prove that she pregnant
we have her medical records coming
good
so let talk while we wait
let start over here
the scene of the crime
you see weve seen dozens
of home invasions
dozens and dozens
this area right here it looked wrong
from the second we saw it
the whole thing looked staged
watch this
and yet they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle
i dont know
what do you want me to say
did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing
no
because our guys did a luminol test
and im sorry to tell you
but that kitchen lit up
amy lost a lot of blood in there nick
a lot
oh my god
yeah and then somebody mopped it up
wait a second
why would they mop up the blood
if theyre trying to stage
a crime scene
no blood and no body
suggests kidnapping
it tells us
look at people outside the house
like these homeless you keep mentioning
a pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide
it tells us to look at people
inside the house
which is what were doing here nick
i see
so how was your marriage nick
because right now all we got is noelle
she says not good
gil what do you and your wife
argue about
what pisses you off
money lack thereof
me and my ex it the same
i mention that because
we got a look at your finances nick
$7000 in credit card debt
what
i pulled up some of the merchandise
there are these fun little splurges
i didnt buy any of this stuff
i dont even golf
i do you bought great clubs
i like the robot dog
this is identity theft
this is a felony
we need to find out who did this
all right
let talk about life insurance
because in april
you bumped up amy life insurance
to $2 million
yes i did that was her idea
she wanted me to
you filed the paperwork
because she told me to
hold on a sec
yeah okay
for sure
all right
she was pregnant
this is insane
so my question becomes
i dont want to talk
to you again ever
without a lawyer
margo
hey
just hold on a second let me finish
nick
i hear you i hear you
i was as surprised as
i know youre upset
i had no idea she was pregnant
listen i thought so too
but evidently that wasnt
you want to know the truth
the truth is amy didnt want kids
well im as surprised as
you told me you didnt want kids
i was trying to put a good face on
then suddenly
youve got a pregnant wife
that a problem for you
especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend
oh stop watching ellen abbott
you have to fucking talk to me
i didnt tell you that she didnt want kids
because she didnt want me to
because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her
and we had enough of those already
it was easier to just
lie to me
i wanted kids
when we first moved here
i went to a fertility clinic
it didnt work
i did my part
masturbate
when it came time for amy to do her thing
all of a sudden it was like
well i dont know maybe no thanks
now who would believe you
all right
this is a letter from the clinic
notifying me
that theyre gonna destroy my sample
unless i contact them
so i gave it to amy
the next day i saw it in the trash
but you were already with andie
by then right
i wanted a baby with amy
a year ago amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever
when your poor amy has a cold
this dessertjust
this is the clue you couldnt solve
yeah
a letter from desi
that creepy boyfriend of amy
it was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her
it just kept hanging over my head
it was disgusting
your prenup
nick why have you kept this stuff
it like a little box of hate
i dont know go maybe i hate her
i love you no matter what
but you need to tell me
tell you what
what are you asking me
are you asking me
if i killed my wife go
is that what youre asking me
if i murdered my wife
i would never ask you that
margo
dont walk on the glass
you have no clue do you
why was he here that night
his wife is missing why come here
who cares
rhonda we got this
let make the arrest
do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body
no
well it incredibly hard
so i want one last thing
what that
i want a body
picture me
im a girl who very very bad
be careful
i need to be punished
and by punished i mean had
fuck
it where you keep goodies
for anniversary five
so open the door
punish wood beach
and look alive
punish wood
wood
i will practice believing
my husband loves me
and will love this baby
that this child
might really save our marriage
but i could be wrong
because sometimes
the way he looks at me
i think
man of my dreams
father of my child
this man of mine may kill me
he may truly
kill me
wtf
i am so much happier now that im dead
technically missing
soon to be presumed dead
gone
and my lazy lying cheating
oblivious husband
will go to prison for my murder
nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity
and my hope and my money
he took and took from me
until i no longer existed
that murder
let the punishment fit the crime
to fake a convincing murder
you have to have discipline
you befriend a local idiot
harvest the details
of her humdrum life
and cram her with stories
about your husband violent temper
secretly create some money troubles
credit cards perhaps online gambling
with the help of the unwitting
bump up your life insurance
purchase getaway car craigslist
generic cheap pay cash
you need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss
and america loves pregnant women
as if it so hard to spread your legs
you know what hard
faking a pregnancy
first drain your toilet
invite pregnant idiot into your home
and ply her with lemonade
steal pregnant idiot urine
voila
a pregnancy is now pan
of your legal medical record
happy anniversary
wait for your clueless husband
to start his day
off he goes
and the clock is ticking
meticulously stage your crime scene
with just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt
you need to bleed
a lot
a lot a lot
a head wound kind of bleed
a crime scene kind of bleed
you need to clean poorly
like he would
clean and bleed bleed and clean
and leave a little something behind
a fire in july
and because youre you
you dont stop there
you need a diary
minimum 300 entries
on the nick and amy story
stan with the fairy tale early days
those are true and theyre crucial
you want nick and amy to be likeable
after that you invent
the spending
the abuse the fear
the threat of violence
and nick thought he was the writer
burn it just the right amount
make sure the cops will find it
finally honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt
and if i get everything right
the world will hate nick
for killing his beautiful
pregnant wife
and after all the outrage
when im ready
ill go out on the water
with a handful of pills
and a pocket full of stones
and when they find my body
theyll know
nick dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage
and she floated down
past all the other
abused unwanted inconvenient women
then nick will die too
nick and amy will be gone
but then we never really existed
nick loved a girl
i was pretending to be
cool girl
men always use that
as their defining compliment
she a cool girl
cool girl is hot
cool girl is game
cool girl is fun
cool girl never gets angry at her man
she only smiles in a chagrined
loving manner
and then presents her mouth for fucking
she likes what he likes
so evidently he a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga
if he likes girls gone wild
she a mall babe
who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at hooters
when i met nick dunne
i knew he wanted cool girl
and for him ill admit
i was willing to try
i wax-stripped my pussy raw
i drank canned beer
watching adam sand/er movies
i ate cold pizza
and remained a size two
i blew him semi-regularly
i lived in the moment
i was fucking game
i cant say i didnt enjoy some of it
nick teased out of me
things i didnt know existed
a lightness a humor an ease
but i made him smarter sharper
i inspired him to rise to my level
i forged the man of my dreams
we were happy pretending
to be other people
we were the happiest couple we knew
and what the point of being together
if youre not the happiest
but nick got lazy
he became someone
i did not agree to marry
he actually expected me
to love him unconditionally
then he dragged me penniless
to the navel of this great country
and found himself a newer
younger bouncier
cool girl
you think id let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever
no fucking wa y
he doesnt get to win
my cute charming salt-of-the-earth
missouri guy
he needed to learn
grown-ups work for things
grown-ups pay
grown-ups suffer consequences
wait
i need 20 seconds where you
dontjudge me interrupt me
or get angry
okay
is that all the stuff
from the credit cards
where do you store goodies
for anniversary five
wood
woodshed
yeah my woodshed
that fucking bitch
i thought
it all right
i would have too
what that present
i dont know
let find out
dear husband i know you think
youre moving through this world unseen
dont believe that for a second
l know where youve been
and i know where youre going
for this anniversary
ive arranged a trip
follow the river up up up
sit back and relax
because you are done
what up up river
up the river  prison
fucking crazy bitch
that what this is
she framing me for her murder
you married a complete psychopath
the morning of our anniversary
i was gonna ask her for a divorce
i just couldnt do it
i couldnt fake it for another year
another day
then what happened
before i could say anything she said
i need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage
she knew i would go to sawyer beach
so youd have no alibi
she stage-managed me
she knew exactly what i would do
and i fucking did it
i went to the beach
i thought about our marriage
i came back
and decided i wanted a divorce
and by the time you got home
she was gone
you fuck
she good
part of me was relieved
when i thought she was gone
punch and judy puppets
remember he beats judy to death
and kills that baby
so im punch
we already knew that amy
what your point
does missouri have the death penalty
hey neighbor
it been weeks
since i had anyone decent next door
well i dont know how decent i feel
as long as you dont own a python
and blast death metal at 4 am
were gonna be best friends
all right nice meeting you
im greta
im nancy
are you going to the marina
i could use some creamer
im sorry i cant
ive got work to do
all right see you around
you will
come on
show me that darling nicky smile
you asshole
hey
nancy
nancy
it hot again today
so where are you from
let me guess
nebraska
new orleans
you know i am an expert oiler
oh i just bet you are
lotions and balms ointment
i would hate
for yall to get tan lines
so sweet
okay you know where ill be
i see we have the same taste in men
i clipped it on a bathroom cabinet
least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him
let me guess
he trying to watch the big game
and you just wont shut up
no you dont seem
like much of a talker
i got it
you caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one
worse
worse
i went to the bar where he works
to surprise him
and out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar
on the very first night that we met
we walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered
and it was in the air everywhere
a sugar storm
and before he kissed me
he leaned in
and did this
and guess what
what
he did the exact same thing with her
that is the most disgusting thing
i ever heard
thank you
thanks very much
well weve gone mainstream
it an appeals process
so we will attempt to appeal to them
mr bolt tanner bolt
nick dunne
i have been sitting by the phone
my friend
im sorry
do you not believe me
no i believe you it just the
craziest thing ive ever heard
i love it but for you it sucks
but you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point right
are you laughing me out of the building
no
are you kidding me im in
im way in
you came to the right guy
this is what i do nick
this is why i have a $00000 retainer
i win the unwinnable cases
$00000
well figure something out
ill give you a special
my wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance rate
okay
so what the plan
well right now
it a he said she said
she telling a better story
no nick
she is telling the perfect story
so we need to start today
to prepare your defense should we need it
and if we decide to go
with your version of
the truth
then well need to realign
the public perception of amy
make them stop seeing her
as america sweetheart
and see her for what she is
which a mind-fucker of the first degree
now that is a huge realignment
well need other voices besides yours
there has to be someone out there
that she screwed with in the past
there a new york guy
ohara tommy ohara
eight years ago
she pressed charges against him
that should be easy to find
ex-classmate desi collings
she said that he stalked her
he in st louis
you go talk to tommy
and ill draw up the contract
i told you you came to the right guy
apparently
tommy
yeah
thanks for seeing me
yeah yeah yeah
youre gonna want a drink
yeah
so she said you got physical with her
no dude she said i raped her
first degree felony rape
did you do it
did you do it
i was looking at 30 years to life
did you get a trial
fuck no
do i look like
i would do well in the yard
i pled down man
sexual assault one no jail time
that something
oh yeah
ive been unemployed
for the last eight years
because i have to write sexual offender
on every job application
im on a neighborhood watch list
because i have to register as a predator
i havent had a date in almost a decade
because if a girl googles me
could you walk me through what happened
i meet amy at this party you know
we click she perfect
she beautiful
she smart she well-read
she got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper
i think what the catch
a few months it hits me
this is not going to be easy
girls like a fixer-upper but amy
she annexed me
she made me her business
it was just too much
she went out and bought me ties
and we must have gone
20 rounds over that
ties the whole thing just became
so you broke up with her
no i just backed away
gave her some space no big deal right
so i thought
then one night
amy comes over to my place
with a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band i love
and within two minutes
she got my pants around my ankles
and she is kneeling down and
im sorry i know it your wife
you had sex
yeah consensual
it was rough
but she was screaming for it
next morning
there two cops at my door
amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape
ligature marks on her wrist
and my semen
it looks like ive tied amy to my bed
and raped her
me
and then guess what they find
headboards of my bed one on each side
the ties you wouldnt wear
you do know your wife
did you ever see her again
yeah
on tv last week with you
i thought there amy
she graduated from being raped
to being murdered
you been watching this too
last night bombshell
we just found out
amy elliott dunne was indeed
pregnant when she went missing
kelly capitono
this makes me wanna throw up
what is it about a pregnant woman
a woman carrying life inside her
that turns men into animals
ellen this is an epidemic
the third leading cause of death
among pregnant women
is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband
let not forget about the wife ever
tonight we welcome amy best friend
noelle hawthorne
thanks for being on the show noelle
thank you ellen
and let me just say this
amy would have loved you
and all you do for women
oh that nice
why dont you tell us
about your friend noelle
amy was so nurturing
oh id love ifjust once
someone was like
she was a real rag
she was beautiful and smart and kind
seems like a rich bitch to me
what do you mean people love her
i dont know she seems uppity
spoiled rich girl
married a cheating asshole
paid the ultimate price
the only secret was her husband
we never met nick
he never introduced himself
why was that noelle why do you think
i think we know why
because he had a violent temper
a little harsh
that life baby
he knew id have
seen right through him
dont get me wrong
im not saying it okay he killed her
im just saying there are consequences
fuck yeah
she was so alone
and she was so innocent
youre a good friend noelle
and youre a good friend of the show

who has alzheimer in a facility
number of times he visited last year
one
oh fuck
his twin sister margo
well she is a peach
these two spend their days
in the bar amy bought them
playing what lauren playing house
what the fuck
twin siblings often enable and abet
while i never examined nick
or his sister
they both seem very very close
it twin-cest
disturbingly close lauren
and so we close with a question
what kind of moral rot
allows a beautiful talented
kind smart loving mother
to vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries
can i bum a cigarette
amy elliott dunne we care about you
and we will not forget
and you know what else we wont forget
missouri has the death penalty
amen
id like to report
some strange activity
near the woodshed
on the property of one margo dunne
hey
mr dunne
mr collings
i know you
i saw you at the volunteer center
i wanted to help
i hope you dont mind me coming by
i got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife
amy and i believe
in the lost art of letter-writing
i always wondered
why you kept in touch after
everything
you were together for two years
in boarding school right
she was my first serious girlfriend
why did you break up
that a strange question
did you treat her bad
did you cheat on her
that a rude question
let me tell you what amy told me
she dumped you
you completely unraveled
you stalked her you threatened her
and you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized
your wife is missing
and you came all this way to tell me this
i thought there might be
another side to this story
mr collings
fuck
the missing persons case
of amy elliott dunne
she is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the amazing amy kids book series
youre reading that diary again
you know how it ends
it interests me
hey rhonda
he gonna kill me  the end
why did he go to his dad house
to burn it
it private there no one there
why didnt he make sure
it actually burned
because he tripped the alarm
you were up his ass with a flashlight
the whole thing just feels hinky
like finding an envelope marked clue
you ever hear the expression
the simplest answer
is often the correct one
actually ive never
found that to be true
good night
good night
hey
elvis is in missouri
thank god come on in
first thing you have to understand
about amy she loves to teach lessons
play god
yeah old testament god
okay keep talking
she finds out ive been cheating on her
with andie
decides to teach me a lesson
fakes her own death frames me for it
blood in the house credit cards
life insurance
she does the treasure hunt
now the treasure hunt is critical
she taking us on a tour of my
infidelities rubbing my nose in it
and she leaves clue number one
for the police
which will lead them
back to my office
which is a place
where andie and i would often
and she leaves a pair of red panties
right racy looks bad
clue two
my father house
another place where andie and i
would occasionally have relations
clue three
woodshed
also a location
oh my god
we had limited options
a hotel
amy would have seen the credit card bill
put it on andie credit card
andie statement
went right to her parents
nick margo can we head over
to the little brown house
this leads us to what
my dad house
dad house is blue
after the divorce
when dad wasnt coming around
i used to pretend that he was a spy
named mr brown who
for the sake of his children safety
had to deny their existence
you never told me that
you told her that
weve got incriminating red panties
in your office
weve got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed
so what in god name
is at your father house nick
and be honest
i honestly have no idea
whatever they found i think it
safe to assume that it very bad
we got a lot of uncontained issues here
nick do you have any idea
as to what andie mindset is
we havent communicated since the vigil
okay amy parents
no it
more pressure
we got a hurt young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment
no andie wont do that
she will
they always do
dont take it personally
amy got us in an interesting bind
we need to tell the cops about andie
really
right now
andie just gives you another motive
we need to tell the cops
about the woodshed
we need to be on the front end of that
but im gonna warn you
as to what will happen
theyll go after margo
they cant do that can they
she your accomplice
she helped you hide the evidence
in all likelihood
she knows that you killed amy
god
well what are we going to do
we find amy
no any other strategy
is missing the point
ive got two ex-secret service guys
that are really good
ill put them on it
but where do they start nick
where would amy go
i have no idea
are we keeping score
hey
i thought we were steering clear
of men for a while
he nice
because he wants to fuck you
she still moping about her ex
he got cheated on too
we three are the
saddest sacks in all the ozarks
im not sad
im angry
there you go
i almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me
i was gonna kill myself
can you believe that
dont give him the pleasure
i was going to drown myself
in the gulf of mexico
let myself be dinner
for the great whites
gulf is bull sharks miss nawlins
why should i die im not the asshole
please put that on a t-shirt
miss moneybags
i thought you said you were broke
that a fat wad
it mostly singles
singles what are you a stripper
swamp girls or treasure chest
were just teasing
dont they tease people down in nola
we can expect nick dunne arrest
any day now
weve got blood in the house
huge debt an unwanted pregnancy
and we have amy elliott dunne
missing for five days
crying out for justice
well be right back
tanner has a very bad idea
he going to pitch you
yeah
youre doing sharon schieber
tomorrow in st louis
it could go so wrong
and you are going
to tell her about andie
nope
that sounds like a very bad idea
you havent heard from her
in three days
this is a ticking time bomb
youve gotta throw yourself on it
people are gonna hate me
and then they will forgive you
a guy admitting that he a
gigantic asshole on television
people empathize with that
why dont we just put out a statement
they need to see you
sharon specials
they get 0 million viewers
she is a crusader
if she takes you on as a cause
she going to ask real questions
i will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition
what to say what not to say
a trained monkey
a trained monkey
who doesnt get the lethal injection
nick this case
is about what people think of you
they need to like you
now you do this and you will reach
millions of those people
maybe i only need to reach one
hello

and my dad who had
your dad scorched earth

for a while

we got on the wrong track
i had a moment of weakness
your moment was over 5 months
i disrespected my wife
and i disrespected my marriage
and ill always regret it

in the amazing amy disappearance
we go live to that story now
oh my god
you little slut
my name is andie fitzgerald
i met nicholas dunne
when he was my creative writing teacher
at mill valley
why is she dressed like a babysitter
i am deeply ashamed
of having been romantically involved
with a married man
the girl with the giant cum-on-me tits
i truly believed we were in love
now she looks like a fucking mennonite
i know that is no excuse
no it is not
l do not in my heart believe
nick dunne would have killed for me
my prayers go out to everyone
who loves amy
i apologize for the pain
this has caused them
we have loved nick dunne like a son
that love ended today
come on youre staring at ghosts
he met our trust with lie after lie
we now absolutely believe
nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter
our amazing amy
this just got very exciting
we need a moment
were gonna have to bow out of this
nothing has changed
everything has changed
an hour ago we were ahead of this now
i can handle this
were on the defense
this is a completely different dynamic
i can handle it
she going to eat you alive
just trust me
okay
great
mic him
one two three four five
thank you
he shouldnt smile at the makeup artist
yeah no kidding
roll tape five four
three two
seriously i cant believe
how fucking good you were
amy brings out the best in me
doni
keep it together you two
at least for the next 24 hours
people still hate you
women want to scratch your eyes out
andie was really good tv
she a good person
therein lies the problem
ride this out
and when sharon airs tomorrow
well be looking at a whole new you
but until then
dont show your face
no problem

roku
internet obviously
here is a supposedly grown man
if there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you cant find it
just let me know
and i will get it for you
instead of the a-b-c
he taught her the birds and the bees
and just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this
wine cellar downstairs
ill get you some clothes too
not that i dont appreciate
bait shop chic
the floors are heated
just dial to your liking
there robes and towels
the shower has steam
the bathtub has a massage cycle
there a great view
if youre in the mood
blackout curtains if youre not
the bed is savoir
youll never get a better sleep
this is just what i need
im so exhausted
not that i dont appreciate
bait shop chic
amy i am so happy that you are here
and i dont want you to worry
for one moment
there are cameras everywhere
the exterior all along the grounds
the entryway
anyone
who is caught coming or going
will be recorded
you are more than safe
and i am not letting you get away again
good morning
dont do that
im sorry
i need to feel safe
you are very safe
what have you been up to
nothing
amy im not nick

i know just what that feels like
you were never under my thumb
on your leash
never
a new start

hair dye makeup tweezers
there a gym overlooking the lake
the sooner you look like yourself
the sooner youll feel like yourself
ill get groceries for tonight well watch
sharon schieber and finally move on
i think that something
i should watch on my own
nonsense
ill be back
and i am looking forward
to my reunion with amy elliott
great
good evening im sharon schieber
tonight exclusively
h u rry u p
a husband breaks his silence
not just on his wife disappearance
but on his infidelity
and all those shocking rumors
nick dunne
youre probably the most hated man
in america right now
i probably am
and i probably deserve it
i bought that tie
did you kill your wife nick
i did not kill my wife
i am not a murderer
but you were unfaithful
i was unfaithful
and i am deeply ashamed
and on top of that
you allowed amy parents
her friends
all the people in your hometown
believe you were a loving husband
desperate to find his missing wife
well i am desperate
to find my missing wife
you say that but im wondering
how you expect us to believe you
now that we know youre a liar
i didnt come fon/vard with my affair
because i knew it would make me look
really really bad
but i dont care about that anymore
i just want to find my wife
im just trying to get clear
let me be clear
just because i am not a murderer
doesnt make me a good guy
im not a good guy
i was a bad husband to a great wife
i broke the vow that i made to her
those are pretty words nick
but what does that really mean to you
it basically means
that i was a con artist
i met amy elliott seven years ago
i was completely transfixed
amy can do that to you
i was this average guy
from an average place
with mediocre aspirations
and i met a woman who dazzled me
and i wanted her to love me
so i pretended to be better than i was
when we got married
i promised to be that guy
that guy who works harder
that guy who who lives and acts
and loves with as much passion
as she does
but i failed her
instead of doing what was right
i did what was easy
you talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife
who believes his wife is still alive
she is still alive
will you look at that camera for me
will you look in the lens
and talk to your wife
if she is out there
able to hear and see you tonight
what would you like to say to her nick
amy i love you
youre the best person ive ever known
and ive taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that ive treated you
and if you come back i promise
i will spend every day
making it up to you
i will be the man
that i promised you i would be
i love you
come home
here
regardless of what you thought
what does it say
l think we can all agree
oh my god you fucking killed it
there more to him
than meets the eye
theyre going crazy for you
they disliked me they liked me
they hated me
and now they love me
a candor and an honesty
that worthy of respect
he certainly earned mine
what is it
im sharon schieber good night
margo dunne this is a search warrant
for your property
i usually ignore tipline calls
but a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed
call tanner
okay fuck
girlfriend real cute nick
is that what this is about
i have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation
i gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over
every time you said something stupid
i thought maybe he just stupid
but i was wrong
that what this is about
are these the clubs
you dont play golf with
none of that is mine
none of this was put here by me
those are nice clubs
you got the makings of a real man cave
everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good
nick
you cant do that
of course we can
amy it time to move on
what can i do to help
i need some time to think
that the last thing you need
desi
twenty years
you have kept me dangling
finally last night you came to me
and you chose me
follow that instinct
dont trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless
sleeping in your car
fearing for your life
im not gonna force myself on you
i understand what youre saying desi
i do
ive been so mistreated for so long
ive forgotten how to behave
ill move in here tomorrow
and well work it out together
i just want you to be you again
they only took margo to fuck with you
she not spending
another fucking second in there
im gonna go in
and im gonna tell them everything
what
we tell boney very little
without a body
without a murder weapon
their only hope is a confession
so you let them do all the talking
that way
we can jump-start your defense
the truth is my defense
recognize these
yes
it amy anniversary present to me
was that how she told you
she was pregnant nick
mommy daddy baby
and that made you real mad
no
recognize this
never seen that before in my life
it amy diary
we found this at your father house
is this your wife handwriting
he not a handwriting ex
looks like it
our experts thought so too
do you wanna
play a little true or false
sure
and then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me
yeah that true
you thought quinoa was a fish
that is also true yes
she wanted to get pregnant
you assaulted her
i hit her no never happened
pushed it says pushed
absolutely not
i never touched her
she tried to buy a gun
i doubt that but i dont know
shall i read the last entry
sure
this man may kill me
in her own words
this man may kill me
it kind of a convenient end note
for future reference
the truth
you are not a handwriting expert
okay i know
judy missing handle
big as a two-by-four right
big as a club
we found this day one
in the fireplace in your home office
we didnt know what the hell it was
but fire in july
we bagged it
ive never seen that before either
we just tested it
fire doesnt erase blood nick
so finally nicholas dunne
youre under arrest
for the murder of your wife
do not say another word
what about my side
nick
more coffee
id love it
remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the cape
god yeah lobster right from the ocean
this reminds me of that
never-ending holiday
youre not bored
desi how could i be bored
you can discuss
8th-century symphonies
9th-century impressionists
quote proust in french
nick idea of culture
was a reality tv marathon
with one hand down his boxers
i really have to get going
but i will be back

now that i know
you didnt murder your wife yes
what do you think
kidnapping the story insane
she on fairly heavy painkillers

ms dunne i know
what youve been through
so well keep this very brief
can you walk us through what happened
that morning the doorbell rang
so normal
i opened the door
so strange
since high school
he wont ever go away
and ive just tried to be nice to him
answer his letters
keep him calm
oh my god
ive encouraged him
you cant blame yourself
he pushed inside
and he grabbed me
but i got away and ran to the kitchen
and he clubbed me
icoflapsed
that club was actually the handle
to a punch and judy puppet
right
treasure hunt
id hidden some puppets at go
then how did desi have that handle
id just found it
it must have fallen off
i was holding it when desi pushed in
so he got it from me
about that woodshed
he took me to his lake house
tied me to his bed
back to the woodshed real quick
real quick
when you went
to place the puppets there
did you notice that it was packed
lots of stuff
corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband name
nick and credit cards
he buys i nag i dont know probably
he hid a lot of stuff at go
theyre very close
now may i go back
to where i was being held prisoner
by a man with a history
of mental problems
please continue ms dunne
desi assaulted me that night
every night
he tied me up like a dog
and then hed punish me
starve me
shave me
sodomize me
there were cameras everywhere
please find this please find the tapes
she slit his throat with a box cutter
how did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter
if he had her tied up the whole time
cant you just be happy
your wife is home and safe
amy we found your diary
it contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse
well it the ugly truth
nick didnt want a baby
he has a temper we had money problems
but i love him
then why did you try to buy a gun
im sorry i feel myself fading
if i could just clarify one thing
if this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands
my husband would be on death row
and id be tied still spread-eagle
ms dunne youve been very brave
were finished
now i have to ask you
do you feel safe
going home with your husband
we prayed to god
and god has answered our prayers
amy dunne is home

a lot of questions and concerns
but for right now we wanna sit tight
and just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the mississippi
excuse me excuse us folks
we love you amy

you killed a guy
you slashed his throat
with a box cutter
you went on national television
and begged for me to save your life
and i obliged

shampoo
wounded raped wife battles her way

and when this spoiled rich
entitled little boy couldnt have her

when two people love each other
and cant make that work

is america sweetheart
she told me she killed desi
not self-defense murder

and stand in the shower
i swear you two are the most
fucked-up people ive ever known

you should pitch that
as reality television
