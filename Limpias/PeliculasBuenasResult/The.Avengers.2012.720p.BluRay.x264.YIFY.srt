
the tesseract has awakened
it is on a little world
a human world
they would wield its power
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will
he is ready to lead
and our force
our chitauri
will follow
a world will be his
the universe yours
and the humans
what can they do
but burn
all personnel
the evacuation order has been confirmed
proceed your dedicated vehicle
for faster evacuation
is not a drill
emergency personnel
proceed your dedicated
vehicle for faster evacuation
how bad is it
that the problem sir
we dont know
dr selvig read an energy surge
from the tesseract four hours ago
nasa didnt authorize selvig
to go to test phase
he wasnt testing it
he wasnt even in the room
spontaneous event
it just turned itself on
where are the energy levels now
climbing when selvig couldnt shut it down
we ordered evac
how long to get everyone out
campus should be clear
in the next half-hour
do better
sir evacuation may be futile
we should tell them to go back to sleep
if we cant control the tesseract energy
there may not be a minimum safe distance
i need you to make sure the phase 2
prototypes are shipped out
sir is that really a priority right now
until such time as the world ends
we will act as though it intends to spin on
clear out the tech below
every piece of phase 2
on a truck and gone
yes sir
with me
talk to me doctor
director
is there anything we know for certain
the tesseract is misbehaving
is that supposed to be funny
no it not funny at all
the tesseract is not only active she
behaving
i assume you pulled the plug
she an energy source
we turn off the power
she turns it back on
if she reaches peak level
we prepared for this doctor
harnessing energy from space
but we dont have the harness
my calculations are far from complete
and she throwing off
interference radiation
nothing harmful
low levels of gamma radiation
that can be harmful
where agent barton
the hawk
up in his nest as usual
agent barton report
i gave you this detail
so you could keep
a close eye on things
well i see better from a distance
have you seen anything
that might set this thing off
doctor it spiking again
no one come or gone
and selvig clean
no contacts no ims
if there was any tampering
sir it wasnt at this end
at this end
yeah the cube is a doorway
to the other end of space right
doors open from both sides
not yet
sir please put down the spear
you have heart
please dont
i still need that
this doesnt have to get any messier
of course it does
ive come too far for anything else
i am loki
of asgard
and i am burdened
with glorious purpose
loki
brother of thor
we have no quarrel with your people
an ant has no quarrel with a boot
are you planning to step on us
i come with glad tidings
of a world made free
free from what
freedom
freedom is life great lie
once you accept that
in your heart
you will know peace
yeah you say peace
i kind of think you mean the other thing
sir director fury is stalling
this place is about to blow
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us
he means to bury us
like the pharaohs of old
he right
the portal is collapsing in on itself
weve got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical
well then
i need these vehicles
who that
they didnt tell me
hill
do you copy
barton has turned
they have the tesseract
shut them down
let go no no no leave it
leave it go
were clear upstairs sir
you need to go
director
director fury do you copy
the tesseract is with a hostile force
i have men down
hill
a lot of men still under
i dont know how many survivors
sound a general call
i want every living soul
not working rescue
looking for that briefcase
roger that
coulson get back to base
this is a level seven
as of right now
we are at war
what do we do
this is not how
i wanted this evening to go
i know how you wanted this evening to go
believe me this is better
who are you working for
lermentov yes
does he think
we have to go through him
to move our cargo
i thought general solohob
is in charge of the export business
solohob
a bagman a front
your outdated information betrays you
the famous black widow
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face
you really think im pretty
tell lermentov we dont need him
to move the tanks
tell him he is out
well
you may have to write it down
it for her
you listen carefully
youre at -4 silensky plaza 3rd floor
we have an f-22 exactly eight miles out
put the woman on the phone
or i will blow up the block
before you can make the lobby
we need you to come in
are you kidding im working
this takes precedence
im in the middle of an interrogation
this moron is giving me everything
i dont give everything
look you cant pull me
out of this right now
natasha
barton been compromised
let me put you on hold
where is barton now
we dont know
but he alive
we think so
ill brief you on everything
when you get back
but first we need you
to talk to the big guy
coulson you know that stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me
ive got stark
you get the big guy
who are you
get out
there is sickness here
youre a doctor
my father did not wake up
he has a fever
and he moaning
but his eyes wont open
he has a big fever
slow down
my father
like them
please
you shouldve got paid up front banner
you know for a man who supposed
to be avoiding stress
you picked a hell of a place to settle
avoiding stress isnt the secret
then what is it
yoga
you brought me to the edge of the city
smart
i assume the whole place is surrounded
just you and me
and your actress buddy
is she a spy too
they start that young
i did
who are you
natasha romanoff
are you here to kill me ms romanoff
because that not going
to work out for everyone
no of course not
im here on behalf of shield
shield
how did they find me
we never lost you doctor
weve kept our distance
even helped keep some other
interested parties off your scent
why
nick fury seems to trust you
but now we need you to come in
what if i say no
ill persuade you
and what if
the other guy says no
youve been more than
a year without an incident
i dont think you want
to break that streak
well i dont every time get what i want
doctor were facing a potential
global catastrophe
well those i actively try to avoid
this
is the tesseract
it has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet
what does fury want me
to do swallow it
he wants you to find it
it been taken
it emits a gamma signature
that too weak for us to trace
there no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do
if there was
that where id be
so fury isnt after the monster
not that he told me
and he tells you everything
talk to fury
he needs you on this
he needs me in a cage
no one going to put you in a
stop lying to me
im sorry
that was mean
i just wanted to see what youd do
why dont we
do this the easy way
where you dont use that
and the other guy
doesnt make a mess
ok
natasha
stand down
were good here
just you and me
this is out of line director
youre dealing with forces
you cant control
you ever been in a war councilman
in a firefight
did you feel an overabundance of control
youre saying that this asgard
is declaring war on our planet
not asgard
loki
he cant be working alone
what about the other one
his brother
our intelligence says
thor is not a hostile
but he worlds away
we cant depend on him to help either
it up to us
which is why you should be
focusing on phase 2
it was designed for exactly this
phase 2 isnt ready
our enemy is
we need a response team
the avengers initiative
was shut down
this isnt about the avengers
weve seen the list
youre running the world greatest
covert security network
and youre going to leave
the fate of the human race
to a handful of freaks
im not leaving anything to anyone
we need a response team
these people may be isolated
unbalanced even
but i believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need
you believe
war isnt won by sentiment director
no it won by soldiers
there not enough time
i got to put her in the water
you wont be alone
oh my god
this guy is still alive
trouble sleeping
i slept for 70 years sir
i think ive had my fill
then you should be out
celebrating
seeing the world
when i went under
the world was at war
i wake up they say we won
they didnt say what we lost
weve made some
mistakes along the way
some very recently
are you here with a mission sir
i am
trying to get me back in the world
trying to save it
hydra secret weapon
howard stark fished that out of
the ocean when he was looking for you
he thought what we think
the tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy
that something the world sorely needs
who took it from you
he called loki
he not from around here
there a lot well have to bring you up
to speed on if youre in
the world has gotten even stranger
than you already know
at this point i doubt anything
would surprise me
ten bucks says youre wrong
there a debriefing packet waiting
for you back at your apartment
is there anything you can tell us about
the tesseract that we ought to know now
you should have left it in the ocean
good to go on this end
the rest is up to you
you disconnected
the transmission lines
are we off the grid
stark tower is about to become a beacon
of self-sustaining clean energy
well assuming the arc reactor takes
over and it actually works
i assume
light her up
how does it look
like christmas but with more me
weve got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign
you need to do some press
im in dc tomorrow
im working on the zoning
for the next three buildings
pepper youre killing me
the moment remember
enjoy the moment
get in here and i will
sir agent coulson of
shield is on the line
im not in
im actually out
sir im afraid he insisting
grow aspine jarvis
i got a date
levels are holding steady
i think
of course they are
i was directly involved
which brings me to my next question
how does it feel to be a genius
well i really wouldnt know now would i
what do you mean all this
came from you
no all this came from that
give yourself some credit
please
stark tower is your baby
give yourself 2% of the credit
2%
an argument can be made for 5
2% for my baby
well i
did do all the heavy lifting
literally i lifted the heavy things
and sorry but the security snafu
that was on you
my private elevator
you mean our elevator
it was teeming with sweaty workmen
im going to pay for that
comment about percentages
in some subtle way later arent i
it not going to be that subtle
ill tell you what
the next building is gonna say
potts on the tower
on the lease
call your mom can you bunk over
sir the telephone
im afraid my protocols
are being overridden
mr stark we need to talk
you have reached the life
model decoy of tony stark
please leave a message
this is urgent
then leave it urgently
security breach
it on you
mr stark
phil come in
phil
i cant stay
his first name is agent
come on in
were celebrating
which is why he cant stay
we need you to look this over
as soon as possible
i dont like being handed things
that fine because i love
to be handed things
so let trade
thank you
official consulting hours are between
8 and 5 every other thursday
this isnt a consultation
is this about the avengers
which i know nothing about
the avengers initiative was scrapped
i thought and i didnt even qualify
i didnt know that either
yeah apparently im volatile
self-obsessed
dont play well with others
that i did know
this isnt about personality
profiles anymore
whatever ms potts got a second
half a moment
you know i thought we were
having a moment
i was having 2% of a moment
this seems serious
phil pretty shaken
how would you know if it
why is he phil
what is all this
this is
this
im going to take the jet to dc tonight
tomorrow
you have homework
you have a lot of homework
well what if i didnt
if you didnt
yeah
you mean when youve finished
well
then
square deal fly safe
work hard
so any chance
youre driving by laguardia
i can drop you
fantastic
i want to hear about the cellist
is that still a thing
she moved back to portland
what
were about 40 minutes
out from home base sir
so this dr banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me
a lot of people were
you were the world first superhero
banner thought gamma radiation might hold
the key to unlocking erskine original formula
didnt really go his way did it
not so much
when he not that thing though
the guy like a stephen hawking
he like a smart person
i got to say
it an honor to meet you
officially
ive sort of met you i mean
i watched you while
you were sleeping
i mean i was i was present
while you were unconscious
from the ice
you know it really just a
just a huge honor
to have you on board
this
i hope im the man for the job
oh you are
absolutely
we made some modifications
to the uniform
i had a little design input
the uniform
arent the stars and stripes a little
old-fashioned
with everything that happening
and the things that are about
to come to light
people might just
need a little old-fashioned
the chitauri grow restless
let them gird themselves
i will lead them in the glorious battle
battle
against the meager might of earth
glorious not lengthy
if your force is
as formidable as you claim
you question us
you question him
he who put the scepter in your hand
who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose
when you were cast out defeated
i was a king
the rightful king of asgard
betrayed
your ambition is little
and born of childish need
we look beyond the earth to the greater
worlds the tesseract will unveil
you dont have the tesseract yet
i dont threaten
but until i open the doors
until your force is mine to command
you are but words
you will have your war asgardian
if you fail
if the tesseract is kept from us
there will be no realm
no barren moon
no crevice where he cannot find you
you think you know pain
he will make you long
for something sweet as pain
stow the captain gear
yes sir
agent romanoff
captain rogers
maam
hi
they need you on the bridge
theyre starting the face-trace
see you there
it was quite the buzz around here
finding you in the ice
i thought coulson was gonna swoon
did he ask you to sign
his captain america trading cards yet
trading cards
theyre vintage
he very proud
dr banner
yeah hi
they told me you would be coming
word is you can find the cube
is that the only word on me
only word i care about
it must be strange for you all of this
well this is actually kind of familiar
gentlemen you might want
to step inside in a minute
it going to get a little hard to breathe
flight crew secure the deck
is this a submarine
really
they want me in a submerged
pressurized metal container
no no this is much worse
hover power check complete
position cyclic
increase collective to 8%
preparing for maximum
performance takeoff
increase output to capacity
power plant performing at capacity
we are clear
all engines operating
shield emergency
protocol 936 in effect
we are at level sir
good
let vanish
engage retro-reflection panels
reflection panels engaged
gentlemen
doctor thank you for coming
thanks for asking nicely
so how long am i staying
once we get our hands
on the tesseract
youre in the wind
where are you with that
were sweeping every wirelessly
accessible camera on the planet
cell phones laptops
if it connected to a satellite
it eyes and ears for us
that still not gonna find them in time
you have to narrow your field
how many spectrometers
do you have access to
how many are there
call every lab you know
tell them to put the spectrometers on
the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays
ill rough out a tracking algorithm
basic cluster recognition
at least we could rule out a few places
do you have somewhere
for me to work
agent romanoff
could you show dr banner
to his laboratory please
youre gonna love it doc
we got all the toys
put it over there
where did you find all these people
shield has no shortage
of enemies doctor
is this the stuff you need
yeah iridium
it found in meteorites
it forms anti-protons
it very hard to get hold of
especially if shield
knows you need it
well i didnt know
hey
the tesseract has shown me
so much it
more than knowledge it truth
i know
what did it show you agent barton
my next target
tell me what you need
i need a distraction
and an eyeball
i mean if it not too much trouble
no no it fine
it a vintage set
it took me a couple of years
to collect them all
near mint
slight foxing around the edges but
we got a hit a 67% match
wait
cross match 79%
location
stuttgart germany
28 königstrasse
he not exactly hiding
captain
youre up
kneel before me
i said
kneel
is not this simpler
is this not your natural state
it the unspoken truth of humanity
that you crave subjugation
the bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life joy
in a mad scramble for power
for identity
you were made
to be ruled
in the end
you will always kneel
not to men like you
there are no men like me
there are always men like you
look to your elder people
let him be an example
you know the last time
i was in germany
and saw a man standing
above everybody else
we ended up disagreeing
the soldier
the man out of time
im not the one who out of time
loki drop the weapon
and stand down
kneel
not today
the guy all over the place
agent romanoff
you miss me
make your move
reindeer games
good move
mr stark
captain
is he saying anything
not a word
just get him here
were low on time
i dont like it
what rock of ages
giving up so easily
i dont remember it being that easy
this guy packs a wallop
still you are pretty spry
for an older fellow
what your thing pilates
what
it like calisthenics
you might have missed
a couple of things you know
doing time as a capsicle
fury didnt tell me
he was calling you in
yeah there is a lot of things fury
doesnt tell you
where this coming from
what the matter
are you scared of a little lightning
im not overly fond of what follows
what are you doing
and now there is that guy
another asgardian
that guy a friendly
doesnt matter
if he frees loki or kills him
the tesseract lost
stark we need a plan of attack
i have a plan attack
id sit this one out cap
i dont see how i can
these guys come from legend
theyre basically gods
there only one god maam
and im pretty sure
he doesnt dress like that
where is the tesseract
i missed you too
do i look to be in a gaming mood
you should thank me
with the bifrost gone
how much dark energy
did the allfather have
to muster to conjure you here
to your precious earth
i thought you dead
did you mourn
we all did
our father
your father
he did tell you my true parentage
did he not
we were raised together
we played together
we fought together
do you remember none of that
i remember a shadow
living in the shade of your greatness
i remember you tossing me
into an abyss
i was and should be king
so you take the world
i love as a recompense
for your imagined slights
no
the earth is under my protection loki
and youre doing
a marvelous job with that
the humans slaughter each other
in droves while you idly fret
i mean to rule them
as why should i not
you think yourself above them
well yes
then you miss the truth
of ruling brother
a throne would suit you ill
ive seen worlds
youve never known about
i have grown
odinson in my exile
i have seen the true power
of the tesseract
and when i wield it
who showed you this power
who controls the would-be king
i am a king
not here
you give up the tesseract
you give up this poisonous dream
come home
i dont have it
you need the cube to bring me home
but ive sent it off i know not where
listen well brother
im listening
do not touch me again
then dont take my stuff
you have no idea
what youre dealing with
shakespeare in the park
doth mother know
you weareth her drapes
this is beyond you metal man
loki will face asgardian justice
he gives up the cube
he all yours
until then
stay out of the way
tourist
ok
power at 400% capacity
how about that
hey
that enough
now i dont know
what you plan on doing here
ive come here to put an end
to loki schemes
then prove it
put that hammer down
yeah no
bad call he loves his
you want me to put the hammer down
are we done here
in case it unclear
if you try to escape
if you so much as scratch that glass
it 30000 feet straight down
in a steel trap
you get how that works
ant boot
it an impressive cage
not built i think for me
built for something
a lot stronger than you
oh ive heard
a mindless beast
makes play he still a man
how desperate are you
that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you
how desperate am i
you threaten my world with war
you steal a force
you cant hope to control
you talk about peace
and you kill because it fun
you have made me very desperate
you might not be glad that you did
it burns you to have come so close
to have the tesseract
to have power
unlimited power
and for what
a warm light for all mankind to share
and then to be reminded
what real power is
well let me know if real power
wants a magazine or something
he really grows on you doesnt he
loki gonna drag this out
so
thor what his play
he has an army called the chitauri
theyre not of asgard
nor any world known
he means to lead them
against your people
they will win him the earth
in return i suspect for the tesseract
an army
from outer space
so he building another portal
that what he needs erik selvig for
selvig
he an astrophysicist
he a friend
loki has him under some kind of spell
along with one of ours
i want to know why loki let us take him
he not leading an army from here
i dont think we should be
focusing on loki
that guy brain is a bag full of cats
you could smell crazy on him
have care how you speak
loki is beyond reason
but he is of asgard
and he is my brother
he killed 80 people in two days
he adopted
i think it about the mechanics
iridium what do they need
the iridium for
it a stabilizing agent
im just saying pick a weekend
ill fly you to portland
keep love alive
it means the portal
wont collapse on itself
like it did at shield
no hard feelings point break
youve got a mean swing
also it means the portal
can open as wide
and stay open as long
as loki wants
raise the mizzenmast
jib the topsails
that man is playing galaga
he thought we wouldnt notice
but we did
how does fury even see these
he turns
sounds exhausting
the rest of the raw materials
agent barton can get his hands
on pretty easily
the only major component
he still needs is a power source
of high-energy density
something
to kick-start the cube
when did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics
last night
the packet selvig notes
the extraction theory papers
am i the only one who did the reading
does loki need any particular
kind of power source
he would have to heat the cube
to 20-million kelvin
just to break through
the coulomb barrier
unless selvig has figured out
how to stabilize
the quantum tunneling effect
well if he could do that
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet
finally someone who speaks english
is that what just happened
it good to meet you dr banner
your work on anti electron
collisions is unparalleled
and im a huge fan of the way
you lose control
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster
thanks
dr banner is only here
to track the cube
i was hoping you might join him
i would start with that stick of his
it may be magical but it works
an awful lot like a hydra weapon
i dont know about that
but it is powered by the cube
and i would like to know
how loki used it
to turn two of the sharpest men i know
into his personal flying monkeys
monkeys
i do not understand
i do
i understood that reference
shall we play doctor
this way sir
the gamma readings
are definitely consistent
with selvig reports of the tesseract
but it going
to take weeks to process
if we bypass their mainframe
and direct route to the homer cluster
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops
all i packed was a toothbrush
you know you should come by
stark tower sometime
top ten floors all r&d
youd love it it candy land
thanks but the last time
i was in new york i
kind of broke
harlem
well i promise
a stress-free environment
no tension no surprises
hey
nothing
are you nuts
jury out
you really have got a lid on it
havent you
what your secret
mellow jazz
bongo drums huge bag of weed
is everything a joke to you
funny things are
threatening the safety of everyone
on this ship isnt funny
no offense doc
it alright
i wouldnt have come aboard
if i couldnt handle
pointy things
youre tip-toeing big man
you need to strut
and you need to focus
on the problem mr stark
do you think im not
why did fury call us in
why now why not before
what isnt he telling us
i cant do the equation unless
i have all the variables
you think fury hiding something
he a spy
captain he the spy
his secrets have secrets
it bugging him too
isnt it
i just want to finish my work here and
doctor
a warm light for all mankind
loki jab at fury about the cube
i heard it
well i think that was meant for you
even if barton didnt tell loki
about the tower
it was still all over the news
the stark tower
that big ugly
building in new york
it powered by an arc reactor
a self-sustaining energy source
that building will run itself for
what a year
it just the prototype
im kind of the only name
in clean energy right now
that what he getting at
so why didnt shield bring
him in on the tesseract project
what are they doing in the energy
business in the first place
i should probably look into that
once my decryption program
finishes breaking into
all of shield secure files
im sorry did you say
jarvis has been running it
since i hit the bridge
in a few hours ill know every dirty
secret shield has ever tried to hide
blueberry
yet youre confused about why
they didnt want you around
an intelligence organization
that fears intelligence
historically not awesome
i think loki trying to wind us up
this is a man who means to start a war
and if we dont stay focused
hell succeed
we have orders
we should follow them
following not really my style
and youre all about style arent you
of the people in this room
which one is a wearing a spangly outfit
and b not of use
steve tell me none of this smells
a little funky to you
just find the cube
that the guy my dad
never shut up about
im wondering if they shouldnt have
kept him on ice
the guy not wrong about loki
he does have the jump on us
what he got is an acme dynamite kit
it going to blow up in his face
and im going to be there when it does
yeah ill read all about it
or youll be suiting up
with the rest of us
you see
i dont get a suit of armor
im exposed
like a nerve
it a nightmare
you know ive got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second
to crawl its way into my heart
this stops it
this little circle of light
it part of me now
not just armor
it a terrible privilege
but you can control it
because i learned how
it different
hey
i read all about your accident
that much gamma exposure
should have killed you
so youre saying that the hulk
the other guy saved my life
that nice
it a nice sentiment
saved it for
what
i guess well find out
you may not enjoy that
and you just might
as soon as loki took the doctor
we moved jane foster
theyve got an excellent
observatory in tromsø
she was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday
handsome fee private plane
very remote
shell be safe
thank you
it no accident
loki taking erik selvig
i dread what he plans
for him once he done
erik is a good man
he talks about you a lot
you changed his life
you changed everything around here
they were better as they were
we pretend on asgard that were
more advanced but we
we come here battling like bilge snipe
like what
bilge snipe
you know huge scaly big antlers
you dont have those
i dont think so
well they are repulsive
and they trample everything
in their path
when i first came to earth
loki rage followed me here
and your people paid the price
and now again
in my youth i courted war
war hasnt started yet
you think you could make loki tell us
where the tesseract is
i do not know
loki mind is far afield
it not just power he craves
it vengeance upon me
there no pain would praise
his need from him
a lot of guys think that
until the pain starts
what are you asking me to do
im asking
what are you prepared to do
loki is a prisoner
then why do i feel like he the only person
on this boat that wants to be here
there not many people
who can sneak up on me
but you figured id come
after
after whatever tortures fury can concoct
you would appear as a friend
as a balm
and i would cooperate
i want to know what youve done
to agent barton
i would say ive expanded his mind
and once youve won
once youre king of the mountain
what happens to his mind
is this love agent romanoff
love is for children
i owe him a debt
tell me
before i worked for shield i have
well
i made a name for myself
i have a very specific skill set
i didnt care who i used it for
or on
i got on shield radar
in a bad way
agent barton was sent to kill me
he made a different call
and what will you do if
i vow to spare him
not let you out
no but i like this
your world in the balance
and you bargain for one man
regimes fall every day
i tend not to weep over that
im russian
or i was
and what are you now
it really not that complicated
i got red in my ledger
id like to wipe it out
can you
can you wipe out that much red
dreykov daughter
são paulo
the hospital fire
barton told me everything
your ledger is dripping
it gushing red
and you think saving a man no more virtuous
than yourself will change anything
this is the basest sentimentality
this is a child at prayer
pathetic
you lie and kill
in the service of liars and killers
you pretend to be separate
to have your own code
something that makes up
for the horrors
but they are part of you
and they will never go away
i wont touch barton
not until i make him kill you
slowly intimately
in every way he knows you fear
and then hell wake just long
enough to see his good work
and when he screams
ill split his skull
this is my bargain
you mewling quim
youre a monster
oh no
you brought the monster
so banner
that your play
what
loki means to unleash the hulk
keep banner in the lab
im on my way
send thor as well
thank you
for your cooperation
what are you doing mr stark
kind of been wondering
the same thing about you
youre supposed to be
locating the tesseract
we are
the model locked
and were sweeping
for the signature now
when we get a hit
well have the location
within half a mile
yeah then you get your cube back
no muss no fuss
what is phase 2
phase 2 is shield uses
the cube to make weapons
sorry computer was moving
a little slow for me
rogers we gathered everything
related to the tesseract
this does not mean that were making
im sorry nick
what were you lying
i was wrong director
the world hasnt changed a bit
did you know about this
you want to think about
removing yourself
from this environment doctor
i was in calcutta
i was pretty well removed
loki is manipulating you
and youve been doing what exactly
you didnt come here because
i bat my eyelashes at you
yes and im not leaving
because suddenly you get a little twitchy
id like to know why shield
is using the tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction
because of him
me
last year earth had
a visitor from another planet
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town
we learned that not only
are we not alone
but we are hopelessly
hilariously outgunned
my people want nothing
but peace with your planet
but youre not the only people
out there are you
and youre not the only threat
the world filling up with people
who cant be matched
that cant be controlled
like you controlled the cube
your work with the tesseract
is what drew loki to it
and his allies
it is a signal to all the realms that the earth
is ready for a higher form of war
a higher form
you forced our hand
we had to come up with something
a nuclear deterrent
because that always calms
everything right down
remind me again how
you made your fortune stark
im sure if he still made weapons
stark would be neck-deep
wait wait hold on
how is this now about me
im sorry isnt everything
i thought humans
were more evolved than this
excuse me did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up
you treat your champions
with such mistrust
are you boys really that naive
shield monitors potential threats
captain america on threat watch
we all are
wait youre on that list
are you above or below angry bees
stark so help me god
if you make one more wisecrack
threat verbal threat
i feel threatened
show some respect
respect what
transport six-six-bravo
please relay confirm codes
ive got you on the computer
but not on the day log
what is your haul
over
arms and ammunition
over
you speak of control
yet you court chaos
that his mo isnt it
i mean what are we a team
no no no were a chemical mixture
that makes chaos
were were a time bomb
you need to step away
why shouldnt
the guy let off a little steam
you know damn well why
back off
im starting to want you to make me
yeah
big man in a suit of armor
take that off what are you
genius billionaire playboy
philanthropist
i know guys with none
of that worth ten of you
ive seen the footage
the only thing you really fight
for is yourself
youre not the guy to make
the sacrifice play
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you
i think i would just cut the wire
always a way out
you know you may not be a threat
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero
a hero
like you
youre a laboratory
experiment rogers
everything special about you
came out of a bottle
put on the suit
let go a few rounds
you people are so petty
and tiny
yeah this is a team
agent romanoff would you escort
dr banner back to his
where
you rented my room
the cell was just in case
in case you needed to kill me
but you cant
i know i tried
i got low
i didnt see an end
so i put a bullet in my mouth
and the other guy spit it out
so i moved on
i focused on helping other people
i was good
until you dragged me back
into this freak show
and put everyone here at risk
you want to know my secret
agent romanoff
you want to know how i stay calm
dr banner
put down the scepter
got it
sorry kids you dont get to see
my party trick after all
you located the tesseract
i could get there fastest
the tesseract belongs on asgard
no human is a match for it
youre not going alone
youre gonna stop me
put on the suit let find out
im not afraid to hit an old man
put on the suit
oh my god
put on the suit
yeah
all hands to stations
hill
external detonation
number three engine is down
can they get it running
talk to me

but it impossible to get out there
to make repairs while were in the air
if we lose one more engine
we wont be
somebody got to get outside
and patch that engine
stark you copy that
im on it

then put it on the left
get us over water
one more turbine goes down
and we drop
stark
stark im here
good
let see what weve got
i got to get this superconducting
coolant system back online
before i can access the rotors
work on dislodging the debris
i need you to get to that
engine control panel
and tell me which relays
are in overload position
what does it look like in there
it seems to run on some form
of electricity
well youre not wrong
we are not your enemies banner
try to think
ok the relays are intact
what our next move
even if i clear the rotors
this thing wont re-engage
without a jump
im going to have to get in there and push
if that thing gets up to speed
youll get shredded
that stator control unit
can reverse the polarity
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could
speak english
you see that red lever
it will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out
stand by it
wait for my word
we need full evac
on the lower hangar bay
grenade
weve got a perimeter breach
hostiles are in shield gear
call-outs at every junction
we have the hulk and thor
on research level 4
levels 2 and 3 are dark
sir the hulk will tear this place apart
get his attention
escort 6-0 proceed to wishbone
and engage hostile
dont get too close
copy
target acquired
target engaged
target angry target angry
theyre not getting through
here so what the hell
engine one is now in shut-down
we are in an uncontrolled descent
sir weve lost all power
in engine one
it barton
he took out our systems
he headed for the detention level
does anybody copy
this is agent romanoff
i copy
stark were losing altitude
yeah i noticed
no
are you ever not going
to fall for that
the humans think us immortal
should we test that
move away please
you like this
we started working on the prototype
after you sent the destroyer
even i dont know what it does
do you want to find out
no
natasha
youre going to lose
am i
it in your nature
your heroes are scattered
your floating fortress falls from the sky
where is my disadvantage
you lack conviction
i dont think im
so that what it does
all hands to crash
stations immediately
cap hit the lever
i need a minute here
lever
now
help
sorry boss
the god rabbited
just stay awake
eyes on me
no im clocking out here
not an option
it ok boss
this was never gonna work
if they didnt have something
to
agent coulson is down
a medical team is on
its way to your location
theyre here
they called it
these were in phil coulson jacket
i guess he never did get you to sign them
were dead in the air up here
our communications
the location of the cube
banner thor
i got nothing for you
i lost my one good eye
maybe i had that coming
yes
we were going to build
an arsenal with the tesseract
i never put all my chips
on that number though
because i was playing
something even riskier
there was an idea
stark knows this
called the avengers initiative
the idea was to bring together a group
of remarkable people
to see if they could
become something more
to see if they could work together
when we needed them to
to fight the battles that we never could
phil coulson died still
believing in that idea
in heroes
well
it an old-fashioned notion
you fell out of the sky
did i hurt anybody
there nobody around here to get hurt
you did scare the hell
out of some pigeons though
lucky
or just good aim
you were awake when you fell
you saw
the whole thing
right through the ceiling
big and green and buck-ass nude
here
didnt think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular-size feller
thank you
are you an alien
what
from outer space an alien
no
well then son
youve got a condition
clint
youre going to be alright
you know that
is that what you know
ive
got no window
i have to flush him out
you got to level out
it going to take time
you dont understand
have you ever had someone
take your brain and play
pull you out
and stuff something else in
do you know what it like
to be unmade
you know that i do
why am i back
how did you get him out
cognitive recalibration
i hit you really hard on the head
thanks
natasha
how many agents did i
dont
dont do that to yourself clint
this is loki
this is
monsters and magic
and nothing we were ever trained for
loki did he get away
yeah
i dont suppose you know where
i didnt need to know
i didnt ask
he going to make
his play soon though
today
we got to stop him
yeah
who we
i dont know
whoever left
well
if i put an arrow through
loki eye socket
i would sleep better i suppose
now you sound like you
but you dont
youre a spy
not a soldier
now you want to
wade into a war
why
what did loki do to you
he didnt
i just
natasha
ive been compromised
i got red in my ledger
i would like to wipe it out
was he married
no
there was a
cellist i think
im sorry
he seemed like a good man
he was an idiot
why
for believing
for taking on loki alone
he was doing his job
he was out of his league
he should have waited
he should have
sometimes there isnt a way out tony
right ive heard that before
is this the first time you lost a soldier
we are not soldiers
im not marching to fury fife
neither am i
he got the same blood
on his hands that loki does
but right now we got to put
that behind us and get this done
loki needs a power source
if we can put together a list
he made it personal
that not the point
that is the point
that loki point
he hit us alright where we live
why
to tear us apart
yeah divide and conquer is
great but
he knows he has to take us
out to win right
that what he wants
he wants to beat us
he wants to be seen doing it
he wants an audience
alright i caught his act in stuttgart
yeah
that was just previews
this is opening night and
loki he a full-tilt diva right
he wants flowers he wants parades
he wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered
son of a bitch
time to go
go where
ill tell you on the way
can you fly one of those jets
i can
you got a suit
yeah
then suit up
hey you guys arent authorized
to be in here
son just dont
sir
agent hill
those cards
they were in coulson locker
not in his jacket
they needed the push
we have an unauthorized
departure from bay 6
they found him
get our communications back up
whatever you have to do
i want eyes on everything
yes sir
sir ive turned off the arc reactor
but the device is already self-sustaining
shut it down dr selvig
it too late
she cant stop now
she wants to show us something
a new universe
ok
the barrier is pure energy
it unbreachable
yeah i got that
plan b
sir the mark 7 is not ready
for deployment
then skip the spinning rims
were on the clock
please tell me youre going
to appeal to my humanity
actually im planning to threaten you
you should have left
your armor on for that
yeah
it seen a bit of mileage
and youve got the
glow stick of destiny
would you like a drink
stalling me wont change anything
no no no threatening
no drink are you sure
im having one
the chitauri are coming
nothing will change that
what have i to fear
the avengers
that what we call ourselves
were sort of like a team
earth mightiest heroes type thing
yes ive met them
yeah
it takes us a while to get any traction
ill give you that one
but let do a head count here
your brother the demigod
a super soldier a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend
a man with breathtaking
anger-management issues
a couple of master assassins and you
big fella
youve managed to piss off
every single one of them
that was the plan
not a great plan
when they come
and they will
theyll come for you
i have an army
we have a hulk
i thought the beast had wandered off
youre missing the point
there is no throne
there is no version of this
where you come out on top
maybe your army comes and maybe
it too much for us but it all on you
because if we cant protect the earth
you can be damn
well sure well avenge it
how will your friends have time for me
when they are so busy fighting you
this usually works
well performance issues it
not uncommon
one out of five
jarvis anytime now
you will all fall before me
deploy
deploy
and there is one other person
you pissed off
his name was phil
right
army
loki
turn off the tesseract or ill destroy it
you cant
there is no stopping it
there is only
the war
so be it
stark were on your three
headed northeast
what did you stop for drive-through
swing up park
im going to lay them out for you
sir we have more incoming
fine
let keep them occupied
nat
i see him
we got to get back up there
stark are you seeing this
seeing
still working on believing
where banner
has he shown up yet
banner
just keep me posted
jarvis find me a soft spot
look at this
look around you
you think this madness
will end with your rule
it too late
it too late to stop it
no we can together
sentiment
weve got civilians still trapped up here
loki
theyre fish in a barrel down there
we got this
it good go
do you think you can hold them off
captain
it would be my genuine pleasure
just like budapest all over again
you and i remember budapest
very differently
it going to be an hour
before they can
scramble the national guard
national guard
does the army know
what happening here
do we
you need men in these buildings
there are people inside and theyre going
to be running right into the line of fire
you take them to the basements
or through the subway
you keep them off the streets
i need a perimeter as far back as 39th
why the hell should
i take orders from you
i need men in those buildings
lead the people down and away
from the streets
were going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th street
well we got its attention
what the hell was step two
what the story upstairs
the power surrounding the cube
is impenetrable
thor right
we got to deal with these guys
how do we do this
as a team
i have unfinished business with loki
yeah well get in line
save it
loki going to keep this fight focused
on us and that what we need
without him these things could run wild
we got stark up top
he going to need us to
so
this all seems horrible
ive seen worse
sorry
no we could use a little worse
stark we got him
banner
just like you said
then tell him to suit up
im bringing the party to you
i dont see how that a party
dr banner
now might be a really good
time for you to get angry
that my secret cap
im always angry
hold on
send the rest
guys
call it captain
alright listen up
until we can close that portal
our priority is containment
barton i want you on that roof
eyes on everything
call out patterns and strays
stark you got the perimeter
anything gets more
than three blocks out
you turn it back or you turn it to ash
can you give me a lift
right better clench up legolas
thor you got to try
and bottleneck that portal
slow them down
you got the lightning
light the bastards up
you and me
we stay here on the ground
we keep the fighting here
and hulk
smash
sir
the council is on
stark
you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail
im just trying
to keep them off the streets
well they cant bank worth a damn
so find a tight corner
i will roger that
oh boy
nice call
what else you got
thor is taking on
a squadron down on sixth
and he didnt invite me
captain none of this is going
to mean a damn thing
if we dont close that portal
our biggest guns couldnt touch it
well maybe it not about guns
if you want to get up there
youre going to need a ride
i got a ride
i could use a boost though
are you sure about this
yeah it gonna be fun
ok turn turn turn
less less
captain the bank on 42nd
past madison
theyve cornered
a lot of civilians in there
im on it
everyone clear out
director fury
the council has made a decision
i recognize the council
has made a decision
but given that it a stupid-ass decision
i have elected to ignore it
director youre closer
than any of our subs
you scramble that jet
that is the island of manhattan
councilman
until im certain my team cant hold it
i will not order a nuclear strike
against a civilian population
if we dont hold them here
we lose everything
if i send that bird out
we already have
oh you
hawkeye
nat what are you doing
a little help
i got him
enough
you are all of you beneath me
i am a god you dull creature
and i will not be bullied by
puny god
the scepter
doctor
loki scepter
the energy
the tesseract cant fight
but you cant protect against yourself
it not your fault
you didnt know what you were doing
actually i think i did
i built in a safety
to cut their power source
loki scepter
it may be able to close the portal
and im looking right at it
sir we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell

i wouldnt consider him
a role model
director fury is

override order 7-alpha--
7-alpha-- confirmed

we need to shut it down
repeat takeoff is not authorized
stark do you hear me

headed straight for the city
how long
three minutes max
the payload will wipe out midtown
jarvis put everything we got
into the thrusters
i just did
package is sent
detonation in 2 minutes
30 seconds mark

and i know just where to put it
stark you know that a one-way trip
save the rest for the turn j
sir shall i try miss potts
might as well
the streets of new york city
have become a battleground
the army is here trying
to contain the violence
but clearly it is outmatched
and i have to say
in all my years of reporting
i have never seen anything like this
we have limited
information on the team
but we do know that billionaire
tony stark iron man
come on stark
close it
son of a gun
he not slowing down
is he breathing
what the hell
what just happened
please tell me nobody kissed me
we won
alright yay
hurray good job guys
let just not come in tomorrow
let just take a day
have you ever tried shawarma
there a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here
i dont know what it is but i want to try it
were not finished yet
and then shawarma after
if it all the same to you
ill have that drink now
despite the devastation of
what has been confirmed
as an extraterrestrial attack
the extraordinary heroics
of the group known as the avengers
has been to many a cause
not only for comfort
but for celebration
it just really great knowing
theyre out there
that someone is watching over us
i love you thor
and then these guys were like
and then the air goes
and this green guy walks up
and he goes
i dont know
i dont exactly feel safer
with those things out there
it just seems that there is
a lot theyre not telling us
superheroes in new york
give me a break
these so-called heroes
have to be held responsible
for the destruction done to this city
this was their fight
where are they now
tough questions are being asked
about the avengers themselves
their sudden appearance
and equally sudden disappearance
what this is all somehow their fault
captain america saved my life
wherever he is
and wherever any of them are
i would just
i would want to say thank you
where are the avengers
im not currently tracking
their whereabouts
id say theyve earned a leave of absence
and the tesseract
the tesseract is where it belongs
out of our reach
that not your call
i didnt make it
i just didnt argue with the god that did
so you let him take it
and the war criminal loki
who should be
answering for his crime
oh i think he will be
i dont think you understand
what youve started
letting the avengers
loose on this world
theyre dangerous
they surely are
and the whole world knows it
every world knows it
was that the point of all this
a statement
a promise
sir how does it work now
theyve gone their separate ways
some pretty extremely far
if we get into a situation like this again
what happens then
theyll come back
are you really sure about that
i am
why
because well need them to

humans
they are not the cowering
wretches we were promised
they stand
they are unruly
and therefore cannot be ruled
to challenge them
is to court death
