duels and killing and
it sells so
why dont you sign
your real name
oh my mother

it too gory for her
i wanna help with the money
i make and not worry her
mm
you know i
i dont like them
honestly uh
i mean i i think
that theyre not good
uh but
theyre
theyre published
in the papers
and people have always said
that im talented
oh i think youre talented
which is why im being so
so blunt
well i cant afford
to starve on praise
are you upset
of course im upset
you just
you told me
you didnt like my work
jo i thought
you wanted honesty
i yes i do
has no one ever talked
to you like this before
yes ive been rejected
plenty of times
do you have anyone
to take you seriously jo
to talk about your work
and who made you high priest
of what good
and what bad
no one and im not
then why are you acting like it
your reaction indicates
there is some truth
my reaction indicates
that you are a pompous blowhard
shakespeare wrote
for the masses
shakespeare was the greatest
poet who ever lived
because he smuggled his poetry
in popular works
im no shakespeare
thank goodness
we already have him
if you know so much about it
why dont you just
do it yourself
because im not a writer
i dont have the gifts you have
no you dont
you will always be a critic
and never an author
and the world will forget
that you ever even lived
oh im sure they will
but
i but i
no one will forget jo march
i can believe it
listen
we are not friends
you are not my friend
and i dont want your opinion
because i dont
like you very much
so just dont talk
to me anymore thank you

long as this war drags on
i wish i had money
and plenty of servants
so i never had to work
or you could be
a proper actress
they arent all fallen women
i cant be an actress
i have lots of wishes
but my favorite one
is to be an artist in paris
and do fine pictures and be
the best painter in the world
that what you want jo
to be a famous writer
yes but it sounds crass
when she says it
why be ashamed
im not
my wish is to have us
all be together
with father and mother
that what i want
beth is perfect
amy
what about your music huh
i do that for us i dont need
anyone else to hear it
you must not limit yourself
mother proposed not having
presents this year

in the army
we cant do much
but we can make
our little sacrifices
and do it gladly

hell stay and work faithfully
as long as he can
we wont ask

than he can be spared
give them all
my dear love and a kiss
tell them i think of them
by day pray for them by night
and find my best comforts
in their affection at all times
a year seems a very long time
to wait before i see them
but remind them
that while we wait
we may all work
so these hard days
need not be wasted
i know that they will
be loving children to you
do their duty faithfully

and conquer themselves

my own way in the world
oh well
no no one makes
their own way
not really
least of all a woman
youll need to marry well
but you are not married
that because im rich
and i made sure
to keep hold of my money
unlike your father
so the only way to be an
unmarried woman is to be rich
yes
there are precious few ways
for women to make money
that not true
you could run a cathouse
or go on the stage
practically the same thing
other than that
youre right
precious few ways
for women
that why you should heed me
so i can get married
no so you can live a better
life than your poor mother has
but marmee loves her life
you dont know what she loves
your father cared more about
educating freedmen children
than he did about caring
for his own family
yes but he was right
well it possible
to be right and foolish
well i dont think so
well youre not paid
to think
i know you dont care much
about marriage now
cant say i blame you
but i intend to go
to europe one more time
and i need a companion
so how would you like to be
the person i take
id like that
more than anything
all right then read
and dont sneak around
i dont like sneaks
president lincoln

and we should let
them keep their labor
susan it is immoral

and what
a lovely surprise it is
why are they calling you daisy
it their pet name for me
meg is a perfectly
good name
it just like playing a part
to be daisy for a little while
what would jo say
you wouldnt actually marry
one of these men would you
i might
youll get
a terrible headache tomorrow
do you like how i look
no i dont
why not
i dont like fuss and feathers
youre the rudest boy
i ever saw
please forgive me

im afraid it would be
too disagreeable for you
i dont like your dress but
i think you are just splendid
really
really
i know it silly
but please dont tell jo
let me have my fun tonight
ill be desperately good
for the rest of my life
im sorry john
the silk was
the first real expense
ahem $50 while a lot
is not i suppose
too much for a dress
with all the notions
that are needed
to finish it these days
it not exactly
even a dress yet it
it just the fabric
oh
i see
i know youre angry
john
i dont mean to waste money
but i cant resist
when i see sallie buying
all she wants
and pitying me
because i dont
i try to be contented
but it is hard
and im tired of being poor
i was afraid of this
i do my best meg
oh john
my dear kind
hardworking boy
it was so ungrateful
and wicked
how could i say it
perhaps you meant it
no i didnt
well work out a way
to get you your coat as well
and then wont we be grand
the two of us
i cant afford it
my dear
john
i need to go to bed
john
and i really am very sorry
that youve had to do
without so many
beautiful things
and that youre married
to someone
who cant give
them to you
hello amy
i dont want to see you
amy dont be mad at me
im sorry for how i behaved
have you been drinking
why are you being so hard on me
it 4 pm
someone has to do it
when do you begin your
great work of art raphaella
never
never what why
im a failure
jo is in new york
being a writer
and im a failure
that quite a statement
to make at 20
rome took all the vanity
out of me
and paris made me realize
id never be a genius
so im giving up
all my foolish artistic hopes
why give up you have
so much talent and energy
talent isnt genius
and no amount of energy
can make it so
i want to be great
or nothing
and i will not be
some commonplace dauber
and i dont intend
to try anymore
what women are allowed into
the club of geniuses anyway
the brontes
hm
that it
yes i think so
and who always
declares genius
men i suppose
cutting down the competition
that a very
complicated argument
to make me feel better
do you though
do you feel better
i do think
male or female
i am of middling talent
middling talent
then may i ask
your last portrait be of me
all right
now that youve given up
your foolish artistic hopes
mm-hm
what are you gonna do
with your life
polish up all my other talents
and become
an ornament to society
mm that where fred vaughn
comes in i suppose
dont make fun
i said his name
youre not engaged i hope
no
but you will be if he goes down
properly on one knee
most likely yes
he rich
richer than you even
i understand queens of society
cant get on without money
although it does sound odd
from the mouth of one
of your mother girls
ive always known
i would marry rich
why should i be ashamed
nothing to be ashamed of
as long as you love him
i believe we have
some power over who we love
it isnt something
that just happens to a person
i think the poets
might disagree
well im not a poet
im just a woman
and as a woman there no way
for me to make my own money
not enough to earn a living
or to support my family
if i had my own money
which i dont
that money would belong
to my husband
the moment we got married
if we had children
they would be his not mine
they would be his property
so dont sit there and tell me
that marriage isnt an economic
proposition because it is
it may not be for you
but it most certainly is for me
oh that fred
can you unbutton me please
thank you
how do i look
do i look all right
you look beautiful
you are beautiful
fred
ive missed you
this is fred vaughn
and his sister kate
of course you know
mr brooke
this is meg amy
beth and jo
so pleased to meet you
oh how elegant heh
im amy march
you remember that name
im gonna find you
one day in london
oh i certainly will
oh that missed a boat
that very kind
well
sorry
i know
something you dont know
tell me this second
has meg perhaps
mislaid a glove
mr brooke has it
yes
how do you know
i saw it
where
in his pocket
all this time
yes
isnt it romantic
no it horrid
i thought youd be pleased
at the idea of anybody
coming to take meg away
no thank you
youll feel better when
somebody comes to take you away
id like to see anyone try
i would like to see
someone try as well
we could never have
loved the earth so well
if we had had
no childhood in it
if it were not the earth
where the same flowers come up
again every spring
that we used to gather
with our tiny fingers
what novelty is worth
that sweet monotony
where everything is known
and loved
because it is known
how great is that
mm
i love to listen
to you read jo
but i love it better when you
read stories youve written
i dont have any new stories
why not
havent written any
you have a pencil and paper
sit here
and write me something
i-i cant
i dont think
i can anymore
why

to hear my stories anyway
write something for me
you are a writer
even before anyone knew

if we married

some lovely accomplished girl
who will love you

a fine mistress
for your fine house
but i wouldnt
yes you would jo
look at me
im homely im awkward
and im odd
i love you jo
and youd be ashamed of me
i love you jo

i think youre wrong
no
i think you will marry
youll find someone
and love them
you will live
and die for them
that your way
and you will
and ill watch
oh i dont want
to disturb your writing
i dont do that anymore
it didnt save her
youre much too
lonely here jo
wouldnt you like
to go back to new york
what about your friend
friedrich
wasnt that his name
no
i ruined our friendship
with my temper
just as
i ruin everything
im sure ill never
see him again
i doubt that a sincere friend
would be deterred
i wish that were true
if i was a girl in a book
this would all be so easy
just give up
the world happily
laurie returning you know
oh he is
mm
there was a letter from amy
she coming home
she devastated about beth
aunt march is very ill
so laurie will accompany them
that good of him
mm
what is it
i dont know
ive always been quite
content with my family
dont understand it
perhaps um
perhaps i
was too quick
in turning him down
laurie
do you love him
if he asked me again
i think i would say yes
do you think
hell ask me again
but do you love him
i care more to be loved
i want to be loved
that is not the same
as loving
i know
you know i just
i just feel
i just feel like
women they
they have minds
and they have souls
as well as just hearts
and theyve got ambition
and theyve got talent
as well as just beauty
and im so sick of
people saying
that love is just
all a woman is fit for
im so sick of it
but im im so lonely
couldnt let you travel alone
with aunt march being so sick
even if you despise me
i dont despise you laurie
beth was the best of us
im not marrying fred
i heard about that
and you are under no obligation
to say anything
or do anything
i just didnt love him
as i should
we dont need to talk about it
we dont need to say anything
my dear teddy
i miss you more
than i can express
i used to think that the
worst fate was to be a wife
i was young and stupid
but now i have changed
the worst fate is to live
my life without you in it
i was wrong to turn you down
and to run away to new york
oysters
lobsters
jo
jo jo
jo
wake up
wake up
teddy oh youre back
are you glad to see me then
yes
oh i was worried
mm here come sit
how amy
did she bother you
all the way from europe
with her preening
yes but i like that
where is she now
your mother has her at meg
we stopped on the way
oh
there was no getting my wife
out of their clutches
your what
ive done it now
it was meant to be
a surprise
we were engaged
and were hoping to wait
but that is to say that
now we are man and wife
you and amy
yes
are you in love
yes
i want to say one thing
and then put it away forever
ive always loved you
but the love i feel for amy
it different
and i think
you were right about this
i think we wouldve killed
each other
yes
i think it was meant this way
oh teddy
youre the only one that ever
calls me that jo teddy
what does amy call you
my lord
that sounds like her
well you look
deserving of it
could we still
be friends jo please
of course my boy always
she a painter
are you excited
laurie told you
yes yes
amy im so happy for you
this this was meant to be
oh im so relieved
thank you
i wanted to write jo
i wanted to write
i wanted to explain but
everything was happening so fast
and i was worried
youd be angry at me
no no
no youre not angry at me
life is too short
to be angry at one sisters
i really miss her
i know
thank you
mr laurence
jo heh
oh jo
i couldnt bring
myself to uh
the house doesnt seem right
without her and
couldnt go in
knowing she wouldnt be there
i know im not half
so good as my sister
but you know ill be a friend
to lean on if youll let me
all right
dear mr dashwood
enclosed are
the first few chapters
of a piece
ive only begun working on
it could suit as a story
for young people
but i think it is
probably quite boring
however im sending it to you
just in case
it has something of value
though i doubt it
jo march
i thought she hated me
she could still hate you
and leave you the house
what about you and john
we cant manage a grand house
like this it too big
i should sell it
but id love to do something
that would really make
aunt march turn in her grave
i wouldnt mind that
a nice turning
just a rotation
nothing terrible
what will you do
id like to open a school
we never had
a proper school
now there are
women colleges opening
there should be a school
for daisy
and what will demi do
ill open a school
for boys and girls both
what about writing
what about it
what are you working on
i started something but
i dont think it very good
everyone likes what you write
no they dont
i do
well it just
about our little life
so
well who will be interested
in a story
of domestic struggles
and joys
it doesnt have
any real importance
maybe it doesnt
seem important
because people
dont write about them
no writing doesnt confer
importance it reflects it
i dont think so
writing them will
make them more important
when did you become so wise
hm-mm i always have been
you were just too busy
noticing my faults
which were never
there of course
dear miss march
i read the chapters you sent
and i have to agree
they arent very promising
but please
send more stories
of the scandalous variety
if you have any
or shall i say
your friend can
my apologies for the joke
i couldnt help it
jo come down
coming
im starving
oh uh jo
you might wanna wait because
im famished
but jo dear

and europeans

boardinghouse in new york
oh jo
he very handsome
do you intend
to stay in new york
no ive been offered
a professorship in california
and as i have
nothing keeping me here
i thought
i might go west
it is new there
and they are
less particular
about immigrants
perhaps i should go west
youre not an immigrant
so perhaps you should stay home
im going
jo
joseph not josephine
i know joseph
pretty well actually
oh wow
this is a beautiful
instrument
which one of you plays
oh it was
my sister beth
we all play a little but
but none
so well as her
it is very hard to lose
a sister
im sorry
do you play
yes i do
it would make us so happy
if youd play now
she wouldnt want
the piano to sit silent
i dont wish to offend
not in the least
it was so lovely to meet you
lovely to meet you goodbye
it was a real pleasure
mr bhaer
bye laurie
goodbye
thank you for everything
lovely to have you
if you ever come to california
i would love to see you
i dont know that i will
but thank you
well goodbye
goodbye
what
why are you all
looking at me like that
what a wonderful man
i hope he comes back
he would make
a terrific friend for me
father he wasnt here for you
no
jo you love him
what no no i dont
yes you do i am half
as smart as you
but i can see it
so plainly you love him
doesnt she
good instinct you love him
i have never seen you so happy
what else is love
you need to go after him
prepare the horses
we can catch him
im coming too
no im not going
yes you are
amy is right
exactly
never thought
id prepare a carriage
to help jo march chase a man
but i like it
he moving to california
that was fiction
he was practically begging
for a reason to stay
but it raining outside
that doesnt matter
come with me i need to fix you
jo
laurie will you
stop standing there
and go get the horses ready
thank you
you never ask about my mother
even when you know
ive seen her
i assume
she still alive
but i ask
after your mother
and i have no idea why
youre willfully
missing the point
that true
what do they want
i have no idea
are you publishing this
what happens
to the little women
tell me you have
the rest of this book
what
im just trying
to fix this hair
stop stop stop
stop the carriage
stop
stop the carriage
stop all right go out out
go go go go
go
jo your hair
kiss him with love
frankly i dont see why
she didnt marry the neighbor
well because the neighbor
marries her sister
right right
of course
so who does she marry
no one she doesnt marry
either of them
no
no no no
that wont work at all
she says the whole book
she doesnt want to marry
who cares
girls want to see women married
not consistent
no it isnt
the right ending
the right ending
is the one that sells
trust me if you decide
to end your delightful book
with your heroine a spinster
no one will buy it
it wont be worth printing
i suppose marriage
has always been
an economic proposition
even in fiction
it romance
heh heh it mercenary
just end it that way will you
heh fine
go
jo your hair
kiss him with love
go
you look so beautiful
go jo
jo
i i dont want you to leave
i want you to stay
you do
yes
i would never leave
if you wish me to stay
no i want you to stay
i have nothing to give you
it doesnt matter
my hands are empty
theyre not empty
i love it it romantic
it very moving
that very emotional
well thank you
we could call the chapter
under the umbrella
that good
perfect
now there the question
of the contract
im prepared to give you
5 percent of the royalties
so i get 5 percent
of the profit
five percent of the net profits
after i recoup
huh well what about
a payment up front
im the one taking the risk
in printing this book
yes but it my book
and if it does well
well both make money
if not
i can stay in business
oh so i get nothing
if it fails
no ill give you $500 right now
to buy out the copyright
the copyright
that the right for reprinting
that sort of thing sequels
characters for other stories
might that
be worth something
well only if it a success
i see it seems like something
i would want to own no
didnt you say your family
needed the money immediately
yes they do which is why
i wanted up-front payment
no it too risky ill only
pay for the copyright
you keep your $500
and ill keep the copyright
also i want 0 percent
of royalties
five point five percent
that very generous
nine percent
six percent and that it
mr dashwood if im going
to sell my heroine
into marriage for money
i might as well get some of it
six point six percent
done
and you dont need to decide
about the copyright right now
no ive decided
i want to own my own book
where is she
she here everyone
come on
now see if you can make a b
