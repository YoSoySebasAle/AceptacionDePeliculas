there would be headlines in the papers
the grown-up gangs who ran the betting
at the wrestling and the barrow-boys
would hear with respect of how
old misery house had been destroyed
it was as though this plan had been with him
all his life pondered through the seasons
now in his 5th year
crystallised with the pain of puberty
what is graham greene
trying to communicate with this passage
why did the children
break into old misery house
joanie
they wanted to rob him
if you had actually read the short story
which was a whopping 3 pages
youd know that the children find a great
deal of money in the mattress but burn it
donnie darko perhaps with your
recent brush with mass destruction
you can give us your opinion
they say it when they flood the house
when they tear it to shreds
that destruction is a form of creation
so burning the money is ironic
they just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart
they want to change things
door opens
may we help you
yeah i just registered
they put me in the wrong class
you look like you belong here
um where do i sit
sit next to the boy you
think is the cutest

quiet
let her choose

on the shingle match
they still dont know
know what
where it came from
oh no they cant tell us
something about a matching serial number
that got burned
i had to sign a form
saying i wouldnt talk to anyone about it

frank
frank

he said to follow him
follow him where
into the future
and then what happens
and then he said then he said
that the world was coming to an end
do you think the world is coming to an end
no
that stupid
woman on tv for my entire life
i was a victim of my own fear
love
woman i was feeding fear with food
fear
finally i looked in the mirror
not just in the mirror
i looked through the mirror
in that image i saw my ego reflection
for two years i thought it was normal
for a 0-year-old to wet the bed
shh quiet
but the solution was there all the time
im not afraid any more
all over america
people have come together to join hands
people who believe that human life
is absolutely too important
too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear
frank pay close attention
you could miss something
hello my name is jim cunningham
and welcome to controlling fear

we gotta find ourselves a smurfette
smurfette
mm-hm
not some tight-ass middlesex chick
like this cute little blonde thatll
get down with the guys like smurfette does
smurfette doesnt fuck
that bullshit
why do you think papa smurf made her
because the other smurfs
were getting too horny
not vanity i heard he was a homosexual
then she fucks them while vanity watches
what about papa smurf
he must get some action
what he does he films the gang-bang
later on he beats off to the tape
first of all papa smurf
didnt create smurfette gargamel did
she was sent as gargamel evil spy
to destroy the smurf village
but the overwhelming goodness
of the smurfs transformed her
and as for the whole gang-bang scenario
it just couldnt happen
smurfs are asexual they dont even have
reproductive organs under those little pants
that what so illogical
about being a smurf
what the point of living
if you dont have a dick
donnie why you gotta get smart on us
horn honks
grandma death
miss farmer excuse me excuse me
please stay off the road miss sparrow

tv authorities continued their search
for a suspect
in the middlesex ridge school vandalism
the private school has asked for
donations to restore its beloved mascot
known only as the mongrel
it very helpful
there a good turnout tonight
what are you trying to accomplish here
there was urine and faeces
flooded in my office
whatever fits
whatever fits
in cooperation with the county police
we have begun an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding
and our suspects
include several of our own students
i want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children
kitty i would appreciate
if you would wait
dr cole not only am i a teacher but i
am also a parent of a middlesex child
therefore i am the only person here
who transcends the parent-teacher bridge
frank dont worry
you got away with it
i have in my hand graham greene
the destructors
this short story is part
of my daughter english assignment
in this story several children destroy
an elderly man house from inside out
eerie humming
how can you do that
and how do they do this they flood the
house by breaking through a water main
i can do anything i want
and so can you
applause
and i think
that this garbage should be removed
excuse me what is the real issue here
the pta doesnt ban books
the pta must acknowledge that pornography
is being taught in our curriculum
it meant to be ironic
excuse me go back to grad school
why did you make me flood the school
they are in great danger
do you even know who graham greene is
i think we have all seen bonanza
well um while we are on other topics
where do you come from
do you believe in time travel
sam who are you talking to
i was just taking my pills sam
a storm is coming frank says
a storm that will swallow the children
and i will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain
ill deliver them back to their doorsteps
send the monsters back to the underground
ill send them back to a place
where no one else can see them
except for me
because i am donnie darko
who is frank
a six-foot-tall bunny rabbit
giggling
in these modern times our attitude
and beliefs are so delicate so fragile
i have had a cunning vision
this vision has released me
it important that our lifeline be
rejuvenated so that we can breathe again
it time to breathe
it is time to breathe
thank you jim cunningham
thank you jim cunningham
o now let us begin lifeline exercise
number one please press stop now
as you can see the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes
fear and love
fear is in the negative energy spectrum
love is in the positive energy spectrum
no duh
excuse me
no duh is a product of fear
now on each card is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline
please take this thank you
please read each character dilemma aloud
and place an x on the lifeline
in the appropriate place
cherita
juanita has an important math test today
she known about the test
for several weeks but has not studied
in order to keep from failing
juanita decides to cheat on the math test
good good very good
mr darko
ling ling finds a wallet
filled with money
she takes it to the address on the
driver license but keeps the money
im sorry miss farmer i dont get this
just place an x in the appropriate place
i know what to do but you cant
lump things into two categories
the lifeline is divided that way
well life isnt that simple i mean
who cares if ling ling keeps the money
it has nothing to do with fear or love
they are the deepest human emotions
ok but youre not listening to me
there are other things to take into account
the whole spectrum of human emotion
you cant just lump everything into two
categories and deny everything else
if you dont complete the assignment
youll get a zero
donald let me preface this by saying
that your iowa test scores are
intimidating
so
let go over this again
what exactly did you say to miss farmer
ill tell you he asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus
stifles laughter with cough
nobody cares about responsibility
morality family values
kitty excuse us please
theyve suspended him from after-school
activities for six months
since this jet engine fiasco
i dont know what gotten into
ill say this because our daughters are on
the dance team together and i respect you
but after witnessing your son behaviour
i have significant doubts about your
our paths through life must be righteous
go home and look in the mirror
and pray that your son doesnt succumb
to the path of fear
do you remember
that weird gym teacher mrs farmer
yeah ok well my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today
and then my parents
just bought him all this new shit
yeah i know
i wish a jet engine would fall on my room
dr monnitoff
donnie
um
i know this is gonna
sound kind of weird but uh
do you know anything about
time travel
monnitoff a wormhole
with an einstein-rosen bridge
which is theoretically
a wormhole in space controlled by man
so according to hawking a wormhole
may be able to provide a short cut
for jumping
between two distant regions of space-time
so to travel back in time you have to have
a spaceship faster than the speed of light
theoretically
and be able to find a wormhole
the basic principles of
time travel are there
your vessel and portal
your vessel can be anything
like a delorean
metal craft of any kind
you know i love that movie
it so like futuristic you know
listen um
dont tell anybody that i gave you this
woman who wrote this used to teach here
she was a nun long before that
then overnight
she became this entirely different person
she up and left the church
wrote this book
she started teaching science
right here at middlesex
the philosophy of time travel
roberta sparrow
that right
roberta sparrow
roberta sparrow
grandma death
it called the philosophy
of time travel
what does philosophy have to do with it
guess who wrote it
who
roberta sparrow huh she wrote a book
grandma death wrote a book
that a terrible nickname
we almost ran her down the other day
she lives in that piece of crap house
and you know she loaded
youre right
she was known for her gem collection
kids used to go up there all the time
and try to steal stuff from her
she became a total recluse
huh i didnt know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down
donnie
he was just standing in the road frozen
i walked over to see if she was ok
and she whispered in my ear
what did she say
i think frank wants me to talk to her
he asked if i knew about time travel
she wrote a book about it
so that cant be a coincidence right
what did she say to you
she said that every living creature
on earth dies alone
how did that make you feel
it reminded me of my dog callie
she died when i was eight and she
crawled underneath the the porch
to die
to be alone
do you feel alone right now
i dont know
id like to believe im not but i just
ive just never seen any proof
so i just dont debate it any more
i could spend my whole life debating it over
and over and still wouldnt have proof
so i just dont debate it any more
it absurd
the search for god is absurd
it is if everyone dies alone
does that scare you
i dont want to be alone
* classical music

night for these super bowl champions

* woman singing ave maria
jet engine roars by
bell rings
teacher tomorrow we meet our partners
for the young inventors fair
what if you could go back in time
and take those hours of pain
and replace them with something better
like images
yeah a hawaiian sunset
or the grand canyon
things that remind you how beautiful
weve been going together for two weeks
yeah
well i er i
you want to kiss me
im sorry i
look donnie wait i just
well i like you a lot
i just want it to be at a time when it
when what
when it reminds me just
when it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be
yeah
and there some fat guy staring at us
i dont think telling any woman
to forcibly insert an object up her anus
is something
that should go without consequence
i think we should buy him a moped
i think we should get a divorce
you wont tell mum will you
why would i
you tell mum everything
no i dont
let me see it
no it not finished it
ok it cool
that scary
you think
thank you for seeing us
at such late notice
we both felt we should come and discuss
what i think is going on with your son
yes
um well he er
you know about his past
and he was suspended from school
for insulting his gym teacher
im not sure that a good example
i think he had just cause
rose let me lay out
what i believe is happening here
donnie aggressive behaviour
his increased detachment from reality
seem to stem from his inability
to cope with the forces in the world
that he perceives to be threatening
has he ever told you about frank
frank
yes the giant bunny rabbit
the what
i dont recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit
donnie is experiencing what is
commonly called a daylight hallucination
this is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics
what can we do
i would like to do more hypnotherapy
and increase his medication
whatever will help him really is
that why were here
we just would like him
to experience some relief
so if you think
that more medication will do that
then i think we should give it a try
it complicated
yeah
there like a force in your brain
that just sends you someplace
do you go someplace familiar
no but each time i keep waking up
farther from my house
gretchen scary
distant thunder rumbles
donnie darko
i know
they chuckle
good morning you mongrels
good morning
is that all you can muster good morning
good morning
now that a tiny tiny bit better
but i still sense some students who are
actually afraid to say good morning
good morning
yeah that what i like to hear
too many young men and women today
are completely paralysed by their fears
they surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction
of drugs alcohol and premarital sex
now im going to tell you
a little story today
it a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places
his name was frank
were moving through time
what
feedback whines
hi my stepsister like
i sometimes worry that she eats too much
shut up kim
im just trying to help
oh sweetheart please
there no reason to be embarrassed here
many times we eat because
we are afraid to face our ego reflection
we find ourselves looking at the mirror
rather than into and through the mirror
when we do that
we can finally see how beautiful we are
thanks
sure come up here dont be afraid
er how can i find out
what i wanna be when i grow up
oh that a hard one well look deep
inside of yourself deep within your heart
and find what makes you feel love -
pure unconditional love and go to that
in your studies in your athletics
in your relationships go towards love
thank you
come on up
next
how do i learn how to fight
how do i learn how to fight
son violence is a product of fear
learn to truly love yourself -
truly love yourself -
and the world will be yours
ok
get yourself up here
all right
good morning
good morning
um how much are they paying you
to be here
er excuse me
what your name son
gerald
well gerald i think youre afraid
do you want us to buy your book
because that was the worst advice ever
see how sad this is
want your sister to lose weight
tell her to stop eating twinkies
and play field hockey
no one knows what they want to be
it takes time to find that out right jim
and you
yeah you
sick of some jerk shoving your head
down the toilet well lift some weights
or take a karate lesson
and next time kick him in the balls
son see this this is an anger prisoner
a textbook example
prisoner
do you see the fear people
this boy is scared to death
son it breaks my heart to say this
but i believe youre a very troubled
and confused young man
you are searching in all the wrong places
youre right actually
i am pretty troubled and pretty confused
and im afraid really really afraid
really afraid but i i
i think youre the fucking antichrist
cheering
it amazing he thinks he telling the
truth everything he says is a fucking lie
everything he says
everyone thinks he so rad
he such a fucking chud
are you ok
sit down calm down
you ever hear of grandma death
who
the philosophy of time travel
what is this
she wrote it
im im seeing stuff
like really messed-up stuff
that book describes stuff ive been seeing
and it cant just be a coincidence
bell clangs
she must be in she never
leaves this house
maybe she asleep
donnie look
frank end her a letter
monnitoff each vessel travels
along a vector through space-time
along its centre of gravity
like a spear
pardon
like a spear coming out of your chest
um sure yeah
in order for the vessel to travel through time
it got to find a portal a wormhole or
could these portals could these portals
just appear anywhere any time
i think that highly unlikely
no youre talking about an act of god
if god controls time time is pre-decided
im not following you
every living thing follows a set path
and if you could see your path
then you could see the future
that a form of time travel
well youre contradicting yourself
if we were able to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies
the mere fact that this choice exists would
make all preformed destiny come to an end
not if you travel within god channel
im not going to be able
to continue this conversation
why
i could lose my job
ok
it gives me no pleasure to deny you one
of the great writers of the 20th century
alas i have not yet been elected queen
of the universe so i must obey the rules
so anyone seen in this school
reading this book will be suspended
not to worry someone pre-ordered a dozen
copies at the sarasota mall bookstore
in mr greene absence we will now be
reading another classic watership down
here donnie
pass these back
maybe you and frank
can read this one together
chuckles
frank now you know where he lives
and they grow
out of our chest solar plexus
just like she described
the way they moved and they smelled
it like theyre workers
assigned to each one of us
they just theyre like liquid
i followed it into my parents bedroom
what did you find
nothing
so we call them imgs
infant memory generators
you buy these glasses for your infant
and they wear them at
night when they sleep
but inside the glasses
are these slide photographs
each photograph is of something peaceful
or beautiful whatever the parents want
what effect would it have on an infant
well nobody remembers their infancy
anybody who says they do is lying
so this will help develop memory
earlier in life
yeah
did you consider that infants need darkness
as part of their natural development
no
yeah
what if the parents put in pictures
of satan or dead people
is that what youd show your kids
er well i mean
didnt your dad like stab your mum
mock screeching
get out
gretchen
gretchen gretchen
im sorry about those guys
two for evil dead please
thatll be $2

how long was i asleep for
whole movie
voices on radio
distant thunder rumbles
well look what the cat dragged in
how you doing donnie
your little sister was broken-hearted
that you missed her big show last night
dad
hm
im crazy
youre not crazy
i used to be crazy
but youre not crazy
look youre my only son
i know
no hold it i know
im not the best communicator but
whatever happens to you
be honest tell the truth
even if they do look at
you funny they will
but what you gotta understand son
is that almost all of those people
are full of shit
theyre all part
of this great big conspiracy of bullshit
and theyre scared of people like you
because those bullshitters know
that youre smarter than all of them
you know what you say
to people like that hm
fuck you
the blaze was extinguished
sometime after 800 last night
firefighters discovered what has been
referred to as a kiddie porn dungeon
cunningham who has become a recent
celebrity for his books was arrested
oh my god
while at sarasota heights country club
arson has not been ruled out
as the cause of the fire
now a group of cunning vision employees
dad played golf with that guy
vehemently denied the alleged link
to a child pornography publishing circuit
in a vicious statement
connie attacked fire department officials
claiming a mass conspiracy
im sorry karen
this is a progressive school
but we dont feel
your methods are appropriate
what exactly about my methods
are inappropriate
i am sorry that you have failed
now if youll excuse me
i have another appointment
you can finish out the week
fuck
good afternoon
it a great pleasure to announce
that the middlesex ridge school dance team
has been invited to perform
on star search 88 in los angeles
i know now a terrible thing is coming
what do you mean
the field the field
it covered with blood
blood dont be silly
all right it getting dark
we should get back to the burrow
back to the burrow
itll come there it all around us
top it fiver
weve got to leave here
when the other rabbits hear of
fiver vision do they believe him
why should we care
because the rabbits are us donnie
why should i mourn for a rabbit
is the death of one species
less tragic than another
of course a rabbit not like us
it has no history books no photographs
no knowledge of sorrow or regret
im sorry dont get me wrong
i like rabbits theyre cute and horny
if youre cute and horny youre happy
you dont know why youre alive
you just want to have sex
as many times as possible before you die
i just dont see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit
who never even feared death to begin with
youre wrong these rabbits are the
product of the author imagination
he cares for them so we care for them
otherwise weve just missed the point
arent we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling
the deus ex machina the god machine
that what saved the rabbits
no it was ridiculous ill call you back
rose
kitty
im sure youve heard the horrible
allegations against jim cunningham
i know
something about a kiddie porn dungeon
oh please please dont use those words
it obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man
im spearheading
the jim cunningham defence campaign
rose i have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning
the girls have to leave for los angeles
as their coach

laughs i only have a few days left
before they catch me
did frank tell you to do these things
i have to obey him he saved my life
i have to obey him or
ill be left all alone
and then and then i wont be able
to figure out what this is all about
i wont know his master plan
do you mean god master plan
do you now believe in god
i have the power to build a time machine
how is that possible
how is time travel possible donnie
time up frank said
when is this going to happen
soon
what is going to happen
frank is gonna kill
who is he going to kill
who is he going to kill
i can see him
the sky gonna open up
if the sky suddenly opened up
there would be no law no rule
there would only be you and your memories
the choices youve made
and the people youve touched
if this world were to end
there would only be you and him
and no one else
you can stop taking your medication
theyre placebos
just pills made out of water
thank you
donnie
an atheist is someone who denies altogether
the existence of god
youre an agnostic
an agnostic is someone
who believes that there is
no proof of the existence of god
but does not deny a possibility
that god exists
