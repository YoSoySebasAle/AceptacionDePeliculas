know who owned these
malibu equity and investments
roger van zant
owns banks in the caymans
runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money stuff like that
so
so you ripped off his bearer bonds
he got insurance
that the point he collects
00 percent from the insurance

back from us for 60 percent of their value
and make 40 percent

sell it back to him instead of going to
the street that an extra 320000 to you
try it on him
kelso called

dont ask
dispatcher speaking
indistinctly over radio
find the ambulance
dumped it four blocks from here
22nd street between figueroa and flower
they torched it burned everything
the guns clothes everything
reporter investigators are
still working the scene
they were airborne
taped the last few seconds
of the black-and-whites
doing demolition derby
stolen out of fresno two weeks ago
yellow pickup truck out of whittier
day before yesterday
you taking this one lieutenant
or does it stay in division
this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-eleven to you
robbery-homicide taking it yeah
officer all yours
we got three motorists all they saw
were men with masks they were distant
console tv man over there however
he was closer
he id anybody
well he was hiding he heard it mostly
vincent okay what about them
heinz right now according to tv man
this guy started mouthing off
smart
yeah somebody called a guard slick
slick
yeah
now this guy i figure this guy went
for that holdout piece ankle holster right
from here
bang bang bang bang bang
to his side
this guy here has got what appears to be
a double-tap entry wound to the sternum
tattooing around the head wound
scorched bone close range
probably executed
and it was a million six in bearer bonds
and they ignored the loose cash
because they had no time
because they were on a clock
which means they knew
our response time to a 2
had our air immobilized it entered
escaped in under three minutes
it a good spot here
we got good escape routes
two freeways within a quarter of a mile
traffic video camera
probably disabled check it anyway
you recognize the mo
mo is that theyre good
once it escalated into a murder-one beef
for all of them
after they killed the first two guards
they didnt hesitate
popped guard number three
because what difference does it make
why leave a living witness
drop of a hat
these guys will rock n roll
the shape charge
the shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient
proficient enough to go in on the prowl
so let start looking for recent high-line
burglaries that have mystified us
run slick as an alias to the fbi
youre gonna get the phone book
do it anyway
who moving the bearer bonds

that you were gonna have to share me
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet
and i bought into that sharing
because i love you
i love you fat bald money no money
driving a bus i dont care
but you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time
that sharing
this is not sharing this is leftovers
oh i see what i should do
is come home and say
hi honey guess what
i walked into this house today
where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave
because it was crying too loud
so let me share that with you
come on let share that
and in sharing it
well somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit right
wrong you know why
because you prefer the normal routine
we fuck
then you lose the power of speech
because i gotta hold on to my angst
i preserve it because i need it
it keeps me sharp on the edge
snapping fingers
where i gotta be
you dont live with me
you live among the remains
of dead people
you read the terrain
you search for signs of passing
for the scent of your prey
and then you hunt them down
that the only thing
youre committed to
the rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through
what i dont understand is
why i cant cut loose of you

you know i have this recurring dream
im sitting at this big banquet table
and all the victims of all the murders
i ever worked are sitting at this table
and theyre staring at me
with these black eyeballs
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds
and there they are
these big balloon people
because i found them two weeks
after theyd been under the bed
the neighbors reported the smell
and there they are
all of them just sitting there
what do they say
nothing
no talk
none
just
they dont have anything to say
see we just look at each other
they look at me
and that it that the dream
i have one where im drowning
and i gotta wake myself up and
start breathing or ill die in my sleep

lapd homicide
you wanna put dominick in the bedroom
he stays with me
there we go
so what now
well he right
because you want out this is out
you believe you have to betray chris
no shit
that right you would have to
see if you dont betray chris
you victimize dominick
because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory
because you got no living parents
to take him
so he ends up state-raised in
foster homes juvenile facilities
then he steals a car
then he winds up in gladiator academies
like chino and tracy
fucked for life
you know what happens
because youve been there
dominick didnt get a chance yet
to choose his life but chris did
if you give up chris you get off clean
you can do it for your kid
so you can raise him
what else are you selling
all kinds of shit
but i dont have to sell this and you know it
because this kind of shit here sells itself
