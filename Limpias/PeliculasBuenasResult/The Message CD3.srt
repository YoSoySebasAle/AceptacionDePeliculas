battle of uhud
there is hamza can you see him
he is your fortune
ubada those horse-men on the flank out there
they are replaced
they are under khalid
khalid
i often thought of that yound man
hamza
yes
prophet asks if you have noticed those horse-men
yes i have i dont like them
he sending our 50 archers to watch them
no matter what happens
the archers must hold off those horse-men
zaid tell the prophet that we are ready
what do you think hamza
besides their numbers id say its a fair fight
we see them and they see us
what faces me has never frightened me
all praise be hubar
when muhammed gives the word well go to them
hamza
weapons ready
we march now
attack
theyve killed hamza
tackle them
fight fight
this is a moment of victory
running away from us let get the loot
stand where you are told to stand
come back to your positions
all of you come back
its a road
their centry is gone
weve lost the battle khalid
not yet
hold on
where is the prophet
muhammad is dead
i saw him fall
no no he alive find him
back back to the mountains
halt
i thought we were beaten
now victory is yours khalid
we have no victory until
weve finished muhammad
he up in those rocks
weve finished our business weve avenged badr
but we can end islam and him forever
some of his fenatics are still with him
they have the advantage of the mountains
the risk is too high
muhammad listen
a day for a day the day of uhub for the day of badr
our dead have answered to your dead
our dead are in paradise
your dead are in hell fire
hamza hamza do you hear me hamza
ok you know that i am with you i hind
do you remember anything hamza
how you killed my father and my brother
now you too are dead
now my heart is light
do you hear hamza light
but i havent finished with you
death is too small
wahshi cut him open cut him
they lost a battle and what do they do
they came home and dig the ground harder
they are mad
i agree with you
they defy reason
they are even happy they lost
god send the defeat they say
to trial in their faith
oh yes they are fighting with the sky
theyll get what they want
they want mecca
theyll get mecca
when we see the stars at noon
immm dont underestimate him i learned that on my cost
my friend mecca is more than their home
it where god spoke to man
mecca is like a home-sickness to the soul
this year they are going as pilgrims
what
unarmed
unarmed
abu sufian will slaughter them in the dessert
if you believe in god as they do
it might be possible not to get slaughtered
but i agree with you they probably will be
be still do not let them provoke you
that is what they want stand firm
peace be upon you
prophet says all who love god
must renew their oaths to him
under the tree
theyve sent someone else
its salool
that means we might come to an agreement
muhammad you have been given conditions of truce
between yourself and mecca
have you agreed to them yet
what is this
in the name of god the most gracious
who is this new god they call gracious
i do not know him strike him out
and i cannot agree with this
muhammad the messenger of god
if i have thought you were the messenger of god
i would not have fought you
make it muhammad the son of abdullah
agrees with suheil the son of amr
that is the more fact
well so i understand
good that is better
now it is agreed
that you do not continue your pilgrimage
you must turn around and go home
mecca is home
however you may continue your
pilgrimage next year
and for 3 days only
in and out
we also agree to the truce
for 0 years
during that time you will not attack any
tribe or ambush any caravan
or any individual associated with us and vice versa
if you injure any one of us the truce ends
and vice versa is that clear
0 years 0 years of peace
we need that time
we will use that time
these letters from muhammad the messenger of god
to rulers of the world
call the world to islam
to heraclius emperor of byzantium
kisra emperor of persia
mephocus patriarch of alexandria
god is great
there are no different races in islam and
arab is not superior to foreign
not a  white man superior to a black
all return equally to god
unless you desire for your neighbour
what you desire for yourself
you dont have faith
a man goes to bed with his belly full
while his neighbor is hungry
he isnt a muslim
the ink of a scholar is holier than
the blood of a martyr
a man reading is handsome in the side of god
so learn to read and when you have learned
teach
the people of the book
jews with their bible the christians with their testament
must be respected by you for their books likewise came from god
you must all think of muhammad as more than a man
he was collecting firewood one day
let me do it i said
why he said
youre the prophet of god
you cant go round scratching for firewood
but he looked at me mumbling
god does not like the man
who considers himself above
other men he said
so i laid back and watched him
suddenly he stopped
he stood to his full height and came to me
yes
i am the prophet of god he said
but even i do not know what will become of me
arm have you come to take me again
no
ive come to ask you to take me
i witness that there is only one god
and that muhammad is his messenger
may god forgive me the times i have fought against you
lslam does the way with all that went before it
im sorry i came here wearing
here are my jewels
what they are worth
i give to the poor
and may i offer you my
yes
but you were the bitterest sword against islam
now by the will of god
i will be the raised sword of god
ah its all easy to god
just as he might gain in losing
be may lose in winning
2 years agon we thought we were beaten
when we had to sign that truce
look at us now charging from victory to victory in the hearts of men
what that
abu sufian is coming
why am i insulted like this
abu sufian
i expect some courtesy
we are not at war
we have a truce
ive come to speak to muhammad
where is he
he is in the mosque
muhammad we did not break the truce
i have come to re-affirm the truce
i speak for mecca
muhammad why do you turn from me
dont go
muhammad dont go
biduns broke the truce not us
the night was dark
i am here to testify that the night was dark
baara this is your city
hudaifa you are my kin
and descendant
why must you be hard
i am mecca i am the leader of mecca
why am i insulted like this
because you keep no promise
and respect no pledge
ive heard what i thought
id never hear
abu sufian asking for pity
to be out-fought out-fought
who we knew to be a one time shepherd
you saw that shepherd religion grow from a speck dust
speck was in my eye
i could see nothing
tell mecca that the gods are dead
it is useless to resist god
travel fast or every man here
will curse behind you
its you who have broken the truce
for tonight will be 0000 men from every tribe
now we can fight them you are back
we will close the streets and defend from the houses
its no use
there are thousands of them and they are joined by more
you coward
hind go home
you coward are you the leader of mecca
look at yourself
you are broke they swallowed you and sput you out
when my father and brother die my husband ran away
you go home you
we can not resist mecca is taken
no no
we are to camp here for the night
we can see mecca even through the mountains
so many fires i can not count them
it is very beautiful
when we drove them out of mecca i did not know
that he carried mecca with him
we can smell the bread they are baking
yes
it means they dont intend to plonder
though i do hope at least thats what it means
they dont want blood on our walls and doorsteps
i can bargain with that
take me to him
so you are giving us your city
you offer me no bread
i understand
you may decide to kill me
say what you have come to say
i saw your fires the men around them
and i know what power you put into them
we can no longer resist muhammad
now if you agree
you dare to come here and ask for conditions
isnt it yet time enough for you to recognize who muhammad is
muhammad there is still doubt in my heart
if i were to cut off your head it would remove all your doubts
khalid
there is no composion in religion
a man may take many years
or only need minutes
its god who decides the time
so respect his doubts
youre a black slave you have the best school
i am only what god has given me
yes
the gods that i worshipped
have never been in use
it would have helped me
i require no composion
there is one god
and you are the messenger of god
now let me go
get inside
no doors may be broken down
nothing plondered nothing seized
no one abused all behind closed doors are safe
all in habu sufian house are safe
all by the side of kabbalah are safe
at least he kept his word
they havent forced any door
he stolen hearts not walls
its a permanent victory
i dread going out
we must we must in the end
were we so wrong
the way we lived yes that was wrong
we were trapped in our own faults
our gods were less than us
now there he is making his entrance to the kabbaah
in the name of god most gracious most merciful
god gave this house to abraham to be a sacred place
worship no other god but him
and cleanse his house
so it was
muhammad took no revenge and allowed all
he declared mecca a holy place
noone may shed blood
or cut down a tree
or kill a living thing in mecca
soon
all arabia was converted not only to the new worship
but to the new laws manners
attitudes contained in islam
the prophet had lived to see his work done
and now he began to feel the nearness of death
one great act of his prophet would remain
the setting of its seal
he called the people to him
and he spoke for the last time
his message was to surrender to god
and humanity to man
oh mankind listen well
i may not be with you much longer
the weak among you
feed them and watch what you eat
dress them as you are dressed
you will meet your god
and he will call you
to count your actions
let those who are present warn those who are absent
you are all are descendant from adam
and the best among you
is he who most regards god
think deeply about what i say
let all your feuds be abolished
you must know that every muslim
is the brother of every other muslim
and all muslims are brothers of one-another
between muslims there are no races and no tribes
not must you take anything from your brother
except what is given freely
do not oppress and do not be oppressed
o my people
im but a man
it may be that the angel of death will visit me soon
and death will overtake me
but i have left you a book
revealed by god
the quran which is light and guidance
now he repeated to the people
the final repetition of the quran
the sea of determination
not muhammad words but god word
this day i have perfected your religion for you
and completed my favour to you
and i have chosen for you islam as your religion
on june the 8th  632
in his 63rd year
muhammad died
many of his followers
could not believe the fact
how can such a man die
but abu bakr the prophet friend
stood up in the mosque
if anyone worships muhammad
let him know that muhammad is dead
but who worships god
let him know that god is alive and can not die
they buried muhammad beside his mosque in medina
but the religion he preached
found its place in the heart of man
it endured it multiplied
still to mecca they come the mankind
the people of islam dressed in their pilgrim white
all equal before god
all united in this place of crowd
each individual soul joined in a community of worship
one god
