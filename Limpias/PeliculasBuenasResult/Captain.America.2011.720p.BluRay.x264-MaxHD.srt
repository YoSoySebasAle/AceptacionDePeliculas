this landscape changing all the time

i think that you are a man of great vision
and in this way we are much alike
i am nothing like you
no of course but
what others see as superstition
you and i know to be a science
what you seek is just a legend

an effort to conceal it
the tesseract was the jewel
of odin treasure room

but
i think it is close yes
i cannot help you
no
but maybe you can help your village

some some little
grandchildren perhaps

yes
i dont want to kill anyone
i dont like bullies

only a chance
i will take it
good
so where is the little guy from
actually
brooklyn
congratulations soldier
are you ready dr zola
my machine requires
the most delicate calibration
forgive me if i seem overcautious
are you certain
that those conductors of yours
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference
with this artifact
i am certain of nothing
i fear it may not work at all
twenty percent
forty
sixty
stabilizing at 70%
i have not come all this way
for safety doctor
what was that
i must congratulate you arnim
your designs do not disappoint
though they may require
some slight reinforcement
the exchange is stable
amazing
the energy we have just collected
could power my designs
all my designs
this will change the war
dr zola
this will change the world
ready exercise
recruits attention
gentlemen i am agent carter
i supervise all operations
for this division
what with the accent
queen victoria
i thought i was signing up
for the us army
what your name soldier
gilmore hodge your majesty
step forward hodge
put your right foot forward
we going to wrassle
because i got a few moves
i know you will like
agent carter
colonel phillips
i can see that you are breaking
in the candidates
that good
get your ass up out of that dirt
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do
yes sir
general patton
has said
wars are fought with weapons
but they are won by men
we are going to win this war
because we have the best men
and because they are going
to get better
much
better
the strategic scientific reserve
is an allied effort
made up of
the best minds in the free world
our goal
is to create the best army in history
but every army starts with one man
rogers
get off of there
at the end of this week
we will choose that man
he will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier
rogers
get that rifle out of the mud
and they
will personally escort adolf hitler
to the gates of hell
pick up the pace ladies
let go let go
double time
come on
faster faster
move move
squad halt
that flag means
were only at the halfway point
first man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with agent carter
move move
come on
get up there
if that all you got
this army in trouble
get up there hodge
come on
get up there
nobody got that flag in 7 years
now fall back into line
come on fall in
let go
get back into formation
rogers
i said fall in
thank you sir
faster ladies come on
my grandmother has more life in her
god rest her soul
move it
youre not really thinking
about picking rogers are you
i am more than just thinking about it
he is the clear choice
when you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base
i let it slide
i thought what the hell
maybe hed be useful to you
like a gerbil
i never thought youd pick him
up
you stick a needle in that kid arm
it going to go right through him
come on girls
look at that
he making me cry
i am looking for qualities
beyond the physical
do you know how long it took
to set up this project
all the groveling i had to do
in front of senator what his name
committees
brandt yes i know
i am well aware of your efforts
then throw me a bone
hodge passed every test we gave him
he big he fast
he obeys orders
he a soldier
he is a bully
you dont win wars with niceness doctor
you win wars
with guts
grenade
get away
get back
it was a dummy grenade
all clear
back in formation
is this a test
he still skinny
may i
yeah
cant sleep
i got the jitters i guess
me too
can i ask you a question
just one
why me
i suppose that is
the only question that matters
this is from augsburg
my city
so many people forget that the first
country the nazis invaded was their own
you know after the last war
my people struggled they
they felt weak they felt
small
and then hitler comes along
with the marching
and the big show and the flags
and he
he hears of me
my work and he finds me
and he says you
he says you will make us strong
well
i am not interested
so he sends the head of hydra
his research division
a brilliant scientist by the name
of johann schmidt
now schmidt is a member
of the inner circle
and he is ambitious
he and hitler share a passion for
occult power and teutonic myth
hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers
but for schmidt it is not fantasy
for him it is real
he has become convinced that there is
a great power hidden in the earth
left here by the gods
waiting to be seized
by a superior man
so when he hears about
my formula and what it can do
he cannot resist
schmidt must become
that superior man
did it make him stronger
yes
but there were other effects
the serum was not ready
but more important
the man
the serum amplifies everything
that is inside so
good becomes great
bad becomes worse
this is why you were chosen
because a strong man
who has known power all his life
may lose respect for that power
but a weak man
knows the value of strength
and knows
compassion
thanks
i think
whatever happens tomorrow
you must promise me one thing
that you will stay who you are
not a perfect soldier
but
a good man
to the little guys
no no wait wait
what i am doing
no you have procedure tomorrow
no fluids
alright
we will drink it after
no i dont have procedure tomorrow
drink it after i drink it now
is there something
in particular you need
i
i understand you found him
see for yourself
you disapprove
i just dont see
why you need concern yourself
i cant imagine he will succeed
again
his serum is the allies only defense
against this power we now possess
if we take it away from them
then our victory is assured
shall i give the order
it has been given
good
dr zola
what do you think
a masterpiece
i know this neighborhood
i got beat up in that alley
and that parking lot
and behind that diner
did you have something
against running away
you start running
they will never let you stop
you stand up you push back
they cant say no forever right
i know a little of what that like
to have every door shut in your face
i guess i just dont know
why youd want to join the army
if you were a beautiful dame
or a beauti a woman
an agent not a dame
you are beautiful but
you have no idea
how to talk to a woman do you
i think this is the longest conversation
i have had with one
women arent exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on
you must have danced
well asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying
and the past few years it just
didnt seem to matter that much
i figured id wait
for what
the right partner
this way
what are we doing here
follow me
wonderful weather this morning isnt it
yes but i always carry an umbrella
good morning
please not now
are you ready
good
take off your shirt
your tie and your hat
senator brandt glad you could make it
why exactly am i in brooklyn
we needed access
to the city power grid
of course if youd given me
the generators i requisitioned
a lot of people are
asking for funds colonel
this is clem
fred clemson state department
if this project of yours comes through
wed like to see it used
for something other than headlines
jesus
somebody get that kid a sandwich
comfortable
it a little big
you save me any of that schnapps
not as much as i should have
sorry
next time
mr stark
how are your levels
levels at 00%
good
we may dim half the lights in brooklyn
but we are ready
as we will ever be
agent carter
dont you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth
yes of course sorry
good
do you hear me
is this on
ladies and gentlemen
today we take not another step
towards annihilation
but the first step
on the path to peace
we begin with a series of microinjections
into the
subject major muscle groups
the serum infusion
will cause immediate cellular change
and then
to stimulate growth
the subject will be saturated
with vita-rays
that wasnt so bad
that was penicillin
serum infusion
beginning in
five
four
three
two
one
now mr stark
steven
can you hear me
it probably too late
to go to the bathroom right
we will proceed
that 0%
twenty percent
thirty
that 40%
vital signs are normal
that 50%
sixty
seventy
steven
steven
shut it down
steven
shut it down
kill the reactor mr stark
turn it off kill it kill the reactor
no
dont
i can do this
eighty
ninety
that 00%
mr stark
steven steven
the son of a bitch did it
i did it
yeah yeah
i think we did it
you actually did it
how do you feel
taller
you look taller
how do you like brooklyn now senator
i can think of some folks in berlin
who are about to get very nervous
congratulations doctor
thank you sir
stop him
stop him we have it
what are you doing
buddy are you alright
hey this guy been shot
i had him
sorry
i am sorry
no no
not my son
stop it
dont hurt him
get back
let me go
no
let go of my son
dont hurt him
wait dont dont
no dont
go get him
i can swim
who the hell are you
the first of many
cut off one head
two more shall take its place
hail hydra
the fuhrer is not accustomed
to being ignored herr schmidt
he funds your research because
you promised him weapons
you serve at his pleasure
he gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries
reward call it what it is exile
i no longer reflect his image
of aryan perfection
you think this is about appearances
your hydra division has failed
to deliver so much
as a rifle in over a year
and we had learned
through local intelligence
you had mounted a full-scale
incursion into norway
the fuhrer feels how does he put it
the red skull has been
indulged long enough
gentlemen
you have come to see
the results of our work
let me show you
hitler speaks of a 000-year reich
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month
his troops spill their blood
across every field in europe
but still he is no
closer to achieving his goals
and i suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic
science
but i understand your confusion
great power has always
baffled primitive men
hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke
wherever they are
regardless of how many
forces they possess
all in a matter of hours
your enemies
my weapons contain
enough destructive power
to decimate every hostile capital on earth
quite simply gentlemen
i have harnessed the power of the gods
thank you schmidt
for what
for making it clear
how obviously mad you are
berlin is on this map
so it is
you will be punished
for your insolence
you will be brought before
the fuhrer himself
schmidt
my apologies doctor
but we both knew hydra could grow
no further in hitler shadow
hail hydra
hail hydra
hail hydra
think you got enough
any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code
but without dr erskine
it would take years
he deserved more than this
if it could work only once
hed be proud it was you
colonel phillips
my committee is demanding answers
great
why dont we start with how a german spy
got a ride to my secret installation in your car
what have we got here
speaking modestly i am the best
mechanical engineer in this country
but i dont know what
inside this thing
or how it works
were not even close to this technology
then who is
hydra
i am sure you have been
reading our briefings
i am on a number
of committees colonel
hydra is the nazi deep science division
it led by johann schmidt
but he has much bigger ambitions
hydra is practically a cult
they worship schmidt
they think he invincible
so what are you going to do about it
i spoke to the president this morning
as of today the ssr is being retasked
colonel
we are taking the fight to hydra
pack your bags agent carter
you too stark
were flying to london tonight
sir
if youre going after schmidt i want in
youre an experiment
youre going to alamogordo
the serum worked
i asked for an army and all i got was you
you
are not enough
with all due respect to the colonel
i think we may be missing the point
i have seen you in action steve
more importantly
the country seen it
paper
the enlistment lines have been around the
block since your picture hit the newsstands
you dont take a soldier
a symbol like that and
hide him in a lab
son
do you want to serve your country
on the most important battlefield of the war
sir
that all i want
then congratulations
you just got promoted
i dont know if i can do this
nothing to it you sell a few bonds
bonds buy bullets bullets kill nazis
ping ping poom
youre an american hero
it just not how i pictured getting there
the senator has got
a lot of pull up on the hill
you play ball with us
you will be leading
your own platoon in no time
take the shield
go
who strong and brave
here to save the american way
not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank
but there is still a way all of us can fight
who vows to fight like a man
for what right night and day
series e defense bonds
each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy gun
who will campaign door to door for america
carry the flag shore to shore for america
from hoboken to spokane
the star-spangled man with a plan
cut
guys dont look at the camera
we cant ignore there is a threat
and a war we must win
each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy gun
who will hang a noose on the
goose-stepping goons from berlin
who will redeem heed the call for america
who will rise or fall give his all for america
who here to prove that we can
the star-spangled man with a plan
we all know this is about trying
to win the war
we cant do that without bullets
and bandages tanks and tents
that where you come in
every bond you buy
will help protect someone you love
turn around
he right behind you
keep our boys armed and ready
and the germans will think twice
about trying to get the drop on us
stalwart and steady and true
forceful and ready to defend
the red white and blue
who will give the axis the sack
and is smart as a fox
far as an eagle will soar
who making adolf
afraid to step out of his box
he knows what were fighting for
who waked the giant that napped in america
we know it no one but captain america
who will finish what they began
hi
who will kick the krauts to japan
the star-spangled man
with a
plan
how many of you are ready
to help me sock old adolf on the jaw
ok
i need a volunteer
i already volunteered
how do you think i got here
bring back the girls
i think they only know
the one song but
wait i will see what i can do
you do that sweetheart
nice boots tinker bell
come on guys
were all on the same team here
hey captain
sign this
bring back the girls
dont worry pal
they will warm up to you
dont worry
hello steve
hi
hi
what are you doing here
officially i am not here at all
that was quite a performance
yeah
i had to improvise a little bit
the crowds i am used
to are usually more
twelve
i understand youre
america new hope
bond sales take a 0% bump
in every state i visit
is that senator brandt i hear
at least he got me doing this
phillips would have had me stuck in a lab
and these are your
only two options
a lab rat or a dancing monkey
you were meant for more
than this you know
what
you know for the longest time
i dreamed about
coming overseas and
being on the front lines
serving my country
i finally got everything i wanted
and i am wearing tights
they look like they have been
through hell
these men more than most
schmidt sent out a force to azzano
two hundred men went up
against him
and less than 50 returned
your audience contained
what was left of the 07th
the rest were killed or captured
the 07th
what
come on
colonel phillips
well if it isnt the star spangled
man with a plan
what your plan today
i need the casualty list from azzano
you dont get to give me orders son
i just need one name
sergeant james barnes from the 07th
you and i are going to have a
conversation later that you wont enjoy
please tell me if he alive sir b-a-r
i can spell
i have signed more of these condolence
letters today than i would care to count
but
the name does sound familiar
i am sorry
what about the others
are you planning a rescue mission
yes it called winning the war
but if you know where they are
why not at least
theyre 30 miles behind the lines
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in europe
wed lose more men than wed save
but i dont expect you to understand
that because youre a chorus girl
i think i understand just fine
well then understand it somewhere else
if i read the posters correctly
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes
yes sir
i do
if you have something to say right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself
what do you plan to do walk to austria
if that what it takes
you heard the colonel
your friend is most likely dead
you dont know that
even so he devising a strategy
if he detects
by the time he done that
it could be too late
steve
you told me you thought i was
meant for more than this
did you mean that
every word
then you got to let me go
i can do more than that
on stage girls
five minutes
where my helmet
anyone seen rogers
the hydra camp is in krausberg
tucked between these
two mountain ranges
it a factory of some kind
we should be able to drop
you right on the doorstep
just get me as close as you can
you two are going to be
in a lot of trouble when you land
and you wont
where i am going if anybody yells
at me i can just shoot them
they will undoubtedly shoot back
well let hope it good for something
agent carter
if were not in too much of a hurry
i thought we could stop off
in lucerne for a late-night fondue
stark is the best civilian pilot
i have ever seen
he mad enough to brave this airspace
were lucky to have him
so are you two
do you
fondue
this is your transponder
activate it when youre ready
and the signal will lead us
straight to you
are you sure this thing works
it been tested more than you pal
get back here
were taking you all the way in
as soon as i am clear you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here
you cant give me orders
the hell i cant
i am a captain
as you can see
production of the valkyrie
is progressing on schedule
even with components of this size
increase the output by 60%
and see to it our other facilities
do the same
but
these prisoners i
i am not sure they have the strength
then use up what strength
they have left doctor
there are always more workers
not now
you know fritz
one of these days
i am going to have a stick of my own

i thought you were dead
i thought you were smaller
come on
what happened to you
i joined the army
did it hurt
a little
is this permanent
so far
captain america
how exciting
i am a great fan of your films
so dr erskine managed it after all
not exactly an improvement but
still
impressive
you have got no idea
havent i
no matter what lies erskine told you
you see i was his greatest success
you dont have one of those do you
you are deluded captain
you pretend to be a simple soldier
but in reality
you are just afraid to admit that
we have left humanity behind
unlike you i embrace it proudly
without fear
then how come youre running
come on let go up
sir are we going to the roof
what about me
where will i sit
not a scratch doctor
not a scratch
let go
one at a time
got to be a rope or something
just go
get out of here
no not without you
hell
senator brandt i
regret to report that captain steven g rogers
went missing behind enemy lines on the
third
aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful
as a result
i must declare captain rogers
killed in action period
the last surveillance flight is back
no sign of activity
go get a cup of coffee corporal
yes sir
i cant touch stark
he rich
and he the army number one
weapons contractor
you are neither one
with respect sir
i dont regret my actions
and i dont think
captain rogers did either
what makes you think
i give a damn about your opinions
i took a chance with you agent carter
and now america golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead
because you had a crush
it wasnt that
i had faith
well i hope that a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down
what the hell going on out there
look who it is
some of these men
need medical attention
medic we got wounded
right over here
id like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action
that wont be necessary
yes sir
faith
youre late
couldnt call my ride
hey
let hear it for captain america
i am honored to present
this medal for valor
to my personal friend
captain america
captain america
captain that your cue
i thought hed be taller
the fifth one was here in poland
right near the baltic
and the sixth one was
about here
30 40 miles west of the maginot line
i just got a quick look
well nobody perfect
these are the weapon factories
we know about
sergeant barnes said that hydra shipped all
the parts to another facility that isnt on this map
agent carter coordinate with mi6
i want every allied eyeball
looking for that main hydra base
what about us
we are going to set a fire
under johann schmidt ass
what do you say rogers
it your map you think
you can wipe hydra off it
yes sir
i will need a team
were already putting together
the best men
with all due respect sir
so am i
so let get this straight
we barely got out of there alive
and you want us to go back
pretty much
sounds rather
fun actually
i am in
i will fight until the last of these
bastards are dead
chained or crying like a little baby
i hope the three
me too
were in
hell i will always fight
but you got to do one thing for me
what that
open a tab
well that was easy
another round
where are they putting all this stuff
see
i told you
theyre all idiots
how about you
you ready to follow captain america
into the jaws of death
hell no
that little guy from brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight
i am following him
but youre keeping the outfit right
you know what
it kind of growing on me
captain
agent carter
maam
howard has some equipment
for you to try
tomorrow morning
sounds good
i see your top squad is prepping for duty
you dont like music
i do actually
i might even when
this is all over go dancing
then what are we waiting for
the right partner
0800 captain
yes maam
i will be there
i am invisible
i am turning into you
it like a horrible dream
dont take it so hard
maybe she got a friend
emission signature is unusual
alpha and beta ray neutral
though i doubt rogers
picked up on that
seems harmless enough
hard to see what all the fuss is about
write that down
excuse me
i am looking for mr stark
he in with colonel phillips
of course youre welcome to wait
i
read about what you did
tthe yeah
well that you know
just doing what needed to be done
sounded like more than that
you saved nearly 400 men
really it not a big deal
tell that to their wives
i dont think they were all married
youre a hero
well that no
that depends on the definition really
the women of america
they owe you their thanks
and seeing as theyre not here
captain
were ready for you
if youre not otherwise occupied
agent carter wait
looks like finding a partner
wasnt that hard after all
peggy that not
what you thought it was
i dont think anything captain
not one thing
you always wanted to be a soldier
and now you are
just like all the rest
well what about you and stark
how do i know you two havent been
fondue-ing
you still dont know
a bloody thing about women
fondue is just cheese and bread
my friend
really
i didnt think
nor should you pal
the moment you think you know
what going on in a woman head
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked
me i concentrate on work
which at the moment
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed
carbon polymer
should withstand your average
german bayonet
although hydra not going
to attack you with a pocket knife
i hear youre
kind of attached
it handier than you might think
i took the liberty of coming up
with some options
this one fun
she been fitted with
electrical relays
that allow you to
what about this one
no no that just a prototype
what it made of
vibranium
it stronger than steel
and a third the weight
it completely vibration absorbent
how come it not standard issue
that the rarest metal on earth
what youre holding there
that all we have got
you quite finished mr stark
i am sure the captain
has some unfinished business
what do you think
yes i think it works
i had some ideas about the uniform
whatever you want pal
you are failing
we are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet
yet we are continually delayed because
you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield
this is hardly my area of expertise
i i merely developed the weapons
i cannot fire them
finish your mission doctor
before the american finishes his
sir
i am sorry herr schmidt
we fought to the last man
evidently not
remember when i made you ride
the cyclone at coney island
yeah and i threw up
this isnt payback is it
now why would i do that
we were right dr zola on the train
hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle
wherever he going
they must need him bad
let get going because
theyre moving like the devil
we only got about
a 0 second window
you miss that window
were bugs on a windshield
mind the gap
better get moving bugs
now
go
stop him
fire again
i had him on the ropes
i know you did
get down
fire again
kill him now
bucky
hang on
grab my hand
now
sit down
what is this
steak
what is in it
cow
doctor do you realize
how difficult it is
to get ahold of a prime cut
like that out here
i dont eat meat
why not
it disagrees with me
how about cyanide
does that give you the rumbly tummy too
every hydra agent that
we have tried to take alive
has crunched a little pill
before we can stop him
but not you
so
here is my brilliant theory
you want to live
youre trying to intimidate me colonel
i bought you dinner
given the valuable information
he has provided
and in exchange
for his full cooperation
dr zola is being remanded
to switzerland
i sent that message
to washington this morning
of course it was encoded
you guys havent broken
those codes have you
that would be awkward
schmidt will know this is a lie
he going to kill you anyway doc
youre a liability
you know more about
schmidt than anyone
and
the last guy you cost us
was captain rogers closest friend
so i wouldnt count on
the very best of protection
it you or schmidt
it just the hand you have been dealt
schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods
only the world itself will satisfy him
you do realize that nuts dont you
what
the sanity of the plan
is of no consequence
and why is that
because he can do it
what his target
his target
is everywhere
tomorrow
hydra will stand master of the world
borne to victory
on the wings of the valkyrie
our enemies weapons
will be powerless against us
if they shoot down one plane
hundreds more will rain fire upon them
if they cut off one head
two more shall take its place
hail hydra
hail hydra
hail hydra
hail hydra hail hydra
hail hydra hail hydra
hail hydra hail hydra
blackout is still in effect
throughout the london area
please wait for the all-clear
your attention please
all citizens shall remain
indoors until further notice
blackout is still in effect
throughout the london area
dr erskine said that
the serum wouldnt
just affect my muscles
it would affect my cells
create a protective system
of regeneration and healing
which means
i cant get drunk
did you know that
your metabolism burns four times
faster than the average person
he thought it could be
one of the side effects
it wasnt your fault
did you read the report
yes
then you know that not true
you did everything you could
did you believe in your friend
did you respect him
then stop blaming yourself
allow barnes the dignity of his choice
he damn well must have thought
you were worth it
i am going after schmidt
i am not going to stop until all
of hydra is dead or captured
you wont be alone
johann schmidt belongs in a bughouse
he thinks he a god
and he willing to blow up
half the world to prove it
starting with the usa
schmidt working with powers
beyond our capabilities
he gets across the atlantic
he will wipe out
the entire eastern seaboard in an hour
how much time we got
according to my new best friend
under 24 hours
where is he now
hydra last base is here
in the alps 500 feet below the surface
so what are we supposed to do
i mean it not like
we can just knock on the front door
why not
that exactly what were going to do
arrogance may not be
a uniquely american trait
but i must say
you do it better than anyone
but there are limits
to what even you can do captain
or did erskine tell you otherwise
he told me you were insane
he resented my genius
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine
but he gave you everything
so
what made you so special
nothing
i am just a kid from brooklyn
i can do this all day
of course you can of course
but unfortunately
i am on a tight schedule
so am i
rogers
you might need this
thanks
were in
assault team go
move out
move
keep your spacing
cut off one head two more shall
let go find two more
youre late
werent you about to
right
get in
keep it steady
wait
go get him
i am not kissing you
you dont give up do you
nope
you could have the power of the gods
yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations
i have seen the future captain
there are no flags
not my future
what have you done
no
come in this is captain rogers
do you read me
captain rogers what is your
steve is that you
are you alright
peggy schmidt dead
what about the plane
that a little bit tougher to explain
give me your coordinates
i will find you a safe landing site
there not going to be a safe landing
but i can try and force it down
ok i will get howard on the line
he will know what to do
there not enough time
this thing moving too fast
and it heading for new york
i got to put her in the water
please dont do this
we have time we can work it out
right now i am in
the middle of nowhere
if i wait any longer
a lot of people are going to die
peggy
this is my choice
peggy
i am here
i am going to need a rain check
on that dance

play something slow
id hate to step on your
steve

steve
to the captain
sir
take us to the next grid point
but there is no trace of wreckage
and the energy signature stops here
just keep looking
curve ball
high and outside for ball one
so the dodgers are tied 4-4
and the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat
this fellow capable of making it
a brand-new game again
just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at ebbets field
the phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4
but the dodgers have three men on
pearson beaned reiser
in philadelphia last month
wouldnt the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor
pete leans in
here the pitch
swung on
a line to the right
and it gets past rizzo
three runs will score
reiser heads to third
durocher going to wave him in
here comes the relay
but they wont get him
good morning
or should i say afternoon
where am i
youre in a recovery room
in new york city
the dodgers take the lead 8-4
oh dodgers
everyone is on their feet
