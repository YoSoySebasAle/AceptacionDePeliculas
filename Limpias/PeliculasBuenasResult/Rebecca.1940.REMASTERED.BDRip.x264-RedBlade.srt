
last night
i dreamt i went to manderley again
it seemed to me i stood by the iron gate
leading to the drive
and for a while i could not enter
for the way was barred to me
then like all dreamers
i was possessed of a sudden
with supernatural powers
and passed like a spirit
through the barrier before me
the drive wound away in front of me
twisting and turning
as it had always done
but as i advanced i was aware
that a change had come upon it
nature had come into her own again
and little by little
had encroached upon the drive
with long tenacious fingers
on and on wound the poor thread
that had once been our drive
and finally there was manderley
manderley ‒ secretive and silent
time could not mar
the perfect symmetry of those walls
moonlight can play
odd tricks upon the fancy
and suddenly it seemed to me
that light came from the windows
and then a cloud came upon the moon
and hovered an instant
like a dark hand before a face
the illusion went with it
i looked upon a desolate shell
with no whisper of the past
about its staring walls
we can never go back to manderley again
that much is certain
but sometimes in my dreams
i do go back to
the strange days of my life
which began for me
in the south of france
no stop
what the devil are you shouting about
who are you what are you staring at
im sorry i didnt mean to stare
but i i only thought ‒
oh you did did you
well what are you doing here
i was only walking
well get on with your walking
dont hang about here screaming
ill never come to monte carlo
out of season again
not a single well-known
personality in the hotel
stone cold waiter
garçon call him
tell him to get me some ‒
why it max de winter
how do you do
how do you do
im edith van hopper
it so nice to run into you here
just when i was beginning to despair
of finding any old friends here in monte
but do sit down
and have some coffee
mr de winter is having coffee with me
ask that stupid waiter for another cup
im afraid i must contradict you
you shall both have coffee with me
garçon coffee please
oui monsieur
a cigarette
no thank you
you know i recognized you
just as soon as you came in
though i havent seen you since
that night at the casino at palm beach
perhaps you dont remember
an old woman like me
are you playing the tables much
here at monte
no im afraid that sort of thing
ceased to amuse me years ago
i can well understand that
as for me if i had a home like manderley
i should certainly never come to monte
i hear it one of the biggest places
in that part of the country
and you just cant beat it for beauty
what do you think of monte carlo
or dont you think of it at all
oh well i think it rather artificial
she spoiled mr de winter
that her trouble
most girls would give their eyes
for a chance to see monte
wouldnt that rather defeat the purpose
now that weve found each other again
i hope i shall see something of you
you must come and have a drink in my suite
i hope theyve given you a good room
the place is empty so if youre
uncomfortable mind you make a fuss
your valet has unpacked for you
i suppose
im afraid i dont possess one
perhaps youd like to do it for me
well i i hardly think ‒
perhaps you could make yourself useful
to mr de winter if he wants anything done
youre a capable child in many ways
that a charming suggestion
but im afraid i cling to the old motto
he travels fastest who travels alone
perhaps youve not heard of it
good night
what do you make of that
do you suppose that sudden departure
was intended to be funny
come dont sit there gawking
let go upstairs
have you got the key
yes mrs van hopper
i remember when i was younger
there was a well-known writer
who used to dart down the back way
whenever he saw me coming
i suppose he was in love with me
and wasnt quite sure of himself
well cest la vie
by the way my dear
dont think that i mean to be unkind
but you were just a teeny weeny bit
forward with mr de winter
your effort to enter the conversation
quite embarrassed me
and im sure it did him
men loathe that sort of thing
oh come dont sulk
after all i am responsible
for your behavior here
perhaps he didnt notice it
poor thing
i suppose he just cant
get over his wife death
they say he simply adored her
louis
oh how awkward of me
what a stupid thing to do
oh im so sorry
please dont bother
it doesnt really matter
leave that leave that
go and lay another place at my table
mademoiselle will have lunch with me
oh but i couldnt possibly
why not
oh please dont be polite
it very kind of you but ill be all right
if they just change the cloth
i wasnt being polite
i should have asked you to have lunch with me
even if you hadnt upset the vase so clumsily
come along we neednt talk to
each other if we dont feel like it
thank you very much
oh ill just ha-have
s-some scrambled eggs
oui mademoiselle
what happened to your friend
oh she ill in bed with a cold
im sorry i was so rude to you yesterday
the only excuse i can offer is that
ive become boorish through living alone
you werent really
you simply wanted to be alone and ‒
tell me is mrs van hopper
a friend of yours or just a relation
no she my employer
im what is known as a paid companion
i didnt know companionship
could be bought
i looked up the word companion
in the dictionary once
it said a friend of the bosom
i dont envy you the privilege
oh she very kind really
and i have to earn my living
havent you any family
no my mother died years and years ago
and then there was only my father
and he died last summer
and then i took this job
how rotten for you
yes it was rather because
you see we got on so well together
you and your father
yes he was a lovely person
very unusual
what was he
a painter
ah was he a good one
well i thought so
but people didnt understand him
yes that often the trouble
he painted trees
at least it was one tree
you mean he painted the same tree
over and over again
yes you see he had a theory that if you should
find one perfect thing or place or person
you should stick to it
do you think that very silly
not at all
im a firm believer in that myself
and what did you find to do with yourself
while he was painting his tree
oh i sat with him and i sketched a little
i dont do it very well though
youre going sketching this afternoon
yes
where
i havent made up my mind
ill drive you somewhere in the car
oh no please i didnt mean ‒
oh nonsense
finish up that mess and well get along
thank you it very kind of you
but im not very hungry
oh come on
eat it up like a good girl
youve taken long enough for that sketch
i shall expect a really fine work of art
oh no dont look at it
it not nearly good enough
well it cant be as bad as all that
dont rub it all out let me see it first
it the perspective i never can get it right
let me see
oh dear tell me is it the perspective
that gives my nose
that curious twist in the middle
well youre not a very easy subject to sketch
no
your expression keeps changing all the time
does it
well id concentrate on
the view instead if i were you
much more worthwhile
it rather reminds me of our coastline at home
do you know cornwall at all
yes i went there once
with my father on holiday
i was in a shop once
and i saw a postcard
with a beautiful house on it
right by the sea
and i asked whose house it was
and the old lady said that manderley
i felt ashamed for not knowing
manderley is beautiful
to me it just the place
where i was born
and have lived in all my life
but now i dont suppose
i shall ever see it again
were lucky not to be home
during the bad weather arent we
hmm
i cant ever remember enjoying swimming
in england until june can you
the water so warm here
that i could stay in all day
there a dangerous undertow
and there was a man drowned here last year
i never have any fear of drowning
have you
come ill take you home
oh yes i know
mr de winter well i knew his wife too
before she married she was
the beautiful rebecca hildreth you know
she was drowned poor dear
while she was sailing near manderley
he never talks about it of course
but he a broken man
i suppose id better have it
wretched stuff
give me a chocolate quick
oh there you are it about time
hurry up i want to play some rummy
she was
the beautiful rebecca hildreth you know
they say he simply adored her
she was the beautiful
rebecca hildreth you know
i suppose he just cant
get over his wife death
she was the beautiful
rebecca hildreth you know
but he a broken man
bonjour
well where are you going
oh i thought id take a tennis lesson
i see
i suppose youve had a look at the pro
and he desperately handsome
and youve conceived
a schoolgirl crush on him
all right go ahead
make the most of it
off duty
oh yes
mrs van hopper cold has turned into flu
so she got a trained nurse
im sorry for the nurse you keen on tennis
no not particularly
that good well go for a drive
good afternoon mrs van hopper
how are you feeling
you got on rather well with him didnt you
that pro must have been
teaching you other things than tennis
hurry up
i want you to make some calls
i wonder if mr de winter
is still in the hotel
may i go now
for the number of lessons youve had
you ought to be ready for wimbledon
but this will be your last
so make the most of it
the trouble is with me laid up like this
you havent had enough to do
but im getting rid of that nurse today
and from now on youll stick to your job
yes mrs van hopper
nurse
yes mrs van hopper
are you absolutely sure you left
those messages for mr de winter
why yes madame
i simply cant believe it
he would most certainly
have called me back
oh well poor boy
i simply hate to see him so alone
you know i
i wish there could be an invention
that bottled up the memory like perfume
and it never faded never got stale
then whenever i wanted to
i could uncork the bottle
and live the memory all over again
and what particular moment in your young life
would you want to keep
oh all of them
all these last few days
i feel as though id id collected
a whole shelf full of bottles
sometimes you know
those little bottles contain demons
that have a way of popping out at you just
as youre trying most desperately to forget
stop biting your nails
oh i wish i were a woman of 36
dressed in black satin
with a string of pearls
you wouldnt be
here with me if you were
would you please tell me mr de winter
why you asked me to come out with you
oh it obvious
that you want to be kind
but why do you choose me
for your charity
i asked you to come out with me
because i wanted your company
youve blotted out the past for me more
than all the bright lights of monte carlo
but if you think i just asked you
out of kindness or charity
you can leave the car now
and find your own way home
go on open the door and get out
better blow your nose
thank you
please dont call me mr de winter
i have a very impressive
array of first names
george fortescue maximilian
but you neednt bother with them all at once
my family call me maxim
and another thing
please promise me
never to wear black satin or pearls
or to be 36 years old
yes maxim
for the love of pete come here
what do you think
my daughter engaged to be married
oh really how nice
we must leave for new york at once

and well take the 230 train for cherbourg

waiting outside in her car
would you ask her
with my compliments
if shed very kindly come up
and see me in my room
yes in my room
mr de winter says please
for you to come up to his room
mr de winter why certainly
this isnt at all
your idea of a proposal is it
it should be in a conservatory
you in a white frock
with a red rose in your hand
and a violin playing in the distance
and i should be making violent
love to you behind a palm tree
poor darling never mind
oh i dont mind
dont worry dont worry
you wont have to say a word
im so glad you called me
mr de winter
i was making a hasty departure
it was so rude of me not to let you know
but a cable came
this morning announcing
that my daughter
is engaged to be married
that rather a coincidence
mrs van hopper
i asked you up here in order
to tell you of my engagement
you dont mean it
oh how perfectly wonderful
how romantic
who is the lucky lady
i apologize for depriving you
of your companion in this abrupt way
i do hope it wont
inconvenience you too greatly
when did all this happen
just now mrs van hopper
just a few minutes ago
i simply cant believe it
i suppose i ought to scold you for not
having breathed a word of all this to me
what am i thinking of
i shall give you both
my congratulations and my blessings
im very happy for you both
when and where is the wedding to be
here as soon as possible
a whirlwind romance splendid
i could easily postpone my sailing for a week
this poor child has no mother
so i shall take responsibility
for all the arrangements ‒
trousseau reception and everything
and ill give the bride away
but our luggage
go down and tell the porter to
take everything out of the car
just a minute
were most grateful mrs van hopper
but i think wed both prefer
to have it as quiet as possible
and i couldnt possibly allow you
to change your sailing plans
oh but ‒
no no no
dear ill go down and see
that your luggage is brought back
thank you maxim
so this is what been happening
during my illness
tennis lessons my foot
i suppose i have to hand it to you
for a fast worker
how did you manage it
still waters certainly run deep
tell me have you been doing
anything you shouldnt
i dont know what you mean
oh well never mind i always did say
that englishmen have strange tastes
but you certainly have your work cut out
as mistress of manderley
to be perfectly frank with you my dear
i cant see you doing it
you havent the experience
you havent the faintest idea
what it means to be a great lady
of course you know why
he marrying you dont you
you havent flattered yourself
that he in love with you
the fact is that empty house
got on his nerves to such an extent
he nearly went off his head
he just couldnt go on living alone
youd better leave mrs van hopper
youll miss your train
mrs de winter
good-bye my dear and good luck
monsieur vous avez oublié
votre carnet de mariage
he says ive forgotten
the proof that were married
good heavens
ah somebody else had the same idea
isnt she sweet
yes
youd have liked a bridal veil
wouldnt you
or at least ‒
madame madame
combien ça fait tout le tout
je vous remercie mille fois
merci
merci
oh maxim how lovely
oh how perfectly lovely
oh perfectly lovely

for very long madam
it usual for ladies in your position
to have a personal maid
i hope you approve the new decoration
of these rooms madam
oh i didnt know
it had been changed
i hope you havent been
to too much trouble
i only followed out
mr de winter instructions
oh well what did it look like before
it had an old paper
and different hangings
it was never used much
except for occasional visitors
oh then it wasnt
mr de winter room originally
no madam he never used
the east wing before
of course there no view
of the sea from here
the only good view of the sea
is from the west wing
the room very charming
and im sure ill be comfortable
if there anything you want done
madam you have only to tell me
i suppose youve been at manderley
for many years longer than anyone else
not so long as frith he was here
when the old gentleman was living
when mr de winter was a boy
oh i see
and you didnt come till after that
i came here when
the first mrs de winter was a bride
mrs danvers
i do hope well be friends
you must be patient with me
this sort of life is new to me
and i do want to make a success of it
and make mr de winter happy
so i know i can leave
all the household arrangements to you
very well i hope i shall do everything
to your satisfaction madam
ive managed the house
since mrs de winter death
and mr de winter
has never complained
i think ill go downstairs now
that room in the west wing i was
telling you about is there through that door
it not used now
it the most beautiful
room in the house ‒
the only one that looks down
across the lawns to the sea
it was mrs de winter room
good morning
good morning

awfully glad to meet you
there a fearful lot of stuff
piled up while maxim was away
yes im sure there must have been
i do wish i could help with some of it

frank never allows anybody to help him
he like an old mother hen
with his bills and rents and taxes
come on frank we must go over these estimates
ill get my papers
youll find quantities
of breakfast over there
but you must eat it all
or cook will be mortally offended

i have to go over the place with frank
to make sure he hasnt lost any of it
but youll be all right wont you
mm-hmm

on what the matter with english cricket
oh uh yes um ‒
my sister beatrice and her husband giles lacy
have invited themselves over for lunch
today
yes
i suppose the old girl
cant wait to look you over

in time to protect you from her
good-bye darling
good-bye maxim
good-bye
good-bye
good morning madam
good morning frith

i could get for you madam
oh no thank you frith
im really not very hungry
thank you
the paper madam
oh yes thank you frith
madam
i slipped
oh thank you frith
it big isnt it
yes madam manderley is a big place
this was the banquet hall
in the old days
it still used on great occasions
such as a big dinner or a ball
and the public is admitted here
you know once a week
that nice
i beg pardon madam
im afraid the fire is not usually
lit in the library until the afternoon
but youll find one
in the morning room
of course if you wish
this fire lit now madam ‒
oh no frith
i wouldnt dream of it
uh mrs de winter ‒
i mean the late mrs de winter always
did her correspondence and telephoning
in the morning room after breakfast
thank you frith
is anything wrong madam
oh no
uh which way is the morning room
oh it that door there on the left
oh yes thank you
mrs de winter
oh im afraid youve made a mistake
mrs de winter
been dead for over a year
oh i mean i ‒
oh
that was the house telephone madam
probably the head gardener
wishing instructions
did you want to see me mrs danvers
mr de winter informed me that
his sister mrs lacy and major lacy
are expected for luncheon
id like to know
if you approve of the menu
oh well i-im sure
it very suitable very nice indeed
youll notice madam that
ive left a blank space for the sauce
mrs de winter was most
particular about sauces
let have whatever you think
that mrs de winter would have ordered
thank you madam
when youve finished your letters
robert will take them to the post
my let ‒ my letters
oh yes of course
thank you mrs danvers
how are you frith
good morning mrs lacy
where mr de winter
i believe he went down to the farm
with mr crawley
how tiresome of him not to be here
when we arrive and how typical
i must say old danvers
keeps the house looking lovely
she certainly learned that trick
of arranging flowers from rebecca
i wonder how she likes it now
being ordered about
by an ex-chorus girl
where on earth did you
get the idea she an ex-chorus girl
he picked her up
in the south of france didnt he
what if he did
well i mean to say there you are
how do you do i-im maxim wife
how do you do
well i must say youre quite different
from what i expected
dont be so silly
she exactly what i told you shed be
well how do you like manderley
very beautiful isnt it
and how do you get along
with mrs danvers
well i ‒ ive never met anyone
quite like her before
you mean she scares you
she not exactly an oil painting is she
giles youre very much in the way here
go somewhere else
ill try and find maxim shall i
giles
i-i didnt mean to say anything
against mrs danvers
oh there no need for you
to be frightened of her
but i shouldnt have any more
to do with her than you can help
shall we sit down
oh yes yes please
you see she bound to be
insanely jealous at first
and she must resent you bitterly
but why should she
dont you know
i should have thought
maxim would have told you
she simply adored rebecca
how are you robert
quite well thank you madam
still having trouble with your teeth
unfortunately yes madam
you should have them out all of them
wretched nuisances teeth
thank you madam
ooh what a plateful
do you hunt
no i dont im afraid i dont even ride
oh have to ride down here
we all do
which do you ride
sidesaddle or astride
oh yes of course i forgot
you dont do you
ha you must
nothing else to do down here
maxim when are you going to have
parties here again like the old days
i havent thought about it
but everyone dying to see you and ‒
yes i bet they are
why dont you have the masquerade ball
again this summer
well ‒
my dear are you fond of dancing
oh i love it
but im not very good at it
do you rumba
ive never tried
you must teach me
i say old boy im trying to find out
exactly what your wife does do
well she sketches a little
sketches
not this modern stuff i hope
portrait of a lampshade upside-down
to represent a soul in torment
dont sail do you
no i dont
well thank goodness for that
huh
youre very much in love with maxim
arent you
yes i can see you are
dont mind my saying so but why dont you
do something about your hair
why dont you have it cut
or sweep it back behind your ears
oh no that worse
what does maxim say about it
does he like it like that

maxim what is it
you look so angry
you knew i didnt want you to go there
but you deliberately went
why not there was only a cottage
down there and a strange man ‒
you didnt go into the cottage did you
yes the door ‒
dont go there again do you hear
well why not
because i hate the place
if you had my memories
you wouldnt go there or even think about it
what the matter
oh im sorry please
we should have stayed away
we should never have come back to manderley
oh what a fool i was
ive made you unhappy
somehow ive hurt you
oh i cant bear to see you like this
because i love you so much
do you
do you
ive made you cry forgive me
i sometimes seem to
fly off the handle for no reason at all
dont i
come well go home and have some tea
and forget all about it
yes let forget all about it
here let me have jasper
hello come in
oh please dont get up mr crawley
i was just wondering if you meant
what you said the other day
about showing me the run of things
of course i did
what are you doing now
notifying all the tenants that
in celebration of maxim return with his bride
this week rent will be free
was that maxim idea
oh yes
all the servants
get an extra week wages too
oh he didnt tell me
cant i help you
i could at least lick the stamps
that terribly nice of you
wont you sit down
oh yes thank you
i i was down at the cottage
on the beach the other day
there was a man there ‒
a queer sort of person
jasper kept barking at him
oh yes mustve been ben
excuse me he quite harmless
we give him odd jobs now and then
that cottage place seemed
to be going to rack and ruin
why isnt something done about it
well i think if maxim wanted anything
done about it hed tell me
are those all rebecca things
down there
yes yes they are
what did she use the cottage for
the boat used to be moored near there
what boat what happened to it
was that the boat she was sailing in
when she was drowned
yes it capsized and sank
she was washed overboard
wasnt she afraid
to go out like that alone
she wasnt afraid of anything
where did they find her
near edgecombe
about 40 miles up channel
about two months afterwards
maxim went up to identify her
it was horrible for him
yes it must have been
mr crawley please dont think me
morbidly curious it isnt that
it just that i feel
at such a disadvantage
all the time whenever i meet anyone
maxim sister or even the servants
i know theyre all
thinking the same thing
theyre all comparing me
with her with rebecca
oh you mustnt think that
i cant tell you how glad i am
that youve married maxim
it going to make
all the difference to his life
and from my point of view
it very refreshing
to find someone like yourself
who not entirely in tune
shall we say with manderley
that very sweet of you
i daresay ive been stupid
but every day i realize
the things that she had and that i lack
beauty and wit and intelligence
and oh all the things
that are so important in a woman
but you have qualities
that are just as important ‒
more important if i may say so
kindliness and sincerity
and if youll forgive me modesty
mean more to a husband
than all the wit and beauty in the world
we none of us want to live in the past
maxim least of all
it up to you you know
to lead us away from it
well i promise you
i wont bring this up again
but before we end this conversation
would you answer
just one more question
if it something im able to answer
ill do my best
tell me what was rebecca really like
i suppose
i suppose she was the most
beautiful creature i ever saw
good evening maxim
hello
the films of the honeymoon
have arrived at last
have we time do you think
before dinner
what on earth
have you done to yourself
oh nothing i just ordered a new dress
from london i hope you dont mind
oh no only do you think that
sort of thing is right for you
it doesnt seem your type at all
i thought youd like it
and what have you done to your hair
oh i see
oh dear oh dear oh dear
im sorry
you look lovely lovely
that very nice for a change
shall we see these pictures
yes id love to see them
ah look now look at that
wasnt it wonderful darling
cant we go back there someday
yes of course of course
ah look at you there
wont our grandchildren be delighted
when they see how lovely you were
oh look at you yes
oh i like that
look at that
oh yes very nice
oh remember that
yes
oh i wish our honeymoon could
have lasted forever maxim
oh dash it look oh
oh oh hang it
threaded it up wrong
as usual or something
yes frith what is it
excuse me sir
may i have a word with you
yes come in
it about robert sir
there been a slight unpleasantness
between him and mrs danvers
oh dear
robert is very upset
this is trouble what is it
it appears that mrs danvers
has accused robert
of stealing a valuable ornament
from the morning room
robert denies the accusation
most emphatically sir
what was the thing anyway
the china cupid sir
oh dear
that one of our treasures isnt it
well tell mrs danvers to get
to the bottom of it somehow
and tell her im sure it wasnt robert
very good sir
why do they come to me with these things
that your job sweetheart
maxim i wanted to tell you
but um well i forgot
the fact is i broke the china cupid
you broke it
now why on earth didnt you say
something about it when frith was here
i dont know i didnt like to
i was afraid hed think me a fool
well hell think you much more a fool now
youll have to explain to him and mrs danvers
oh no you do it ill go upstairs
dont be such a little idiot
anybody would think
you were afraid of them
it was all a mistake mrs danvers
apparently mrs de winter broke the cupid
herself and forgot to say anything about it
im so sorry i ‒ i never thought
that id get robert into trouble
is it possible to repair
the ornament madam
no im afraid it isnt
it was smashed into pieces
what did you do with the pieces
well i-i put them at the back of one
of the drawers in the writing desk
well it looks as though mrs de winter
were afraid you were going to put her in prison
doesnt it mrs danvers
well never mind
do what you can to find the pieces
see if they can be mended
and above all tell robert to dry his tears
i shall apologize
to robert of course
perhaps if such a thing happens again
mrs de winter will tell me personally ‒
yes yes all right
thank you mrs danvers
well i suppose that clip
will hold all right i dont know
im awfully sorry darling
it was very careless of me
mrs danvers
must be furious with me
oh hang mrs danvers why on earth
should you be frightened of her
you behave more like an upstairs maid
not like the mistress of the house at all
yes i know i do
but i feel so uncomfortable
i i try my best every day
but it very difficult
with people looking me up and down
as if i were a prize cow
what does it matter if they do
you must remember that life at manderley is
the only thing that interests anybody down here
what a slap in the eye
i must have been to them then
i suppose that why you married me
because you knew i was dull
and gauche and inexperienced
and there could never be
any gossip about me
gossip what do you mean
i-i dont know
i just said it for something to say
dont look at me like that
maxim what the matter
what have i said
it wasnt a very attractive
thing to say was it
no it was rude hateful
i wonder if i did a very selfish thing
in marrying you
how do you mean
im not much of a companion
to you am i
you dont get much fun do you
you ought to have married a boy
someone of your own age
maxim why do you say this
of course were companions
are we i dont know
im very difficult to live with
no youre not difficult
youre easy very easy
our marriage is a success isnt it
a great success
were happy arent we
terribly happy
if you dont think we are happy
it would be much better
if you didnt pretend
ill go away
why dont you answer me
how can i answer you
when i dont know the answer myself
if you say were happy
let leave it at that
happiness is something
i know nothing about
oh look there the one
when i left the camera running
on the tripod remember
pardon me madam
is there anything i can do for you
im all right hilda
thank you very much
ill bring the sandwiches
immediately madam
hilda
yes madam

nobody ever uses it anymore do they
no madam
not since the death of mrs de winter
come along mr jack
or someone may see you
well danny old harpy
it been good to see you again
been simply breathless to pick up all the news
i dont think it
wise for you to come here mr jack
jasper come here
nonsense it just like coming back home
quiet mr jack
yes and we must be careful
not to shock cinderella mustnt we
she in the morning room
if you leave through the garden door
she wont see you
i must say
i feel a little like the poor relation
sneaking around through back doors
well toodle-oo danny
good-bye mr jack and please be careful
jasper quiet
looking for me
oh i didnt make you jump did i
no of course not
i didnt quite know who it was
yes
youre pleased to see me
arent you old boy
im glad there someone in the family
to welcome me back to manderley
and um how is dear old max
very well thank you
i hear he went up to london
left his little bride all alone
that too bad
isnt he rather afraid that somebody
might come down and carry you off
danny all your precautions
were in vain
the mistress of the house
was hiding behind the door
oh what about presenting me
to the bride
this is mr favell madam
how do you do
how do you do
wont you have some tea or something
now isnt that a charming invitation
ive been asked to stay to tea danny
and ive a good mind to accept
oh well perhaps youre right
pity just when we were getting on so nicely
we mustnt lead the young bride astray
must we jasper
good-bye
it been fun meeting you
oh and by the way
it would be very decent of you
if you didnt mention this little visit
to your revered husband
he doesnt exactly approve of me
very well
that very sporting of you
i wish i had a young bride of three months
waiting for me at home
im just a lonely old bachelor
fare thee well
oh and i know what was wrong
with that introduction
danny didnt tell you did she
i am rebecca favorite cousin
toodle-oo
do you wish anything madam
i didnt expect to see you
mrs danvers
i noticed a window wasnt closed
and i came up to see if i could fasten it
why did you say that
i closed it before i left the room
you opened it yourself didnt you
youve always wanted to see this room
havent you madam
why did you never ask me
to show it to you
i was ready to show it to you every day
it a lovely room isnt it
the loveliest room youve ever seen
everything is kept
just as mrs de winter liked it
nothing has been altered
since that last night
come ill show you
her dressing room
this is where i keep all her clothes
you would like to see them
wouldnt you
feel this
it was a christmas present
from mr de winter
he was always giving her expensive gifts
the whole year round
i keep her underwear on this side
they were made specially for her
by the nuns in the convent of st claire
i always used to wait up for her
no matter how late
sometimes she and mr de winter
didnt come home until dawn
while she was undressing
shed tell me about the party shed been to
she knew everyone that mattered
and everyone loved her
when shed finished her bath
shed go into the bedroom
and go over to the dressing table
oh youve moved her brush
havent you
there that better ‒
just as she always laid it down
come on danny hair drill
she would say
id stand behind her like this
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time
and then she would say
good night danny
and step into her bed
i embroidered this case
for her myself
and i keep it here always
did you ever see anything so delicate
look
you can see my hand through it
you wouldnt think shed
been gone so long would you
sometimes when i walk
along the corridor
i fancy i hear her just behind me
that quick light step
i couldnt mistake it anywhere
it not only in this room
it in all the rooms in the house
i can almost hear it now
do you think the dead
come back and watch the living
no i dont believe it
sometimes i wonder if she doesnt
come back here to manderley
and watch you
and mr de winter together
you look tired why dont you
stay here a while and rest
and listen to the sea
it so soothing
listen to it
listen
listen to the sea
tell mrs danvers
i wish to see her immediately
you sent for me madam
yes mrs danvers
i want you to get rid
of all these things
these are mrs de winter things
i am mrs de winter now
very well
ill give the instructions
just a moment please
mrs danvers i intend to say nothing to
mr de winter about mr favell visit

that happened this afternoon

to make people feel that manderley
is just the same as it always was
oh please darling could we
you dont know

you would have to be hostess
to hundreds of people all the county
and a lot of young people would come up from
london and turn the house into a nightclub

ive never been to a large party
but i could learn what to do
and i promise you
you wouldnt be ashamed of me

they were just some ideas i was
sketching for my costume for the ball
hasnt mr de winter
suggested anything
no i want to surprise him
i dont want him to know anything about it
i merely thought
that you might find a costume
among the family portraits
that would suit you
oh you mean those at the top of the stairs
ill go and look at them
this one for instance
it might have been designed for you
im sure you could have it copied
ive heard mr de winter say that
this is his favorite of all the paintings
it lady caroline de winter
one of his ancestors
oh well well that a splendid idea
mrs danvers im-im very grateful
everything under control frith
yes sir thank you
excuse me sir

oh no this is just
my old cap and gown

because hed lost her

i dont want to know
you thought you could be
mrs de winter
live in her house walk in her steps
take the things that were hers
but she too strong for you

and im afraid something
might have happened to him
frank what the matter
is anything wrong
there is something wrong
well the diver who went down
to inspect the bottom of the ship
came across the hull of another boat ‒
a little sailboat
frank is it ‒
yes it rebecca
how did they recognize it
he a local man
knew it instantly
itll be so hard on poor maxim
yes it going to bring it
all back again
and worse than before
why did they have to find it
why couldnt they have left it there
in peace at the bottom of the sea
well id better get along
and arrange some breakfast for the men
all right frank
ill go and look for maxim
hello
maxim
you havent had any sleep
have you forgiven me
forgiven you
what have i got to forgive you for
for last night
my stupidity about the costume
oh that id forgotten
i was angry with you wasnt i
mmm
maxim cant we start all over again
i dont ask that you should love me
i wont ask impossible things
ill be your friend your companion
ill be happy with that
you love me very much dont you
but it too late my darling
weve lost our little
chance of happiness
no maxim no
yes it all over now
the thing happened
the thing ive dreaded day after day
night after night
maxim what are you trying to tell me
rebecca has won
her shadow has been
between us all the time
keeping us from one another
she knew that this would happen
what are you saying
they sent a diver down
he found another boat
yes i know frank told me
rebecca boat
oh it terrible for you
im so sorry
the diver made another discovery
he broke one of the ports
and looked into the cabin
there was a body in there
then she wasnt alone
there was someone sailing with her
and you have to find out who it was
that it isnt it maxim
you dont understand
there was no one with her
it rebecca body
lying there on the cabin floor
oh no
the woman that was washed up
at edgecombe
the woman that is now buried
in the family crypt
that was not rebecca
that was the body
of some unknown woman
unclaimed belonging nowhere
i identified it
but i knew it wasnt rebecca
it was all a lie
i knew where rebecca body was
lying on that cabin floor
on the bottom of the sea
how did you know maxim
because i put it there
will you look into my eyes
and tell me that you love me now
you see i was right
it too late
no it not too late
youre not to say that
i love you more
than anything in the world
oh please maxim kiss me please
no it no use it too late
we cant lose each other now
we must be together always
with no secrets no shadows
we may only have
a few days a few hours
maxim why didnt you tell me before
i nearly did sometimes
but you never seemed close enough
how could we be close when i knew
you were always thinking of rebecca
how could i even ask you to love me
when i knew you loved rebecca still
what are you talking about
what do you mean
whenever you touched me i knew
you were comparing me with rebecca
whenever you looked at me or spoke to me
or walked with me in the garden
i knew you were thinking
this i did with rebecca and this and this
oh it true isnt it
you thought i loved rebecca
you thought that
i hated her
oh i was carried away by her
enchanted by her as everyone was
and when i was married i was told
i was the luckiest man in the world
she was so lovely
so accomplished so amusing
she got the three things that really
matter in a wife everyone said
breeding brains and beauty
and i believed them completely
but i never had
a moment happiness with her
she was incapable of love
or tenderness or decency
you didnt love her
you didnt love her
do you remember that cliff
where you first saw me in monte carlo
well i went there with rebecca
on our honeymoon
that was where i found out about her
four days after we were married
she stood there laughing
her black hair blowing in the wind
and told me all about herself
everything
things ill never tell a living soul
i wanted to kill her
it would have been so easy
remember the precipice
i frightened you didnt i
you thought i was mad
perhaps i was
perhaps i am mad
it wouldnt make for sanity would it
living with the devil
ill make a bargain with you she said
youd look rather foolish trying to
divorce me now after four days of marriage
so ill play the part of a devoted wife
mistress of your precious manderley
ill make it the most famous showplace
in england if you like
and people will visit us and envy us
and say were the luckiest
happiest couple in the country
what a grand joke it will be
what a triumph
i should never have accepted
her dirty bargain but i did
i was younger then and tremendously
conscious of the family honor
family honor
she knew that id sacrifice everything
rather than stand up in a divorce court
and give her away admit that
our marriage was a rotten fraud
you despise me dont you
as i despise myself
you cant understand what
my feelings were can you
of course i can darling
of course i can
well i kept the bargain
and so did she apparently
oh she played the game brilliantly
but after a while
she began to grow careless
she took a flat in london
and shed stay away for days at a time
then she started to bring
her friends down here
i warned her
but she shrugged her shoulders
what it got to do with you
she said
she even started on frank
poor faithful frank
then there was a cousin of hers
a man named favell
yes i know him
he came the day you went to london
why didnt you tell me
i didnt like to i thought
it would remind you of rebecca
remind me
as if i needed reminding
favell used to visit her
here in this cottage
i found out about it and i warned her that
if he came here again id shoot them both
one night when i found that
shed come back quietly from london
i thought that favell was with her
and i knew then i couldnt stand this
life of filth and deceit any longer
i decided to come down here
and have it out with both of them
but she was alone
she was expecting favell
but he hadnt come
she was lying on the divan
a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her
she looked ill queer
suddenly she got up
started to walk toward me
when i have a child she said
neither you nor anyone else
could ever prove it wasnt yours
youd like to have an heir wouldnt you
max for your precious manderley
then she started to laugh
how funny
how supremely wonderfully funny
id be the perfect mother
just as ive been the perfect wife
no one will ever know
it ought to give you
the thrill of your life max
to watch my son grow bigger
day by day
and to know that when you die
manderley will be his
she was face to face with me
one hand in her pocket
the other holding a cigarette
she was smiling
well max
what are you going to do about it
arent you going to kill me
i suppose i went mad for a moment
i must have struck her
she stood staring at me
she looked almost triumphant
then she started
toward me again smiling
suddenly she stumbled and fell
when i looked down ‒ ages afterwards
it seemed ‒ she was lying on the floor
shed struck her head
on a heavy piece of ship tackle
i remember wondering
why she was still smiling
then i realized she was dead
but you didnt kill her
it was an accident
who would believe me
i lost my head
i just knew i had to do something anything
i carried her out to the boat
it was very dark
there was no moon
i put her in the cabin
when the boat seemed a safe distance
from the shore i took a spike
and drove it again and again
through the planking of the hull
i had opened up the seacocks
and the water began to come in fast
i climbed over into the dinghy
and pulled away
i saw the boat heel over and sink
i pulled back into the cove
it started raining
maxim does anyone else know this
no no one except you and me
we must explain it
it got to be the body
of someone youve never seen before
no theyre bound to know her
her rings bracelets she always wore
theyll identify her body
then theyll remember the other woman
the other woman buried in the crypt
if they find out it was rebecca
you must simply say that you made
a mistake about the other body ‒
that the day you went to edgecombe
you were ill you didnt know what you were doing
rebecca dead
that what weve got to remember
rebecca dead she cant speak
she cant bear witness
she cant harm you anymore
were the only two people in the world
that know maxim ‒ you and i
i told you once that id done
a very selfish thing in marrying you
you can understand now what i meant
ive loved you my darling
i shall always love you
but ive known all along
that rebecca would win in the end
no no she hasnt won
no matter what happens now
she hasnt won
hello hel ‒
hello frank hello frank yes
who colonel julyan
yes tell him ill meet him there
as soon as i possibly can
what oh
well say we could talk about that
when were sure about the matter
yes
what happened
colonel julyan called
he the chief constable of the county
he been asked by the police
to go to the mortuary
he wants to know if i could
possibly have made a mistake
about that other body
well colonel julyan apparently i did
make a mistake about that other body
the mistake was quite natural
under the circumstances
besides you werent well at the time
that nonsense i was perfectly well
well dont let it worry you maxim
nobody can blame you
for making a mistake
the pity is youve got to go through
the same thing all over again
what do you mean
therell have to be another inquest of course
same formality and red tape
oh
i wish you could be spared the publicity of it
but im afraid that impossible
oh yes the publicity
i suppose mrs de winter
went below for something
and a squall hit the boat
with nobody at the helm
i imagine that about the solution of it
dont you think so crawley
oh yes probably the door jammed
and she couldnt get on deck again
yes tabb the boatbuilder
will undoubtedly come
to some such conclusion
why what would he know about it
well he examining the boat now
purely as a matter of routine you know
ill be at the inquest tomorrow maxim ‒
quite unofficially you know
we must get together for a game of golf
when it all over eh
yes
bye-bye
i have the evening papers madam
would you care to see them
oh no thank you frith
and id prefer that mr de winter
werent troubled with them either
i understand madam permit me to say
that were all most distressed outside
oh thank you frith
im afraid the news has been
a great shock to mrs danvers
yes i rather expected it would be
it seems there to be
a coroner inquest madam
yes frith it purely a formality
of course madam i
i wanted to say that if any of us
might be required to give evidence
i should be only too pleased to do
anything that might help the family
oh thank you frith im sure mr de winter
will be very happy to hear it
but i dont think
anything will be necessary
maxim
hello darling
oh maxim im im worried about
what youll do at the inquest tomorrow
what do you mean
you wont lose your temper will you
promise me that they
wont make you angry
all right darling i promise
no matter what he asks you
you wont lose your head
dont worry dear
they cant do anything at once can they
no
then weve a little time left to be together
yes
i want to go to the inquest with you
id rather you didnt darling
but i cant wait here alone
i promise you i wont be
any trouble to you
and i must be near you
so that no matter what happens
we wont be separated for a moment
all right dear
i dont mind this whole thing
except for you
i cant forget what it done to you
ive been thinking of nothing else
since it happened
no no
it gone forever
that funny young lost look i loved
wont ever come back
i killed that when i told you
about rebecca
it gone
in a few hours
youve grown so much older
oh maxim maxim
black jack brady was his name
the most important arrest i ever made
it must have been
about two years ago now
of course there was no doubt about it
he was hung a month after i caught him
hello wait a minute
theyve got old barmy ben up now
you remember
the late mrs de winter dont you
she gone
yes we know that
she went in the sea
the sea got her
that right that right
now we want you to tell us
whether you were on the shore
that last night she went sailing
eh
were you on the shore
that last night she went out
when she didnt come back
i didnt see nothin
i dont want to go to the asylum
them cruel folks there
now nobody going
to send you to the asylum
all we want you to do
is to tell us what you saw
i didnt see nothin
come come did you see mrs de winter
get into her boat that last night
i dont know nothin
i dont want to go to the asylum
very well you may go
eh
you may go now
mr tabb
would you step forward please
the evidence you give will be the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the truth
i do so help me god
the late mrs de winter used to send her boat
to your shipyard for reconditioning
that right sir
can you remember any occasion
when she had any sort of accident with the boat
no sir
i often said mrs de winter
was a born sailor
now when mrs de winter
went below as is supposed
and a sudden gust of wind came down
that would be enough
to capsize the boat wouldnt it
excuse me sir but there
a little more to it than that
what do you mean mr tabb
i mean sir the sea cocks
what are the sea cocks
sea cock ‒
oh well the sea cocks
are the valves to drain out the boat
and theyre always kept tight closed
when youre afloat
yes
well yesterday when i examined that boat
i found theyd been opened
what could be the reason for that
just this
that what flooded the boat
and sunk her
are you implying ‒
that boat never capsized at all
i know it a terrible thing to say sir
but in my opinion she was scuttled
and there them holes
what holes
in her planking
what are you talking about
of course that boat been
underwater for over a year
and the tide been knocking her
against the ridge
but it seemed to me them holes looked
as if shed made em from the inside
then you believe she must have
done it deliberately
couldnt have been no accident
not with her knowledge of boats
you knew the former mrs de winter
very well i believe
oh yes
would you have believed her
capable of suicide
no frankly i would not
but you never can tell
you may stand down mr tabb
mr de winter please
im sorry to drag you back
for further questioning mr de winter
youve heard the statement of mr tabb
i wonder if you can help us in any way
im afraid not
can you think of any reason
why there should be holes
in the planking of the late
mrs de winter boat
well of course i cant
think of any reason
has anyone ever discussed
these holes with you before
well since the boat has been at the bottom
of the ocean i scarcely think that likely
mr de winter i want you to believe
we all feel very deeply for you
but i dont conduct this inquiry
for my own amusement
that rather obvious isnt it
i hope that it is
since mrs de winter went sailing alone
are we to believe she drove those holes herself
you may believe what you like
can you enlighten us as to why mrs de winter
should have wanted to end her own life
i know of no reason whatever
mr de winter
however painful it may be
i have to ask you
a very personal question
were relations between you
and the late mrs de winter perfectly happy
were relations between you
and the late mrs de winter perfectly happy
i wont stand this any longer
and you might as well know now ‒
it my wife she fainted
well adjourn till after lunch
mr de winter i presume
youll be available for us then
i told you you should
have had some breakfast
youre hungry
that what the matter with you
mr frith thought you might like to
have some lunch and sent me with it
that fine can you pull around the corner
very good sir
awfully foolish of me fainting like that
nonsense if you hadnt fainted
id have really lost my temper
darling please be careful
darling wait here a few moments
ill see if i can find old frank
of course darling
dont worry about me ill be all right
sure
all right
here have a spot of this
do you good
thank you
sure youre all right
yes of course
wont be long
right you are
ugh
hello
and how does the bride
find herself today
i say marriage with max is not exactly
a bed of roses is it
i think youd better go
before maxim gets back
oh jealous is he
well i cant say i blame him
but you dont think
im the big bad wolf do you
im not you know
im a perfectly ordinary harmless bloke
and i think youre behaving
splendidly over all this
perfectly splendidly
you know youve grown up a bit
since i last saw you
it no wonder
what do you want favell
oh hello max things are going
pretty well for you arent they
better than you ever expected
i was rather worried about you at first
that why i came down to the inquest
im touched by your solicitude
but if you dont mind wed like to have our lunch
lunch i say what a jolly idea
rather like a picnic isnt it
im so sorry
do you mind if i put this there
you know max old boy i really think
i ought to talk things over with you
talk what things over
well those holes in the planking
for one thing
those holes that were drilled
from the inside
oh mullen
yes sir
would you like a good fellow have my car
filled with petrol it almost empty
very good sir
and mullen close the door will you
yes sir
does this bother you
you know old boy
i have a strong feeling
that before the day is out
somebody going to make use of that uh
rather expressive though somewhat
old-fashioned term foul play
am i boring you with all this
no good
well you see max i find myself
in a rather awkward position
youve only got to read this note
to understand it from rebecca
and what more she had the foresight
to put the date on it
she wrote it to me
the day she died
incidentally
i was out on a party on that night
so i didnt get it until the next day
what makes you think
that note would interest me
oh im not going to bother you
with the contents now
but i can assure you that
it is not the note of a woman
who intends to drown herself
that same night
by the way
what do you do with old bones
bury them eh what
however for the time being ‒
you know max im getting awfully fed up
with my job as a motorcar salesman
i dont know if youve ever
experienced the feeling
of driving an expensive motorcar
which isnt your own
but it can be very very exasperating
you know what i mean
you want to own the car yourself
ive often wondered what it would be like
to retire to the country
have a nice little place
with a few acres of shooting
ive never figured out what it would cost a year
but id like to talk about it with you
id like to have your advice on how
to live comfortably without hard work
hello favell
you looking for me maxim
yes
mr favell and i have a little
business transaction on hand
i think we had better
conduct it over at the inn
they may have a private room there
well see you later
find colonel julyan
tell him i want to see him immediately
come on favell let go
have you a private room please
of course sir through there sir
thank you
hope this will do mr de winter
oh it splendid splendid
exactly like the ritz
any orders gents
yes you might bring me a large brandy and soda
how about you max have one on me
i feel i can afford to play host
thanks i dont mind if i do
make it two will you my good fellow
very good sir
where mr de winter
oh through the other door sir
colonel julyan this is mr favell
oh i know colonel julyan
were old friends arent we
since youre old friends i assume you
also know he head of the police here
i think he might be interested to hear
your proposition go on tell him all about it
i merely said i hoped to give up
selling cars and retire into the country
actually he offered to withhold a vital piece
of evidence if i made it worth his while
i only want to see justice done colonel
now that boatbuilder evidence
suggested certain possible theories
concerning rebecca death
one of them of course is suicide
i have a little note here which i consider
puts that possibility quite out of court
read it colonel
jack darling
ive just seen the doctor
and im going down to manderley
right away
i shall be at the cottage all this evening
and shall leave the door open for you
i have something terribly
important to tell you rebecca
now does that look like the note of a woman
who had made up her mind to kill herself
and apart from that colonel do you mean to
tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide
youd go to all the trouble
of putting out to sea in a boat
then take a hammer and chisel and laboriously
knock holes through the bottom of it
come colonel as an officer of the law
dont you feel there are some
slight grounds for suspicion
of murder
what else
youve known max a long time
so you know he the old-fashioned type
whod die to defend his honor
or whod kill for it
it blackmail pure and simple
blackmail not so pure nor so simple
it can bring a lot of trouble
to a great many people
and the blackmailer sometimes
finds himself in jail at the end of it
i see youre going to hold
de winter hand through all this
just because he the big noise around here
and he actually permitted you to dine with him
be careful favell
youve brought an accusation of murder
have you any witnesses
i do have a witness
it that fellow ben
if that stupid coroner hadnt been
as much of a snob as you are
hed have seen that half-wit
was hiding something
and why should ben do that
because we caught him once rebecca and i
peering at us through the cottage window
rebecca threatened him with the asylum
that why he was afraid to speak
but he was always hanging about
he must have seen this whole thing
it ridiculous even listening to all this
ah youre like a little trades union
all of you arent you
and if my guess is right crawley
there a bit of malice in your soul
toward me isnt there
crawley didnt have much success
with rebecca
but he ought to have
more luck this time
the bride will be grateful
for your fraternal arm crawley
in a week or so
every time she faints in fact
de winter
maxim please
that temper of yours
will do you in yet max
oh uh excuse me gentlemen
now is there anything else
yes you might bring
mr de winter a sedative
no no nothing at all just leave us
very good sir
now favell let get this business over
as you seem to have worked out
the whole thing so carefully
perhaps you can provide us
also with a motive
i knew you were going
to bring that up colonel
ive read enough detective stories to
know that there must always be a motive
and if youll all excuse me a moment
ill supply that too
i wish you would go home
you ought not to be here through all this
please let me stay maxim
surely colonel julyan
youre not going to allow this fellow ‒
my opinion of favell
is no higher than yours crawley
but in my official capacity i have
no alternative but to pursue his accusation
i entirely agree with you colonel
in a manner so serious as this we must
make sure of every point explore every avenue
and in fact if i may coin a phrase
leave no stone unturned
ah here she is ‒ the missing link
the witness who will help supply the motive
colonel julyan mrs danvers
i believe you know everyone else
wont you sit down
no offense colonel
but i think ill put this to danny
shell understand it more easily
danny who was rebecca doctor
mrs de winter
always had dr mcclean from the village
now you heard
i said rebecca doctor in london
i dont know anything about that
oh dont give me that danny
you knew everything about rebecca
you knew she was in love with me didnt you
surely you havent forgotten the good times
she and i used to have down at the cottage
she had a right to amuse herself
didnt she
love was a game to her only a game
it made her laugh i tell you
she used to sit on her bed
and rock with laughter at the lot of you
can you think of any reason why
mrs de winter should have taken her own life
no no i refuse to believe it
i knew everything about her
and i wont believe it
there you see it impossible
she knows that as well as i do
now listen we know that rebecca went to
a doctor in london on the last day of her life
who was it
i dont know
oh i understand danny
you think were asking you
to reveal secrets of rebecca life
youre trying to defend her
but that what im doing
im trying to clear her name
of the suspicion of suicide
mrs danvers it has been suggested
that mrs de winter
was deliberately murdered
there you have it in a nutshell danny
but there one more thing youll want to know
the name of the murderer
it a lovely name
that rolls off the tongue so easily
george fortescue maximilian de winter
there was a doctor mrs de winter
sometimes went to him privately
she used to go to him
even before she was married
we dont want reminiscences danny
what was his name
dr baker 65 goldhawk road
shepherd bush
there you are colonel
there where youll find your motive
go and question dr baker
hell tell you why rebecca went to him ‒
to confirm the fact that
she was going to have a child
a sweet curly-headed little child
it isnt true it isnt true
she would have told me
she told max about it
maxim knew he wasnt the father
so like the gentleman of the old school
that he is he killed her
im afraid we shall have
to question this dr baker
hear hear but for safety sake
i think id like to go along too
yes unfortunately i suppose
you have the right to ask that
ill see the coroner and have the inquest
postponed pending further evidence
i say arent you rather afraid that
the prisoner shall we say might bolt
you have my word for it
that he will not do that
toodle-oo max
come along danny
let leave the unhappy couple to spend
their last moments together alone
are you sure you dont want me
to go with you maxim
no darling
itll be very tiring for you
ill be back the very first thing in the morning
and i wont even stop to sleep
ill be waiting for you
ready maxim
yes
you two go on ahead
ill follow with favell
dr baker you may have seen
mr de winter name in the papers recently
oh yes yes in connection with a body
that was found in a boat
my wife was reading all about it
a very sad case
my condolences ‒
oh this is going to take hours let me ‒
dont bother favell
i think i can tell dr baker
were trying to discover certain facts
concerning the late mrs de winter
activities on the day of her death
october 2 last year
and i want you to tell me if you can
if anyone of that name
paid you a visit on that date
im awfully sorry
im afraid i cant help you
i should have remembered
the name de winter
ive never attended
a mrs de winter in my life
well how can you possibly tell
all your patients names
i can look it up
in my engagement diary if you like
did you say the 2th of october
yes
oh here we are
no no de winter
are you sure
well here are all the appointments for that day
ross campbell steadall
perrino danvers mathews ‒
danny what the devil
would you read that name again
did you say danvers
yes i have a mrs danvers for 300
what did she look like
can you remember
yes i remember her quite well
she was a very beautiful woman ‒
tall dark exquisitely dressed
rebecca
the lady must have used an assumed name
is that so
this is a surprise
id known her a long time
what was the matter with her
my dear sir there are certain ethics
could you supply a reason dr baker
for mrs de winter suicide
for her murder you mean
she was going to have a kid wasnt she
come on out with it
tell me what else a woman of her class
be doing in a dump like this
i take it the official nature of this visit
makes it necessary for me to ‒
i assure you wed not be troubling you
if it were not necessary
you want to know
if i can suggest any motive
as to why mrs de winter
should have taken her life
yes i think i can
the woman who called herself mrs danvers
was very seriously ill
she was not going to have a child
that was what she thought
but my diagnosis was different
i sent her to a well-known specialist
for an examination and x-rays
and on this date
she returned to me for his report
i remember her standing here
holding out her hand for the photograph
i want to know the truth she said
i dont want soft words
and a bedside manner
if im for it you can tell me right away
i knew she was not the type
to accept a lie
shed asked for the truth
so i let her have it
she thanked me and i never saw her again
so i assumed that ‒
what was wrong with her
cancer
yes the growth was deep-rooted
an operation would have been
no earthly use at all
in a short time
she would have been under morphia
there was nothing that could
be done for her except wait
did she say anything when you told her
she smiled in a queer sort of way
your wife was a wonderful woman
mr de winter
and oh yes
i remember she said something
that struck me as being
very peculiar at the time
when i told her it was a matter of months
she said
oh no doctor not that long
youve been very kind
youve told us all we wanted to know
we shall probably need
an official verification
verification
yes to confirm the verdict of suicide
i understand
can i offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry
no very kind
i think we ought to be going
thank heaven we know the truth
dreadful thing dreadful
a young and lovely woman like her
no wonder ‒
i never had the remotest idea
neither did danny im sure
i wish i had a drink
will we be needed at the inquest
any further colonel julyan
oh no i can see to it that maxim
is not troubled any further
thank you sir
are you ready to start colonel
no thank you
im staying in town tonight
and let me tell you favell
blackmail is not much of a profession
and we know how to deal with it in our part
of the world strange as it may seem to you
im sure i dont know
what youre talking about
but if you ever need a new car
colonel just let me know
it impossible to thank you
for your kindness to us through all this
