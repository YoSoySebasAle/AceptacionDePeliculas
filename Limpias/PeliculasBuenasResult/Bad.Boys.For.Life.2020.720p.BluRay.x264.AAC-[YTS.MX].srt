let go ladies
youre useless
move it
what the fuck
stop the ambulance
my son
dont be sad for his death
the spirit of your father is free
from the bars that confined him
this is the last gift from papa before he died
youre a man now youre finally
ready for what needs to be done
you must bring honor and respect
back to our family
your father hid millions of dollars
before he was locked up
here are the coordinates where you can find them
well take back what ours
with this money we can finally get revenge
the people who destroyed our family
will know how it feels to be hunted
he dies last
stay calm
it ours
that was fast
we got a new base of operations too
youve spent so much time on the other
side you sound like a gringo
i made it clear lowrey dies last
im the one up here
ive learned how to handle things all right
youve had me training my whole life
the cop was a threat the others are nothing
do you listen to me or not
i wanted him to see the others die
just finish it
never disobey me again
everything for you papa
he didnt die
isnt that what you wanted
santa muerte wouldnt let him die
before he suffered as we have
dont kill him until i tell you
he will suffer
a little something for your fans
i had him
i had him right there
i dont understand mama
a bullet is mercy for this son of a bitch
who took your father from me
he needs to suffer
then he dies
you understand
yes
mama theyre all gone it time
yes kill him
but before you do it look in his eyes
and tell him something for me
what mama
forget about me kill them both
kill them both
move
the traitor is coming
get prepared
we will
let go
or should i call you mike
not very thorough
there was a time when touching
me would have melted you
this used to be our place
i wanted you dead
but you survived
perhaps i made you too strong
or perhaps
santa muerte is telling us something
we were fated to meet one more time
ive taken care of that
it just us now
why didnt you tell me i had a son
what would you have done
taken care of him
like you took care of me
is it true what he says
it doesnt matter he nothing to you
who is he
is he my father
