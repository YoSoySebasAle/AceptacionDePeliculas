now
where is mr takagi
joseph yashinobo takagi
born kyoto 937
dont move
family emigrated to san pedro
california 939
interned at manzanar 942 to 43
scholarship student
university of california
law degree stanford 962

vice chairman
nakatomi investment group
enough
and father
of five
i am takagi
how do you do
it a pleasure to meet you
ok 32 construction
33 computers
nice suit
john phillips london
i have two myself
rumor has it
arafat buys his there
this way
on the left
and when alexander saw
the breadth of his domain
he wept for there were
no more worlds to conquer
the benefits of a classical education
ohh that beautiful
i always enjoyed to make models
when i was a boy
the exactness the attention
to every conceivable detail
it beautiful
is this what this is all about
our project in indonesia
contrary to what you people may think
were going to develop
that region not exploit it
i believe you
i read the article in forbes
mr takagi
i could talk about industrialization
and men fashions all day
but im afraid work must intrude
and my associate here
has some questions for you
sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions
actually
i dont have that code
you broke in here
to access our computer
any information you could get
when they wake up in tokyo
theyll change it
you wont be able to blackmail
our executives
sit down
mr takagi im really not
interested in your computer
but i need the code key
because i am interested
in the $640 million
in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault
and the computer
controls the vault
you want money
what kind of terrorists are you
who said we were terrorists
the bonds represent at most
0 days operating capital
for your parent organization
it really no more
than a temporary inconvenience
now
the code please
it useless to you
there are seven safeguards on our vault
and the code key only one of them
youll never get it open
then there no reason
not to tell it to us
i told you
it not over yet
it a very nice suit mr takagi
it would be a shame to ruin it
im going to count to three
there will not be a four
give me the code
one
two
three
i dont know it
get on a jet to tokyo
and ask the chairman
youre just gonna have to kill me
ok
we do it the hard way
tony see if you can dispose of that
karl you better check on heinrich work
up on the machine floor
nothing
see to heinrich
now
you can break the code
you didnt bring me
for my charming personality
argyle tell me you heard the shots
youre calling the police right now

two hours two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals at the minimum
the 7th lock however
is out of my hands
im sorry
the 7th lock
the electromagnetic seal
you do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally
trust me

and join the others
i promise i wont hurt you
drop it dickhead it the police
you wont hurt me
yeah why not
because youre a policeman
there are rules for policemen
yeah that what my captain
keeps telling me
bet your ass i wish to proceed
nine million terrorists in the world
and i got to kill one with feet
smaller than my sister
i wanted this to be professional
efficient adult cooperative
not a lot to ask
alas your mr takagi
did not see it that way
so he wont be joining us
for the rest of his life
we can go any way you want it
you can walk out of here
or be carried out
but have no illusions
we are in charge
so decide now each of you
and please remember
we have left nothing to chance
it tony
get them back
now i have a machine gun
ho ho ho
a security guard we missed
theyre usually tired old policemen
no this is something else
we have to do something hans
yes we do
tell karl his brother is dead
tell him to come down
karl komm sofort
franco fritz take the body upstairs
and out of sight
i dont want the hostages
to think too much
komm sofort schnell
i want blood
youll have it but let
heinrich plant the detonators
and theo prepare the vault
after we call the police
you can tear the building apart
looking for this man
but until then
do not alter the plan
and if he alters it
what do you think
something wrong
cops
john

for further loss of life
what is it you do wish for
i have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison
the american state department
enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends
now it can rattle it for me

in northern ireland the seven members
of the new provo front
in canada the five imprisoned leaders
of liberté de quebec
in sri lanka the nine members
of the asian dawn
what the fuck
asian dawn
i read about them in time magazine
when these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof
and they will accompany us
in helicopters
to the los angeles
international airport
where they will be given
further instructions
you have two hours to comply
wait a minute uh mr gruber

i figured you for the street al
in my youth in my youth
author of hostage terrorist
terrorist hostage
a study in duality
dr hasseldorf
what can we expect
in the next few hours
well gail
by this time
the hostages should be going through
the early stages
of the helsinki syndrome
as in helsinki sweden
finland
basically it when the hostages
and the terrorists
go through a sort of
psychological transference
and a projection of dependency
a strange sort of trust
and bond develops
weve had situations
where the hostages
have embraced their captors
after release
and even corresponded with them
in prison
no no darling asian dawn dawn
d-a-w-n
sir
yeah

30 or 35 hostages up there

terrorists up there

thank you
well handle it from here
when we commandeer your men
well try and let you know
arent you forgetting something
such as
what about john mcclane
