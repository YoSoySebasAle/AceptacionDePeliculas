right
gruppenkommandeur ramsey
good morning group captain
im captain posen von
luger adjutant
since youre senior
british officer
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel
he wishes to make clear to
you certain matters of
the word is policy
yes
thank you
come in
gruppenkommandeur ramsey
i am colonel von luger
please sit down
group captain ramsey
in the past four years
the reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time
energy manpower and equipment
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers
at least it rather nice to
know youre wanted isnt it
for us it not a
matter for levity
there will be no escapes
from this camp
colonel von luger it is the sworn
duty of all officers
to try to escape
if they cant it is their
duty to cause the enemy
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them
and their sworn duty to harass the
enemy to the best
of their ability
yes i know
the men under your authority
have been most successful
this man ashley-pitt
for example
caught in the north sea escaped
recaptured escaped recaptured
archibald archie ives
eleven escape attempts
even tried to jump out of
the truck coming here
dickes william
known to have participated in
digging of  escape tunnels
flight lieutenant
willinski four escapes
macdonald nine hendley
the american five
haynes four sedgwick seven
the list is almost endless
one man here has made
7 attempted escapes
group captain this
is close to insanity
quite
and it must stop
colonel do you expect
officers to forget their duty
no
it is because we
expect the opposite
that we have brought you here
this is a new camp
it has been built to
hold you and your men
it is organised to
incorporate all we
have learned of security measures
and in me you will not be
dealing with a common jailer
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task
by the luftwaffe high command
we have in effect put all our
rotten eggs in one basket
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully
very wise
you will not be denied
the usual facilities
sports a library a
recreation hall
and for gardening we
will give you tools
we trust you to use
them for gardening
devote your energies
to these things
give up your hopeless
attempts to escape
and with intelligent cooperation
we may all sit out the war
as comfortably as possible
what do you do here by the truck
im stealing tools
for stealing tools cooler
i was only kidding
oh youre american
yes and youre a german
of course why do you
come to germany
why fight for england your enemy
enemy what are you talking about

that propaganda
it in the history
books i read it
now go away from here if
you steal tools cooler
yeah no tools
hey virgil

i think they expect
a lot of business
yeah
those two guys who were
with us in the old camp
in hut 4 i cant find them
you think the goons
left em behind
i guess
what were their names

the raf eagle squadron
hey you got something
going already
see the way the goons got
those towers placed
there a blind spot
through the middle
a blind spot
a guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower
theyd never see me
especially at night
youre crazy
you think so let
find out right now
now the next step
a little tricky
youre not going out there

stupidity and carelessness
on both sides

i was trying to cut my way through
your wire because
i wanna get out
search him
do you speak german
yes colonel
wire cutters
yes colonel
i have had the pleasure of knowing
quite a number of british
officers in this war
and i flatter myself that
we understand one another
you are the first american officer
i have met hilts isnt it
captain hilts actually
seventeen escape attempts
eighteen sir
tunnel man engineer
flier
i suppose what called in the
american army a hotshot pilot
unfortunately you
were shot down anyway
so we are both grounded for
the duration of the war
well you speak for
yourself colonel
you have other plans
i havent seen berlin yet
i plan on doing so
before the war over
are all american officers
so ill-mannered
about 99 percent
perhaps while you are with us
you will have a chance to learn
some ten days isolation hilts
captain hilts
twenty days
right
oh youll still be
here when i get out
cooler
name
ives
flying officer ives
cooler 20 days
cooler ives
pleasure
hilts
yeah
what did you do in the
states play baseball
no i was in college
say ives
aye
how many escapes have you tried
four over seven under
tunnel man huh
sure i am that
how tall are you ives
five feet four why
oh just wondering
what did you do in college
study physical education
chemical engineering did a
little bike riding though
bicycles
motorcycles
flat tracks county fairs
picked up a buck here and there
helped pay my tuition
i did a wee bit of racing myself
in scotland
bikes
no horse racing jockey
jockey
hilts
are you there hilts
yeah im here
dont you have them in
the states jockeys
sure
they were the days
saturday nights in towns like
musselburgh and hamilton
you had to fight off the birds
you know birds
girls man girls
do you not have
them in the states
hilts are you there hilts
ives
what
you know the kind of clay and
gravel we got here
in the compound
how many feet do you think you
could get through in eight hours
i could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an
end of an auger
but you know it not the digging
it the shoring up with wood
and getting the dirt out that
what youve to worry about
no it isnt ives you dont
have to worry about that
how are you going to
get the dirt out
what do they call a
mole in scotland
a mole
aye
well what do you think
i must say it an
interesting first 20 minutes
id say we made
fools of ourselves
as the sergeant out there says
this is only the first day
eric
dont take too much notice the
goons may not know who he is
ill pass the word
ill tell the old man
he has arrived
the prisoner bartlett
is discharged
into your custody
colonel von luger
i suggest this prisoner be kept
under the strictest security
confinement permanently
make a note of herr
kuhn suggestion
we have reason to believe
he is the leader
of numerous criminal
escape attempts
squadron leader bartlett has
been three months in your care
and the gestapo has only
reason to believe
if he once more falls into our
hands he will not be so lucky
air-force officer
prisoners are the
responsibility of the luftwaffe
not the ss or the gestapo
at present yes colonel
that is why he is returned
for the moment to your care
of course if the luftwaffe
is not up to the task
the prisoners will find
themselves totally in our charge
we regretfully are not so
professionally understanding
squadron leader bartlett
if you escape again and be
caught you will be shot
heil hitler
heil hitler
heil hitler
herr kuhn
take these things off the man
eric
hello roger
they dumped you here too
what this one like
well it new
here let find you a bed
thanks
come in
hello roger
hello sir
ill put your bag in your room
thanks eric
how are you
as well as can be expected
the fellows wanted
to put up a welcome
committee but that for later
i saw willie and
willinski with mac
a lot of old friends here
how long have you been here sir
arrived today
new camp expert
guards the elite
you met the commandant
yes i did
what were the gestapo and
the ss doing with you
they wanted to find out who
helped me to the border
who else is here cavendish
nimmo and sorren
griffith haynes
blythe
yes
almost the whole x organisation
almost they cleaned
out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one
as von luger put it all the
rotten eggs in one basket
there madness in their method
what about tommy bristol
no but there an
american hendley
is he a scrounger blackmailer
macdonald says he the best
good
last of the tea until the red
cross gets through again
i scrounged this from sedgwick
did the gestapo give
you a rough time
not nearly as rough as i
now intend to give them
roger personal
revenge must be kept
out of what we have to do here
too many lives are at stake
what my personal feelings
are is of no importance
you appointed me big x and
it my duty to harass
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability
that true
that what i intend to do
im gonna cause such a terrible
stink in this third
reich of theirs
that thousands of troopsll be
tied up here looking after us
how
by putting more men out of this
perfect camp of theirs than
have ever escaped before
not two or three or
a dozen but 200
300 scatter them
all over germany
think that possible
the men are here to do it
the goons have put
every escape artist
in germany here you
said so yourself
have you thought of
what it might cost
ive thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit
knuckle under and crawl
surely you dont advocate
that do you sir
i have to point out one
thing to you roger
no matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be
the high command have left us
in the hands of the luftwaffe
not the gestapo and the ss
look sir you talk about the
high command of the luftwaffe
then the ss and the gestapo
to me theyre the same were
fighting the bloody lot
there only one way
to put it sir
they are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom
if they didnt approve of hitler
why didnt they throw him out
i have no argument
with you roger
as senior officer im merely
pointing out a pertinent fact
when are you calling a meeting x
tonight
gentlemen no doubt youve heard
the immortal words of
our new commandant
devote your energies to
things other than escape
and sit out the war as
comfortably as possible
ha
well that exactly
what were going to do
were going to devote our
energies to sports and gardening
all the cultural pursuits as
far as theyre concerned
in fact were going to
put the goons to sleep
meanwhile we dig
now even a superficial
look at the compound
shows us that huts 04 and
five are closest to the woods
the first tunnel
goes out from 05
directly east under the
cooler and the wire
but that over 300 feet roger
did you make a survey dennis
only a temporary one sir
i make it just over 335 feet
tell me when youve
got an exact one
willie this time
well dig straight
down 30 feet before
we go horizontal
thatll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing
all right roger but did
you say the first tunnel
i did therell be three
well call them tom
dick and harry
tom goes out directly
east from 04
dick goes north from the kitchen
and harry goes out
parallel to tom from 05
if the goons find one
well move into the other
how many men do you plan
to take out roger
two hundred and fifty
therell be no half
measures this time
identification
papers for everyone
and griff well need
outfits for the lot
two hundred and fifty
mostly civilian clothes
yes but
ok roger
mac maps blankets rations
compasses for all the walkers
timetables for every train
right roger
sorry im late roger
it all right colin sit down
were going to tunnel
splendid
willie you and dannyll be tunnel
kings danny in charge of traps
sedgwick manufacturer
griff as i said tailor
nimmo and haynes
diversions mac of
course will take
care of intelligence
hendley we havent met
scrounger
right
dennis maps and surveys
colin youll take your usual job
eric how are you gonna
get rid of this dirt
usual places i hadnt anticipated
three tunnels but well manage
roger who going to handle
security for all this
you are i want a system of
stooges covering this compound
from front to back checking
every goon in and out
i want a signal system
so perfect that
if ever a ferret
gets within 50 feet
of any of the huts in
which were working
we can shut down without a sign
well i dont think there much
point in discussing any more now
ill meet each of
you on the exercise
circuit well pound
out the details
nothing else is there mac
i shouldnt think so roger
oh hello my name blythe
hendley
for birds
i used to do a little
hunting myself
oh not hunting watching
oh a bird watcher
yes that right watching
them and drawing them
i suppose you have bird
watchers in the states
yes we have some
tea
i only drank tea once
in the hospital
where your kit
this is it
the rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown
the goons didnt appreciate some
of my more personal items
such as
youre the scrounger
yes that right
ill need a camera
what kind
a good one
a 35mm f28 with a focal-plane
shutter should do all right
all right
and film of course
oh of course
oh hendley i need a
pick big heavy one
only one
two would be better
im afraid this tea pathetic
i must have used these wretched
leaves about 20 times
it not that i mind so much
tea without milk
is so uncivilised
yeah ill get our wood
close up close up
close up
close up
close up
no me sprechen the english
close up
oh splendid
blythe what are you doing here
oh
im in photographic aerial
reconnaissance interpretation

myself it my own silly fault
the aircraft bought it got
shot down terrifying
no i mean what do you do here

oh
im the forger
forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut
sedgwick
im in 0
griffith
well id like to
work in 09 roger
09 right
ill work in 07
for now danny willie and their
trap team will be in 04
i want to take a
chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without
any shoring-up
we will need timber for the
shafts and the entrance chambers
hendley figures there
are 36 empty bunks
we can tear up 5 and move the men
around so the goons
wont miss them
the rest will come from
strips off the wall
is hendley taking
care of this himself
not yet
he working on some steel
for a pick that danny needs
hey what the hell
is going on here
turn the water off
get your hands away
get away
hey what the hell
going on there
stop this nonsense
get away turn the water off
somewhere
in the stove we keep
fire burning always
the goons will not
feel like moving it
good
hendley two tiles
they are chipped
we need new ones
there some in 3 washroom
should match perfectly
good
it going to be a
bit tricky danny
not when youre organised mac
were ready
big enough
it perfect right through
the middle of the foundation
good luck to us danny
why 7
this is the 7th tunnel
danny started
all right
it good
it very good
out
get out
get out
out hier
out get done there
you back there out here
youre not in your hut
what are you doing here
mopping up
and you
shower i need a wash
im watching him im a lifeguard
out
put on warm clothes you
might be outside all night
out
no i vote no look weve put the
goons to sleep exactly
like you said
but just one little
thing like this and
were up the creek
without a paddle
ives sit down wont you
hello sir
hello squadron leader
bartlett captain hilts
flight lieutenant macdonald
i understand you two are
contemplating a blitz-out
whered you hear that sir
macdonald it mac job to
know everything that goes on
we thought perhaps
we might talk it over
why it only a two-man job
everybody in the
camp is supposed to
clear all escape
attempts in advance
with squadron leader
bartlett here
we dont necessarily
want to interfere
it just that well what sort
of blitz were you contemplating
we sneak out at night to a spot i
found near the wire a blind spot
then we dig down
take the dirt spread
it on top so it wont make a pile
and then straight out
ives here is a tunnel
man so he digs
in front pushes the
dirt behind him
i stash it behind
me then we burrow
through the dirt like
a couple of moles
by dawn were under
the wire across the
open space into the
woods and gone
well
when do you intend to try this
when do you intend to try it
oh tonight
hilts this may not be quite the
right time for this sort of thing
look sir ive been in the
bag nearly three years now
bloody close to being wire-happy
it a blitz-out for
me or forget it
itll work i know it will
good luck
thank you
hilts how do you breathe
we got a steel rod
with hinges on it
we shove it up and make
air holes as we go along
good night sir
now why didnt anybody
think of that before
it so stupid it
positively brilliant
but itll bring every goon in
the camp down on top of us
i dont know perhaps
were being too clever
if we stop all the breakouts
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling
i hope it works if it doesnt
theyre going to be in the
cooler for an awful long time
good huh
danny it bloody beautiful
this is the dirt
from the compound
this is from the tunnel
wherever we put it theyre
going to spot it a mile away
maybe we could put it under the
huts the dirt dark there
it the first place
the ferrets would
look i saw one
measuring yesterday
maybe we could dry it
to the same colour
there are 50 tons of it
i was just thinking out loud
if you must think for
god sake think clearly
where the devil is ashley-pitt
we cant destroy the dirt
and we cant eat it
the only thing left to
do is camouflage it
that as far as my
thinking takes me
didnt they teach you
promptness in the rn
youll never believe it but
i think i have the solution
the problem is somehow
to get rid of
this tunnel dirt
over the compound
well of course
would you mind
now
you fill these bags with
the dirt from the tunnel
then wearing them
inside your trousers
you wander out into the compound
where you pull these
strings in your pockets
out come the pins
eric it good
all you have to do is kick it in
unless youre a fool the
ferrets wont see a thing
it indecently brilliant
what do you think roger
well try it first thing tomorrow
i already have it works
mac this is what well do
a little present from tom sir
thank you nimmo
nice garden youve got sir
all right let look sharp
that looks sharp
sir
please gentlemen continue this
is merely a routine inspection
good morning squadron leader
good morning sir
i am sorry the soil here isnt
better suited to
your men purpose
well manage sir
i must say i am surprised with the
extent of this activity
group captain
pleased of course but surprised
surprised colonel
fliers are gentlemen
not peasants to
dig in the earth
so i am surprised
the english are keen on gardening
oh yes but flowers
is this not so
you cant eat flowers colonel
good point
i have the nasty feeling he
knows exactly what were doing
maybe he does
you dont really think so do you
if he does well
find out soon enough

and that im sure
youll all remember
is the voice of the
nelles warbler
let turn our attention to this
gentleman the masked shrike
lanius nubicus the butcherbird
the shrike impales his foes on
the spikes of thorn bushes
not a very lovable
character you see
let have a look
at the colouring
uniform black above
from head to tail
a black rump a black crown
with a bold white flash
and a white line over the eye
the shrike lives in
lightly wooded country
ah hendley sit down youll find
drawing materials on the table
the shrike lives in lightly wooded
country olive groves and gardens
well hendley have you
taken to birds too now
yeah stick around you
might learn something
i have better things
to do than draw birds
the voice is a
monotonous succession
of scratchy complaining notes
now let have a
good look at this
bird he got a round shape
on holiday certificate
permission to cross
a frontier here another one
which one the forgery
that one
that right
they both are
what holding us up now is the
new form of this travel permit
weve no idea what they look like
here one
and a military identity card
and a
a passport
yeah
permission to be
on reich property
a ticket to oden
what appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week
you get ten out of ten
for this old boy
thank you sir take
good care of that
where did you get this
it on loan
in order to get the right
amount of outfits roger
i suggest that we work mainly
from service uniforms
i can do double-breasts
single-breasts
and rather nice lounge suits
lapels i can do quite a
lot of things with those
i can have them deep like
that or high ones like that
here one that were
working on right now
oh yes what about buttons
take a look at those here
one that ive finished roger
and
here one that i dyed
with a bottle of blue ink
it rather good
what up roger
the goonsd have a field day if
they crashed in on this lot
that sorren
department now ive
started working on
the other materials
this blanket
particularly the
stripes marvellous
coats
yes
ive got the chaps working on
these all over the compound
those battle dresses im
afraid theyre a bit too short
ill have to get the
chaps to make those
into some sort of
working man outfits
blanket ticking
now ive made these into
rather nice little waistcoats
very dapper yes dyed of course
of course
just take a look at this roger
now this blanket
material we scrape
this down until
it really smooth
and then dye it with boot polish
corduroy scrounged by hendley
i wish we had more of this
where in god name
did you get these
hendley
where did he get them
i asked him that
what did he say
dont ask
let me show you some of the
overcoats ive been working on
good morning hilts
oh
well if youre here to find out
if im going out again i am
when
seventeen days 7th of july
dark of the moon
correct
is ives going with you
yeah if he wants to
you know that ives is
close to cracking
yeah
better for him to go out
in the tunnel huh
safer
right
it possible for
one man to get out
through the wire even get away
but there are in
fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself
in this camp who are
trying to escape
i appreciate that
something coming i can feel it
and it coming right around the
corner at me squadron leader
my name roger
all right roger
yours is virgil isnt it
hilts just make it hilts
yes well as i
was saying hilts
we have maps of germany
general maps that is
we have all the
information we need
for the escape routes
out of germany
but what we do not have
is a clear idea of what 500
yards beyond those trees
weve tried every goon
in the camp no go
we must know the exact
position of the local town
we want to know where
we hit the main roads
where the police
stations are where
theyve got their roadblocks
and most important of all weve
got to know how to get from here
to the railway station
no absolutely not when
i get through that wire
im not gonna be making
maps for you guys
im gonna be so far away
you wont hear if theyre
shooting at me with howitzers
understandable
completely
i mean id like to help but
interesting idea
how many you taking out
two hundred and fifty
two hundred and fifty
yeah
youre crazy you too
two hundred and fifty
guys just walking
down the road just like that
well some on the road some
by train some cross-country
theyll have forged
papers clothes
maps compasses rations
youre gonna alert every
goon in the country
anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you
theyre gonna swoop
down and scoop you
up so fast itd make
your head swim
yes well thanks anyway
if i can help on the
tunnel let me know
that good of you
any time
wait a minute
you arent seriously suggesting
that if i get through the wire
and case everything out there
and dont get picked up
to turn myself in and get
thrown back in the cooler
so you can get the
information you need
yes one has to ask some very
strange things in the job i have
well give you a front place
i wouldnt do that
for my own mother
i dont blame you
well ok then
it completely understandable
well ok then
yes well thanks hilts

how do you like the
old escape suit

youll get yourself shot
what the matter with you
im going out through that fence
danny were getting out through
the tunnel were almost clear
please willie let me alone
i cant go in that
tunnel any more
so im going out through the wire
danny think were getting

were getting out through
the tunnel it finished
i go out now
no
danny you go through that
wire and youll get killed
dont do that
willie
since i was a boy
i hate and feared little rooms
closets caves
danny youve dug 7
tunnels over 7 tunnels
because i must get out
i hide the fear and i dig
but tomorrow night in the
tunnel with all those men
im afraid maybe this
time i will lose my head
and ruin the escape for everybody
so i go now
danny ill see you
through the tunnel
ill look after you ill
stick with you all the way
all right
good evening
hello roger
well how do you think we look
good evening sir how are you
it as bad as all that
colin i want first of all
to say that without you
we would not have been ready
that all right i had lots of
help lots of very good help
what the matter roger
you cant go
what do you mean
i cant allow it
why
you cant see your hand
in front of your face
youd be caught before
you got 0 yards
that ridiculous
that ridiculous never heard
anything so absurd in my life
i can see perfectly
i can see perfectly
i can see that pin down there
does that satisfy you
what pin where
colin do you see the
foot of the door
yes of course
put the pin down there will you
all right
all right come on
come on sit down
sit down it was a good try
i hate these last-minute letdowns
but ive only just been told
it too risky for you
dont you think that
colin decision
no i dont
come on roger
we all know the score here well
at least most of us do
your idea of this escape
is to start another front
to foul up the germans behind the
lines all right that fine
but once we get past
that wire and have
them looking all
over germany for us
that mission is accomplished
afterwards we have
some ideas of our own
you mean getting home
back to your family
that right
do you really believe i havent
thought about that too
im sure you have
i know colin has
and roger i have too
we think we can make
it all the way
not colin hed be
an appalling hazard
to the escape that
must be my decision
let talk about hazard
let talk about you
youre the biggest hazard we have
the gestapo has you marked
no one has said you cant go
that true
i have thought about the gestapo
but if youre asking me how far a
commanding officer
is allowed to go
or dare go or should be
permitted to play god
i cant answer you
but i can tell you
a blind man is an
unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation
colin not a blind man as long as
he with me and
he going with me
it all right with you colin
oh yes quite
very well ill arrange
for your escape
numbers to be altered accordingly
good night gentlemen
actually
he quite right
he completely right
i really shouldnt go at all
my eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately
i think they call it
progressive myopia
i can see things up here close
to i can see to work but
youre just a blur
i know
oh hell well make
it in great shape
colin do you have any tea
yes of course
