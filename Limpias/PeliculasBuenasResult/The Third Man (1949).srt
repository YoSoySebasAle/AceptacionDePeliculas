
i never knew
the old vienna before the war
with its strauss music
its glamour and easy charm
constantinople suited me better
i really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market
wed run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay
of course a situation like that
does tempt amateurs
but well they you know they cant stay
the course like a professional
now the city it divided
into four zones you know
each occupied by a power the american
the british the russian and the french
but the centre of the city
that international
policed by an international patrol
one member of each of the four powers
wonderful what a hope they had
all strangers to the place
and none of them
could speak the same language
except a sort of smattering of german
good fellows on the whole
did their best you know
vienna doesnt really look any worse
than a lot of other european cities
bombed about a bit

excuse me have you got a toothache
number 8 mr martins
come upstairs a moment
i know a very good dentist
i dont need a dentist
somebody hit me that all
goodness we must report that to the police
were they trying to rob you
oh just a soldier i was trying
to punch his major in the eye
no a major were you really
heard of harry lime
well ive heard of him of course
but i didnt exactly know him
i was going to stay with him
but he died thursday
goodness that awkward
that what you say to people after death
goodness that awkward
mr martins excuse me telephone
who is it
baron kurtz
must be some mistake yes
i was a friend of harry lime
id very much like to meet you baron
come around
austrians arent allowed in your hotel
couldnt we meet at the mozart cafe
where
just around the corner
how will i know you
ill carry a copy of one of your books
harry gave it to me
be there in a moment wait a minute
if i do this lecture business
youll put me up here a while
certainly
it a deal
you ever read a book of mine called
the lone rider of santa fe
no not that one sir
it a story about a man
who hunted down a sheriff
who was victimizing his best friend
seems exciting
it is
im gunning just the same way
for your major callaghan
sounds anti-british sir
baron kurtz
mr martins
delighted to meet you
come let sit down here
what would you like tea coffee
coffee
it wonderful how you keep the tension
tension
suspense
you really liked it
at the end of every chapter
you are left guessing
what hell be up to next
so you were a friend of harry
i think his best except you of course
the police have a crazy notion that
he was mixed up in some sort of a racket
everyone in vienna is we all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing
i tell you ive done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war
once when i was hard up
i sold some tyres on the black market
i wonder what my father would have said
im afraid the police meant
more than that
they get rather absurd ideas sometimes
he somewhere now
he wont mind about that
even so im not going
to leave it at this
will you help me
i wish i could
but you know i am an austrian
i have to be careful with the police
im afraid i cant help you
except with advice of course
advice
we came out of his place like this
and were walking this way
a friend of his called to him
from over there
harry went across
and from up there came the truck
it was just about here
here
yes
his friend and i picked him up
carried him across over here
it was a terrible thing terrible
we laid him down just about here
and this is where he died
even at the end
his thoughts were of you
what did he say
i cant remember the exact words holly
i may call you holly maynt i
he always called you that to us
he was anxious i should
look after you when you arrived
to see that you got safely home
tickets you know and all that
but you said he died instantaneously
well he died before
the ambulance could reach us
well there was only you and this uh
this friend of his uh who was he
a romanian mr popescu
id like to talk to him
he has left vienna
uh excuse me
yes
did you know mr lime well
mr lime yes
you remember me upstairs
yes i remember you
who used to visit mr lime
visit eh
what did he say
he says he doesnt know everybody
excuse me
who was at the funeral besides you
only his doctor dr winkel
wasnt there a girl there
some girl of the josefstadt theatre
you know what harry was
you oughtnt to speak to her
it would only cause her pain
not necessarily
shed probably want to help
what the good of another post-mortem
suppose you dig up something
well discreditable to harry
would you give me your address
i live in the russian sector
but youll find me at
the casanova club every night
one has to work the best way one can
you know
what the name of this girl
i dont know
i dont think i ever heard it
you did mention the theatre
josefstadt
but i still think it wont do
harry any good
youd do better to think of yourself
ill be all right
of course im so glad ive met you
a master of suspense
such a good cover i think
number 8 please
major calloway compliments sir
here the ticket for the plane tomorrow
you tell the major i wont need it
oh porter order me a ticket tonight
for the josefstadt theatre
ah mr martins
good evening mr crabbin
he said i was to drive you
to the airfield
or take you to the bus sir
whichever you prefer
didnt you hear mr crabbin offer me
the hospitality of the hq bmt
i was a friend of harry lime
afterwards
uh miss schmidt
oh come in
thank you
sit down
thank you i enjoyed the play very much
excuse me
you were you were awfully good
do you understand german
no excuse me
i could follow it fine
oh yes
perhaps harry told you about me
my name is holly martins
no he never told me about his friends
oh
would you like some tea
thank you
someone threw me this packet last week
sometimes the british do instead
of flowers you know on the first night
that was a bouquet too from an american
would you rather have whisky
oh tea fine
good i wanted to sell it
oh there is some tea left
had you known him some time
yes
i wanted to talk to you no thank you

there nothing really to talk about
is there nothing
well i saw you at the funeral
im so sorry i didnt notice much
you were in love with him werent you
i dont know
how can you know
a thing like that afterwards
i dont know anything any more
except i want to be dead too
some more tea
no no tea
would you like a cigarette
oh american thank you i like them
i was talking to another friend
of harry a baron kurtz
do you know him
no
he got a little dog
oh yes yes
dont understand what harry saw
in a fellow like that
that was the man who brought me
some money when harry died
he said harry had been
anxious at the last moment
hmm he said he remembered me too
seems to show he wasnt in much pain
dr winkel told me that
dr winkel who he
a doctor harry used to go to
he was passing just after it happened
his own doctor
yes
well were you at the inquest
yes they said it wasnt
the driver fault
harry had often said what
a careful driver he was
he was harry driver
mmm-hmm
well uh i dont get it
all of them there
uh kurtz this romanian uh popescu
his own driver knocking him over
his own doctor just passing by
no strangers there at all
i know
ive wondered about it 00 times
if it really was an accident
what difference does it make
he dead isnt he
but if it wasnt an
fräulein schmidt
i must hurry
they dont like us to use the lights
the porter saw it happen
then why worry
look do you know that porter
yes
what he saying
he says it happened right down there
happened yes
happened right down there
you saw it
well not saw heard
heard i heard the brakes
and i got to the window and saw them
carry the body to the other side
uh of the josef the josef
emperor josef statue
why didnt they bring him in the house
could he have been conscious
conscious
uh was he still alive
ah alive he couldnt have been alive
not with his head in the way it was
i was told that he did not die at once
no i mean that
no you
he was quite dead
he was oh yeah he was quite dead
he was quite dead
but this sounds crazy
if he was killed at once
how could he have talked about me
and this lady here after he was dead
why didnt you say
all this at the inquest
uh it better not to be
mixed up in things like this
things like what
i was not the only one
who did not give evidence
who else
three men helped to carry
your friend to the statue
kurtz
yes
the romanian
yes
and
there was a third man
he didnt give evidence
you dont mean the doctor
no no no
he came later after they carried him
to the josef statue
what did this man look like
i didnt see his face
he didnt look up he was uh
quite uh gewöhnlich ordinary
he he might have been
just anybody
just anybody
hello hello
hello
hello
who was that
i dont know they didnt answer
but i was told
there were only two men there
youve got to tell your story
to the police
the police why police
it nonsense it is all nonsense
it was an accident
you dont know it was an accident
you only saw a dead man
with three men carrying him
i should have listened to my wife
she said you were up to no good gossip
suppose i take your evidence
to the police
now hold on
i have no evidence
i saw nothing i said nothing
it not my business
well make it your business
hold on
i have always liked you
but you must not bring this gentleman again
you must go at once please please

thank you
you were born
in graz of austrian parents
yes
paine
hmm
it very good sir isnt it eh
how much did you pay for this
im afraid i shall have to keep
this for a while miss schmidt
how do you expect her to live
in this city without her papers
write her out a receipt paine
and give her a receipt for those letters too
this way miss
i suppose it wouldnt interest you
to know that harry lime was murdered
youre too busy you havent even
bothered to get the complete evidence
must you take those
theyll be returned miss
they are private letters
that all right miss dont worry
were used to it like doctors
there was a third man there i suppose
that doesnt sound peculiar to you
im not interested in whether
a racketeer like lime
was killed by his friends
or by an accident
the only important thing
is that he dead
im sorry
tactful too arent we callaghan
calloway
must you take those letters
yes im afraid so
theyre harry
that the reason
you wont learn anything from them
theyre only love letters
there are not many of them
theyll be returned to you miss schmidt
as soon as theyve been examined
there nothing in them
harry never did anything
only a small thing once
out of kindness
and what was that
youve got it in your hand
major calloway
finished
yes okay
you will have to come
with us miss schmidt
youre not locking her up
go home martins
like a sensible chap
you dont know what youre mixing in
get the next plane
as soon as i get to the bottom of this
ill get the next plane
death at the bottom of everything martins
leave death to the professionals
mind if i use that line
in my next western
you cant chuck me out
my papers are in order
here we are miss
your receipt for the letters
i dont want it
well ive got it

only complaining about the way
they behave in her house
give her some cigarettes
uh cigarettes hmm

thank you
i have guests waiting
we were both friends of harry lime
i was his medical adviser
i want to find out all i can
find out
hear the details
i can tell you very little
he was run over by a car
he was dead when i arrived
who was with him
two friends of his
you sure two
quite sure
could he have been at all conscious
i understand he was yes
for a short time
while they carried him across the road
in great pain
mmm not necessarily
could he have been capable
of making plans
for me and others just
just during those few moments
i understand he left some
instructions before he died
i cannot give an opinion
i was not there
my opinion is uh
limited to the causes of death
have you any reason to be dissatisfied
was it possible that his death
might have been
not accidental
could he have been
could he have been
pushed dr winkel
winkel
i cannot give an opinion
the injuries to the head and skull
would have been the same
major may i see you
for a moment please
certainly brodsky what is it
this forgery is very clever
and we are interested in this case
have you arrested the girl
no not yet
please keep this passport to yourself
until i make some inquiries will you major
yes of course
thank you
right sit down miss schmidt
well send your letters
and things back to you
and my passport
well need that for a while longer
what did he mean
you know as much as i do
miss schmidt
you were intimate
with lime werent you
we loved each other do you mean that
do you know this man
ive never seen him
joseph harbin
no
he works in a military hospital
no
it stupid to lie to me miss schmidt
im in a position to help you
im not lying
youre wrong about harry
youre wrong about everything
in one of his letters
he asked you to telephone
a good friend of his called joseph
he gave you the number
of the casanova club
that where a lot of friends
of lime used to go
it wasnt important
what was the message
something about meeting harry
at his home
harbin disappeared
the day you telephoned
weve got to find him
you can help us
what can i tell you but
youve got everything upside down
okay
that american friend of yours
is still waiting for you
he wont do you much good
i thank you miss schmidt
well send for you when we want you
hello mr martins ive been trying
to get you at your hotel
ive arranged that lecture for tomorrow
well what about
on the modern novel
you remember what we arranged
oh
now they want you to talk
on the crisis of faith
what that
oh i thought youd know youre a writer
but of course you do
good night young man
oh ive forgotten my hat
ill let you know the time later
mmm
drink
whisky
two whiskies
how much
oh they dont take army money here
how much did he say
harry
yes
he moved his head
but the rest is good isnt it
good evening miss schmidt
good evening
youve found out my little secret
a man must live
how goes the investigation
have you proved the policemen are wrong
not yet
but you will our friend dr winkel
said you had called
wasnt he helpful
well he was uh limited
but mr popescu is here tonight
the romanian
yes the man who helped carry him
i thought hed left vienna
he back now
well id like to meet
all of harry friends
ill bring him to you
havent you done enough for tonight
the porter said three men carried
the body and two of them are here
who are you looking for now
ssh ssh dont dont please dont
silly-looking bunch
mr popescu mr martins
how do you do
how do you do
any friend of harry is a friend of mine
ill leave you together
good evening miss schmidt
you remember me
of course
i helped harry fix her papers mr martins
oh you did
not the sort of thing
i should confess to a stranger
but you have to break
the rules sometimes
humanity is a duty
cigarette miss schmidt
keep the pack
i understand you were with harry
two double whiskies
it was a terrible thing
i was just crossing the road
to go to harry
he and the baron were on the sidewalk
maybe if i hadnt started to cross the road
it wouldnt have happened
i cant help blaming myself
and wishing things had been different
anyway he saw me and stepped
off the sidewalk to meet me
and the truck
it was terrible mr martins terrible
ive never seen a man killed before
i think there was something funny
about the whole thing
funny
something wrong
of course there was
some ice for mr martins
you think so too hmm
it was so terribly stupid
for a man like harry
to be killed in an ordinary
street accident
that all you meant
what else
who was the third man
i oughtnt to drink it
it makes me acid
what man would you be
referring to mr martins
i was told that a third man
helped you and kurtz carry the body
oh i dont know how you got that idea
youll find all about it
in the police report
there was just the two of us
me and the baron
who could have told you
a story like that
the porter at harry place
he was cleaning the window at the time
and saw the accident
no no he didnt see the accident
but he saw three men carrying the body
why wasnt he at the police inquiry
he didnt want to get involved
youll never teach these austrians
to be good citizens
it was his duty to give the evidence
even so he remembers wrong
what else did he tell you
that harry was dead
before you got him to that statue
he probably knows a lot more than that
somebody lying
hmm not necessarily
the police say he was
mixed up in some uh racket
oh that quite impossible
he had a great sense of duty
your friend kurtz
seems to think it was possible
i understand how an anglo-saxon feels
the baron hasnt travelled you know
he seems to have been around a bit
do you know a man called uh harbin
no
joseph harbin
joseph harbin no no
that a nice girl that
but she ought to go careful in vienna
everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this
he will meet us at the bridge good
hello is it so very important for you
yes it is
i am not a bad man
id like to tell you something
tell me how did the car
ssh ssh
come tonight my wife goes out
all right ill come back but
shh tonight
does that mean come in
oh yes yes come in
the porter going to talk
to us tonight
need we go through it all again
i can manage by myself you busy
just another part ive got to learn
can i hear you
in german
i can try
is it comedy or tragedy
comedy i dont play tragedy
do i uh read
well you read this
oh well uh
what that
uh heurigen i guess
h-e-z-t
oh let me see
no no that not the cue
it means she has to sit down
well uh frau hausman
no no
it no good
bad day
it always bad about this time
he used to look in around 600
ive been frightened
ive been alone without friends and money
but ive never known anything like this
please talk tell me about him
tell you what
oh anything just talk
where did you see him last
when what did you do
oh we didnt make much sense
we drank too much
once he tried to steal my girl
where is she
oh that was nine years ago
tell me more
well it very difficult
you knew harry
we didnt do anything very amusing
he just made everything
seem like such uh fun
was he clever when he was a boy
i suppose so he could fix anything
what sort of things
oh little things
how to put your temperature up
before exam the best crib
uh how to avoid this and that
he fixed my papers for me
he heard the russians
were repatriating people like me
who came from czechoslovakia
he knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps
yeah
when he was 4
he taught me the three-card trick
that growing up fast
he never grew up
the world grew up
around him that all
and buried him
anna
youll fall in love again
dont you see i dont want to
i dont ever want to
come on out and have a drink

another murder in this case
and you were born to be murdered
so youre going to hear the facts
you havent told me a single one yet
have you ever heard of penicillin
well
in vienna there hasnt been
enough penicillin to go around
so a nice trade started here
stealing penicillin
from the military hospitals
diluting it to make it go further
and selling it to patients
do you see what that means
are you too busy
chasing a few tubes of penicillin
to investigate a murder
these were murders
men with gangrened legs
women in childbirth
and there were children too
they used some of this
diluted penicillin against meningitis
the lucky children died
the unlucky ones went off their heads
you can see them now in the mental ward
that was the racket
harry lime organised
calloway you havent shown me
one shred of evidence
were just coming to that
paine magic lantern show
very good sir

a medical orderly at the general hospital
he worked for lime and helped
to steal the stuff from the laboratories
we forced him to give information to us
which led us as far as kurtz and lime
but we didnt arrest them
as our evidence wasnt complete
and it might have spoiled
our chances of getting the others
next paine
id like a word with this orderly harbin
so would i
well bring him in
i cant he disappeared a week ago
this is more like a mortuary
than police headquarters
we have better witnesses look here
how could he have done it
£70 a tube
go back to the hotel
and do keep out of trouble
ill try and fix things with the austrian
police youll be all right in the hotel

harry was real
he wasnt just your friend and my lover
he was harry
well dont preach wisdom to me

hack writer who
drinks too much and
falls in love with girls

if youd rung me up and asked me
were you fair or dark
or had a moustache
i wouldnt have known
oh i am leaving vienna
i dont care whether harry was murdered
by kurtz or popescu or the third man

justice

ive got quite a lot on my mind
you wouldnt do anything
what do you want me to do
be reasonable
get somebody else to…
do you expect me to give myself up
why not
it a far far better thing that
i do with the old limelight the
fall of the curtain no
holly you and i arent heroes
the world doesnt make any heroes
youve got plenty of contacts
outside of your stories
ive got to be so careful
im only safe in the russian zone im only
safe here as long as they can use me
as long as they can use you
i wish i could get rid of this thing
so that how they found out about anna
you told them didnt you
dont try to be a policeman old man
what do you expect me to be part of your
part
you can have any part you want
as long as you dont interfere
ive never cut you out of anything
yes i remember when they raided the
gambling joint you knew a safe way out
sure
yeah safe for you not safe for me
old man you never should have
gone to the police you know
you ought to leave this thing alone
have you ever seen any of your victims
you know i never feel comfortable
on these sort of things
victims dont be melodramatic
tell me
would you really feel any pity
if one of those dots stopped moving forever
if i offered you £20000
for every dot that stopped
would you really old man
tell me to keep my money
or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spare
free of income tax old man
free of income tax
the only way you can
save money nowadays
a lot of good your money
will do you in jail
that jail in another zone
there no proof against me
besides you
i should be pretty easy to get rid of
pretty easy
i wouldnt be too sure
i carry a gun
i dont think theyd look for a bullet wound
after you hit that ground
they dug up your coffin
and found harbin
mmm-hmm
pity
holly
what fools we are
talking to each other this way
as though id do anything to you
or you to me
youre just a little mixed up
about things in general
nobody thinks in terms of human beings
governments dont why should we
they talk about the people
and the proletariat
i talk about the suckers and the mugs
it the same thing
they have their five-year plans
and so have i
you used to believe in god
oh i still do believe in god old man
i believe in god and mercy and all that
but the dead are happier dead
they dont miss much here poor devils
what do you believe in
well if you ever get anna out of this mess
be kind to her youll find she worth it
i wish i had asked you to bring me
some of those tablets from home
holly i would like
to cut you in old man
there nobody left
in vienna i can really trust
and we have always done
everything together
when you make up your mind
send me a message
ill meet you any place any time
and when we do meet old man
it is you i want to see not the police
remember that wont you
and dont be so gloomy
after all it not that awful
remember what the fellow said
in italy for 30 years under the borgias
they had warfare terror murder
and bloodshed
but they produced michelangelo
leonardo da vinci and the renaissance
in switzerland they had brotherly love
they had 500 years of democracy and peace
and what did that produce the cuckoo clock
so long holly
but look here martins
you can always arrange to meet him at
at some little cafe
here in the international zone
it wouldnt work
well never get him in the russian zone
calloway you expect too much

you proved your stuff but
20 years is a long time

ive asked your people
to help with lime
that a different case
it is being looked into
so long major
in the last war a general would
hang his opponent picture on the wall
