thank you mr gittes
call me jake
careful driving home curl huh
mrs mulwray waiting for you
with mr walsh and mr duffy
mrs mulwray may i present mr gittes
mrs mulwray how do you do
mr gittes
now what seems to be the problem
my husband
i believe is seeing another woman
no really
im afraid so
i am sorry
mr gittes please do you think
we could discuss this alone
sighing
im afraid not mrs mulwray
these are my operatives
and at some point
theyre going to have to assist me
i cant do everything myself
of course not
now
clearing throat
what makes you certain
that your husband is
involved with someone
a wife can tell
mrs mulwray
do you love your husband
yes of course
then go home and forget everything
but i
im sure that he loves you too
mrs mulwray
do you know the expression
let sleeping dogs lie
youre better off not knowing
i have to know
sighing
very well
clearing throat
what is your husband first name
hollis
hollis mulwray
water and power
he chief engineer
chief engineer
sighing
mrs mulwray this
this type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook
it takes time
money doesnt matter to me mr gittes
okay well
well see what we can do
gentlemen today
you can walk out that door
turn right hop a streetcar
and within 25 minutes
end up smack in the pacific ocean
now you can swim in it and you can
fish in it but you cant drink it
and you cant irrigate
an orange grove with it
now remember
we live next door to the ocean
but we also live on
the edge of a desert
los angeles is a desert community
beneath this building
beneath our streets is a desert
and without water
the dust will rise up and cover us
as though we never existed
now the alto vallejo
can save us from this
and i respectfully suggest
that $85 million
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets
and not on top of them
man hear hear
chattering
people applauding
mayor bagby let hear
from all the departments again
i suppose wed better take
water and power first
mr mulwray
in case youve forgotten gentlemen
over 500 lives were lost
when the van der lip dam gave way
core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the van der lip disaster
it couldnt withstand
that kind of pressure
and now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam
with slopes of 25 2 feet high
and a 2000-acre water surface
well it wont hold
i wont build it it that simple
im not going to make
the same mistake twice
thank you gentlemen
people jeering
sheep baaing
man quiet quiet
what the hell do you think youre doing
get those goddamn things out of here
hold some of them
tell me where to take them

mrs mulwray
this alleged affair
your husband was having
the publicity didnt make him

because i thought i would put an end

yes i remember
beg your pardon is something wrong

or two with my two associates

i understand
who was your employer
that could be helpful to both of us
oh no oh no

those people miss
dial tone droning

how do you like them apples

thank you for coming
yes sir
drink
tom collins
with lime not lemon please
tom collins with lime
i got your check in the mail
yes as i said i was very grateful
mrs mulwray
im afraid that not good enough
sighing
how much would you like
oh stop it the money fine
it generous
but i think you short-changed me
on the story
i have
i think so
something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you
you were upset but not that upset
mr gittes dont tell me how i feel
sorry
look you sue me your husband dies
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck ass
excuse me
then you ask me to lie to the police
it wasnt much of a lie
if your husband was killed it was
this could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence
but he wasnt killed
mrs mulwray
i think youre hiding something
well
i suppose i am
actually i knew about the affair
how did you find out
my husband
he told you
and you werent the least bit upset
i was grateful
mrs mulwray
youll have to explain that
why
look i do matrimonial work
it my métier
when a wife tells me that she happy
that her husband is cheating on her
it runs contrary to my experience
unless what
she was cheating on him
were you
i dislike the word cheat
did you have affairs
mr gittes
did he know about it
well i wouldnt run home and tell him
every time i went to bed with someone
if that what you mean
is there anything else you want
to know about me
where were you
when your husband died
i cant tell you
you mean you dont know
where you were
i mean i cant tell you
you were seeing someone too
for very long
i dont see anyone
for very long mr gittes
it difficult for me
now i think you know
all you need know about me
i didnt want publicity
i didnt want to go
into any of this then or now
is that all
exclaiming
by the way
what does this c stand for
cross
it your maiden name
yes
why
no reason
you mustve had a reason
to ask me that
no im just a snoop
exclaiming
no i have my own car the packard
wait a minute sonny
i think you better come with me
but why there nothing more to say
will you get my car please
okay go home
but in case youre interested
your husband was murdered
somebody been dumping
thousands of tons of water
from the city reservoirs
and were supposed to be
in the middle of a drought
he found out about it
and he was killed
there a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue
involuntary manslaughter
if anybody wants to take the trouble
which they dont
it seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up
which is fine by me
but mrs mulwray
i goddamn near lost my nose
and i like it
i like breathing through it
and i still think
that youre hiding something
mr gittes
jj gittes to see mr yelburton
mr yelburton will be
busy for some time
well it my lunch hour i can wait
he liable to be tied up indefinitely
i take a long lunch hour
all day sometimes
gittes humming
whistling
humming
noah cross worked
for the water department
yes
no
well did he or didnt he
he owned it
he owned the water department
yes
you mean he owned
the entire water supply for the city
yes
how did they get it away from him
mr mulwray felt
the public should own the water
mr mulwray
i thought you said cross owned it
along with mr mulwray
they were partners
yes yes they were partners
humming
singing
scraping
mr yelburton will see you now
mr gittes sorry to keep you waiting
these staff meetings

yeah must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances
yes hollis was the best
department chief the city ever had
my goodness

chuckling
well you ought to be more careful
that must really smart

for mrs mulwray
i never was
i dont understand
neither do i actually
you hired me
or you hired that chippy to hire me
mr gittes youre not making
a bit of sense
well let look at it this way
mulwray didnt want to build a dam
he had a reputation
that was hard to get around
you decided to ruin it
then he found out
you were dumping water at night
then he was
drowned
mr gittes
that an outrageous accusation
i dont know what youre talking about
well whitey mehrholtz
over at the times will
dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet
in the middle of a drought that news
mr gittes
were

but we have been diverting a little water
to irrigate orange groves
in the northwest valley
as you know the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water
but weve been trying to help
some of them out
keep them from going under
naturally when you divert water
there a little run-off
yeah a little run-off
whered you say those groves were
in the northwest valley
that like saying theyre in arizona
mr gittes my field men are out
i cant give you the exact location
youre a married man arent you

i dont want to nail you
i want to find out who put you up to it
ill give you a few
days to think about it
call me i can help

maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots
and you can stay
the head of the department
for the next 20 years
inaudible
door closing
drink

yes of course
it was sometime after
i was just out of grade school
when they did that
then you married
your father business partner
youve already got one going
mrs mulwray
does my talking about your father
upset you
why no
evelyn scoffing
yes a little
you see hollis and my
my father
had a falling-out finally
over you
or over the water department
not over me why should it be over me
then it was over
the water department
yes
hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public
and i dont think my
father felt that way
actually it was over
the van der lip dam
you know the dam that broke
oh yeah
yes hollis never forgave him for it
never forgave him for what
for talking him into building it
they never spoke from that time on
you sure about that
of course im sure
sign here
the copy for you
mr gitts
gittes
oh
how do you do
youve got a nasty reputation
mr gitts i like that
thanks
if you were a bank president
that would be one thing
but in your business it admirable
and it good advertising
it doesnt hurt
it why you attracted
a client like my daughter
probably
but im surprised
youre still working for her
unless she suddenly come up
with another husband
no she happens to think
the last one was murdered
howd she get that idea
i think i gave it to her
i hope you dont mind i believe
they should be served with the head
fine long as you dont serve
chicken that way
tell me what do the police say
theyre calling it an accident
who the investigating officer
lou escobar he a lieutenant
do you know him
oh yeah
where from
we used to work together
in chinatown
would you call him a capable man
very
honest
as far as it goes
of course he has to swim
in the same water we all do
of course but youve no reason to think
he bungled the case
none
that too bad
too bad
hmm
it disturbs me makes me think
youre taking my daughter for a ride
financially speaking of course
what are you charging her
my usual fee
plus a bonus if i get results
are you sleeping with her
come come mr gitts
you dont have to think about that
to remember do you
if you want an answer
to that question mr cross
ill put one of my men on the job
good afternoon
mr gitts
gittes
gittes
youre dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband
i dont want her taken advantage of
sit down
what for
you may think you know
what youre dealing with
but believe me you dont
why is that funny
it what the district attorney
used to tell me in chinatown
yeah was he right
exactly what do you know about me
sit down
mainly that youre rich
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers
of course im respectable im old
politicians ugly buildings and whores
all get respectable
if they last long enough
ill double whatever your fee is
and pay you $0000
if you find hollis girlfriend
girlfriend
disappeared hasnt she
yeah
wouldnt it be useful to talk to her
maybe
if mulwray was murdered
shed be one of the last
to have seen him alive
when the last time you saw mulwray
rancheria music playing
sheriff gold posse
bunch of damn fools
who pay $5000 apiece
towards the sheriff re-election
i let them practice up out here
yeah
do you remember the last time
you saw mulwray
at my age you tend to forget
it was five days ago outside
the pign whistle
and you had one hell of an argument
i got the pictures in my office
if thatll help you remember
what was the argument about
my daughter
what about her
just find the girl mr gitts
i happen to know hollis was fond of her
id like to help her if i can
i had no idea you and hollis
were that fond of one another
hollis mulwray made this city
and he made me a fortune
we were a lot closer
than evelyn realized
if you want to hire me i still have to
know what the argument was about
my daughter a very jealous woman
i didnt want her to find out
about the girl
how did you find out
i still got a few teeth left in my head
and a few friends in town
okay
ill
ill have my secretary
draw up the papers
tell me
are you frightened for the girl
or what evelyn might do to her
just find the girl
ill look into it
as soon as ive checked out
some orange groves
orange groves

ive got her
is she all right
she fine
well where is she
with her mother
i got something
id like to show you mr cross
what is it
an obituary column
can you see all right in this light
i guess i can manage
what does it mean
that you killed hollis mulwray
right here
in that pond
you drowned him
and you left these
the coroner report shows mulwray
had salt water in his lungs
hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools
you know what he used to say
i havent the faintest idea
that where life begins
sloughs tide pools
when we first come out here
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand
and let it percolate down to the
bedrock it would stay there
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs
youd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80
he made this city
and that what you were going to do
in the valley
it what i am doing
when the bond issue passes tuesday
therell be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir
im doing it
gonna be a lot of irate citizens
when they find out that theyre paying
for water that theyre not gonna get
oh that all taken care of
see mr gitts
