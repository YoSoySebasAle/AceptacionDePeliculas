
seize upon that
moment long ago
one breath away and
there you will be
so young and carefree
again you will see
that place in time
so gold
still away into
that way back when
you thought that all
would last for ever
but like the weather
nothing can ever
and be in time
stay gold
but can it be when we can see
so vividly a memory
and yes you say
so must the day too fade away
and leave a ray of sun
so gold
life is but a
twinkling of an eye
yet filled with
sorrow and compassion
though not imagined all
things that happen
will age too old
though gold
gold though gold

wounded men lying
in the tracks the sidewalks
stretched out in endless
rows under the car shed
some lay stiff and still but
many withered in the hot sun
everywhere swarms of flies
hovered over the men
crawling and buzzing
in their faces

everywhere was blood
dirty bandages groans
screamed curses of pain

who had refused to
recognise defeat

at him for every
little thing that he does man
he feels things
different than you
it bad enough having
to listen to you
but when you start trying
to get me to take sides
were all we got left now
if we dont have each other
you end up like dallas
and i dont mean dead either
i mean how he was before
so please
dont fight any more
please
sure sure little buddy we
aint gonna fight no more
ponyboy
pone
now dont you start
bawling too pony
one bawling baby in
this family is enough
i aint crying
let go home im cold
ponyboy i asked the nurse
to give you this book
so you could finish it
it was worth saving
those kids their
lives are worth more than mine
they have more to live for
tell dally i think it worth it
im gonna miss you guys
ive been thinking about it and
that poem that guy that wrote it
he meant youre gold when
youre a kid like green
when youre a kid
everything new
dawn
like the way you dig
sunsets pony that gold
keep it that way it
a good way to be
i want you to ask
dally to look at one
i dont think he
ever seen a sunset
there still lots of
good in the world
tell dally i dont
think he knows
your buddy johnny
when i stepped out into
the bright sunlight
from the darkness
of the movie house
i had only two
things on my mind
paul newman and a ride home
seize upon that
moment long ago
one breath away and
there you will be
so young and carefree
again you will see
that place in time
so gold
still away into
that way back when
you thought that all
would last for ever
but like the weather
nothing can ever
and be in time
stay gold
but can it be when we can see
so vividly a memory
and yes you say
so must the day too fade away
and leave a ray of sun
so gold
life is but a
twinkling of an eye
yet filled with
sorrow and compassion
though not imagined
all things that happen
will age too old
though gold
gold gold though gold
