doctor
let get a line in her

please
ekg beeping rapidly
so um despite all our efforts
she failed to respond
okay
and her heart stopped
and unfortunately she did die
right
im sorry mr emhoff
i know this is hard to accept
okay i mean so can i go talk to her
mr emhoff im sorry your wife is dead
i mean i just saw her
we were just at home
is there somebody that we can call
someone who you think should be here
with you
i mean we had dinner we had pizza
she said she was jet-lagged
you mentioned that she was away
hong kong
we checked the latest bulletins
the only things there were measles
and h n
and this was not that
then what was it
we dont always know
i mean some people get a disease and live
some get sicker and die
were gonna have to notify
the medical examiner
and they may request an autopsy
or if you wish we can order one
but i cant guarantee
it gonna tell you any more than i can
i mean my best guess is that this
was either meningitis or encephalitis
and with encephalitis
were in the dark a lot of the time
if it was summer i might say a bug bite
you know west nile
i dont know
herpes can cause encephalitis
she didnt have herpes
what are you talking about
okay
what happened to her
what happened to her
okay okay
mr emhoff there are grief counselors
who are very helpful
with this sort of passing okay
you might find some resolution there
now i am sorry
cell phone ringing
hello
hang up the phone and call 9 right now
right now 9
carrie anne he said he had a headache
so i put him to bed
i dont think he breathing
clark clark
oh my god is he dead
leopold what we are hearing from
beijing is that the outbreak is contained
to the chrysanthemum complex
in hong kong
two deaths and 0 suspected cases
who official
how are we defining contained
leopold theyre using the same protocols
established for sars
theyre quarantining the complex
and screening for symptoms
orantes kowloon is the most densely
populated area in the world
and hong kong is a harbor
it going to spread
leopold
hong kong is sending us blood samples
were also looking at samples
from london
two clusters one at a hotel
the other at a health club
five dead encephalitis
and there the man on the bus in tokyo
three dead in that cluster
any of them travel to china or london
were checking
paramedic
mr neal i want you to stay with me here
can you hear me
have you had seizures before mr neal
i want you to open your eyes if you can
mrs neal he breathing right
sobbing i couldnt wake him
i got home i couldnt wake him
we both woke up sick this morning
paramedic
watch your head
saw buzzing
medical examiner
hmm
well the sulci are obliterated
let look at the base
oh my god
you want me to take a sample or
i want you to move away from the table
should i call someone or
call everyone
cheever well these things happen
up there from time to time
meningitis in a college dorm
after a swim meet
or west nile in some summer camp
near a lake
i was reading that last summer they had
an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis
a hundred and three cases
mainly children
well it probably too cold up there
for that right now
as of last night
there were five deaths and 32 cases
there a cluster
in an elementary school
that the kind of thing
you have to be prepared for
it gonna be all over the news
what your single overriding
communications objective
were isolating the sick and quarantining
those who we believe were exposed
okay good
as of this moment
you and i are attached at the cell phone
if you need resources call me
if you get into a political dogfight call me
if you find yourself wide awake
staring at the walls at 3 a m
wondering why you took the job
call me
dave i sure hope you packed something
warmer than that
were looking at around zero
with the windchill
dont want you to catch cold
do you wanna go to the hotel first
get situated
mears
id prefer to get started if that possible
dave okay
mears how far is the office
about a half-hour from here
doctor
your dad in isolation
you can go up to the window
pick up the phone and you can talk to him
mitch hey
dad
hey
are you sick
no no no im uh
this is all just you know a precaution
theyre you know just making sure
but you were with them
you could still get it
no i wont um
they said this happens really really fast
and uh im fine
there nothing wrong with me
there nothing wrong with me
were okay were okay
and clark
yeah you know i um
i wasnt there
i went uh in the ambulance with uh beth
and uh i just didnt i
i left him with uh carrie anne
i should have been there
i could have helped
no no no honey no no
it good that you werent there
im happy
if something had happened to you
i mean id
honey youre here now you know
im happy about that
im happy about that
when are you coming home
soon very soon they you know
why dont you go uh to your mom
no
just stay in wisconsin
no she doesnt need me
she got dan i live here
you dont have anybody
im not leaving you
official  we have 47 cases
and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon
it a weekend
these numbers might be low
people are staying home for a couple days
see if they get better
at this point i think
we have to believe this is respiratory
maybe fomites too
what that fomites
uh it refers to transmission
from surfaces
the average person touches their face
2or 3000 times a day
twoor 3000 times a day
three to five times every waking minute
in between were touching doorknobs
water fountains
elevator buttons and each other
those things become fomites
is this something we wanna release
to the press respiratory and fomites
how the public gonna react
hard to say a plastic shark in a movie
will keep people from getting
in the ocean but a warning on cigarettes
we need to walk the governor through this
before we freak everybody out
i mean heh we cant even tell people
right now what they should be afraid of
we tried that with swine flu
all we did was get healthy people scared
it the biggest shopping weekend
of the year
official 2
we need to consider closing schools
and who stays home with the kids
people that work at stores
government workers
people that work at hospitals
when will we know what this is
what causes it what cures it
things that keep people calm
what we need to determine is this
for every person who gets sick
how many other people
are they likely to infect
so for seasonal flu
that usually about one
smallpox on the other hand
it over three
now before we had a vaccine
polio spread at a rate
between four and six
now we call that number
the r-nought
r stands for the reproductive rate
of the virus
any ideas what that might be for this
how fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors
the incubation period
how long a person is contagious
sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms
we need to know that too
we need to know how big the population
of people susceptible to the virus might be
so far that appears to be everyone
with hands a mouth and a nose
once we know the r-nought well be able
to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic
so it an epidemic now
an epidemic of what
we sent samples to the cdc
in 72 hours well know what it is
if were lucky
clearly were not lucky
eisenberg
what do we got
a young woman in minnesota
recently traveled to china
son also died
as of this morning 87 cases 5 deaths
did you have a good thanksgiving
i worked
you really
texas salmonella pretty limited
mine was great thanks
oh
it pleomorphic
but tends toward ovoid in shape
i see structures on the surface
that look like glycoproteins
but there nothing
morphologically pathognomonic
we tested all her antibodies
i didnt see much cross-reactivity
her body had no idea what to do with it
it just kept amplifying
hextall
send it to sussman in san francisco
if he doesnt know what it is
nobody does
it shows novel characteristics
and appears to be chimeric in origin
virus is 5 to 9 kilobases in length
and containing six to 0 genes
typical of a paramyxovirus
it godzilla king kong
and frankenstein all in one
sussman hold on shit ill call you back
youve got it in there
get away from here
whered it come from military
youre not a doctor
and youre not a writer
yes i am a writer yes i am
blogging is not writing
it graffiti with punctuation
i am a journalist and there
informed discussion on the blogosphere
that this is a biological weapon
you wanna talk to me
call my office and make an appointment
french dr cheever
yes
do you have a moment
sure
we found him tell the unit
on the way to his house to come in
excuse me who are you
my name is dennis french
with the department of homeland security
and what this all about
rear admiral haggerty expecting us
in the emergency operations center
we can discuss it there
french
this happened in kowloon
today weve got workers at a casino
in macao striking over conditions
three have died in one bunkhouse
cia thinks there may be a connection
casinos are of particular concern
to homeland security
someone ready to blow themselves up
at a pizzeria or the local market
the thought of getting themselves sick
with smallpox
and walking through a crowded casino
must have crossed their mind
what did they die of the three
reports are vague seizures comas
weve reached out to the who
see what they know
if you were gonna plan it
cant think of a better time
plan what
an attack
is there any way
someone could weaponize the bird flu
someone doesnt have to weaponize
the bird flu
the birds are doing that
newscaster officials are reporting
the closing of mondale elementary school
in suburban minneapolis
in response to the recent outbreak
of a still-unknown disease
that has so far taken the life
of a school nurse and three students
other schools in district 28
will remain open
but parents have been notified
to keep home any children with symptoms
the department of health
is awaiting confirmation
but sources say these new cases
may be connected to the sudden death
of a 34-year-old
aimm alderson executive
and her 6-year-old son
this holiday weekend
hello im dr mears
im an epidemic intelligence service
officer
and im here from atlanta to find out
what happened to beth emhoff
okay im gonna ask you some questions
and see if
there was a package she messengered
from hong kong
i opened it with scissors im not sure if
no it shouldnt be an issue
virus cant live for days on a box
we did pilates together
i called her after she got back
i never heard from her
so you had no contact with her
no
did she go to the class
i didnt see her there
we had coffee the day she left
i think she might have moved my cup
because it was on some papers
i cant remember
how many days ago
about 0 days
that okay
the incubation period is less than that
is there anyone else
who might have had contact with her
this was everyone
man  aaron barnes did
man 2
barnes he worked on another floor
man  there were documents she needed
he picked her up from the airport
cell phone ringing
mears he picked her up from the airport
where is he
hello
hello mr barnes
barnes hello yes
this is dr mears
from the centers for disease control
i believe
hi
hi i believe you may have had contact
with beth emhoff last week
yeah i picked her up at the airport
what this about
barnes coughs
and how are you feeling today
uh pretty cruddy to be honest
my head is pounding
i probably picked up some bug
where are you right now
im on the bus heading to work
id like you to get off immediately
what
he on a bus
dave where
where where the bus aaron
um uh
lake and lyndale what going on
lake and lyndale
i really need you to get off that bus
it possible youve come in contact
with an infectious disease
and youre highly contagious
do you understand
i want you to get off now
and stay away from other people
now what do i do
dont talk to anyone dont touch anyone
that the most important thing
well send somebody to meet the bus
okay
im on my way to you now aaron
coughing
what about my kids i touched them
it was a groundbreaking ceremony
for a new factory
she traveled a lot for work
did her work involve contact with livestock
in any way
did you keep any pets at home
no
no
did she mention seeing anyone
who was sick
anyone on a plane
no
she went through customs in chicago
at 5 a m
and then took a flight to minneapolis
at 6 pm
any idea what she did in chicago
during that layover
did she have meetings
is there any reason
she might have left the airport
why i mean is there
someone sick in chicago
uh before we were married
my wife had a relationship
with a man in chicago named jon neal
is jon neal sick
did we get this from him
were investigating all the possibilities
no i think i have a right to know
look at where i am here
look at where i am here
i cant disclose that information im sorry
no im just im just trying to understand
i know
hextall
were getting the same results as sussman
weve sequenced the virus
determined its origin
and weve modeled the way
it enters the cells of the lung and the brain
the virus contains
both bat and pig sequences
the dark green is pig
and the light green is bat
and here you can see
the crossover event
uh bat bat and pig bat
and here is a model of the virus
and how it attaches to its host
the blue is virus and the gold is human
and the red is the viral attachment protein
and the green is its receptor
in the human cells
these receptors are found in the cells
of both the respiratory tract
and the central nervous system
and the virus attaches to the cell
like a key slipping into a lock
somewhere in the world
the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat
you ever seen anything like this before
no and it still changing
it figuring us out
faster than were figuring it out
it doesnt have anything else to do
so we have a novel virus
with a mortality rate in the low 20s
no treatment protocol
and no vaccine at this time
that is correct
cheever sighs
from here on out i want no one working
on this except at bsl-4
last thing we need is for this to walk out of
the lab on the bottom of someone shoe
cell phone ringing
dr sussman office
hextall
ian hi ally hextall
we need to shut you down
this thing too hot uh
bsl-4 only at this point
i think that a mistake
cook your samples
uh destroy everything
we cant risk it
were making progress
you limit this to government-run bsl-4s
itll take forever
i can do this
im sorry
sighs
yeah
sure ally
reporter  on tv
can you repeat the affected cities so far
cheever
again the affected cities are
minneapolis chicago los angeles
boston and salt lake
we expect that list to grow
as people return home
from their holidays
yes
reporter 2 dr cheever
how many people are infected
and how many have died
cheever
those numbers are changing as we speak
so any figure i give you
is likely to be low
were still calculating the mortality rate
at this time
reporter 3
uh dr cheever are you concerned
that the cdc faces
a credibility issue here
after the perceived overreaction
to h n
id rather the story be
that we overreacted
than that many people lost their lives
because we didnt do enough
that why were here
it also why the world health organization
is sending an epidemiologist to hong kong
hard to know what it is
without where it came from
our first job with these things
is to find ground zero
figure out how it jumped
into the population
we do know that a patient in minnesota
traveled to that part of the world
inaudible dialogue
we believe that there are
approximately 89000 cases at this point
and that we are heading
toward 267000
and from there using our model
based on an r-nought of two
here is where we expect to be
in 48 hours
dr cheever perhaps you can update us
on the research
as of right now no one has found
a good way to grow the virus in cells
orantes over monitor
why is that
because it kills every cell we put it in
a pig a chicken everything
until we can grow it and a great deal of it
we cant experiment with it
and until then
we cant vaccinate against it
have you found any treatment at all
any antivirus anything
no
orantes beth emhoff used an atm
at a casino in macao
citibank released her records
we have her using the machine at 043
just off the casino floor
i wanna see the casino security footage
for two hours on either side of that
both speaking in chinese
is there a problem
oh theyre from my village
they found a new cluster there
oh
is your family still there
my mother has symptoms
ill get you the footage you require
excuse me
chattering
woman coughing
phone rings
dr sussman i heard that they were
shutting us down
yeah i just have to deal
with the samples
if it just a matter of destroying them
i can do it
no ill take care of it you go on home
ill do that
and then i just want to recheck some data
cheever
he grew it
hextall he tried antibodies
and immunological mac outlines
but the key was a fetal-bat cell line
from geelong
we didnt have it
he grew it in a bsl-3
ally what the hell was he doing
working with it in a bsl-3
ignoring me
cheever sighs
he gonna publish
shit what does he want
a box of cigars he had a choice ellis
he could have gone into business
for himself
there no doubt he was approached
but he gave it to us
and were supposed to trust him
we dont have a choice
newscaster the centers for disease
control and prevention in the united states
and the world health organization
in switzerland
confirmed today that dr ian sussman
of san francisco
has succeeded in growing
the mev- virus in a laboratory setting
officials at the cdc cautioned that
the breakthrough is only the first step
toward developing a vaccine
which is likely still months away
from human trials
the who estimates the number of people
infected worldwide to be over 8 million
alan
now it all changes
sussman gets anointed
by the national academy of sciences
and every pharmaceutical executive
gets a hard-on
theyll be growing the virus
in every lab on earth
it a bad day to be a rhesus monkey
crikey first we shoot them into space
now well be shooting them full of virus
so this is where we need your expertise
pharmaceutical stocks
are already through the roof
what next where the opportunity
now you saw that shinko bus thing
day one
that why we wanted this meeting
when i turned on my computer
this morning
i had over 2 million unique visitors
all looking for the truth
you think they wanna see me
talking to some hedge-fund guy
mr krumwiede
we dont invent need here
we just analyze it predict it
you tell me what it costs
to look into your crystal ball
youre familiar with forsythia
no im not
what im about to tell you is backed up
by testimonials that will appear shortly
in the media
ill be talking about it extensively
in the days ahead
what does forsythia do
it the cure
mitch if im immune
cant you use my blood to cure this
mears blood serums can take a long time
to make and are very expensive
but the good news here
is that youre not going to get sick
okay um
then that would mean that
my daughter cant get it either right
i cant promise you that
but isnt that something
that she would inherit from me
well half her immune system
came from you
but the other half
came from her mother
clamoring and coughing
man
almost three hours
i need to see a doctor
or a supervisor or something
i wanna know if he has this thing
on the news
nurse im sorry sir
were doing the best we can
man can i just speak to an administrator
or something anybody
nurse
sir please be patient well get you in
man
he sick
dave my wife makes me take off
my clothes in the garage
then she leaves out a bucket of warm water
and some soap
and then she douses everything
in hand sanitizer after i leave
i mean she overreacting right
not really
and stop touching your face dave
okay well put the air lock here
i want 25 rows of 0 beds apiece
the most febrile cases at this end
well set up triage outside
fema can handle food in the basement
and well need to be operational
within the next 24 to 48 hours
gotcha
mears sighs
nice job dave this will work
thanks
now find me three more just like it
footsteps approaching
excuse me dr mears
is this coming out of your budget or ours
sighs
who has confirmed
that the hong kong sample
matches london
tokyo and abu dhabi
and were seeing large clusters in
from frankfurt and cairo
mears over speaker
are we any closer to an index patient
could be your beth emhoff
or the guy on the bus in japan
someone else who crawled off the grid
how you doing
yeah good
im going into a meeting with

with the logistics of evacuating you
finding a plane and all
i got your phone
dr cheever he asked you to call
if you feel up to it
now were setting up a special ward
for medical personnel
and first responders at the university
i wanna move you there
but the nurses union
is calling a work stoppage
until protocols are in place
there are volunteers but it just
it hard right now to know
where the right place
youre asking me to spend
a lot of resources on one person
and right now i cant do that
dr mears would agree with me
she one of our own lyle
we sent her up there
okay i sent her up there
i would like to go get her back
we have a plane with an isolation pod
to bring our people in the field home

theyre setting up roadblocks
theyre shutting down trade
public transportation
the teamsters are pulling drivers
off the road

the secret service

congress is figuring out
how to work online
when the word goes out
there will be a run on the banks
gas stations grocery stores you name it

that nobody knows until everybody knows
alan

aubrey over phone
how many people are gonna die
well in 98
percent of the population died
from spanish flu
it was novel like this
no one had ever seen it before
one percent of america
one percent of the world
as many as 70 million people could die
baby maybe more
so what do we do
i dont know we try to figure it out
this is why i sent mears up there
to minnesota
and now i cant get her back
she sick aubrey
and i cant do anything for her
because there are no nurses
why not
because theyre on strike
how can they do that
because there nothing they can do
were putting healthy people
next to sick people
and hoping the healthy people
dont get sick
im sorry ellis but that not your fault
i sent her up there aubrey
if one in four are dying that means
three out of four are living right

ill find out
when did we run out of body bags
two days ago
were trying to get more in from canada
but they just wanna wait and see
crowd chanting
no more lies no more lies no more lies
thudding on windows
gupta there are stories on the internet
that in india and elsewhere
the drug ribavirin has been shown
to be effective against this virus
yet homeland security is telling the cdc
not to make any announcements
until stockpiles of the drug
could be secured
well dr gupta there continue
to be evaluations of several drugs
ribavirin is among them
but right now our best defense
has been social distancing
no hand-shaking
staying home when youre sick
washing your hands frequently
can you tell us to date how many people
have died from this virus
very difficult were still working
on uh confirming that number
there are 50 different states
in this country
which means there are 50 different
health departments
followed by 50 different protocols
let me bring alan krumwiede
into this debate as well
uh alan a freelance journalist
uh he was the first
to track the shinko bus man video
uh alan today on twitter
you wrote that the truth about this virus
is being kept from the world
by the cdc
by the world health organization
to allow friends of the administration
to benefit from it
both financially and physically
uh there are therapies we know
are effective right now like forsythia
and they dont even appear
on the cdc website
gupta
on your blog you also wrote
that the world health organization
is in bed with pharmaceutical companies
because they are
that who stands to gain from this
theyre working hand in glove
and the hand is reaching
into our pockets
the cdc is exploring forsythia
and other homeopathic treatments
but right now there no science
to back any of these claims
or no way dr cheever or the people
who put him into power can profit from it
were not ruling anything out
there are people who are sick
people who are dying and we are doing
theyre not keeping us safe from this
any more than
were concerned
about every american citizen
dr cheever is being a bit disingenuous
when he says every american citizen
were working very hard to find out
where this virus came from treat it
and vaccinate against it if we can
we dont know all of that yet
we just dont
what we do know
is that in order to become sick
you have to first come in contact with
a sick person or something they touched
in order to get scared all you have to do
is come in contact with a rumor
television or the internet
i think what mr krumwiede is spreading
is far more dangerous than the disease
oh really
yes
that funny
what funny
youre funny
because if you check on facebook
youll find a communiqué attributed
to dr cheever by elizabeth nygaard
about the quarantine of chicago hours
before it was announced to the public
that why i think
he a bit disingenuous
when he says equal care for all
and not just his friends
some pretty wild allegations here
dr cheever
can you tell us what communication
appeared and when
what is the nature of your relationship
with nygaard
im not aware of anything attributed to me
on any social network
im sure youre not it is there it is there
tell them what an r-nought of two
really means dr cheever
teach them some math hm
no ill do it
on day  there were two people with it
and then there were four
and then it was 6
and you think youve got it in front of you
but next it 256 and then it 65000
and it behind you above you
and all around you
in 30 steps it a billion sick
three months
it a math problem you can do on a napkin
and that where were headed
and that why you wont even tell us
the number of the dead
will you dr cheever
but youll tell your friends
when to get out of chicago
before anyone else has a chance
haggerty
theyre looking for a scapegoat
you just made it easy
the only reason were not taking this
to the attorney general
is because we cant replace you
right now
but there gonna be an investigation
do you understand that
and we dont wanna see you
in front of the cameras anymore
whoa whoa whoa
where did you come from
it mutated
cheever which way better or worse
hextall it moved into
an african hiv aids population
the durban cluster is highly divergent
we have a new r-nought ellis
it not two anymore
cheever i thought you said once we could
grow it we could vaccinate against it
we tried using dead virus combined
with atrophins to boost immune response
cheever
and
no protective antibodies
a lot of dead monkeys
can you get to the good news
now we have to try a live attenuated virus
like with polio
exactly
the only danger with a live virus
is the possibility that it will revert
to wild type and kill the host
and when will we know about that
ill ask the monkeys
cheever as of right now
the mortality rate is fluctuating
between 25 and 30 percent
depending upon
underlying medical conditions
socioeconomic factors nutrition
fresh water
with the new mutation
we are predicting an r-nought
of no less than four
and without a vaccine
we can anticipate
that approximately one in 2 people
on the planet will contract the disease

go home andrew
get up
cheever over phone
are we even close
if we even had a viable vaccine
right now
we would still have to do human trials
and that would take weeks
and then we would have to
get clearance and approval
figure out manufacturing
and distribution
that would take months
and then training survivors
to give inoculations
more months more deaths
well homeland security wants to know
if we can put a vaccination
in the water supply like fluoride
cure everyone all at once

gave himself the bug
and then cured himself
you taught me about him
im testing my vaccine
no this is different
i dont want to get you sick
ally you cant take that chance
oh dad youre here

newscaster the food and drug
administration is accelerating approval
of the mev- vaccine
currently in production at five
secret locations in the us and europe
saying the first doses could be available
for human use within 90 days
the who estimates
that it could take nearly a year
to manufacture and distribute
the necessary amount of the vaccine
to stop the spread of the virus
which so far has taken
over 26 million lives worldwide
but as labs work around the clock
to produce the life-saving formula
the question remains who gets it first
dont touch me
burglar where is it
we dont have it
bullshit he works there he gets it first
we dont have it we have to wait
inaudible dialogue
cheever aubrey
aubrey ellis
where are you
aubrey it because they saw you on the
news and they heard about what happened
you all right
they knew where you worked
they waited for you to leave
sighs
get up here come on let me look at you
i tried to stop them
i tried
did they touch you did they look sick
they had masks on ellis and gloves
dont tell me that
aubrey we get the vaccine tomorrow
you have to trust me ellis
they didnt touch me
alan after the spanish flu in 98
you know people got rich
the vicks vaporub people
the lysol people look it up
one man dies
another man makes money off his coffin
one country culls all their chickens
red meat goes into higher demand
im not the first person to make money
off the fact that our immune system
is a work in progress
the pharmaceutical industry
do it every quarter
i dont think anyone is immune
to opportunity alan
it just that studies show
that there is no proof that forsythia works
who conducted the studies
what defines works
against what strain of the virus
did you know about the studies
when we met the last time
we can get in a lot of trouble
do you really think this dr hextall
cdc person is jesus in a lab coat
the government rushed the trials
the lawyers indemnified
the drug companies
maybe it causes autism or narcolepsy
or cancer 0 years from now
who knows
you the
the swine flu vaccine killed people
back in 976
nerve disease
so were all guinea pigs
starting from today
just wait theyll start listing side effects
like the credits at the end of a movie
people trust you alan
if you tell them not to take it
that right
they trust me
all 2 million unique visitors
im a trusted man
stepping up to a microphone
in front of a very large crowd
that who i am that the brand
i say the right thing
nobody shows up for their shot
maybe theyd rather roll the dice
with forsythia
i can make that happen
i just wanna know
im in the best position possible when i do
what does that mean exactly
if im gonna step into the crosshairs
i wanna know what in
is he with you
what who
are you wearing a wire
alan i didnt have a choice
theyve seen your blog
agent
get him
agent 2 speaks indistinctly
agent 3 far enough far enough
for what tell me for what
securities fraud conspiracy
and most likely manslaughter
alan it cured me forsythia cured me
well see alan
this is entrapment
you cant take my blood
you cant that my property
we may never know
where this disease came from
but we do know
that this vaccine is the result
of the courage and perseverance
of a remarkable few
we shall now begin the drawing john
the first mev- vaccination
are those people born on march 0th
march 0th
we remind all of you
to stay 0 feet apart from each other
while on line
typing on keyboard
shouldnt you be downstairs
hextall
im tracking vaccine batch numbers
this is what you have to be doing
right this minute
this is what i want to do
right this minute
cheever sighs
take a bow ally
people have for a lot less
it not that hard
to give yourself an injection
what about mears or my father or you
im gonna take a bow
while you get hauled in front of congress
what do i say when they ask about that
you tell them that i told a loved one
who told a loved one
and that id do it again
without you
ally you have saved millions of lives
that a great story
it also happens to be true
now how often can you say that
the next citizens to receive
the mev- vaccination
are those born on the date
what is that january th
okay all right 44
that ahem there still uh 200
more than 200 birthdays hon
that havent been called so that good
that a good number
what if they run out
theyre not gonna run out
they have enough to keep up with demand
they said that already
maybe im immune like you
and i dont even need it
that not a chance were gonna take
so instead we lose spring
we lose summer
we lose another 44 days
that dont happen again
why cant they invent a shot
that keeps time from passing
mitch it gonna start
getting normal again jory

eyes in a moon of blindness
a river in a time of dryness
a harbor in the tempest
but all the promises we make
from the cradle to the grave
when all i want is you
inaudible dialogue
