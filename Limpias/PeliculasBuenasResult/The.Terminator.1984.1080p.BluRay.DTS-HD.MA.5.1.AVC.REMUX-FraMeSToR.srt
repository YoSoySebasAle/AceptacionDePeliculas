dn3846 assigned to protect you
youve been targeted for termination
this is one-l-9
westbound on olympic
approaching overland
this is a mistake
i didnt do anything
no but you will
it very important that you live
this isnt true how could that
man just get up after you
it not a man a machine
a terminator
cyberdyne systems model 0
a machine like a robot
not a robot a cyborg
cybernetic organism
no he was bleeding
just a second
get your head down
all right listen
the terminator an infiltration unit
part man part machine
underneath it a hyper-alloy
combat chassis microprocessor controlled
fully armored very tough
but outside it living human tissue
flesh skin hair blood
grown for the cyborgs
look reese i dont know
pay attention
i gotta ditch this car
the 600-series had rubber skin
we spotted them easy
but these are new they look human
sweat bad breath everything
very hard to spot
i had to wait till he moved on
you before i could zero him
look i am not stupid
they cannot make things like that yet
not yet not for about 40 years
are you saying it from the future
one possible future
from your point of view
i dont know tech stuff
then youre from the future too
is that right
right
right
cyborgs dont feel pain
i do dont do that again
just let me go
listen and understand
that terminator is out there
it cant be bargained with
it cant be reasoned with
it doesnt feel pity or remorse or fear
and it absolutely will not stop
ever until you are dead
can you stop it
i dont know
with these weapons i dont know
all units
ford suspect vehicle has been
found in a parking structure
reese why me
why does it want me
there was a nuclear war
a few years from now
all this this whole place
everything
it gone just gone
there were survivors
here there
nobody even knew who started it
it was the machines sarah
i dont understand
defense network computers
new powerful
hooked into everything
trusted to run it all
they say it got smart
a new order of intelligence
then it saw all people as a threat
not just the ones on the other side
it decided our fate in a microsecond
extermination
did you see this war
no i grew up after in the ruins
starving hiding from the h-ks
h-ks
hunter-killers
patrol machines
built in automated factories
most of us were rounded up
put in camps for orderly disposal
this was burned in by laser scanner
some of us were kept alive to work
loading bodies
the disposal units ran night and day
we were that close
to going out forever
but there was one man
who taught us to fight
to storm the wire of the camps
to smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk
he turned it around
he brought us back from the brink
his name was connor john connor
your son sarah your unborn son
drive
reese
reese
no reese no no no theyll kill you
you in the cadillac
let me see your hands now
get out of the car
drop to your knees
out of the car
drop to the ground
sarah sarah try to drink some of this
listen are you sure it them
i mean
maybe i should look at the bodies
no theyve been identified
and there no doubt
ginger
kiddo
sarah
sarah this is dr silberman
hi sarah
i want you to tell him everything
reese told you do you feel up to that
yeah i guess so
youre a doctor
criminal psychologist
is reese crazy
that what were gonna find out
so youre a soldier
fighting for whom
with the 32nd under perry
from 2 to 27
that the year 2027
that right
then i was assigned
this is fucking great
under john connor
who was the enemy
a computer defense system built
god damn sorry
built for sac-norad
by cyberdyne systems
i see
and this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy
killing him in effect
before he even conceived
a sort of retroactive abortion
silberman cracks me up
last week a guy burned his afghan
he screwed it first
ed shut up
why didnt the computer
just kill connor then
why this elaborate scheme
with the terminator
it had no choice
their defense grid was smashed
wed won taking out connor
then would make no difference
skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence
is that when you captured
the lab complex and found
what is it called
the time displacement equipment
that right the terminator
had already gone through
connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place
well how are you supposed to get back
i cant
nobody goes home
nobody else comes through
it just him and me
it just him and me
why didnt you
bring any weapons
something more advanced
dont you have ray guns
ray guns
show me a piece of future technology
you go naked
something about the field
generated by a living organism
nothing dead will go
why
i didnt build the fucking thing
ok ok but this cyborg
if it metal
surrounded by living tissue
oh right
this is great stuff
i could make a career out of this guy
see how clever it is
it doesnt require a shred of proof
most paranoid delusions are intricate
but this is brilliant
why were the
other two women killed
most records
were lost in the war
skynet knew almost nothing
about connor mother
her full name where she lived
they just knew the city
the terminator was
just being systematic
let go back
look you have heard enough
i have answered your questions
now i have to see sarah connor
im afraid that not up to me
then why am i talking to you
who is in authority here
please
shut up
you still dont get it do you
hell find her that what he does
that all he does
you cant stop him
hell reach down her throat
and pull her fucking heart out
doc
let go of me
sorry
so reese is crazy
in technical terminology he a loon
sarah this is what they call
body armor our tac guys wear these
itll stop a 2-gauge round
this other individual mustve
been wearing one under his coat
feel that go ahead
he punched through the windshield
he was probably on pcp
broke every bone in his hand
he wouldnt feel it for hours
there was this guy once
you see this scar
here
thank you
there a couch in this other room
stretch out and get some sleep
be at least an hour before your
mother gets here from big bear
i cant sleep
try
it may not look it
but that couch is very comfortable
youll be perfectly safe
we got 30 cops in this building
thank you
good night
good night
im a friend of sarah connor
i was told she here could i see her
no cant see her

to give to you made me memorize it
thank you sarah
for your courage through the dark years
i cant help you
with what you must soon face

what most difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to
but i guess i have a while before youre
old enough to understand these tapes
theyre more for me at this point
just so that i can get it straight
fill her up
should i tell you
about your father
boy that a tough one
will it affect your decision to send him
here knowing that he is your father
if you dont send kyle
you can never be
god a person could go crazy
thinking about this
i suppose i will tell you
i owe him that
maybe itll help if
you know that in the few hours
that we had together
we loved a lifetime worth
what did he just say
he says youre very beautiful
he is ashamed to ask you for
five american dollars for this picture
but if he doesnt
his father will beat him
pretty good hustle kid
what did he just say
he said there a storm coming in
i know
