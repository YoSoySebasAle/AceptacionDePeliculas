
how that going
mother bawling and the
uncle is pissed off
she not married
divorced with 4 kids
i guess the father
was helping out
helping out
hey mr burke theyre in the
back talking to the bishop
and father
we put him in the break room
any press
some guy from the citizen
but we sent him away
none of the big papers
let keep it that way
who that
assistant da
it gonna be hard to keep
the papers from arraignment
what arraignment
you can tell father geoghan
it wont be much longer
now sheila you know
what a good work
the church does in
the community
but i give you my
personal guarantee
that im going to take
father out of the parish
and this will never happen again
well just be another moment paul
of course father
now sheila im going to
give you my personal card
losing a good reporter
is always tough
but losing one of our best
well to put it this
eloquently as i can
it a real kick in the ass
but robby here has
known stewart
longer than most
of you been alive
so ill handed off to him robby
oh well thanks ben i think
although i take issue
with your reference
to my seniority
i will say that stewart
departure is specially
painful for me because
for what
stewart 20 years now
stewart been more
than willing
to part with his money
at a poker table
and ive got a kid in college
yeah but im gonna keep playing
oh problem solved
god speed then
now stewart i find the
timing of your departure
disconcerted
a corner office
sits empty
the new editor arrives on monday
so im sorry buddy but
i got to ask you
what the hell do you know
how the cake
it really good
you saving yours
no that for mike
i cant ever eat at those things
they are kinda depressing
i know
did you see the numbers
from washington
yeah very interesting
im not asking if the pd is
lying i know theyre lying
all im asking who behind it
ok i get it you
dont wanna talk
no dan im not mad im hungry
ive been talking to you so
long i didnt eat lunch
so im gonna get
something to eat
and ill give you an
hour to decide
whether you want to be on
the right side of this
or read about it
like everybody else
bye dan
you think cahill has something
maybe i just dont think
the story is for us
ben likes it
yeah it not bad it
just not spotlight
what just not spotlight
pd numbers
the numbers story feels thin
oh you got cahill to talk
no but i will
good then know if it thin
how did it go upstairs
ok robby gave a good speech
sure he did
i heard lubin and connor
are going to the times
cmon really
yeah i heard that
they are leaching us
well at least they are sending us
a guy from miami to run things
that should help
has baron even spent
time in boston
he never been here before
maybe we should buy him a map
i have a friend down in miami
said he cut 5% of the stuff
great
hey robby
new boss coming in
to make some cuts
i have no idea
arent you sitting down with him
yes i am
so is it about spotlight
i dont know mike
but i do know
that ben needs an answer on
that crime number story
im telling you i really dont
think that story is for us
mr baron
walter robinson
robby
thanks for taking
a time of your
oh it my pleasure
appreciate it
oh yeah
great book
globe has a season
tickets at fenway
once you settle in by the way
thank you
to be honest im not
much of baseball fan
im just trying to get
the feel for the city
oh yeah
so youre originally from boston
i am born and raised yeah
a lot of the newsroom
is from here
really feels like ah
like a local paper in that way
and did that changed at all
after the paper were
sold to the times
no i dont think that big impact
good
and youre an editor
for the spotlight team
i prefer to think of myself
as a player-coach but yes
are you familiar
with the spotlight
no not particularly
well we are a 4 person
investigative team
we report to ben
bradlee jr and
we keep our work confidential
what are you working on now
we just put out a
piece on a shoddy
contraction outfit
and right now
were really just trolling
around for our next story
how long does that typically take
hard to say a couple months
couple months
yeah we dont like to rush it
once we settle on the project
we can spend a year or
more investigating
is that a concern
not necessarily
but but from what i
understand readership is down
the internet is cutting into
the classified business
and i think im gonna need to
take a hard look at things
so you anticipate more cuts
i think it safe to
assume so but
what im more focused
on right now is
finding the way to
make this paper
essential to its readers
i like to think it already is
fair enough i just think
that we can do better
mr bradlee
hey
saw the pd numbers
looks interesting
yeah there something there
how long do you need
another week
where are you going
since when
technically i am an editor
technically
your sit down with
baron go that well
i couldnt get a read on him
that a first
how about you
oh he a barrel of laughs
morning everyone
lets get started
do you want to say
something marty
sure
hello
as most of you know by now
my name is marty baron
im delighted to be here
if you could tell me your
name as we go around
thatd be helpful thank you
ok peter
peter canellos metro
weve got a major
big dig closure
hey steve
mike
hey
crappy game last night
they cant hit worth a nickel
listen what what eileen
mcnamara doing in 030
you need something mike
no just curious
go be curious somewhere
else i got work to do
ok steve see you
yeah
and it looks like pedro is going
to be out till september st
jimmy says he could
be back this year
but the doctor
didnt seem so sure
when the pats opener
is that everyone
yes that it
ok good thank you
did everyone read eileen
mcnamara column this weekend
that the geoghan case
yeah what the folo on that
it a column what kind of
follow would you thinking
well apparently this
priest molested kids
in 6 different parishes
over the last 30 years
and the attorney for
the victims mr
garabedian
thanks eileen mr garabedian
says cardinal law
found about it 5 years
ago and did nothing
yeah i think that attorney
is a bit of crank
and the church
dismissed the claim
he said she said
whether mr garabedian
is a crank or not
he says he has documents to
prove that cardinal knew
and as i understand that those
documents are under a seal
ok but the fact remains
that boston priest
abused 80 kids we
have a lawyer
who says he can prove
law knew about it
and we written all of
2 stories in the last 6 months
this strikes me as an
essential story
to a local paper i think
that at very least
we have to go through
those documents
how would you like to do that
well i dont know what
the laws are here
but in florida we
would go to court
you want to sue the church
technically we wouldnt
sue the church
wed file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents
the church would read
that as us suing them
so will everybody else
good to know
gutsy call for a first day
that one word for it
how do you think that
gonna play down front
i think gilman
gonna shit a brick
hey
door
how did it go
well baron wants to sue for
the sealed docs in
the geoghan case
wants to sue the church
hey that great
we covered geoghan when the
story broke 3 years ago
baron was still in miami
i think he was at the
times then actually
he wasnt here
so do you think that
sue has a chance
depend on the judge
and what parish he belongs to
bradlee yeah ok
baron wants to talk to us
us
ok jim thank you
yes ok thanks
ive set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsellor
jon albano
yeah
who the judge in this case
constance sweeney
tough
why is that
good catholic girl
so
judging from what ive
read it doesnt seem
like weve done the very thorough
investigation in the geoghan case
is that right
no it not
we looked hard at geoghan
david armstrong from metro
and michael poison for religion
ok but just so
that i understand
beyond our daily coverage
we havent committed any long
term investigative resources
to the question whether or not
cardinal law knew about this
no we havent
and that the kind of
thing your team would do
spotlight well yeah but
were still prospecting
the boston pd story
i told you about
could you set that aside
we could
marty in past spotlight
had success in large part
because they picked
their own projects
would you consider
picking this one
i dont know if he
writing about you but
i will let him know
you called ok bye
hey
hey how did it go
ok baron wants us to
scrub the geoghan case
that great
didnt we cover geoghan
there a lawyer alleging
cardinal law knew about it
mitch garabedian right
yeah i covered him
at the court house
can you get to him
i only interviewed him once
he kind of a character
i like characters ill take him
good you take him
also we should be talking to
the lawyer who repped
the victims
in the porter case eric macleish
that guy who is always on tv
the porter case remind me
yeah father porter similar story
molested dozens of kids in fall
river about 0 years ago
so were dropping the boston pd
i vote yes
no we should set that
aside for now listen
i dont need to tell
you guys this
we need to be more
discreet than usual
alright
everybody gonna be interested
in this not just herald
we cant let cardinal
law getting wind
of this until we
know what we have
good luck with that
when are you leaving nana
the bus is picking us up at
church parking lot at 9 oclock
we got 40 going
and is father dominic going
no he says he unlucky
but luck has nothing
to do with it
you know last time nana won $60
wow
you gonna tell her
we dont even know if
there a story yet
well globe sues church
it gonna be a story
hey lisa could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me
yeah
this is for spotlight
just drop em off when
theyre ready thanks
excuse me do you know where
the publishers office is
will do
how are you marty settling in
yeah i think so
good what can i do for you
id like to challenge
the protective
order in the geoghan case
you want to sue the
catholic church
were just filing the
motion but yes
you think it that important
yes i do
because
obviously the church will
fight us very hard on this
which wont go unnoticed
by our subscriber base
53% of them are catholic
i think theyll be interested
ok
marty lake street will
probably contact you
about face to face with
cardinal it customary
yeah they already have
it set up for next week
i wouldnt mention this
hello
hello
can i help you
hi im mike rezendes
from boston globe
im here to see
mitchell garabedian
he on the call
please have a sit
ok
alright im listening go ahead
ok
bill where the hell
are those papers
i asked you to put
them on my desk
the famous walter robinson
in my conference room
good to see you again eric
sacha pfeiffer eric macleish
nice to meet you
nice to meet you
you dont play golf do you
no
good your colleague here
took some money of me
at the charity event last year
it was a very lucky putt i
actually had my eyes
closed by the way
so how can i help you guys
you are familiar with
the geoghan case
sure 80 plaintiffs
all of them individual cases
garabedian must be swimming
yeah any allegation
against cardinal law
yeah it tricky
this is what you
need to understand
these are shitty cases
statute of limitation is only
3 years and most of these
victims dont come forward
till long after that
why is that
well theyre kids you
know guilt shame
and most of these kids come
from tough neighbourhood
nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing so
youre screwed on the
time moment and
even if you argue
your way around that
the charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand
20 grand for molesting a child
that is the way the
system is set up yes
the church is tough so
your best shot is to try
this cases in the press
like i did on porter
but you know most of the
victims they dont wanna
have anything do to with tv
and mitch isnt exactly
a people person
yeah if garabedian
cant get these
victims just go
before the press
that is really
that right and he has a
long road ahead of him
my guess is he doesnt
have anything on law
what do you think he bluffing
i think he grandstanding
to cut a better deal
seems a bit reckless
have you met mitch garabedian
i asked you to write
me that motion bill
i didnt ask you to file it
hey bill
hi
who are you
im mike rezendes
from boston globe
i had an appointment with
you about an hour ago
i cant talk to you
im busy sharon
she went for coffee she
said shell be right back
im following up on an article
the one in the phoenix
no in the globe
did you see the one
in the phoenix
no i didnt
i thought it was very good i
have a copy here somewhere
it alright ill track it down
im actually following
up on a column
that eileen mcnamara
wrote about your suit
suits 84 of them
it not a class action you
should get your facts straight
no youre right i should
so im trying to get some
background information
you are not recording
this are you
no i wouldnt do
that without asking
i cant show you the
church documents
if that what youre
after theyre under seal
yeah i know that
did you know that they
try to bring me up
before the massachusetts board
of bar overseers 3 times
they are watching me very closely
the church
yeah the church yeah
theyd like to get me disbarred
in fact put that away
put it away
sure
i dont want you recording this
in any way shape or form
not on paper not
on tape nothing
ok
in fact i probably shouldnt
even be speaking to you
look mr garabedian
i know there
things you cannot tell me but
i also know there a story here
and i think it an
important story
i already talked to the phoenix
yeah there a reason
i didnt see it
nobody reads a phoenix any more
theyre broke they
dont have any power
the globe does
if we cover the story
everybody will hear about it
the church thinks in
centuries mr rezendes
do you think your paper has
resources to take that on
yeah i do
but if you dont mind
me asking do you
i cant talk to you right now mr
rezendes im very very busy
sharon
thank you
yeah yeah
can i at least talk to
some of the clients
victims id really
like to do that
call me tomorrow i got
to think about it
thank you
yeah yeah
a familiar pattern
porter faces mass court
as 87 abuse claim arises
i got more clips from the library
leave em right there
are you guys doing a
story on the church
no we are not doing a
story on the church
matt you find anything
on this guy phil saviano
no who is he
he part of a victims
organisation
kurkjian did a story on him
right after the porter case
there a victims organisation
yeah it called snap
it survivors network of
those abused by priest
crummy acronym
want me to track him down
yeah bring him in
how much longer do you need
to get through the clips
i mean a few days there a lot
lisa is still sending it more
ok
hey guys i think i
got another priest
liam barrett molested
some kids in philly
and was moved to boston did the
same thing and was moved again
really that sounds like geoghan
is that one of our clips
yeah byline diego ribadeneira
997 mustve been back
when he was working religion
was there any follow
not much only show one piece
the church settled the case
dont you know jim sullivan
yeah why
looks like the church
brought him in to help out
jesus has anybody
but manny gotten
the ball out of the infield
why do you even bother
with that thing
it distracts me from the game
you know what else
is good for that
oh yeah good idea buy a
round ill be right back
anybody want any food
a hotdog
so you guys making any progress
absolutely it a good story
why because youre another lapsed
catholic pissed off at the church
we got a lot of good stuff
like what
im just watching
the game omerta
they got another
priest liam barrett
we reported it
im just saying we did
ok but this guy was
shuffled a lot
from parish to parish
every few years
just like geoghan and porter
i think there a pattern
sounds thin what else you got
sacha got another guy from a
victims organisation
phil saviano
from snap o boy we
reported on him too
i thought you were
watching a game steve
that guy pretty banged up mike
we did a couple stories on him
guy would not stop
writing letters
he wants a holy war
so he not worth talking to
where are you on garabedian
im working on it
robby say macleish
thinks he bluffing
i think there
something there ben
get me something solid or
im taking you off him
i dont want us chasing
our tails on this
stay away from that trap
you couldnt reach that trap
in a million years partner
i could reach that trap before
yeah now paul maybe
how we doing
good
were two up in the front
how that new editor working out
well he doesnt like baseball
but he seems like a smart guy
yeah i read an article
about him said he a
first jewish editor of the globe
must have been a slow news day
he got a family this guy
no he is not married
divorced
i dont think so no
so the new editor of the
globe is not married man
of the jewish faith
who hates baseball
yeah
they should have given it to ben
he a bradlee for
crying out loud
didnt raise his hand
fast enough i guess
hey by the way ive been
reading about this priest
father barrett said you
were involved with that
barrett yeah bad egg
lake street asked for
help i pitched in
victims said cardinal
law knew about
barrett when he came to
philly is that true
you know i cant talk
about the case robby
off the record
off the record i
cant talk about it
this related to a lawsuit
you know about that
look
i dont know this guy baron
or what his agenda is
frankly i dont care
i just dont wanna see you
taking a bullet for him
i think youre wise
right over here
lets go lets go
so the other day i was
on the world wide web
anything you wanna know
it right there
now i have to admit
that as a priest
this makes me a little nervous
should i be worried
about job security
i dont think so
you see knowledge is one thing
but faith faith is another
hey
hey
so should we golfing or something
golfing is not a verb
and i couldnt get a tee time
is that what they
call it tee time
they also call it a
leisure activity
you oughta try it mike
i do i run
yeah you run to work
so why are you here today
going over this clips of saviano
yeah ben and steve
thinks it a dead end
they gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game
yeah ben emailed me
he did
yeah he said we should let it go
what do you wanna do
we bring saviano in
so just ignore those guys
i think we got to start
ignoring everybody on this one
im good at that
you think marty has any idea
what coming down the pike
no i dont think he cares either
that refreshing
yeah
unless he wrong
i have always been fascinated
with the newspaper business
i used to sit in on
the lectures with
the nieman fellows
when i was at harvard
i read that you were
an editor once
yes that was a
very long time ago
the mississippi register small
diocese in newspaper
but for 30 year old pastor
it was a big responsibility
too much at times
how so
i was close with the
evers brothers
we took a stand on civil rights
our readership was not pleased
they saw me as meddling outsider
i can imagine
tough sit to sit in
especially in a small town
i think youll find
that boston
still a small town too marty
in any ways
but if i can be of any help
marty dont hesitate to ask
i find that the city flourishes
when its grand institution
works together
thank you personally
im of the opinion
that for the paper to
best perform its function
it really needs to stand alone
of course but my
offer still stands
thank you
come in
thank you maureen
little gift marty
think of it as a cardinal
guide to the city of boston
catholic churchcatechism
im here to see sacha pfeiffer
your name
phil saviano
ok just a minute
so am i first
survivor you talk to
yeah sure you are
ok well
first of all let me say thank
you for having me in today
and i want you to know
that youll have
the full cooperation of
my organisation snap
how many members are in
your organisation phil
we had eleven at our
last chapter meeting
no ten karen just moved
you had a woman in your group
of course there was a woman
they dont discriminate not
when it comes to abuse
and this has nothing
to do with being gay
what this is is priest using
the collar to rape kids
kids boys and girls
phil saviano age
i was
and i was preyed upon
by father david holly
in worcester
and i dont mean prayed
for i mean preyed upon
are any of you catholic
i was raised catholic
now i go to my wife
presbyterian church
im lapsed i go to church
of my grandmother sometimes
it safe to say we were all
raised catholic but now
not so much
ok well let me tell you
when you are poor kid
from a poor family
religion counts for a lot
and when a priest pays attention
to you it a big deal
he asks you to collect the hymnals
or take out a trash
you feel special
it like god asking for help
maybe it a little weird when
he tells you a dirty joke
but now you got a secret together
so you go along
then he shows you a porno mag
and then you go along
and you go along
and you go along
until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blowjob
and so you go along with that too
because you feel trapped
because he has groomed you
how do you say no to god right
see
it is important to understand
that this is not
just physical abuse it
spiritual abuse too
then when a priest
does this to you
he robs you of your faith
so you reach for the
bottle or the needle
or if those dont work
you jump of a bridge
that why we call
ourselves survivors
have you read jason berry book
he wrote about a gauthe
case in louisiana
that g
g-a-u-t-h-e
i talked to richard sipe
he worked in one of
the church treatment centre
he is an ex-priest married a nun
yeah this is his testimony
from the cass case
phil what a treatment centre
it where they send priests
when they get caught
this is all right here in the box
i sent this all to you
guys 5 years ago
to the globe who
did you send it to
i dont wanna say who
but they said that they
werent interested
but phil we did run
a couple stories
on you i saw them in the clips
yeah but to be completely
frank it wasnt enough
you guys gotta understand
this is big
this is not just boston this is a
whole country it a whole world
and it goes right
up to the vatican
do you have any proof
of that phil
no not yet
but think about it there
are so many of them
how else could they have
hidden it for so long
so many what
priests
priests i know 3
right here in boston
you know 3 priest in boston
who have molested children
yeah why do you keep
repeating everything i say
i just like to clarify things
maybe you shouldve
clarified it 5 years ago
when i sent you all of this stuff
it all right here
may i use your bathroom
yeah sure phil
come on
well what do you think
the guy got an agenda
that for sure
you think
he obviously been through a
lot but he smart and
if he right about
thirteen priests
yeah and might be a
big if with this guy
do a background check on him
and follow up some of the other
survivors of this group
ill track down this
ex-priest sipe
ok but stay on garabedian
that more important
garabedian what a
pain in the ass
you can be a pain
in the ass mike
mitchell what a
surprise how are you
im fine mr rezendes
good you know ive never
heard back from you
i left you a couple of messages
i know ive been very busy

i just had a kid he only
but im not sure i want
him to know about this
sure i get that
you can stop this interview
at any time patrick
alright
ok
alright
you go ahead with your notes
ok so
where did you live when
it first happened
in the projects
over in hyde park
over by the stop & shop
yeah you know it
yeah i drove a cab
for a few years
opens early bad coffee right
yeah i guess
how old were you
when it happened
i was 2
just after my dad killed himself
oh geez
he was a real piece of shit
and my mum she wasnt
so stable either
how do you mean
i mean she was nuts
she was schizophrenic
same shit
when did you first meet geoghan
well my sister she saw him
over at the dunking donuts
tells him about my old man passing
and he rushed right over
and there was this nun sister
barbara and she ran this group
for kids from troubled families
where is that
st ambrose in dorchester
ok
she the one who introduced
me to father shanley
he was a street priest
long hair very hip
he invited me to his
apartment in back bay
where in back bay
beacon street
beacon ok
are you from here
no i grew up in ohio but
my mum is from southie
so you get it ive never
even seen back bay
so what happened on
that first visit joe
well it was very nice at first
very funny very casual
and i think he could
tell i was gay
so he showed me
this mobile he had
like over a baby crib
but with different words
homosexual transexual
bisexual
ok and did you know that you
were gay at that time joe
yes but that wasnt information
im sharing with anybody
not in dorchester
ok
so what happened after
he showed you the mobile
well i was a little freaked out
i think he could tell
so he said you know
what will help
is if we play strip poker
of course i lost
and things went on from there
can you tell me
specifically what happened
specifically he molested me
joe i think that the language is
going to be so important here
we cant sanitise this just
saying molest isnt enough
people need to know
what actually happened
we should probably
get these to go
right
geoghan shows up and my
mum you know she
she thrilled and
this was like god
showing up you know
sure right
so what happened then
you really wanna hear this shit
yeah yeah patrick i do
he offers to take me
to get ice cream
he a priest im a kid so i go
sure
so were driving home and he
he starts patting my leg
you know then
his hand just slides
right up and
he grabs my dick alright
i just froze up i was
fucking petrified
i couldnt move
i didnt know what to do
i was just a little kid
yeah
you know i never even
touched my ice cream
just melted down my arm
did you
did you see him again after that
yeah
alright that good
let stop there for now
sure
he said he was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body
so what happened after that
he took off his clothes and he
said ive been so depressed
but maybe you can cheer
me up and give a blowjob
classic guy
and did you
yeah
i know what you must
be thinking like
why would i ever do that
with some creepy guy who 30
years older than me but
but you have to understand this
was the first time in my life
that someone told me that
it was okay to be gay
and it was a priest
so you had oral sex
did you have intercourse
yes not then but later
it really messed me up
im sober now but that that
was the beginning of it all
it very confusing you know
to be introduced to sex
like that and then
and then to be attracted to men
im sorry i knew i was gonna
do this oh im sorry
dont be sorry it
ok joe it ok
of course there is a
church right there
and a playground
joe did you ever try
and tell anyone
like who a priest
can i use your phone
yeah sure you know where it is
you can use my name if you want
thanks patrick
dont thank me just get
this assholes will ya
he one of the lucky ones
he is still alive
do you want a cup of tea sacha
im ok nana thanks
hello
hi joe it sacha pfeiffer
hi sacha how are you
im good thanks
listen joe i just want a
follow up on one thing
you talked to phil saviano
about all of this right
yeah i did i went to a
couple of snap meetings
and did phil ever suggest you
to do anything about it
no the meetings werent
really about that
i mean a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer but
i didnt think it was worth it
why not
there were just so
many forms to fill
out it was
overwhelming you know
and he said he could only get
me a small settlement so
who said that
the lawyer told me that
so you did go and see a lawyer
yeah but i didnt end
up using him so
i didnt think it was
important im sorry
im not trying to hide anything
no i know joe
do you remember his
name the lawyer
no but maybe phil would know
the guy was on tv a lot
during the porter case
he was handsome
was it eric macleish
yeah that him macleish
i thought he was very handsome
hey
hey
i was just in a newsroom
judge sweeney set a
date for the hearing
really when
in two weeks in springfield
canellos started a pool
of 0 bucks to get in
anyone picking the globe
he only taking best if how
fast sweeney rules against us
robby
hi it me
did you got my message
i did
looks like father shanley
could be our fourth priest
yeah i think he is
did you follow up on macleish
i just talked with phil
he said macleish
dealt with a number of this cases
i guess he forgot to mention that
yeah
im gonna go to the courthouse
tomorrow see if i can
find any cases he settled
against the church
alright call me after you do
good night
ok good night
hey
you wanted to chat
yeah im late for dinner
you wanna walk me out
sure
jesus does this guy ever go home
apparently not
i got guys who wont
leave until he does
he wearing out the
goddamn newsroom
where are we on geoghan
following up with more victims
hey i want to expend
the investigation
why
we got fourth priest it
might be as many as 3
yeah
who your source
phil saviano
oh jesus christ
robby i told mike
i know i know
i know i think saviano
might be legit ben
you want to elaborate on that
no not really
it just feels like this thing
is stacking up he my guy
ok
ok good thank you
hello
mr rezendes
yeah who is this
it richard sipe
oh yeah hey
richard how are you
im good
thanks for calling
look phil saviano
gave me your name
i was wondering if i could
ask you a few questions
of course yeah
great
so phil told me that you
were working at one of
the church treatment
centres in baltimore
yes the seton
psychiatric institute
it was run by the
daughters of charity
and
when was that richard
well i started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 965
and i was there for 5 years
then i spend the next 30
studying abusive priests
and their victims
really
and that been your sole focus
look mike the church wants
us to believe that
it just a few bad apples
it much bigger
problem than that
how much bigger richard
well based on the research
i would classify it as a
recognisable psychiatric
phenomenon
that big
hey mac
hey
if i wanted historical
data on a priest
parishes hed been assigned
to where would i find it
the geoghan case
it all in clips
lisa has the source material
yeah what if it was
for another priest
the one that hadnt
been in the papers
looking at another priest
whore you looking at
any ideas
come on matt youre
not gonna tell me
i gotta get to a
meeting thanks mac
hey steve
the archdioceses puts out
the annual directory
every priest in parish
that great this go back
any further than 98
oh yeah they go back
to the 80 in the mez
beyond that you
gotta go to the bpl
in the mez thanks lisa
bye
he said they all target
the same kinda kid
low income families
absentee fathers
broken homes
for guy like geoghan goes after
boys not because
he prefers them
but because they are more
ashamed less likely to talk
and these guys are
predators robby
i talked to sipe
sipe says he saw dozens of
them in the 60 at seton
why didnt he go public
he did
but the church made a huge
effort to discredit him
smear campaigns public
statements by prominent bishops
it just like saviano
said and garabedian
you get anywhere with him
more victims
more victims
you cant empty his pockets
ill get him i just
need more time
come on mike you gotta get him
ill get him ill get him
jesus what the
hell is that smell
there a dead rat in the corner
what have you got
church directories
it every priest
in massachusetts
what parish they were assigned to
is it official
yeah i figure it would
help us track down some
of the priests that
saviano mentioned
maybe find some more victims
can we turn on some
more light in here
i couldnt find the switch do
you want to borrow my glasses
no im good im good
look look 983
john geoghan st brendan
parish dorchester
so so we can find out
where any priest is
at any given year
yeah i got him here
what
980 the year geoghan
was pulled from jp
it says he on sick leave
come on it really says that
where is 99
yeah here
let see this
barrett barrett
liam i cant read
this look for liam barrett there
99 the year they pulled
him out of charlestown
barrett liam
yeah
sick leave
that an official designation
get this upstairs
and matt check
the priests saviano
gave us robby
im at the court house
yeah
something not right here
nothing on shanley either sacha
ok thanks
yeah we need to go
talk to macleish again
really why
there nothing here
there arent any records
thanks for waiting so sorry
guys stuck in a call
not a problem how are you
good
thanks for meeting us
you bet what up guys
mr macleish are you familiar with
the priest named paul shinley
yes i am familiar with him
and have you settled cases
against father shinley
as im sure you can
understand i cant
discuss that with you
yeah how about
father ronald paquin
well i cant discuss that with
you either come on guys
we understand youve
settled several
cases against each of them
even if id been
involved in those cases
the settlements would
be confidential
and i can be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence
ok
look i told you guys
these are tough cases
most of these folks they just
want some acknowledgement
of what happened
we got them a sit-down
with the bishop and
a little dough and that
the best they can hope for
well certainly the best
the priest could hope for
no the church promises to take
the priest out of circulation
and did you follow up on that
you guys need anything else
yes
why arent there any records
i was down at the
court house earlier
there arent any records of
any of these settlements
we dealt directly with the church
wed draw up a demand letter and
wed send it to the chancery
you never filed anything in court
it a private mediation
so
this is just you and the
archdiocese lawyers
in a room
correct
anyone else
occasionally the
church would bring in
another defence
attorney to help out
you know names
no
no i dont
so this was all under the table
there no paper trail at all
the victim has to sign
the confidentiality
agreement to get the settlement
the lawyer takes his third and
the church sweeps
it under the rug
jesus that freaking racket
it more complicated than that
macleish has got the
duty to client
to get the best deal he can
sure but how many victims
do you represent and profit
from before you say something
garabedian would say none
and that why he taking
these cases to court
because he wants people
to know about this
i agree
and legal ethics
aside ben i mean
operating the way macleish has
all the guarantee is that
abuse stays under wraps
yeah did macleish confirm
all saviano priests
no he is
limited by his
confidentiality agreement
but clearly he settles cases
against a number of them
phil put me in touch with
some of the other victims
im pretty confident all of his
priests are going to check out
so there 3 priests
yeah
looks that way
holy shit
ok keep going
catholic charities gala guest list
im sorry what was
the name again
baron
b-a-l-u-n b-a-r-o-n
im having trouble finding
it just give me a second
it ok kim i can vouch for him
im pete conley im on the
board of catholic charities
welcome to boston mr baron
thank you
appreciate you joining us
were very proud of the
work we do here at boston
oh the cardinal said
you had a nice visit
yes we did
he an extraordinary man
im glad you had a chance to chat
enjoying yourself
to be honest these events
arent really my strong suit
yeah
are you involved with the charity
not directly no
some of my friends
are we all went to
high school bc high that a
school across the
street from the globe
it hard to miss
yeah
hard to get away from
too apparently
the cardinal is in the corner
if youre so inclined
weve met
really
did he mentioned the suit
no but he did give me
a copy of cathecism
yeah well the cardinal is
not known for his subtlety
during the porter investigation
hed literally
call down the power
of god on the globe
how that got out
a week later our editor
broke his leg skiing
shrimp toast gentlemen
no thanks thanks
you said there was
a victim who filed
a criminal complaint
yeah there were a few of them
but the judge had the
case reconciled
after friends of the
church complained
and the church has
a lot of friends
like eric macleish
yeah let just say
he is not part of the solution
you follow what im saying
sure
you work hard mr rezendes
are you married
yeah
and your wife doesnt mind
you working all the time
yeah she does
that why i never got married
to busy
what i do is to important
your new editor he a jew right
that right yeah
well see
he comes in
and suddenly everybody is
interested in the church
you know why
no
because it takes the outsider
like me im armenian
how many armenians do
you know in boston
steve kurkjian
works at the globe
that two you should get
a prize or something
what are you italian
no im portuguese
from where
east boston
really east boston
you dont sound like it
this city
this people
making the rest of us feel
like we dont belong
but theyre no better than us
look at how they treat
their children
mark my words mr rezendes
if it takes a village
to raise a child
it takes a village to abuse one
hey there he is
hey
you want a beer
love one
another you with barbara
no no
she hates this things
karen too
yeah
smart ladies
i met your new editor
seems like a decent fella
i think he is
hey i had an interesting
conversation
with eric macleish yesterday
turns out he been
settling abuse cases
with the archdioceses for years
you want to talk about this here
jim you said you helped out
on father barrett as a favour
that was a one-off
how many of these cases
youve been involved with
you know i cant answer
that robby it unethical
is that all it is
so this
would be the robby
robinson ive always
heard about but never met
listen jimmy
you want to be on the
right side of this
this is the church youre
talking about robby
look around these
are good people
done a lot of good for this city
enjoy the party
ive been through a lot these now
sick leave isnt the
only designation
they use when they take one
of these priests out
of the circulation
they use slew of terms
absent on leave
unassigned
emergency response
they work for
everything these guys
except rape
and they move parishes
way more frequently
than other priests
when i was a kid priest moved
after seven or eight years
sometimes longer
these guys it 2
to 3 years tops
and did they use
this designations
for all saviano priests
yeah
it pretty clear pattern
guys i got sipe
i think that if you really want
to understand the crisis
you need to start with the
celibacy requirement
that was my first major finding
only 50% of the
clergy are celibate
now most of them are having
sex with other adults
but the fact remains
that this creates
a culture of secrecy that
tolerates and even protects
paedophiles
so you believe the
church is aware
of the extent of this crisis
well absolutely
after the first major
scandal in louisiana
tom doyle the secretary
canonist for papal nuncio
co-authored a report
warning paedophile priests
were billion-dollar liability
that was in 985
that right
who saw that report anyone
from the catholic hierarchy
sure
doyle tried to introduce
the report
at the national conference
of catholic bishops
in fact cardinal law initially
helped to fund the report
but then he backed out
and they shelved it
are you kidding me
oh richard
robby here
we think we have 3 priests
in boston that fits
this pattern which
would be a very very big story
does that sound right to you
in terms of scale
no not really robby
sounds low to me
my estimate suggests six percent
act out sexually with minors
six percent of what
six percent of all priests
how many priest do
we have in boston
about fifteen hundred one percent
is fifteen six percent is
ninety
90 priests
is that possible
from a metric standpoint
yes that would be in
line with my findings
hello
90 fucking priests in boston
that what he said
if there were 90 of these
bastards people would know
maybe they do
and no one said a thing
good germans
i dont think that a comparison
you want to make publicly
macleish knew
he just didnt say anything
that 3 priests
there a big difference
between 3 and 90
where this sipe guy
getting his numbers
well he been studying
it for 30 years
he is a trained psychotherapist
ok but we need something more
than a metric from some
some hippy ex-priest who
shacking up with a nun
ok so well track
down more victims
well get more priests then
then we could we could check
them against the directories
that a shitload of victims
well get there
how long is it going to take
too long
wait what the meeting is over
yeah for now
what do you got
what if we work backwards
what do you mean from what
from the directories
weve been using them
to confirm bad priests
what if we do it the
other way around
use the directories to
identify bad priests
yeah exactly
we search by designation
you know we look
for any priest
on a sick leave or unassigned
or for priests who
moved around a lot
yeah
which can take a load of work
well not if were all on it
you too
generally that
what all means yeah
yeah generally
sick leave
unassigned
unassigned
active
library is closing
library is closing

up with you okay
ok
hey guys im really sorry
i am i dont have any
time to talk right now but
mr macleish
if you call my assistant
we have reasons to believe
that there are
allegations against as many
as 87 priests in boston
i cant talk to you about that
does that number
sound right to you
you gotta be kidding
me i just told you
i dont have time for this crap
eric how many priests
did you settle
robby you know i
cant tell you that
youre going to give
me their names
and the names of their victims
are you threatening me
weve got two stories here
we got a story about
degenerate clergy
and we got a story about
a bunch of lawyers
turning child abuse into
a cottage industry
now which story do
you want us to write
cause were writing one of them
i already sent you
a list of names
what are you talking
about to whom
the globe years ago
after the porter case i
got plenty of calls
i had 20 priests
in boston alone
but i couldnt go after
them without the press
so i sent you guys
a list of names and you buried it
i want those names tomorrow
check you goddamn clips robby
we didnt find
anything in the clips
yeah big surprise
richard
do you still go to mass
no i havent been to
church for some time now
but i still consider
myself a catholic
how does that work
well the church is
an institution mike
made of men
it passing my faith
is in the eternal
i try to separate the two
sounds tricky
it is especially
since the church continues
to go after me
it takes the toll mike
theyll try to silence
anyone who speaks out
and im sure theyll come after
you and your team soon enough
really and how do you
think theyll do that
hello richard
who is it
it the archbishop of canterbury

im freaking starving
so where are we with the 90
im close
how close
im close

for everybody
hey ben i forgot to ask you
hey phil saviano said
he sent a bunch of
info over to the globe a years
ago do you have an idea to whom
no why
well im just curious
i wanted to see if there were any
leads you guys didnt run out
saviano was a fucking
train wreck
5 years ago but we
didnt miss anything
this story needs spotlight
yeah i agree im
just following up
good night
yeah good night
this is unbelievable
when did you get this
macleish emailed the
list this morning
he settled cases
against 45 priests
where are we on law
anything that shows the
acknowledge of this
still working garabedian
but nothing concrete
i keep thinking about that
conversation we had
the other night
about how law called
down the power of god
when we reported the porter
that just law being law
ok but i checked the clips
and porter isnt even
in boston archdiocese
he from fall river
so
why the extreme reaction
law had to know that
why he had the reaction
he knew there were others
i think that the bigger story
bigger than 50 priests
if it came from the top down yes
but the numbers
clearly indicate that
there were senior clergy involved
that all they do indicate
are you telling me that
that if we run a story about 50
paedophile priests in boston
mike
well get into the same cat
fight you got into on porter
which made a lot of noise
but changed things not one bit
we need to focus on
the institution
not the individual priests
practise and policy
show me the church
manipulate the system
so this guy wouldnt
have to face charges
show me they put those
same priests
back into parishes
time and time again
show me this was systemic that
it came from the top down
sound like were going after law
were going after the system
make the list of
all the victims
we have start reaching out
and bring matt in
if you need help
ok
hey when do you go to springfield

the bishop came over to house
he said nothing like this

and he asked us not

my mother
she put out freaking cookies

pressure to keep quiet
from the church

but not just the church
from my friends
from the other parishioners
well many of the priest
i treated were
psychosexually stunted
on the emotional level of
the 2 or 3 year old

we spoke to several men who
knew you when they were boys
at st john the
baptist in haverhill
they told us you molested
them is that true

could you please
clarify the globe
position for me mr albano
yes judge sweeney
our argument to make this
documents public rest
mainly on first amendment grounds
we also have a number of
other relevant arguments
after all your honour this
was discretionary audit
yes it was made the
judges discretionary
hey mike
hey joe
what the spotlight reporter
doing in springfield
your boy albano is
sledding uphill
actually thinking he has a
shot of winning this thing
you want me to comment
for the herald
globe reporter would not comment
but he did not seem hopeful
he didnt try to hide it at all
he had this really odd
rationalisation for it
like it was totally normal to
fool around with little boys
id really like to go back
i think hed talk to us
oh we will
just not yet
i want you to stay focused
on the victims right now
sacha where did they
send father talbot again
i think it was cheverus
cheverus that right
wait father talbot from bc high
yeah you know him
yeah he was there when i was
we have a victim
yeah
lives in providence
there nothing personal within
this documents your honour
they concern how the
cardinal is handling
say the archdiocese
excuse me
you dont get to tag the cardinal
with everything mr albano
say the archdiocese
judge sweeney the globe is
not a party to this case
they just want to sell the papers
if mr garabedian hadnt
smeared the cardinal
good name
we wouldnt even be here
your honour
i object to the use
of the word smear
duly noted mr garabedian
thank you your honour
anything else mr rogers
no your honour
sr albano you may continue
the globe believe having
hey mitch how you doing
im fine
he tough that wilson rogers
he smug
he sloppy
doesnt seem sloppy
you dont know the
half of it trust me
what the half of it
tell me the half of it mitch
of the record
of the record yeah
3 years ago i get the
call from an ex-priest
anthony benzevich
he was at blessed
sacrament back in 62
and he saw geoghan
taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom ok
so he was appalled
and the bishop threatens
to reassign him
to south america
jesus
yeah alright so
fast-forward 35 years
benzevich reads that geoghan
has been charged
with molesting hundreds of kids
so he feels guilty
and he calls me
so you have a testimony
of a priest
telling his superiors
about geoghan in 62
no i do not
because when i call benzevich
in to give a deposition
he comes in with the lawyer
wilson rogers
right
and suddenly father benzevich
has a foggy memory
cant remember anything
he useless
so i go back to work i
forget about it whatever
until about a year ago i find
an article about a priest
who warned church
officials about geoghan
benzevich went to the press
yeah
yeah local paper patriot ledger
nobody saw it but now i
got benzevich on record
so i file a motion to depose
benzevich the second time
alright and wilson rogers
that smug son of a bitch
he files a motion
opposing my motion
and that when i have him
have have him how
rogers opposes my motion
so i have to make an argument
as to why am i allowed to
depose father benzevich
the second time ok
but this time im allowed
to attach exhibits
you follow what im saying
the sealed documents
yes i can attach the
sealed documents
that ive gotten in
discovery mr rezendes
the same documents that your
paper is currently suing for
youre shitting me
what no no im
not shitting you
so i pull out the 4
most damning docs
and i attach them to my motion
and they prove
everything everything
about the church about
the bishops about law
and it all public
because your motion
to oppose rogers motion is public
is public yeah exactly now
youre paying attention
and so i could just walk in to
that courthouse right now
and get those documents
no you can not
because the documents
are not there
but you just said theyre public
i know i did but this is boston
and the church does not
want them to be found
so they are not there
mitch are you telling me
that the catholic church
removed legal documents
from that courthouse
look im not crazy
im not paranoid
im experienced
check the docket youll see
they control everything
everything
i got to go back
i got to get the
fucking documents
docket entry number 49
with the geoghan case
ok thanks
were closing in 0 minutes
0 minutes alright
rev james f talbot
robby
hey it me
hey
youre not gonna believe it
garabedian gave me a tip
some of the sealed docs
are already public
theyre part of the
motion he filed
he said theyre the best of a
bunch we dont have to
wait for sweeney ruling
so we can get them
yeah but they are not there
i already talked to albano
he said all we have to do is
file a motion and sweeney will
order mitch to refile the docs
and you think this
documents are
he said this 4 docs
are all we need
they are huge
ok ill call ben good work
what happened
they are saying it a prop plane
but that not a prop plane
tell linda to get every
reporter we have in here now
you pray for the victims
you pray for the injured
and you pray for
those who survived
you pray too for the nation
that our response to this
might reflect the best
ideals of our nation
and even more reflect
god own teaching
not only as it shown in
christianity and judaism
but in islam as well
not bad who there

going back through the clips
and i had a little time
last week finally so
i found that
it from93
lawyer for porter victims says
20 other priests in
area are accused
is that it
yeah yeah that it
good night
ok good night
so i was probably a few
years after you right
no you were more than
a few believe me
after the bc high i came
down to providence
i played hockey for the friars
oh well you mustve
been pretty good
no rode the bench
in college yeah
but i love the city
and we just had our third kid
and i still get my
globe for the record
that good to know good to know
look kevin
it actually why im here
i
need to ask you some questions
about father talbot
howd you find out
well
i guess it doesnt matter
i never even told my wife
excuse me
hey hey i need to get in there
were closed
come on let me in five minutes
im sorry were closed
come on 5 minutes
fuck
here you go
this is the geoghan case
that right
those records are sealed
no that a public motion
those record are public
look i work for the globe
good for you
can i talk to your supervisor
he not in today
what about a judge
there must be judges that
work on this kind of thing
sixth floor
we understand the nature
of the allegations
against father talbot
im just not sure what you
want from president kemeza
talbot taught here long
before bill took over
of course
we just want to know
if that possible
that the president the
faculty the board
that no one knew what was
going on at the time
i graduated in 979 and
i had no idea about
any of this so
if youre suggesting
that father gibbons
and father callahan
had in anyway
gibbons and callahan ran
this place like the navy
you really think they didnt know
it a big school
robby you know that
and were talking about seven
alleged victims over
what eight years
were talking about
seven that we know about
this is ridiculous
youre reaching for
the story here
jack jack jack
if i had been president
then i would have known
bill im not sure
that relevant
why do you think they sent
talbot up to cheverus
you know they wanted
him out of town
robby
as well intentioned this
bill remarks are
im hoping we can keep
this between us
until we all get on the same page
is that why we are here
to get on the same page
no were here because youre
an important alumnus robby
and a friend
exactly and we know
you care about the
school as much as we do
did you play your
sport here jack
yeah football why
i ran track
you know i went to
providence yesterday
talked to one of
father talbot victims
he played hockey here and
he was one of the better ones
he got wife kids
good job
about 0 minutes into
the conversation
guy breaks down
you know couldnt stop crying
said he could never
figure out why
father talbot picked him
father talbot coached
the hockey team
so
i guess we just got lucky
you and me
does jack dunn work
for the school
no he pr for the
boston college
they call him when they need help
and pete conley why was he there
good question
pete a big alum but i
called bill directly
and i asked for a sit-down
i never mentioned anybody else
looks like everybody
already knows the story
yeah except us
and we work right there
judge volterra
yes
hi im mike rezendes
from the boston globe
ive been having some troubles
accessing some public records
down in the records room
i was wondering if i can
have a word with you
alright
thank you
these exhibits youre
after mr rezendes
theyre very sensitive records
with all due respect your honour
that not the question
the records are public
maybe so but tell me
where is the editorial
responsibility
in publishing records
of this nature
well where is the editorial
responsibility
in not publishing them
you cant take those you
need to make copies
im going to the copy room
it been closed at 4 pm
look ill give you
$83 to use yours
hey cab
hey hey hey hey
take me to the boston globe
on morrissey boulevard
dont take 93 take
dorchester avenue
robby it incredible
law knew about geoghan
for years no question
there a letter to law
from a woman margaret gallant
who lived in jamaica plain
in early 80 when
geoghan was there
listen to this
our family is rooted
in the church
our desire is to protect
the holy orders
even in the midst of our agony
over the seven boys
in our family
who have been violated
seven robby seven boys
it was suggested
that we keep silent
we did not question the
authority of the church
two years ago
but since father geoghan
is still in his parish
which she send it to
law and law did shit
here another one
to law same year
listen to this
a word on the recent assignment
to father geoghan
as an associate at saint
julia in weston
father geoghan has a history
of homosexual involvement
with young boys
i understand his recent departure
from saint brendan may be
related to this problem
i wonder if father
geoghan should not be
reduced to just
weekend work while
receiving some kind of therapy
you know how grateful i am to
you for you constant concern
sincerely yours in our lord
most reverend john m darcy
auxiliary bishop of boston
december 7 984
an auxiliary bishop wrote that
that incredible
he broke ranks i mean when
did gallant write her letter
and law just ignored it
how do you ignore
that freaking letter
weve got him
you cant read this letters
and think anything else
it proof
yeah it is
this is good work
should we take it up to ben
no not yet
why not
we got law this is it
no this is law covering
for one priest
there other 90 out there
yeah well print that
story when we get it
but we got to go with this now
no im not gonna rush
this story mike
but we dont have a choice robby
if we dont rush to print somebody
else is gonna find this letters
and butcher the story
john quinby from the herald was
at the freaking courthouse
so well write a holding story
and well keep our
eye on the herald
keep our eye on the herald
yeah
if they run this and
they get it wrong
the church will bury it
we got to do this now
mike mike
what why are we hesitating
baron told us to get
law this is law
baron told us to get the system
we need the full scope
that the only thing that
will put an end on this
then let take it up to
ben and let him decide
well take to ben
when i say it time
it time robby it time
they knew and they
let it happen
to kids ok
it could have been you
it could have been me
it could have been any of us
we gotta nail these scumbags
we gotta show people
that nobody can get
away with this
not a priest or a cardinal
or a freaking pope
you finished
yeah i am
this is bullshit
you ok
hi hansi
hard day at work mike
here
thank you
i dont know why i got
so pissed off you know
i think robby is wrong
you know you just
you care about the
story mike we all do
yeah i guess
i stopped going to
church with my nana
it was it was
to hard you know
id be sitting there and i
i would start thinking
about joe crowley
or someone else and i just
i just got so angry
did you did you tell her why
she goes to church 3
times a week mike
it really pisses me off
yeah
i actually really liked going to
church when i was a little kid
why did you stop
typical shit
but the weird thing is is
i think i
i think i figured that
maybe one day i would
i would actually go back
i really i was
holding on to that
then i read those letters and
and something just
cracked
it a shitty feeling
yeah
it a shitty feeling
looks like a long day
hey pete
im sorry to make it longer
brian
does anyone ever said no
to a drink with you pete
well sure
the trick is to keep asking
for boston
for boston
so youre here
for the cardinal
no no no i wouldnt
i wouldnt presume to speak
for the cardinal you know
you know
you got a lot of people
here respect you robby
yeah
with work you do
that good to know
you know it cause you
care about this place
yeah
it why you do what you
do it who you are
but people need the church
more than ever right now
you know you can feel it
and the cardinal
you know the cardinal
he may not be perfect
but we cant throw out
all the good he doing
over a few bad apples
you know im bringing
this up to you
because i know this is
baron idea his agenda
i gotta tell you honest
to god i mean
he doesnt care about
this city the way we do
i mean how could he
this is how it happens
isnt it pete
what that
guy leans on the guy
and suddenly
the whole town just
looks the other way
robby robby
look it
marty baron is just
trying to make his mark
he gonna be here for
a couple of years
and he gonna move on
just like he did in
new york and miami
where are you gonna go
good night robby brian
hey pete
yeah
when we do run the story
im gonna need a comment
from the cardinal
well talk again later
good night robby
good night pete
robby
what
no shit when
ok yeah
hey
what up
sweeney ruled in our favour
she ruled to unseal the documents
jesus
church has already
filed an appeal
but the trial court of ruling
is generally upheld
in this matters
and when do we get the documents
probably takes cohen a
few weeks to rule
and then there a
redaction process
id say it would be made
public mid january
ok
alright
thanks jon
you bet
nice work
thanks
metro should run something marty
we cant run this one big
why wouldnt we
it a major first
amendment victory
not to mention you got an
irish catholic judge
ruling against the church
that a hell of a precedent
we dont want the herald
going deep on this
why is that
youre gonna have
to step out peter
im not stepping out
peter
when did you
couple of weeks ago
couple of weeks
yeah
and youre telling us now
these are substantial
it clearly shows that
law was negligent
i need more time i
wanna keep digging
for what this is
the goddamn story
it not the whole story
tough shit were on a clock now
even if we dont run
sweeney rulings
another paper could find this
letters and fuck the story
agreed
but we run these letters alone
law apologises says
it one time thing
and he can bury it
how this clearly show he knew
and did nothing about it
look im close to
stories on 70 priests
we nail that along
with those letters
this is proof that this
is bigger than law
this is the whole system
your multiple sources
confirming all those priests
some ill get more
too risky if were
not buttoned up
on every single one of them the
church will pick us apart
i think i can get us someone
from the other side of the isle
somebody inside the church
yeah a lawyer
will he go on the record
deep background but
he a solid source
rezendes needs time
to write the story
we dont want to drop
it on christmass
not after the 9/
we can run it just
after new years
before they release the
rest of the documents
alright
tell canellos to bury
the ruling in metro
you got six weeks
thank you
tell mike i want a
draught by christmass
and we need a response
from lake street
yeah
who does pr for the cardinal
still john walsh
no somebody new donna morrissey
she came from tv she young
good get a quote
we need something
from law to appear even-handed
robby next time give
me a goddamn heads up
will do
robby what a nice surprise
come on in
hey hun look who
i found outside
karen can you give us a minute
sure
good to see you karen
what up
im out of time jim
we got cover-up stories
on 70 priests
but the boss is not
gonna run it
unless i got confirmation
from your side
are you out of your mind
come on this is our town jimmy
everybody knew something
was going on
and no one did a thing
we got to put an end to it
dont tell me what i got to do
yeah i helped defend
this scumbags

matt wants to put the letters
online so that the readers
can see for themselves
we can run the url at the
bottom of the article
it pretty straightforward
ok
we also put the spotlight tip
line at the end of the story
so people can call in
it goes directly to our office
matt and i can go
in the morning
in case we get any calls
im more concerned about
the phones at reception
after we ran the porter case
the message centre were
tied up for weeks
there were picketers
too lots of them
ill talk to richard about
the security and the phones
how are we coming
on the folo story
well weve now done multiple
stories on 70 priests
all 70
and with confirmation
from robby source
we are ready to go
we can have a draught next week
robby that source of yours
is it something we could revisit
it might be tough
but he has no problem helping
the church protect
dozens of dirty priests
guy is a scumbag
he a lawyer he doing his job
he a shill for the church
he knew and he did nothing
he could have said something years
ago maybe save some lives
what about us
what that supposed to mean
we had all the pieces
why didnt we get it sooner
we didnt have all the pieces
we had saviano we had
barrett we had geoghan
we had the directories
in the basement
you know what we got it now
robby this story
needed spotlight
mike spotlight been
around since 970
so what we couldnt see
the scope of this no one could
robby this started with
one goddamn priest
macleish sent us a letter
of 20 priests years ago
sacha found a clip
are you freaking kidding
me 20 priests
when
just after porter
december of 93
we buried the story
in metro no folo
that was you
you were metro
yeah that was me
id just taken over i
dont remember it at all
but yeah
can i say something here
sometimes it easy to forget
that we spend most of our time
stumbling around the dark
suddenly a light gets
turned on and
there a fair share
of blame to go around
i cant speak to what happened
before i arrived but
all of you have done some
very good reporting here
reporting that i believe
is gonna have
an immediate and
considerable impact
on our readers
for me this kind of
story is why we do this
having said that
cardinal law and
the catholic community
are gonna have
a very strong response to this
so if you need a moment
youve earned it
but i will need you back here
monday morning focused
and ready to do your job
leaving
yeah
i just got a call
from the cardinal
really why
he wanted to tell me personally he
had decided not to comment and
he said he wanted to
extend me that courtesy
jesus the balls on that
guy what did you say
i told him he was
making mistake and
that were gonna run the story
damn right were gonna run it
