should be easy killing them if
they dont go on down to texas
how long since you fired a gun
at a man nine ten years
eleven
easy huh
i dont know it was all
that easy even back then
and we was young
and full of beans
if you was mad at them
over some wrong i could
see shooting them
we done stuff for money before
we thought we did
whatd these fellows
do cheat at cards
steal some strays spit
on a rich fellow what
they cut up a woman
what

could you look in on my
youngsters next week
they got some hogs theyre
trying to separate
how long you reckon

that spencer rifle
and i can still knock the eye
out of a bird flying too
jesus will
he must be moving right along
well come across him

kind of got used to my bed
this aint going to
be like no home
that aint the only
thing ill miss
hell im sorry
dont fret it it aint nothing
she dont like it much
you riding off with me
gave me the evil eye
you know sally injun
and injuns aint over-friendly
i dont blame her
i wont hold it against her
she knew me back then
she knew what a
no-good son of a bitch i was
she aint allowing that i changed
she dont realise i aint
like that no more
you know will
i aint the same
claudia straightened
me up cleared
me of drinking whiskey and all
going on this killing
dont mean ill go
back to the way i was
just need the money
get a new start for
them youngsters
remember that drover
i shot in the mouth
and his teeth came out
the back of his head
i think about him now and again
he didnt do anything
to deserve to get shot
at least nothing i remembered
when i sobered up
you was one crazy son of a bitch
no one liked me and
the boys all thought
id shoot them out
of pure meanness
you aint like that no more
eagle he hated my guts
bonaparte didnt think
too much of me
quincy neither i reckon
quincy used to just
watch all the time
scared
like i said
you aint like that no more
that right
im just a fellow now
i aint no different
than anyone else
no more
what son of a bitch shot him
was it one of them john bulls
no sir the would-be assassin is
a gentleman of french ancestry
or so it seems i dont
wish to give offence
but the french are known
to be a race of assassins
who cant shoot worth a damn
any frenchmen present are
excluded of course
says here a fellow by the
name of guiteau g-u-i-t
sure as hell sounds
like a john bull to me
again i dont wish
to give offence
when i suggest this country select
a king or even a queen
rather than a president
one isnt that quick to
shoot a king or a queen
the majesty of royalty you see
maybe you dont wish
to give offence sir
but you are giving
it pretty thick
this country dont need
no queens whatsoever
when i heard about queens
shut up joe
what wrong with you
thirsty this dude
might be that this
dude is english bob
works for the railroad
shooting chinamen
might be he waiting for some
cowboy to touch his pistol
so he can shoot him
is that a fact mister
you english bob
pheasants
let shoot some pheasants
ten shots
at let say $ a pheasant
ill shoot for the queen and you
for whomever
that eight for me
and one for you
that comes to seven
american dollars
pretty damn good shooting
for a john bull
no doubt your aim was
affected by your grief
over the injury to your president
it the climate that does it
that and the infernal distances
does what
induces people to shoot
persons in high places
that the second one
shot in 20 years
it uncivilised shooting
persons of substance
thank you
pardon me gentlemen
the law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the
proper authorities
proper authority
i assure you that
neither my companion
or i carry firearms on our person
we rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man
and the forbearance of reptiles
unarmed my ass
christ it hot
if im going to get shot id
rather it was hot than cold
everything hurts more when it
cold you know how if you hit
shut up fatty
clyde back
with little bill
no
shit
you clean my remington
cleaned and loaded
where little bill
building his damn porch
building his porch
if you got shot would you
want it to be hot or cold
i aint gonna get shot
he coming
of course he coming
i just loaded that
i dont trust nobody loading
my guns before a shooting
whatd he say
little bill said he was
building his porch
you seen that thing
it was all loaded
clyde you got three pistols
and you only got one arm
i dont want to get killed
for lack of shooting back
he dont have a straight
angle on that whole porch
or the whole house
for that matter
he is the worst damn carpenter
he didnt say nothing
asked what they looked like
maybe he tough but
he aint no carpenter
maybe he aint so tough
seem like he was scared
little bill him scared
we never seen him up against
any like these ones
killers
little bill come out of
kansas and texas boys
he worked them tough towns
just wondered
anybody could be scared
he wasnt scared boys
he just aint no carpenter
there a dignity in royalty
which precludes the
likelihood of assassination
if you pointed a pistol
at a monarch your hands
would shake as if palsied
i wouldnt point no
pistol at nobody
that a wise policy
but if you did i assure
you the sight of royalty
would cause you to
dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed you would stand
how shall i put it in awe
a president why not
shoot a president
keep the change
this strawberry alice
person tell me again
down the street to greely beer
garden and billiards parlour
say you want a game of billiards
billiards even though i
dont really wish to play
no matter they burned the
table in 78 for firewood
quite right

hold on
hear that ned
kid can see 50 yards fine
jesus
50 yardsll do just fine
now let move out
they look like real
hard cases bob
did you kill all seven of them
or just wing some of them
that you here bob on the cover
the duck of death
it the duke duke of death
you always were the hell in jesus
with a pistol but seven of them
protecting that woman
how do you do that
it desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain
liberty when depicting
the cover scene
for reasons involving
the marketplace
from what i read
the writing not
that much different
than the picture
i can assure you mr daggett
that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts
eyewitnesses
like the duck himself i guess
the duke
duck i says
you have insulted the honour of
this beautiful woman corcoran
said the duck
you must apologise
but two-gun corcoran
would have none of it
he reached for his pistols
and would have killed him
but the duck was faster and hot
lead blazed from his
smoking six-guns
i consider that an accurate
depiction of events
there is a certain poetry to the
language which i couldnt resist
i was in the blue bottle
saloon in wichita
the night english bob
killed corky corcoran
i didnt see you there
nor no woman
nor two-gun shooters
nor none of this
you were there
yeah i was there
first off
corky never carried two guns
though he should have
he was called two-gun corcoran
a lot of folks did
call him two-gun
but not because he
had two pistols
it was because his dick
was longer than the barrel
on his walker colt
only insulting he did was stick it
into a french lady
bob was sweet on
when corky walked into the blue
bottle and before
he knew what what
bob takes a shot at him and
misses he so damn drunk
that bullet whizzing by panicked
corky he did the wrong thing
he hurried and shot
his damn toe off
meantime bob here
aims real good and
squeezes off another
but he misses he
still so drunk
hits a $000 mirror over the bar
the duck of death is as good as
dead because corky does it right
he aims real careful
no hurry
and
that walker colt
blew up in his hand
a failing common to that model
if corkyd had two guns instead of
a big dick he wouldve been there
to defend himself to the end
wait a minute
english bob killed him
when he didnt even have
bob wasnt going to wait for
corky to grow a new hand
no he just walked
over there real slow
because he was drunk
and shot him through the liver
dont like rocks
on my dadgum back
i sure do miss my bed
you said that last night
last night i said
i missed my wife
tonight i just miss my dadgum bed
youll miss your dadgum
roof next i suppose
shit
that business up in jackson
county that really happen
the way they say it happened
what business
there two deputies up close
pointing their
rifles right at you
got you dead to rights
you pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell
only took a scratch yourself
uncle pete never
seen nothing like it
shooting your way
out of that scrape
i dont recollect
you dont recollect
that right
ned
how many men you killed
aint you gonna answer
what the hell that to you
to know the kind of
fellow im riding
with in case we
get into a scrape
how many men you killed kid
five
how many
five
i done killed five of them
that including a mexican he
come after me with a knife
why dont you shut
up get some rest
you boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens
actually then mr corcoran was
faster on the draw
than the duck
than english bob
faster faster was his mistake
if he hadnt rushed he wouldnt
have shot himself in the toe
he wouldve killed old bob
being a good shot being
quick with a pistol
dont do no harm but it dont
mean much next to
being cool-headed
a man wholl keep his head
not get rattled under fire
like as not hell kill you
but if the other
fellow is quicker
then hell hurry and hell miss
look here
that as fast as i can draw aim
hit anything more
than 0 feet away
unless it a barn
but if he doesnt miss
hell kill you
that why there so few
dangerous men around like bob
like me
it aint so easy to shoot a
man if he shooting back
thatll flat rattle some folks
let me show you something
look here take that
go on take it
there the key
just shoot me
and you and bob can ride on
out of here free as birds
is it loaded
wouldnt do any good if it wasnt
first you got to cock it
go on cock it
now you got to point it
go on point it
now all you got to do
is pull the trigger
hot aint it
didnt even put your
finger on the trigger
what if
what if i gave it to him
give it to him
you dont really want me to
give it to him
i guess he dont want it
you were right not to take it
id have killed you
we could use some rain
you no-good goddamn
pig-fucking whore
sorry old horse
i brung this for when
we kill them fellows
figured we could use some now
not me i dont touch it no more
come on it raining
i know it raining
give some to the kid
you think that kid
really killed five men
no
when he talked about the time
them deputies had the drop on you
i remember there was three
men you shot not two
i aint like that no more ned
i aint no crazy killing fool
still think itll be easy
to kill them cowboys
if we dont drown first
give these keys to the conductor
he can loose bob cuffs as soon
as he outside the county
got my pistols
i guess you know bob
that if i see you again ill
just shoot in self-defence
i didnt steal your biographer
he staying on his own account
he can go stuff himself
as well cant he
