
mary dinkle eyes were the
colour of muddy puddles
her birthmark the colour of poo
it was saturday afternoon
and she was bored
mary wished she had a friend
to play piggybacks with
mary mood ring
which shed found
in a cereal box was grey
which according to the chart
meant she was either pensive
unconsciously ambitious
or hungry
her only friends
were the noblets
from her favourite cartoon
they werent the real ones
you bought in the shops
but fake ones that she had
to make herself
from shells gumnuts pompoms
and the chicken bones salvaged
from friday night takeaway
she had to make
all her own toys
and her favourites
were shrinkies
potato chip packets that
she had shrunk in the oven
mary father
noel norman dinkle
worked in a factory attaching
the strings to tea bags
at show-and-tell
she told the class
he could get as many
free tea bags as he wanted
her favourite tea bag
was earl grey
she loved saying earl grey
and would like one day to marry
someone called earl grey
they would live in a castle
in scotland
have nine babies two ducks
and a dog called kevin
noel hobby was to sit
in his shed
and drink bailey irish cream
and stuff birds hed found
on the side of the freeway
mary wished hed spend
more time with her
and less with his dead friends
she also wished she had
some brothers and sisters
her mother had told her
she was an accident
how could someone be
an accident
grand-poppy ralph had told her
that babies were deliberate
and found by dads
at the bottom of their beer
grand-poppy ralph had smelt
like pickled onions
and had been a member of the
frankston ice breakers for 5 years
they swam in winter
to feel alive
grand-poppy ralph had said
it made his nipples erect
he had died the year before
aged 74
and his best mate ken
had recited a poem in his honour
born in a barn
in the hills of boronia
ralph lived a long life
then died of pneumonia
mary missed him
and often wondered
why he had drunk ammonia
a lot of things puzzled mary
especially her mother
vera lorraine dinkle
to mary
vera always seemed wobbly
a pretty vicious pull that one
and he out
vera liked listening
to the cricket while baking
and her main ingredient
was always sherry
she told mary
it was a type of tea
for grown-ups
that needed constant testing
mary thought
her mother tested the sherry
way too much
mary also couldnt understand
why vera was always borrowing
yesterday she borrowed some
fish fingers from aisle six
she told mary she put things
up her dress
to save on plastic bags
vera was indeed
a complicated soul
ooh
mary stopped daydreaming
and went and fetched
her pet rooster from the rain
her father had found the rooster
on the side of the freeway
after it had fallen off
the back of a slaughter truck
she named him ethel
it was time to watch
the noblets
she adored the noblets
because everyone was brown
lived in a teapot
and had oodles of friends
there was nothing nicer
mary thought to herself
than the smell of a wet rooster
the sound of rain on the roof
and the taste
of sweetened condensed milk
straight from the can
while watching
your favourite cartoon
meanwhile
a man called max horowitz
also watched the noblets
max small television
had picture but no sound;
his big television sound
but no picture
he was 44 and liked the noblets
because they lived
in a delineated and articulated
social structure
with constant
adherent conformity
and also because they had
oodles of friends
max had trouble sleeping
and had spent the night
watching television
and catching fish food
he noted to himself
it was the sixth fly
hed caught this evening
he wondered if he should go
to bed and count sheep
or have one more
chocolate hot dog
he thought hed try both
but it didnt work
it had been 6 hours
and 2 minutes
since henry the eighth
had passed away
and henry death had thrown
max life into disarray
it had become asymmetrical
and the sooner
he got a new fish the better
tomorrow he would go
to the pet store
and get another henry henry the ninth
next
it was shopping day
and mary sat patiently
while her mother
borrowed some envelopes
to fill in time
she scanned the room
and counted how many things
were brown
there was sticky tape
rubber bands
and a phone book
with a picture of a lady
standing in a brown lake
with her hand on fire
people had weird names
in america
mary daisy dinkle
thought to herself
funny-sounding people called
rockefeller and finkelstein
she wondered
what they looked like
how old they were
and if they were married
wore glasses or had found
babies in their beer
maybe in america
people found babies elsewhere
hmm
they drank a lot of cola
maybe they found them in cans
but no they wouldnt fit
through the hole
mary had an idea
she would write
to one of the americans
and ask where babies came from
she chose a mr m horowitz
mrs dinkle
come back here
vera dinkle you come back here
dear mr m horowitz
my name is mary daisy dinkle
and i am eight years old
three months and nine days
my favourite colour is brown
and my favourite food
is sweetened condensed milk
followed closely by chocolate
i have a rooster called ethel
that looks like this
he doesnt lay eggs
but will one day
my mother likes smoking
cricket and sherry
and my father likes playing
in his shed with dead birds
where do babies come from
in america
do they come from cola cans
in australia they are found
in beer glasses
here is a drawing of me
i cant draw ears proper
but am good at teeth
it would be great if you could
write back and be my friend
yours sincerealy
mary daisy dinkle
ps i hope you like the
chocolate bar im also sending
it called a cherry ripe
good-bye letter
dont forget to write
max hated thursdays
the day of his weekly
overeaters anonymous meeting
and tonight hed felt
especially unsettled
because hed eaten two chocolate
hot dogs on his way there
okay class
eating chocolate
was breaking the rules
hed found the night
even more unbearable
because of marjorie
butterworth strange glances
class dismissed
max had trouble understanding
non-verbal signals
flirting was as foreign
to him as jogging
max found most people
very confusing
but little did max realize
his night was about to become
even more confusing and cryptic
he read
mary letter four times
and then did
what he normally did
whenever confronted with
something new and stressful
max fragile existence
had once again become unsettled
and after staring
out of the window for 8 hours
he finally he made a decision
dear mary daisy dinkle
thank you for the letter
which i opened and read
at 97 pm
after my
overeaters anonymous class
i am trying to lose weight
because my psychiatrist
dr bernard hazelhof
says a healthy body
equals a healthy mind
he says my mind
is not that healthy
your drawing is an interesting
visual portrayal of yourself
i have never met anyone
from australia
firstly i will answer
your question
unfortunately in america
babies are not found
in cola cans
i asked my mother
when i was four
and she said they came
from eggs laid by rabbis
if you arent jewish
theyre laid by catholic nuns
if youre an atheist
theyre laid by
dirty lonely prostitutes
so this is where babies
come from in america
i share my home with a fish
some snails whom i have named
after famous scientists
a parakeet called mr biscuit
and finally a cat called hal
hal is an abbreviation
for halitosis
from which he suffers
he followed me home
after a gang of children
shot his eye out with a bb gun
do you have a pet kangaroo
when i was born
my father left my mother and me
on a kibbutz
she shot herself with
my uncle gun when i was six
do you like chocolate hot dogs
i invented the recipe for them
and can send it to you
when i was young
i invented an invisible friend
called mr ravioli
my psychiatrist says
i dont need him anymore
so he just sits in the corner
and reads
last week i picked up
28 cigarette butts
people are always littering
in new york
i do not understand
why people break laws
butts are bad
because they wash out to sea
and fish smoke them
and become nicotine-dependent
i am just joking
because of course
it is impossible for a cigarette
to remain lit underwater
also fish do not have pockets
to keep cigarette lighters in
i am 44 years old
and have eight tracksuits
the same colour and size
i weigh 352 pounds
ooh
and am as tall
as a six-foot tree
welcome to the new york lottery
i enjoy entering the lottery
and have chosen
the same numbers for nine years
those numbers are 3
and 2
are you a winner or a loser
i have had many different
jobs during my life
my first job was collecting
subway tokens in the subway
my second job was at yiddel
gourmet kosher supplies
where i worked at the machine
that made prepackaged
noodle kugels
i was born jewish
and used to believe in god
but have since read many books
that have proven god is just
a figment of my imagination
people like to believe in god
because it answers
complicated questions
like where did the universe
come from
do worms go to heaven
and why do old ladies
have blue hair
even though im an atheist
i still wear my yarmulke
as it keeps my brain warm
my third job was for a company
that printed logos
on novelty items
i worked at
the frisbee printing machine
a frisbee is
a circular plastic disk
that people throw
at each other
it is like a boomerang
but it does not come back
my fourth job was when i was
called up for jury duty
i didnt get paid much
but got free cookies
and coffee
jurors are outstanding members
of the community
who havent murdered anybody
i made it to the short list
for a trial
where a man killed
all his friends
at his own surprise
birthday party
unfortunately
i didnt get selected
because they found out id been
a mental patient at one point
have you ever been
hang gliding
my fifth job was
as a garbage collector
i got to clean up
after litterbugs
and didnt have
to talk to anybody
sometimes i used to pretend
i was an intergalactical robot
this is 9--
your call has been placed
in a queue
one time the police
took me in for questioning
but let me go when they decided
i wasnt a threat to anybody
except myself
the sixth job i had was
for the united states army
in the stationery supply
department
because i am good with numbers
i had to work out how many
ballpoint pens the army needed
one day they did
a security check
and asked whether i was
a member of any radical groups
i told them i was a member
of the new york
science fiction fan club
they said this didnt count
but dismissed me anyway
fortunately
i did not remember to tell them
i was once a communist
have you ever been a communist
have you ever been attacked
by a crow
or similar large bird
when i was nine a crow
attacked me on my way to school
i had to have three stitches
and in spring
i now wear a helmet
with eyes i have painted on
people laugh at me
when i wear my helmet
but im not sure why
people often confuse me
but i try not to let them
worry me
new york is a very busy
and noisy place
i would prefer to live
somewhere much quieter
like the moon
i dont like crowds
bright lights sudden noises
or strong smells
new york has all these
especially the smells
i often wear noseand earplugs
when i go outside
it helps keep me calm
i find humans interesting
but i have trouble
understanding them
i think however
i will understand and trust you
you appear very happy
and i think you would smell
like a shrimp
as i know australia
has a lot of shrimps
can you speed-read
i have taught myself to read
two pages at once
one eyeball per page
i have to go now
even though i have not told you
about my seventh job
in a condom factory
write back soon
your american friend
max jerry horowitz
ps please find enclosed
a photo
from one of those booths
pps thank you
for the cherry ripe
and i am glad you like
chocolate as much as i do
i have never eaten
sweetened condensed milk
but i will try some this week
ppps i have never
used a condom
max hoped mary
would write again
hed always wanted a friend
a friend that wasnt invisible
a pet or rubber figurine
he counted the stars
and wondered how many days
hours minutes
it would take his letter
to reach australia
vera was not impressed
not impressed at all
there was no way this nutcase
was going to be
her daughter pen-friend
she thought to herself
there was enough ugliness
in the world
mary would be home from school
in an hour
enough time for another cup
of tea and a bit of cricket
to soothe the nerves and dissolve the memory
of max letter from her pickled mind
and he out
found the lead for 4
england 7
stop
wait
hey fellas you got room
for one more bag
sure mrs dinkle
hop in
good one kevin
oh
come on vera weve got
some other bags to pick up
hmm
hmm
mmph
mary is that all your rubbish
yep
see ya toots
sweet baby jesus
even though max letter
smelled like fish heads
and orange peel
mary drank his words
like a bowl of alphabet soup
and hadnt been this excited
since grand-poppy ralph
had found a coin up her nose
she wrote back immediately
on some butcher paper
shed stolen from some chops
dear max i am so excited
youve wroted back
i dont think
my parents like you
so from now on
send stuff to my neighbour
len hislop
at 26 lamington drive
mount waverley
he old with no legs
they got cheweded off
in world war ii
when some japanese peoples kept
him in a cage above piranhas
piranhas are goldfish
that have teeth
he scared of outside
which is a disease
called homophobia
he started giving me 50 cents
a week to get his mail
im saving to buy a castle
in scotland
and marry a man
called earl grey
do you get the noblets
in america
well my favourite noblet
is vanity noblet
he wants to be
everyone friend
even the boys
in your letter
you said you had no friends
well neither do i
yesterday at school
bernie clifford weed
on my spam sandwich
and called me poo-face
cause of my birthmark
i wish i could peel it off
like a band-aid
he also laughed
cause i had no buttons
ethel pecked them off
and mum couldnt thread
a needle
cause shed been testing
the sherry
so she used pegs instead
when i got home
i climbed into my secret place
till dinnertime
the other kids also laugh
at my haircut
dad has to cut my hair
because mum says
real hairdressers sell your hair
to chinamen
who stuff mattresses
my teacher mrs pendergast
says i should smile more
i told my mum
and so she drawed
a big smile on me
i dont think mrs pendergast
likes me anymore
i better go now
my tears are smudg-ling
my words
your friend in australia
mary daisy dinkle
ps have you
ever been teased
can you help me
pss ive never been
hang gliding before
or been a commune-ist
but would love a frisbee
and your recipe
for chocolate hot dogs
psss im sending you
some australian chocolate
a pompom i made
and a cake called a lamington
which i was meant to eat
for lunch
have you ever been teased
mary letter triggered memories
max had buried deep down
in his shoes
he going that way
weve got him cornered now
hey jew boy youre gonna pay
have a load of this jew boy
jew boy jew boy
jew boy jew boy
and as usual
he coped in the only way
he knew
and 36
chocolate hot dogs later
and after only two hours sleep
max meltdown faded away
and an idea popped
into his brain
dear mary daisy dinkle
thank you for your letter
chocolate bar
lamington and pompom
the chocolate got crushed
so i blended the bits
with milk and ice cream
and now i am drinking it
right now
after much thought
i think i have a solution
to your teasing
tell bernie clifford
your birthmark
is made of chocolate
which means
when you get to heaven
you will be in charge
of all the chocolate
this of course is a lie
i do not like lies
but in this case
i think it will be of benefit
i wish i could be in charge
of all the chocolate
but of course i cannot
because of my atheism
my neighbour ivy
is also an atheist
she doesnt talk much
but makes me very good soup
on sunday nights
she is partly blind
and sometimes i find her hair
in my soup
i do not tell her
as dr bernard hazelhof says
this would be impolite
here is a list of what i eat
on the other nights
mondays glicks potato knish
tuesdays yiddel noodle kugel
wednesdays captain salty fishstix
thursdays yentl cheesy blintz
and fridays chicken nuggets
on saturday nights
i create my own recipes
last week i invented
canned spaghetti hamburgers
recipes are like
mathematical equations
dr bernard hazelhof told me
you should never weigh more
than your refrigerator
and to never eat anything
bigger than your head
i once ate a watermelon
bigger than my head
but not all at once
do you have
any weight loss suggestions
my overeaters anonymous
meetings
dont seem to be working
and just make me tense
it would be good
if there was a fat fairy
she would be a bit like
the tooth fairy
but would suck out your fat
ivy says she is only
a little bit blind
but i think she is very blind
she should get a cane
like other
vision-impaired people
she could make the end pointy
and collect rubbish
at the same time
i think i will write a letter
to the mayor and suggest this
he will be very impressed
ivy says
she doesnt need a cane
because she has
a good sense of smell
she says she could find me
with her eyes stapled shut
she says i smell like
licorice and old books
i think she smells like
cough medicine and urine
i have never told her this
as dr bernard hazelhof said
this would also be impolite
people often think
i am tactless and rude
i cannot understand how
being honest can be improper
maybe this is why
i dont have any friends
of course except for you
a real friend has been one
of my three goals in life
the other two
are to own every noblet
and a lifetime supply
of chocolate
dr bernard hazelhof says
it is good to have goals
but not stupid ones like mine
i have now run out of things
to tell you
please write soon
your friend in america
max jerry horowitz
ps do not worry
about not smiling
my mouth hardly ever smiles
but it does not mean
i am not smiling
inside my brain
pps please find enclosed
a frisbee
some chocolate pop rocks
which you should eat with cola
and an illustration of a turtle
from one
of my national geographics
ppps did you know
that turtles
can breathe
through their anuses
dear max
when i told bernie clifford
ill be in charge
of all the chocolate in heaven
and he wouldnt get any
he cried
i also hided some dog poo
in his bit of the sand pit
your advice was great
and i have got a job
delivering pamphlets
so i can save
to come and see you
i am sad to hear you are fat
mum says i am fat too
and i am growing up
to be a heffa
which i think is a type of cow
maybe you should
only eat things
beginning with the letter
of each day
on mondays you could only eat
milkshakes marshmallows
and mustard
ooh
for my birthday
my mum baked a cake
and dad gave me a camera
i hope you like
the photos i sent
the first one is of ethel
who ate some tinsel
the next one is of myself
after i ate
the chocolate pop rocks
with the cola like you said
next is len
he still trying hard
not to be afraid of outside
and conquer his homophobia
the next one
is of dad in his shed
and then one of the times
i covered mum
while she was asleep
in her stickers
that help her stop smoking
next when i got my slinky
caught in my hair
then one of the times sonny
digged up his wife cher
and finally
a photo of my other neighbour
damian popodopolous
he a greek and smells like
lemon dishwashing liquid
and his skin is smooth
like the back of a spoon
mum says he a wog
and has a stutter
and cant even say
his own surname
she says you have to hit him
on the back of the head
to get his words out
popodopolous
i wish he was my boyfriend
and we can be in love
and do sexing
like katherine ramsay told me
behind the bike shed
she said
it when two people go nuddy
and rub on each other
to make babies
i told her she a liar
and would go to hell
and burn like toast
cause babies really come
from beer glasses
and eggs laid by rabbits
and nuns and proster-tubes
she said ladies get knocked up
and bake babies
in their stomachs for two years
till they spurt
out their vag-eye-nas
with blood
and tinned spaghetti
have you got a girlfriend max
or some wives
have you done sexing
valen-time day is soon
and i want to give damian
a present so he can love me
can you explain love
and how i can be lovered
once again mary letter
had triggered an anxiety attack
max knew nothing about love
it was as it was as foreign
to him as scuba diving
and hed had an appalling history
of getting it all wrong
one valentine day
hed given zelda glutnik
a gift he was sure
was appropriate
the only companion
that had ever warmed max bed
was his hot water bottle
romance and love was a mysterious
language hed given up on
if only mary had asked
how a toaster works
or asked for an explanation
of the chaos theory
if only there was
a mathematical equation
for love
he kept eating and thinking
but love was not like
max rubik cube
it could not be solved
and no matter from what angle
he analysed it
the results were negative
beat it creep
he felt love
but couldnt articulate it
its logic was as foreign
to him as
as a salad sandwich
the stars made more sense
unit 2 have you responded
to the hubert street call
the anxiety
and stress were too much
the inscrutability of love
finally won
and max brain gave in
ooh
he was diagnosed with severe
depression and obesity
and spent the next eight months
institutionalized and bedridden
they marinated him
in a cocktail of drugs
and performed the usual
therapeutic procedures
meanwhile
mary wondered and waited
maybe max typewriter
had run out of ink
and maybe america
had run out of ink
maybe his pets had eaten him
maybe it was her
was she too demanding
too boring too ugly
filled with anger confusion
and self-loathing
mary tried to erase the memory
of her friend forever
max had recovered
and life was balanced
safe and symmetrical
once again
but mary still lingered
in his mind
half of him wanted
to write to her immediately
the other half didnt want to
end up a mental patient again
at least there was always
mr ravioli to be friends with
he was a much safer option
he wondered what mary
was doing right now
but she was far from content
and struggled on by herself
saving her money
for a rainy day
life went on as usual for max
and even though he opted
for order and stability
misfortune was never far away
luckily his manslaughter
charges were dismissed
because he was labelled
mentally deficient
and unlikely to have a motive
for killing a mime artist
unlike most people
from then on
max cooled himself differently
and things went back to normal
until after his 48th birthday
when his numbers
finally came up
welcome to the new york lottery
and these are
tonight winning numbers
and 2
max was sensible
with his sudden wealth
and had bought
a lifetime supply of chocolate
and the complete
noblet collection
two of his life goals
had come true
but he still had a lot of money
so decided to give it to ivy
oh
who was also very sensible
until her own numbers came up
ivy willed everything
to the local cat shelter
whose owner relocated her kind
donation to his bank account
his wife new breasts
a ferrari
and enough fuel
to get to mexico
despite achieving
all his life goals
max still felt incomplete
mr ravioli just wasnt
cutting the mustard anymore
and seemed more interested
in his self-help books
mary had given max a taste
of real friendship
and there was just
no comparison
she missed him too
but no longer saved to see him
she now saved
for a different reason
one day mr ravioli got up
left and never came back
max sought dr hazelhofs advice
he told max that true friendship
is seen through the heart
not through the eyes
and that it was time
he wrote to mary
to reveal his true self
warts and all
max understood
dear mary daisy dinkle
there is something
i have to tell you
which will explain why
i have not written
each time i received
one of your letters
i had a severe anxiety attack
this is because recently
while i was
in a mental institution
they diagnosed
that i have a new thing
called asperger syndrome
which is a neurobiological
pervasive
developmental disability
i prefer aspie for short
i will now list
some of the traits of an aspie
number one
i find the world
very confusing and chaotic
because my mind
is very literal and logical
two i have trouble understanding
the expressions
on people faces
when i was younger
i made a book to help me
when i was confused
i still have trouble
with some people
ivy was hard to understand
because of her wrinkles
and because her eyebrows
werent real
three i have bad handwriting
am hypersensitive
clumsy
and can get very concerned
four i like solving problems
ivy said this is a good thing
and finally number five
i have trouble expressing
my emotions
dr bernard hazelhof says
my brain is defective
but one day there will be
a cure for my disability
i do not like it
when he says this
i do not feel disabled
defective
or a need to be cured
i like being an aspie
it would be like trying
to change the colour of my eyes
there is one thing i wish
i could change however
i wish i could cry properly
i squeeze and squeeze
but nothing comes out
i cry when i cut onions
but this does not count
anyway do you like
the word kumquat
it is a type of fruit
do you have
a favourite-sounding word
my top five are
ointment bumblebee
vladivostock banana
and testicle
i have also invented
some new words
confuzzled which is being
confused and puzzled
at the same time;
snirt which is a cross
between snow and dirt
and smushables
which are squashed groceries
you find at the bottom
of the bag
i have sent a letter
to the oxford dictionary people
asking them to include my words
but have not heard back
it is now time for me to go
to my overeaters anonymous
meeting
there is a woman there
called marjorie buttersworth
who confuzzles me
she kisses me
without my permission
so tonight i have decided
to rub onions
under my armpits to repel her
your friend in america
max jerry horowitz
ps please find enclosed
some chocolate-covered ants
i found at the deli
pps not much has happened
since i last wrote
except for
my manslaughter charges
lotto win and ivy death
mary was thrilled
max had finally written
and suddenly had
a fabulous idea
aha
mary and max
friendship was resuscitated
and her tears were the best gift
hed ever received
inside max head
his brain was smiling
loaded up with bizarre forms
of chocolate
their letters flew
thick and fast
between the continents
max learned to read
mary letters with caution
and at the slightest tingle
of tension
he would stop
take his medication
and soothe his nerves
each letter he would iron
laminate
and file in a special place
which also soothed his nerves
he enjoyed answering
her questions
and solving her puzzles like
do sheep shrink when it rains
why do old men
wear their pants so high
do gooses get goose bumps
and why is
belly button lint blue
are there noblets in heaven
and if a taxi goes backwards
does the driver owe you money
in turn
mary simply enjoyed hearing
about max fascinating life
how many people
hed counted littering
how the latest henry had died
and new recipes
hed invented for chicken
each nourished the other
and as mary grew taller
max grew wider
their friendship becoming stronger
than the glue on mary noblets
although max found solace
in mary
he still found the rest
of the world bewildering
and he couldnt understand
why he was seen as the odd one
while everyone else
was considered normal
humans were endlessly illogical
why did they throw out food
when there were children
starving in india
why did they clear
the rain forests
when they needed the oxygen
and why did they create
bus timetables
when they never ran on time
he agreed with
his favourite physicist
that there are only
two things infinite
the universe
and man stupidity
and for mary even though max
filled her with confidence
bull-eye
her world was far from perfect
the grip of love
had her by the throat
at 459 pm
on the 8th of the 8th 988
noel norman dinkle
attached his last string
and after 40 years
and 40 million tea bags
he retired
to celebrate noel announced
he was retiring from taxidermy
and taking up
metal detecting instead
but sadly it was not a hobby
he had for long
in his will
noel had left mary some money
so she decided
to go to university
and study disorders of the mind
yearning to learn more
about her friend
mary was as popular
at university
as she was at school
damian went there too
aching to be a thespian
hi there m-m-mary
hi
hello
hey damian
your mum roses look fab
ah th-thanks mary
urn mary can i tell you
something
sure babe
um um
youve got d-d-d-dog poo
on your shoe
dear max i have been
such an idiot
ive wasted all my money
on something pointless
when i should have been
saving to see you
i know love upsets you
so i wont go on about it
all i want to say is that
love is obviously not for me
i hope you are well
and enjoy the chocolate
cigarettes ive enclosed
love mary
oh you should be ashamed
come on bethany let go
oh mom
i told you never to talk to strangers you naughty girl
noel sudden death
had filled vera
with remorse and guilt
and she coped
in the only way she knew
dear max
our wedding day was everything
that ive ever dreamt
making up
for the terrible year ive had
although all the guests were
damian family and friends
i felt very welcome
damian is so perfect
he even made my wedding dress
and for our honeymoon
he took me to mykonos
his favourite island in greece
i got to ride a donkey
and found the perfect gift
for len
poor len
he still struggling
with his agoraphobia
damian and i are so similar
he even has his own pen-friend
who lives on a sheep farm
in new zealand
mary
m-m-m-mary
mary
mary was bursting
with self-esteem
and her confidence
was almost unbearable
at university she shone
and took it upon herself
to cure the world
of mental illness
she did her thesis
on asperger syndrome
and used max as her case study
her professors
were thoroughly impressed
and her writing
praised far and wide
soon publishers queued
to print her unique insight
and by her 25th birthday
thousands of copies
were ready to be shipped
dear max
i am very proud to give you the very first
copy of my book about your disability
and the hopes that we have
to one day cure it
even more exciting is that
im finally coming
to meet and celebrate with you
in one week time
im also gonna give you
half the royalties
your loving friend mary
ps please find enclosed some
chocolate-coated swiss almonds
max didnt take
the news very well
not very well at all
dear mary daisy dinkle
i cannot express myself
very clearly at this moment
and so i will list my emotions
in the order they feel
most intense
hurt confuzzledness betrayal
discomfort distress
and wheeziness
this last one
is not really an emotion
but i thought you
should know about it anyway
with her suitcase
packed for new york
mary said good-bye to damian
she hadnt been this excited
since shed found a noblet
in the gutter
but her excitement
suddenly dribbled away
like a chocolate in the sun
mary slowly sank
into a puddle of depression
self-loathing
and cooking sherry
the only colour left in her life
was her beloved damian
only an arm length away
but as distant as the moon
she lost interest in the world
and it lost interest in her
as a horrible apparition
began to haunt
she started to spend her nights
making pompoms
and eating two-minute noodles
each day
with strength and shame
mary trudged
to the letterbox in hope
only to swivel shrivel
and slink back inside
my dearest mary
by the time you read this
i will be on a plane
to new zealand
to begin a new life
you probably havent even
noticed id packed my bags
i have fallen in love with
with my pen-friend desmond
and im going to live
on his sheep farm
it been hard to watch you become a
remnant of the person i once loved
your research into m-m-mental
illness has been admirable
but your i-i-idealistic pursuit
to remedy it has been misguided
mary you have to realize
you are not some sort
of magic beauty cream
you can smooth on the world
to rid of its wrinkles
i love you mary
but i love desmond more
i hope one day your heart will
heal and we can be friends
yours compassionately damian
dear mayor ridiculani
on monday i counted 27 people
illegally dropping
cigarette butts
i would like to recommend
the fine be increased
to a minimum of $ million
as a stronger deterrent
and would be happy
thank you
thank you
sorry
dear mary
please find enclosed
my entire noblet collection
as a sign that i forgive you
when i received your book
what
on the way home
max sat to count the stars
he felt complete
the world was back in balance
when i was just a little girl
i asked my mother
what will i be
will i be pretty
will i be rich
here what she said to me
que sera sera
whatever will be will be
the future not ours to see
que sera sera
que sera sera
whatever will be will be
the future not ours to see
que sera sera
what will be will be
que sera sera
len had saved the day
and after 45 years
he finally conquered
his agoraphobia
moron
dear mary
please find enclosed
my entire noblet collection
as a sign that i forgive you
when i received your book
the emotions inside my brain
felt like they were
in a tumble dryer
smashing into each other
the hurt felt like
when i accidentally
stapled my lips together
the reason i forgive you
is because you are not perfect
you are imperfect and so am i
all humans are imperfect
even the man outside
my apartment who litters
when i was young
i wanted to be anybody
but myself
dr bernard hazelhof said
if i was on a desert island
then i would have to
get used to my own company
just me and the coconuts
he said i would
have to accept myself
my warts and all
and that we dont get
to choose our warts
they are a part of us
and we have to live with them
we can however
choose our friends
and i am glad
i have chosen you
dr bernard hazelhof
also said that everyone lives
are like a very long sidewalk
some are well-paved
others like mine have cracks
banana skins
and cigarette butts
your sidewalk is like mine
but probably not
as many cracks
hopefully one day
our sidewalks will meet
and we can share
a can of condensed milk
you are my best friend
you are my only friend
your american pen pal
max jerry horowitz
ps i have recently found
the perfect job
with a survey company
all i have to do is eat things
and tick boxes
max
max
max
hello
max it us
were here
max
max had died
peacefully that morning
after finishing his final can
of condensed milk
you are my best friend
you are my only friend
he smelled like
licorice and old books
she thought to herself
as tears rolled from her eyes
the colour of muddy puddles
