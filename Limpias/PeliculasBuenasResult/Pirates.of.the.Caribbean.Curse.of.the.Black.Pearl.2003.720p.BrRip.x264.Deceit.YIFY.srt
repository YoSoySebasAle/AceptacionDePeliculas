yo ho
yo ho
a pirate life for me
we extort we pilfer
we filch we sack
drink
quiet missy
cursed pirates sail these waters
you dont want to bring
them down on us do ya
mr gibbs that will do
she was singing about pirates
bad luck to be singing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog
mark my words
consider them marked
on your way
aye lieutenant
it bad luck to have
a woman on board too
even a miniature one
i think itd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate
think again miss swann
vile and dissolute creatures
the lot of em
i intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves
a short drop and a sudden stop
lieutenant norrington
i appreciate your fervor
but im concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter
my apologies governor swann
actually i find it all fascinating
yes that what concerns me
look a boy
there a boy in the water
man overboard
man the ropes
fetch a hook
haul him aboard
he still breathing
mary mother of god
what happened here
most likely the powder magazine
merchant vessels run heavily armed
lot of good it did them
everyone thinking it
im just saying it
pirates
there no proof of that
it was probably an accident
rouse the captain
aye sir
heave to and take in sail
launch the boats
heave to
elizabeth i want you
to accompany the boy
hell be in your charge
take care of him
it ok
my name elizabeth swann
will turner
im watching over you will
youre a pirate
has he said anything
his name william turner
that all i found out
take him below
elizabeth
are you all right
are you decent
yes
yes
still in bed at this hour
it a beautiful day
i have a gift for you
oh it beautiful
isnt it
may i inquire as to the occasion
does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter
go on
actually i
i had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today
ceremony
captain norrington promotion ceremony
i knew it
commodore norrington
as he about to become
a fine gentleman dont you think
he fancies you you know
elizabeth
how it coming
it difficult to say
im told it
the latest fashion in london
well women in london
mustve learned not to breathe
my lord you have a visitor
ah mr turner
good to see you again
good day sir
i have your order
well
the blade is folded steel
that gold filigree
laid into the handle
if i may
perfectly balanced
the tang is nearly
the full width of the blade
impressive very impressive
very nice
commodore norrington going
to be very pleased with this
do pass my compliments
onto your master
i shall
a craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated
elizabeth
you look absolutely stunning
will
it so good to see you
i had a dream about you last night
about me
is it entirely proper for you
about the day we met
do you remember
how could i forget miss swann
how many times must i ask you
to call me elizabeth
at least once more miss swann
as always
now you see
at least the boy
has a sense of propriety
we really must be going
come on
good day mr turner
come along
good day
elizabeth
hold up there you
it a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock
and i shall need to know your name
what do you say to three shillings
and we forget the name
welcome to port royal mr smith
two paces march
right about face
present arms
this dock is off-limits to civilians
im terribly sorry i didnt know
if i see one
i shall inform you immediately
apparently there some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort eh
how could it be two upstanding
gentlemen such as yourselves
did not merit an invitation
someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians
it a fine goal to be sure
but it seems to me a
a ship like that
makes this one here
a bit superfluous really
oh the dauntless is the power
in these waters true enough
but there no ship that can match
the interceptor for speed
ive heard of one
it supposed to be very fast
nigh uncatchable
the black pearl
there no real ship
that can match the interceptor
the black pearl is a real ship
no no it not
yes it is ive seen it
youve seen it
yes
you havent seen it
yes i have
youve seen a ship
with black sails
that crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil
that hell itself spat him back out
no
but i have seen a ship
with black sails
oh and no ship that
not crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out
could possibly have black sails
therefore couldnt possibly
be any other ship
than the black pearl
is that what youre saying
no
like i said
there no real ship
that can match the interceptor
hey
you
get away from there
you dont have permission
to be aboard there
sorry it such a pretty boat
ship
what your name
smith
or smithy if you like
what your purpose in port royal
mr smith
yeah and no lies
all right then
i confess
it is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships pick up a crew
in tortuga to rape pillage and pilfer
my weasely black guts out
i said no lies
i think he telling the truth
if he were telling the truth
he wouldnt have told us
unless he knew you wouldnt believe
the truth even if he told it to you
may i have a moment
you look lovely elizabeth
yes
i apologize if i seem forward
but i must speak my mind
this promotion throws into sharp relief
that which i have not yet achieved
a marriage to a fine woman
you have become a fine woman elizabeth
i cant breathe
yes i
im a bit nervous myself
and then they made me their chief
elizabeth
elizabeth
the rocks
sir it a miracle she missed them
will you be saving her then
i cant swim
pearl of the king navy you are
do not lose these
what was that
make way
i got her
she not breathing
move
i never wouldve thought of that
clearly youve never been to singapore
where did you get that
on your feet
elizabeth
are you all right
yes im fine
shoot him
father commodore
do you intend to kill my rescuer
i believe thanks are in order
had a brush with the east india
trading company did we
pirate
hang him
keep your guns on him men
gillette fetch some irons
well well
jack sparrow isnt it
captain jack sparrow
if you please sir
well i dont see your ship
captain
im in the market as it were
he said hed come to commandeer one
i told you he was telling the truth
these are his sir
no additional shots nor powder
a compass that doesnt point north
and i half expected it
to be made of wood
you are without doubt
the worst pirate ive heard of
but you have heard of me
commodore i really must protest
carefully lieutenant
pirate or not this man saved my life
one good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness
but it seems enough to condemn him
