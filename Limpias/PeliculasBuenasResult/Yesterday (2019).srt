it the dictionary definition
of a one-night stand and

for brothers and sisters to have sex
except were not brother and sister
no exactly right but
no so
exhales i have been waiting half my life
for you to wake up and love me
having loved you for half a lifetime
i realized when you left
that i had made a bad choice doing that
and now it got even trickier because
chuckles when you were playing
in pubs we were the perfect match
but now
i sighs
im an actual schoolteacher
in actual lowestoft
and youre the world
greatest singer-songwriter
no im not
except that you probably are
okay two minutes

marketing meeting of meetings
so amazing to have jack himself
right here in the building
give it up for jack yall
cheering and applause
now uh jack i do believe i speak for
everyone in attendance today when i say
whistles chuckles
it is the climax of our careers
to be working
on this mind-bending album with you
give it up yall
cheering
man yeah
you dont have to clap every time
but thanks very much
laughter
mr modesty
give it up for modesty
no seriously
that what he does right off the top
chuckles
now as you all know
the songs we released online
have created unprecedented excitement
cheering
yeah
no
so now upon us falls the mighty task
of packaging everything together
into one single irresistible album
now jack came up
with some title suggestions himself
and chuckles
we worked on some of those
you know i especially
got a kick out of
sgt pepper lonely hearts club band
laughter
yeah that chuckles
it okay to laugh cause it funny
laughter continues
it is it a lot of words jack
but ultimately in the end
we just felt it was uh too confusing
crowd hmm
all right too confusing
and uh the white album
has some diversity issues
how
that a lot of white jack
and i know you were pretty enthusiastic
about abbey road
i gotta say
it didnt have a lot going for it
if i could put it to you like that uh
it just a road with a bunch of people
driving down the wrong side of the street
chuckles
laughter
that not exactly what i meant
but weve been developing
some ideas of our own now you know
we werent just sitting around
we focused on the one thing
that makes this man here
unlike anyone else
in the entire world of music today
no collaborators no cowriters
no samples no steals hmm
no featuring cardi b
no featuring bieber
just the simple pure genius
of one man only
gasping
chattering
mmm-mmm-mmm and as a second wave
because of the miracle
that is one man only
it just this
crowd gasping
just this
mmm-mmm i know i know
applause
so let operation jack begin
cheering
each week a new song online
each week a new tv show

audience cheering
in this age of sometimes 6 people
writing on one song
suddenly here a guy
him and a guitar and he writes
everything himself on his own
yeah i mean you know
that how it always used to be though
with like james taylor
or stevie wonder bruce springsteen

would have it and do forgive me
because we love a surprise on this show

as a song of comfort
i dont believe you
what
i mean i just i dont believe you
it one genius idea after the other
oh right
i do have a suggestion though um
about the song the title hey jude
