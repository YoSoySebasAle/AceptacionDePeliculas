when a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart
like you gave me that butt
i remember it from the heart

i want you to keep this lighter

it belonged to that english kid
we just buried
he gave it to me
for a favour id done him
before i pass on
i want to do the same for you
you funny man shears

one of these days colonel saito
will catch you bribing him
then wherell we be
before that happens
well be far away from here chum
far away
okay let knock off
here lies
i forgot who we just buried
thomson
ah yes
here lies corporal herbert thomson
serial number zero-one-two-
three-four-five-six-seven
valiant member of the king own
or the queen own or something
who died of beri-beri
in the year of our lord 943
for the greater glory of
what did he die for
come off it
no need to mock the grave
i dont mock the grave or the man
may he rest in peace
he found little of it
while he was alive
a company mark time
mark time
halt
into line left turn
stand easy
were going to be
busy gravediggers weaver
well done well done
that colonel doesnt know
what he in for
you going to tell him the truth
of course not
youre neither an officer
nor a gentleman
my name is nicholson
i am colonel saito
in the name of his lmperial majesty
i welcome you
i am the commanding officer
of this camp
which is camp 6
along the great railroad
which will soon connect
bangkok with rangoon
you british prisoners
have been chosen
to build a bridge
across the river kwai
it will be pleasant work
requiring skill
and officers will work as well as men
the japanese army cannot
have idle mouths to feed
if you work hard
you will be treated well
but if you do not work hard
you will be punished
a word to you about escape
there is no barbed wire
no stockade
no watchtower
they are not necessary
we are an island in the jungle
escape is impossible
you would die
today you rest
tomorrow youll begin
let me remind you of
general yamashita motto
be happy in your work
be happy in your work
dismissed
battalion stand at ease
fall out major hughes
battalion stand easy
hughes get the men to their quarters
see who sick
im going to have a word
with this fellow
i heard your remarks just now sir
my men will carry on in the way
one expects of a british soldier
my officers and i
will be responsible for their conduct
you may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labour
is expressly forbidden
by the geneva convention
is that so
i have a copy of the convention
and would be glad to
let you glance through it
that will not be necessary
sit down please
yes sir
im going to have a word with clipton
clipton dont let me interrupt
how the arm
nearly healed
sir this is commander shears
of the united states navy
how do you do sir
we found him and an australian
all that left of the
prisoners who built the camp
us navy out here
i am sort of landlocked
you lost your ship
the houston
i made it ashore but i got separated
from the other survivors
and your group here
mostly aussies some lime
some british
indians burmese siamese
and what happened to them
they died
of malaria dysentery
beri-beri gangrene
other causes of death
famine overwork bullet wounds
snakebites
saito
then there were some
who just got tired of living
has clipton seen you
just about to come over here
you can shave later
all right
youll stay with the officers
well find some decent clothing
dont bother about me
im not anxious to
get off the sick list
besides this is working kit
it the fashion here
the officers in your party
did manual labour
i think you could call it that
i raised that very point
with colonel what-his-name
saito
i think he understands now
is that so
yes i must say he seems
quite a reasonable type
well i must be pushing on
there an officer meeting at 7
give me a list of your requirements
yes sir
anything we can do
thank you sir
what is it
never mind
go on say it
i can think of a lot of things
to call saito
but reasonable that a new one
perhaps col nicholson
defines the word differently
any other points
by your leave sir
jennings
about the escape committee
ive spoken with cmd shears
there wont be any escape committee
i dont understand sir
lt jennings has a plan
yes yes im sure jennings
has a plan but escape
where into this jungle
that fellow saito is right
no need for barbed wire here
one chance in 00 of survival
im sure a man of cmdr shears
experience will back me up on that
id say that the odds against a
successful escape are 00 to one
but may i add another word
please
the odds against survival in this camp
are even worse
youve seen the graveyard
theyre your real odds
to give up hope of escape
to stop thinking about it
means accepting a death sentence
why havent you tried to escape
commander
im biding my time waiting for
the right moment the right company
i understand how you feel
of course it the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape
but my men and i are
involved in a curious legal point
of which you are unaware
in singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters
ordered mind you
therefore in our case escape might
well be an infraction of military law
interesting point sir
im sorry sir
i didnt quite follow you
you intend to uphold the letter
of the law no matter what it costs
without law commander
there is no civilization
that just my point
here there is no civilization
then we have the opportunity
to introduce it
i suggest we drop
the subject of escape
is there anything else
i think were
clear on the program
i want everything to go off smoothly
starting tomorrow morning
and remember this
our men must always feel they are
still commanded by us
and not by the japanese
so long as they have that idea
theyll be soldiers and not slaves
are you with me there commander
i hope they can
remain soldiers colonel
as for me im just a slave
a living slave
queer bird even for an ameri
he been in isolation too long
poor chap
cut off from his unit
it should be a lesson to all of us
english prisoners
notice i do not say english soldiers
from the moment you surrendered
you ceased to be soldiers
you will finish the bridge
by the twelfth day of may
you will work under the direction
of a japanese engineer
time is short all men will work
your officers will work beside you
this is only just
for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender
your shame is their dishonour
it is they who told you
better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero
it is they who brought you here
not i
therefore they will join you
in useful labour
that is all
officer prisoners collect your tools
bradley back in your place
i must call your attention
colonel saito
to article 27
of the geneva convention
belligerents may employ
prisoners of war
who are fit
other than officers
give me the book
by all means
you read english i take it
do you read japanese
im sorry no
if it a matter of translation
im sure it can be arranged
you see the code states that
stand fast in the ranks
you speak to me of code
what code
the coward code
what do you know
of the soldier code
of bushido nothing
you are unworthy of command
if you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilized worid
we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you
my officers will not do manual labour
we shall see
all enlisted prisoners to work
sergeant major take the men to work
battalion take up tools
move to the left in columnar route
left turn
a company by the right
quick march
eyes right
eyes right
eyes front
quick march eyes right
c company by the right
what he up to
looks like he doesnt
want any witnesses
now you will be reasonable
you will order your officers to work
no
i will count three
if by the third count
you and your officers
are not on the way to work
i will give the order to fire
he going to do it
believe me
he really going to do it
one
i warn you colonel
two
stop
colonel saito
ive seen and heard everything
so has every man in the hospital
theyre too many witnesses
you cant call it a mass escape
most of those men cant walk
is this your soldier code
murdering unarmed men
you see jennings there are
advantages to being on the sick list
ill say this for the old man
he got guts
into the valley of death
rode the 600
how that sir
that kind of guts
also the kind they had in 94
when officers fought
with only a swagger stick
i see what you mean
you dont see what i mean at all
the kind of guts
that can get us all killed
excuse me sir
id like to go along too
arm almost healed sir
really it is
what about him
he didnt order us not to escape
he suggested
listen when a man like your colonel
suggests something it an order
here we go again
colonel saito says all officers
to punishment hut
tell them to go
not you
come
leave him alone
leave him alone
theyre going to put him in the oven
for he a jolly good fellow
for he a jolly good fellow
for he a jolly good fellow
and so say all of us
and so say all of us
and so say all of us
for he a jolly good fellow
for he a jolly good fellow
for he a jolly good fellow
and so say all of us
timber
one two three four
one two three four
no no no
let go
let go
you wish to see me
ive tried to see you for three days
it about the colonel
he been shut up in that hut
i could have you shot
those prisoners who tried to escape
they were in your charge
i knew nothing about the escape
it does not matter
one must respect those who tried
for a brief moment
between escape and death
they were soldiers again
but it is insane to try and escape
two soldiers shot
and the third drowned
to what end
it was an escape from reality
there is your reality
this shows the position work
should have reached by noon today
and this shows the position
of actual progress
because of your colonel stubbornness
we are far behind schedule
that is not all
enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work
yes i have seen it
i could have them all shot
then who would build your bridge
besides are you sure it sabotage
the men dont work well
without their own officers
my officers will direct them
your officers will work beside them
that for nicholson to decide
as he said
it against the rules
do not speak to me of rules
this is war
this is not a game of cricket
he mad your colonel
quite mad
sit down please
i have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel
thank you
tell him that if his officers
will not work
lll be forced
to close the hospital
and your patients will
work in their place
many will die
and he will be responsible
go and speak to him
you have five minutes
doc going to see the old man
sir
it clipton sir
i brought you a few things
how are the men
fine sir fine
we scraped together a little meat
and a coconut
and the officers
not so good
theyre still in detention
and lieutenant jennings
jennings is dead
what
killed attempting to escape
also two others
corporal weaver and the american
jennings poor brave lad
i warned him didnt i clipton
look sir we havent much time
im going to clean you up a little
while i talk
ive got something to tell you
ive just had a word with saito
that man is the worst commanding
officer ive ever come across
actually i think he mad
carry on
blackmail
i know sir but he means it
im sure he does
it a question of face pure and
simple and he cant give in
it still blackmail
sir you cant stand
much more of this
wouldnt the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole
the men are doing a wonderful job
theyre going as slow as they dare
but saito cut their food rations
and if he makes
the sick men work
well theyre going to die
that all there is to it
yes clipton i understand truly
but dont you see
it a matter of principle
if we give in now
therell be no end to it no
sir were lost in the jungle
a thousand miles from anywhere
were under a man wholl stop at
nothing to get his way principle
no one will ever know or care
what happens to us
give in sir please
im adamant
i will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie
time
all right
please thank those concerned
everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece
reynolds stole the coconut
well be able to get you
food sometimes
weve bribed one of your guards
goodbye sir and good luck
many thanks
did you say that american
was killed
yes sir shot and drowned
it insane to plan escapes
three men killed and to what end
time
here is where we must win through
doc just looked at us and shook
his head whatever that means
means only one thing
the colonel wont give in
well
it like this
colonel nicholson
wont give in to force
it a question of principle
as medical officer i protest
the way he being treated
it a wonder he still alive
should a tragedy occur
it would be tantamount to murder
he is responsible
not i
you sick
are they both mad
or am i going mad
or is it the sun
attention
battalion attention
english prisoners
let us ask the question
why does the bridge not progress
you know why
because your officers are lazy
they think themselves too good
to share your burden
this is not just
therefore you are not happy
in your work
therefore the bridge
does not progress
but there is another cause
i do not hide the truth
with deep shame and regret
i admit to you the failure
of a member of the japanese staff
i refer to lieutenant miura
he is a bad engineer
he is unworthy of command
therefore i have removed him
from his post
tomorrow we begin again
i shall be in personal command
today we rest
all work and no play
make jack a dull boy
as token of regard
for your efforts in the future
i give presents to you all
let us be happy in our work
company dismissed
battalion dismissed
hey take a look at this
red cross he given us our
hey he given us
our own red cross parcels
tomorrow we begin again
hey harry look
theyre letting the old man out
most likely going to give him
another pasting
good evening colonel
do you mind sitting over here
i am having rather a late supper
english corned beef
no thank you
produce of scotland
i prefer it to sake
i spent three years in london
you know
i studied at the london polytechnic
cheers
sorry
later perhaps
perhaps
i was not a good artist
my father disapproved
he felt i belonged in the army
so i changed from art to engineering
i must tell you colonel saito
i intend to make a full report
of your activities
i do not think you
quite realize my position
i must carry out my orders
oh quite quite
my orders are to complete the bridge
by the 2th day of may
i have only 2 weeks more
no doubt
therefore i am compelled
to use all available personnel
no officers except
for administration
but officers are working
along the entire railway
you know it i know it
im not responsible
for other officers
personally im appalled
let not get excited
will you have a cigar
no thank you
when i said all officers must work
naturally i never meant you
the commanding officer
my orders were only intended
for officers below
no officers will do manual labour
please i was about to say
ive thought the matter over
and have decided
to put majors and above
on administrative duties
leaving only junior officers
to work
no the convention
quite clear on that point
do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time
i havent the foggiest
id have to kill myself
what would you do if you were me
i suppose if i were you
ld have to kill myself
cheers
i warn you colonel
if i am to die
others will die before me
do you understand
clipton did mention that
that wont solve your problem
im sure we can
arrive at a solution
please sit down
now tell me colonel
do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command
of course
good
now
take this bridge of yours
it quite an enormous undertaking
frankly i doubt whether
your lieutenant what-his-name
miura
is capable of tackling
a job of such importance
on the other hand i have officers
reeves and hughes for instance
who have built bridges
all over india
the men respect them
it essential for an officer
to have that respect
if it gone he ceases to command
what then
demoralization and chaos
a poor commander i would be if
i allowed that to happen
perhaps you are not aware that
the bridge is now under my command
really and may i ask are you
satisfied with the work
i am not
youve proved my point
i hate the british
you are defeated
but you have no shame
you are stubborn
but have no pride
you endure
but you have no courage
i hate the british
pointless going on like this
stay there
stand down stand down
battalion attention
battalion stand at ease
please
do you know what is
the date today colonel
ive lost count
it the anniversary of
our great victory
over russia in 905
throughout east asia
we are celebrating this date
in honour of this occasin
i have given your troops
a day of rest
many thanks
i am declaring a general amnesty
you and your officers may
return to your quarters
as part of this amnesty
it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labour
he done it
somebody deserves a medal sir
how many men in your party
i dont really know sir
you dont know
twelve usually
one of the men took sick
this morning sir
it took three or four
to help him to the hospital
and he took terrible sick sir
a corporal should know
how many men he has under him
oh yes sir
have you a nervous affliction
stop making those faces
it may be funny to you
but it not military behaviour
no sir
we must put a stop
to these demonstrations
i say reeves
yes sir
ever built a bridge
over a stream like the kwai
yes sir half a dozen of them
in madras bengal
if this were your bridge
how would you get it under way
get it under way sir
first of all
i wouldnt build it here
oh why not
i was trying to tell you
the japanese couldnt have
picked a worse location
you see those piles
theyre sinking
we could drive those logs
forever and they wouldnt hold
where would you build it
further downstream sir
across those narrows
then wed have solid bedrock
on both banks
hughes if this were your bridge
how would you use the men
not the way theyre doing it
it chaos as you can see
uncoordinated activity
no teamwork
some parties are working
against each other
yes
i say gentlemen we have
a problem on our hands
thanks to the japanese
we command a rabble
there no order no discipline
our task is to rebuild the battalion
yes sir
which isnt going to be easy
fortunately we have
the means at hand the bridge
the bridge sir
the bridge
well teach them a lesson in western
efficiency thatll put them to shame
show what a british
soldier is capable of
yes i see your point sir
i know how difficult
it going to be here
where you cant find what you need
there the challenge
i beg your pardon sir
you really want them
to build the bridge
youre not usually
so slow in the uptake
i know our men
youve got to keep them occupied
if there werent any work
wed invent some
that we would sir
so were lucky
but it going to be a proper bridge
here again i know the men
it essential that they
take pride in their job
right men
yes sir
reeves youre
the key man here as engineer
tell me what you want and well
get it can we make a go of it
well do out best sir
fine
we must draw up our plans
then arrange a conference
with saito
and set him straight
that takes care of all
the procedural matters
oh yes
the next point is unpleasant
for all concerned im afraid
sorry to say the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily
and i have to add incorrectly
incorrectly
unfortunately yes
our engineer has made
a study of the site
and decided that the river bottom
there is too soft
too soft
mud all the work
has been useless
reeves will you carry on
yes sir
those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before theyd hold
it would collapse
under the first train
the pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch
reeves before you get too involved
colonel could we have a cup of tea
i take it we all agree
that if were to avoid disaster
we build a new bridge at the site
picked by reeves 400 yards downstream
let proceed to the next point
i decided to alter
the work quota of our men
alter
ive increased it
from 5 yards of earth moved
to two
im sure it will
meet with your approval
hughes has all the facts
would you take over
ive done a time study
of the entire project
you see the available forces
have been badly distributed
id urge we revise the
organization of the working parties
just a moment colonel it would save
time if we could work during dinner
would it be possible
to have dinner
of course
carry on
yes sir
if we increase the squads
and specialize their functions
lm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30%
now colonel saito
i have one more point
now there another important
decisin that cant be postponed
as the british
will work on the bridge
only a few will be available
for railway work
i must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang
so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible
i have already given the order
we must fix the daily work quota
for your men
i thought to set it at 5 yards
so as not to overtire them
but isnt it best
to be the same as ours
that would also create a healthy
competitive spirit
i have already given the order
well try to surpass that
wont we hughes
i think that completes
the agenda for tonight
thank you colonel saito
for your kind attention
are there any other questions
one question
can you finish the bridge in time
frankly the consensus of opinion
is that it impossible
but well certainly give it a go
dont forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement
for which i was not to blame
is there anything else
no
thank you the meeting is closed
good night
good night
i hope these japanese appreciate
what were doing for them
for now im not concerned
with their appreciation
good night clipton
good night sir
by the way i meant to tell you
there are trees here
similar to elm
and the elm piles of london bridge
lasted 600 years
six hundred years reeves
yes sir
six hundred years
that would be quite something
im looking for an american

im terribly sorry sir
youre sorry
so am i
i thought you were the enemy
im american if that what you mean
thatll be all joyce
yes sir sorry sir
what can i do for you
im going to see major warden
ill show you the way hell finish
his lecture any moment now
that the end of his lecture
thunderous ovation
he believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible
major warden sir
yes
good of you to come
they took care of you
they certainly have
thank you staff
well come along then
col green is looking forward
to meeting you
fascinating place isnt it
didnt know it was a commando school
were trying to discourage the use of
that word such a melodramatic air
what do you do here
sabotage demolition
that line of country
were using pe plastic explosives
it wonderful
that pop was made
with a lump half this size
it twice as powerful as gelignite
at half the weight
it quite harmless
until it detonated
thanks for telling me
it completely waterproof
and actually plastic
you can do what you like with it
this is my place
go ahead
oh im dying for a cup of tea
would you care for one
no thanks
a drink
no thank you
pot of tea for one please peter
very good sir
do you read this
i taught oriental languages
at cambridge before the war
i never congratulated you
on your escape good show
if your sea rescue plane hadnt
spotted me i wouldnt be here
no i suppose not
would you like to see where you were
all right
our information scanty
it based on your report
we think the camp here
do your people have any idea
what happened to col nicholson
he had guts they were about to
shoot him and he didnt bat an eye
if youre about to be shot
there not much you can do
here is the river kwai and here
the village where you were helped
here is the railway
you must be fairly familiar
with this area
no i was out of my head
half the time
the railway starts down here
in singapore malaya
bangkok rangoon their idea
is to drive on through into india
where was i picked up
oh about here
the japanese aim to open the bangkok-
rangoon section by the middle of may
well try to prevent them
it too far for bombers
to carry a load
well have to go smash it
on the ground
how
parachute drop then march
with demolition equipment
through that jungle
our chief problem
is lack of firsthand knowledge
you see none of us have
ever been there
i dont want to discourage
it should be interesting
col green given me the kwai bridge
im taking a team in to blow it up
lucky you
sure you wont have tea
no thanks i dont want to be rude
but ive got a date at 2
lf there are any questions
of course im sorry
well there is only
one question actually
how would you feel about going back
come again
under the circumstances
it a bit much
but you have a unique
knowledge for our purpose
wed love to have you with us
that why you brought me here
to ask me this
well frankly yes
i just got out of there
my escape was a miracle now
you want me to go back ridiculous
this is embarrassing
i dont belong to you
i belong to the american navy
actually col green has taken
the matter up with your people
with my people
your navy turned you over to us
a signal arrived yesterday morning
from the pacific
authorizing your temporary transfer
of duty to force 36
they cant do this
im afraid they have
it was hard to break it to you
but they cant do this to me
i mean it my navy made a mistake
look im not a navy commander
im not even an officer
the whole thing a fake im just
an ordinary swab jockey second class
when the houston sunk i made
it ashore with a real commander
we ran into a japanese patrol
he was killed
i figured it was just
a matter of time till l
so you changed uniforms
with a dead man
i thought officers would get better
treatment in prison camps
but with saito the officers
worked along with the rest
there always the unexpected
isnt there
i kind of got used
to being a commander
so when i arrived
at the hospital
i took a look at the enlisted men
ward and then the officer ward
and i said to myself  let let
it ride along for a while
there were certain advantages
i saw one of them on the beach
that the whole story
the point is you cant use me
you want an officer
an american commander shears
who doesnt exist
when the navy learns the truth
theyll say
ship him home
for impersonating an officer
once that happens ive got it made
got it what
made id like that drink now
ill apply for a medical discharge
ill say i impersonated an officer
because i went crazy in the jungle
im getting worse sometimes
i think im admiral halsey
it quite a clever plan
not only clever it foolproof
if my navy finds out who i am
those orders wont be worth
the paper theyre written on
isnt this your photograph
where did you get this
it took some doing
since your people
couldnt identify you
finally your c-in-c pacific
sent us a copy of your service record
the photograph fingerprints
would you care to have a look
you see weve known about your actual
rank for nearly a week
your navy in an awkward position
in one sense youre a hero
for making an escape
from the jungle
at the same time they cant
bring you home
and give you the navy cross for
impersonating an officer
i suppose that why they were
happy to hand you over
you see
hot potato
as far as your rank is concerned
were fairly informal
about that in force 36
youd have the simulated
rank of major
a simulated major that figures
well
as long as im hooked
i might as well volunteer
good show
oh colonel green sir
this is major shears he volunteered
to go and help me blow up the bridge
really
good show
jolly good show major
get up to sick bay
this foot infected
colonel might think im malingering
im the medical officer
get cracking
will someone tell me why
he wants to build a proper bridge
dont worry about old nick
he knows what he doing
hello clipton
about time you paid us a visit
fine job our chaps are doing
yes how he behaving
he been most reasonable
since we took over
what he thinking
i havent the foggiest
thanks reeves
right sir
what do you think
quite a challenge isnt it
are you convinced that building
this bridge is a good idea
are you serious
yes sir
a good idea take another look
you dont agree morale is high
discipline has been restored
their condition has improved
are they a happier lot
or arent they
they feed better
and they are no longer abused
honestly clipton there are times
when i dont understand you at all
ill try to make myself clear
the fact is what were doing
could be construed as
forgive me sir
collaboration with the enemy
perhaps even treason
were prisoners of war we havent
the right to refuse to work
i understand that sir
but must we work so well
must we do better
than they could themselves
if you had to operate on saito
would you do your best or let him die
would you prefer
we disintegrate in idleness
or have it said
we cant do a proper job
it important to show them they
cant break us in body or in spirit
take a good look clipton
one day the war will be over
i hope that those who use the bridge
in years to come
will remember how it was built
and who built it
not a gang of slaves but soldiers
british soldiers even in captivity
yes sir
youre a fine doctor
but youve a lot to learn
about the army
hold him hold him
use your boot
get your boot in there will you
good morning
what on earth
are you people staring at
get him with your boot
im sorry im late sir
four minutes to be exact
you were in need of medical attention
sir
i was referring to the nurse
very ingenious warden was right
sit down
i asked you here to help us pick
the fourth member of your team
ask mr joyce to come in
yes sir
chapman wants joyce
but i have my doubts
he has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation
ive told you
in this job even when it finished
there always one more thing to do
he the best swimmer in the school
im well aware of your evaluation
the opinion i want is shears
all right at ease
these men are thinking of taking you
for a hike in the jungle
yes sir
you were an accountant in montreal
yes sir not really an accountant
that is i didnt have my charter
exactly what did you do
well sir i just checked columns
and columns of figures
which people had checked
before me
and other people checked them
after i had checked them
sounds a frightful bore
sir it was a bore
how did you wind up here
in 39 i came over to london to enlist
later i volunteered for this work
you volunteered
yes sir see the regular army
go ahead you can be frank
well the regular army reminded me
of my job in civilian life
they dont expect you to think
think about this
are you sure youd be able
to use it in cold blood
i know how to use it
that not what i meant
could you use it in cold blood
could you kill without hesitation
that a question ive asked myself
it worried me quite a bit
and what was the answer
i dont honestly know sir
ive tried to imagine myself
i suppose i find it hard to kid myself
that killing isnt a crime
it an old army problem
well i think that all
thank you joyce
am i to go with the team
well let you know
you see what i mean
well at least he was honest
none of us ever know the answer to
that question until the moment arises
what your opinion shears
well he canadian
that fits with the international
composition of this outfit
if he wants to go
he can take my place
well if youre all agreed on joyce
he yours
i had an air reconnaissance
report on the village
there enough clearing
to make your jump at dusk
youve had parachute training
no sir
blast this is awkward
silly it never occurred to me
well maybe
he right
arrange some practice jumps for him
ill go check right away
all right chapman you can run along
yes sir
well feel like a sniff of air
yes sir
you dont realize what a plum you are
your knowledge of the area
making friends in that village
it almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind
by the way here something thatll
interest you the new l pill
l pill
l for lethal instant painless
much better than the old ones
for capture of course
youre telling me
not to be taken alive
i wouldnt recommend it
if any of you get hurt or wounded the
others will have to leave him behind
the objective comes first in our work
you want my honest evaluation
i didnt want to say in front of them
i understand go ahead
well chapman will be fine
ice water in his veins
joyce is hell be okay
it warden i dont get
oh why not
cambridge don and all of that
it one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers
he not without experience you know
when singapore fell he stayed behind
to blow up a couple of bridges
many other installations
before the japs caught him
fascinating story he
sir it most annoying
in view of time they dont think
practice jumps would be worth it
if you make one jump there
only a 50% chance of injury
two jumps 80% three jumps
youre bound to get your packet
the consensus is the most
sensible thing for shears to do
is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best
with or without parachute
oh very good
with or without
he in the trees
yai says we cant
reach the kwai your way
there are too many japanese patrols
well swing north through heavy jungle
then who going to lead
yai
he hates the japanese
they took all his men
which means we shall have to
use women bearers
women bearers
theyre capable
he says it dangerous
to spend the night here
there an enemy post three miles away
so well have to sleep in the jungle
what about chapman
yai will bury him and his chute
is there something wrong
i was just thinking you speak
yai language i dont
he going to lead you
to the river by a route i never took
will someone tell me why im
so indispensable to this outfit
i know how you feel but there
always the unexpected isnt there
tell that to chapman
let get cracking
youre lovely
lovely
be happy in your work
yes sir
leeches
leeches
she telling you to hold still
shell take the leeches off your back
what a girl like you
doing in a place like this
ill teach you to say that in siamese
no that would spoil it
too much talk always spoils it
what wrong with that thing
it taken an awful beating
i cant get a strong signal
ill tell you it wet mildewed
like everything else in this jungle
you might as well dump it
this is radio tokio signing off
this is your friendliest enemy
reminding you to take it easy
and never volunteer for anything
if we stay well
be up to our necks
ive got it all decoded sir
read it
yes sir one original
bridge works reported abandoned
new construction downstream
from first site
two enemy intends to open railway
with passage of special train
bangkok for rangoon
with troops and vip
estimated to arrive target am 3th
three synchronize demolition
with passage of train
four good hunting have fun
that all
a train and a bridge
can we get there in time sir
yai says were two to three days away
if we set a faster pace we could
make it before sundown on the 2th
it worth it for the train
oh by all means good hunting
good show
jolly good fun jolly good
if you hadnt fixed the radio
we wouldnt know about the train
there always the unexpected
isnt there
half a pint sir
quinine
well well complete this later
clipton were facing a crisis
yes sir
i spoke with reeves and hughes
we cant finish the bridge on time
we havent the manpower
ive asked the officers to help
but that wont do it
the officers are working
i explained the situation and they
volunteered but it not enough
why not ask saito for some men
this is ours well make the most
of our resources
that why i came to talk to you
the sick list
there not a man in this hospital
who doesnt belong there
it no reflection on you but
there are always a few malingerers
keep an open mind that all i ask
come along let see
dont move dont move
what wrong with haskins
amoebic dysentery and black
water fever temperature of 04
right i see
and this man
leg ulcers i may be able to save it
if i do more cutting tonight
want to send him out to work
dont talk rot clipton
that man there
his arm infected
most of their wounds
wont heal properly
i wonder if fresh air and light duties
might do more than being cooped up
light duties
it not our policy to keep a man
just because he scratched his arm
not our policy
a man may not be on top of his form
but he can still be useful
trimmings and finishing jobs
stand easy baker
do you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge
anything you say sir
good show
you nothing difficult
ill try sir
good man
look here men it goes without
saying that im proud of all of you
but were facing a crisis for those
of you who feel up to it
how about lending us a hand
fetch and carry paint here and there
what do you say
yes sir
good show come on follow me
ten minutes
make sure theyre all dead
come on joyce
use your knife
or well be shooting each other
go that way joyce
i could have done it
i was ready
are you hit sir
let go
it superficial maybe a chipped
bone but nothing broken
it my fault sir
oh shut up
i can walk on it
that all that counts
yeah but how far and how fast
we wont know that
till ive tried it will we
what are you doing
i didnt give orders for a halt
we all need it
were still five hours fast march
from the objective
maybe six
come on
if you keep walking
youll bleed to death
youre going to leave me here
lf you stop we stop
you cant study the layout
of the bridge after dark
youve got to get there
before sundown
but sir when the job done who
knows if we can return by this route
or whether we could find you
if we did
if you were me i wouldnt hesitate
to leave you and you know that
he doesnt know but i do
youd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it
youll go on without me
that an order
youre in command now shears
i wont obey that order
your heroics make me sick
you carry the stench of death
like the plague
explosives and l-pills
go well together
it one thing or the other
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself
this is just a game this war
you and that colonel nicholson
youre crazy with courage for what
how to die like a gentleman
how to die by the rules
when the only important thing
is how to live like a human being
im not gonna leave you
here to die warden
because i dont care about
your bridge or about your rules
if we go on we go on together
good old yai
all right
come on
let get closer
still sorry we brought you along
feeling better
yeah
youre in command again you know
thank you major
i cant understand it
it such a solid well-designed job
not like the bridges
the enemy usually throws together
look
those poor devils down there
imagine being forced to build that
in the condition they must be in
theyve got a british officer
working on his knees
the japanese seem
to be enjoying it too
if he knew we were here
it might boost his morale
if not for the train we could
set a time fuse and be miles away
since we dont know
what time itll cross tomorrow
well have to do the job manually
well set the charges
against the piles
about three feet underwater
i should think
and run the main wire
downstream to the plunger
the problem is where to hide it
our side of the river is
obviously used by the japanese
theyd spot it at once
look do you see
those fallen tree trunks
and the grey rock just below them
on that little beach
yes sir i see them
that our key position
the wrong side of the river
but it the only hiding place
within feasible distance
as soon as the bridge goes up
whoever there
will have to swim back
it wont be a pleasant swim
sir i was the best swimmer
in my course
it looks like
your line of country then
thank you
shears pick a spot on our side
of the bank where you can cover joyce
yai will be with you
so you can occupy the nips
if they make trouble for joyce
on the theory that
there always one more thing
lll set up the mortar here
to create an additional diversin
perhaps i might even take
a few potshots at the train
all clear
any questions right youll
start as soon as it dark
theyre sure to have
sentries on the bridge
so youll have to float
the stuff down from upriver
which means building a raft
yai
yai will take three women to help you
one will stay here with me
all right get cracking
you know if it wasnt for my ankle
id take joyce assignment
you think hell be all right
i think so want me to handle it
id let you stay up here
with the mortar if i could
im sorry
when it over i hope
you get that medical discharge
and not the hard way
thanks
load
beautiful
yes beautiful
a first-rate job
i had no idea it would
turn out so well
yes a beautiful creation
ive been thinking
tomorrow it will be 28 years to
the day that ive been in the service
twenty-eight years in peace and war
i havent been at home more
than ten months in all that time
still it been a good life
i love india
i wouldnt have had it any other way
but there are times
suddenly you realize you are
nearer the end than the beginning
and you wonder
you ask yourself
what the sum total
of your life represents
what difference your being there
at any time made to anything
or if it made any difference
at all really
particularly in comparison
with other men careers
i dont know if that
kind of thinking healthy
but i must admit ive had
some thoughts on those lines
from time to time
but tonight
tonight
blast
i must be off
the men are preparing
some sort of entertainment
lovely
if you were the only
girl in the worid
and you were the only boy
nothing else would matter
in the worid today
we could go on loving
in the same old way
a garden of eden just made for two
im sure i speak for all of us
when i say this has been
a most enjoyable evening
most of you move on tomorrow
to a new camp and new construction
it a pity you wont see the first
practical use of this bridge
youll be glad to know
that the completion
of this link in the railway
will enable us to transport
the sick and disabled
to the new camp by train
colonel saito has kindly
permitted me to stay behind
with major clipton
and the sick men
and well rejoin you
in a few days time
now that your work here is finished
i suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down
that quite understandable
it a very natural reaction
but one day in a week
a month a year
on that day when god willing
we all return to our homes again
youre going to feel very proud
of what youve achieved here
in the face of great adversity
what you have done should be
and i think will be
an example to all our countrymen
soldier and civilian alike
you have survived with honour
that and more
here in the wilderness
you have turned defeat
into victory
i congratulate you
well done
to the king
youre in business
now you got everything stem
ammunition pack canteen knife
ill be directly across the river
the professor says there
always one more thing to do
i cant think of what it could be
except to wish you
a long and happy life
thank you
what happened
the river gone down
you can see the wire
the charges
dont wait for the train
do it now
if saito is correct the train
will arrive in 5 or 0 minutes
if you dont mind
ill watch from up on the hill
why it better from the bridge
it hard to explain sir
id rather not be a part of it
as you please honestly sometimes
i dont understand you at all
as you once said sir ive got
a lot to learn about the army
good morning
river gone down in the night
what he doing
colonel there something
rather odd going on
i think we better have a look around
before that train comes across
he gone mad
he leading him right to it
our own man
i was right there is
something going on
youve got to do it boy
youve got to do it now
have you a knife i just realized
the bridge has been mined
mined
good boy
british officer
here to blow up the bridge
blow up the bridge
yes sir british commando orders
