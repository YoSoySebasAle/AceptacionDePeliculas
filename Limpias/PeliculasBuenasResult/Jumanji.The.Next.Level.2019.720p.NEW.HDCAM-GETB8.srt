nigel were looking
for someone
has anyone arrived
in jumanji
jumanji is in great peril
it all detailed in the letter

read it aloud
grandpa eddie
do you have a letter
do i have a letter
check your pockets
why would i have a letter
nigel here
wrote you a letter
i didnt get a letter
from this guy
but we are
in a video game and
were in a video game
were gonna die
we did die
are we in hell
i knew it
oh my god
it detailed
in the letter i sent you
dr bravestone
you should read it aloud
i dont have a letter how many
times i gotta tell you that
oh no eddie
it in your hand
where did this come from
you got to pay attention
to what in your hand
perhaps you should
read it aloud
dr bravestone
it is my solemn hope
that this letter finds you
for again
jumanji is in grave danger
we need your help at once
whoa what going on here
it a cutscene
it how we find
ill explain afterwards
you see our worst nightmare
has come to pass
for jurgen the brutal
has returned
indeed that most vicious
jumanjian conqueror is back
and he brought with him
his savage horde
they descended from their
fortress atop mount zhatmire
and made their way south
to the avian province
home of the sacred
falcon jewel
worn around the neck
of the village elder
the falcon is
the fertility jewel of jumanji
and it has been guarded
by the people
of the avian province
for hundreds of years
so long as the jewel
can see the sun
the waters will flow
and the land will flourish
yeah
many brave souls died that day
but jurgen got
what he came for
he stowed the jewel
in darkness
hidden from the sun
a drought befell the land
the crops dried out and died
and if the jewel
is not returned soon
it may be too late
which is why we called for you
and your brilliant associates
i understand
the enormous weight
that this must carry for you
dr bravestone
how this adventure
is like no other
since it was jurgen the brutal
who killed your parents
no no no no
huh
he killed
dr bravestone parents
indeed he did
when the doctor was just a boy
oh well that terrible
i cant say this enough
were in a video game
you must recover the jewel
from jurgen the brutal
and show it to the sun
he making his way north
across the desert now
jurgen the brutal
is that barbara boy
and remember the goal
is to recover the loot
to wrest it from
the hands of the brute
and if you wish
to leave the game
you must save jumanji
and call out its name
excuse me who is jumanji
well if i was listening
correctly that is her sister
here your map
find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit
huh
i cant land here
so youre going
to have to drop in
what
no no nigel
ill get as low as i can
hold on
get ready
what do you mean
we dont have parachutes
shouldnt we have ahh
what the hell
good luck
the future of jumanji
is in your hands
why did we take a plane
if there nowhere to land
and go
