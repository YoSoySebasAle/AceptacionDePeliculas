but it is an ingenious solution
and a final one
no
ali his cousin laid there to die for him
who are we fighting
they cannot go far all the tracks are watched
we must take to the desert
bakka will give 00 camels to the man
who brings back muhammad
or his head
look for 3 of them
muhammad abu bakr and uriqat the bidune guide
what is it
these are drains of camel
maybe two days that from the city
why are you here
medina is to the north
they made the tracks not i
know much traveling west
i know my art
they say that you can track a bird by smelling the air
we go with him
he may be in that cave over there
muhammad if you come out we will
take you to mecca alive
muhammad come out
they cannot be in there
this web is unbroken
and these pigeons
they would not build
we were wrong to follow them
we should have gone north
let move then
we still have time to head them off
a few threads of a spider web
was all that was then
between muhammad and murder
but he was a man not to be killed
the bidune guide led him
and his companion abu bakr in their escape
through untracked spaces of the desert
and the heat of the june days
at medina his followers waited with their welcome ready
but in great fear for his journey
anything no nothing
this shows that he is only a man
no man can survive that heat
there i see them look
run and hide i might be obliged
to free you as a gesture
welcome to the city of medina the blessed
your city the messenger of god
you will stay with me messenger of god
i have the best house in medina
youll give me the honor of keeping you
stay with me
please please please how can the prophet
choose between so many welcomes
where god guides his camel to stop
there he will build his house
all agreed
we turn quaswa his camel loose
and where quaswa sits the prophet stays
clever man
a choice made by camel
can offend no one
here we will build the house of the prophet
and our first meeting place
a prayer house
the first mosque of islam here
god is great
god is great
what got the prophet to start doing it
carrying bricks
give me that look you are doing too much
please go and sit down we will do it
look he went for more
work is a worship he says
he 53 years old
how old are you
there is something missing
maybe a bell to call people in
the christians use a bell
what about a horn like the jews
a drum
there too much blood in a drum
why not the human voice
as in omar bin kattab vision
the prophet agrees
he means you bilal
me
you have a good voice use it
climb up there
brothers today a man of medina
will embrace a man of mecca
each will share half and half
reach out embrace your neighbor and brother
im tired of the politics of kissing slaves
read this
the prophet should concern himself with the after-world
what is my son
praying like a horse
does it burn your hands
it not upon us to burn down the house
he making laws like a king
he declared that loyalty to islam
is more than loyalty to tribal family
what
all muslims are next of kin to one-another
dont be mislead by that
they must change the nature of the tribes before that
the danger is here the quality
a man neighbour is as good as himself
the lunatic means it
jews and christians
have equal rights with muslims
the jews who attach themselves to a common wealth
will be protected
women have rights of inheritance rights
next he will be giving the camel rights
he has the lunatic has
you cant overload them
he remaking a city my city
damn him
he taken our sons from us he took the children our future from us
his rights are wrongs
no more
this time there will not be any regret
it will take everything of value they left in mecca
their rugs their houses their silver
and with it large of caravans to damascus
my friends listen to me
i have news from mecca
everything you have left behind is gone
the thieves abu bakr shops
the prophet house sold
every cup or piece of cloth
every rag or bone
you ever owned is thrown on the market
you are a people of nothing
dont you even fight for what you own
who talks of the fight
what other way is there hamza
when the prophet says fight
we fight now he says peace
exactly
you are a peace loving people
up to your necks and fore bearers
go back to work
we have to defend ourselves
you are the messenger of god
yet they mock abuse and plunder us and we do nothing
in the pathage of war we are pathetic
but they are led by greed we are
led by god and you
i know how you hate the sword but
we have to fight
theyve stolen our property they are taking it to damascus
right past our own door our door
i say by god turn back
im sorry i got carried away
its pounding in my head
please fight them
but look at the sun
it not the time of prayer
it is newly revealed by god to his messenger
fight but fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you
drive them out of the places from where they drove you out
for persecution is worse than slaughter
fight them until persecution is no more
and religion is god
but if they stop let there be no more war
for god never loves the slaughters of wars
so fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you
god is great
god is great
god is great
god is great
these are the disciplines that the prophet
puts upon you
you may not harm a woman a child or any old person
you may not harm cripples
you may not harm the man that works in the field
you may not cut down trees
strike only at those who have expelled you
who have stolen your rights and
riched themselves with your possession
now to the wells of badr
news from medina
arms arm yourself arm yourself
defend your wealth
muhammad has come out of medina to attack the great caravan

you are not to rob or try to perish this
and if a rogue does cut him loose
i said cut them loose
and give them water
and share your food equal mouth-fulls
and if they walk walk beside them
any prisoner who can teach 0 muslims
to read will go free
why dont they go away
because they blame me hind
whatever it is good or bad
i should have joined them
and drown in the wells of bitter with them
but i saved the caravan and our future with it
