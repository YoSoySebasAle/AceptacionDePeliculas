death is often a bittersweet occasion
to us catholics
« bitter in the pain
sweet in the salvation »
bitter in the pain it causes the deceased
and their families
« sweet to those of us
who know the salvation that awaits
and some may ask what is death
« is it the end »
or is it the beginning
and what is life
what is this thing we call life
« all these questions can frustrate you »
ashley stop it
« that why you have
to turn to the lord »
jesus
« because the lord is the sweetness »

right out of the rookie
preacher handbook
i dont know about that i think
death is bittersweet
sort of bitter in its pain
but sweet in its salvation
that what you know about life and death
and it pathetic
what do you know mr kowalski
i know a lot
i lived for almost three years
in korea with it
thanks
we shot men
stabbed them with bayonets
hacked 7-year-old to death with shovels
stuff ill remember till the day i die
horrible things
but things ill live with
and what about life
well i survived the war
got married had a family

about death than you do living

why cant you just leave me alone
we brought you some shallots
to plant
i dont want them
theyre perennials
they come back every year
why are you bringing me
all this garbage
because
because you saved thao
i didnt save anybody
i just
i kept a bunch of jabbering gooks
off of my lawn that all
youre a hero to the neighborhood
im not a hero
they think you are
that why they keep bringing you gifts
please take them
theyre wrong
now i just want to be left alone
thank you
wait
this is my mom vu im sue
and that my brother thao
we live next door
so
thao wants to say something
im sorry
sorry for what
for trying to steal your car
let me tell you something boy
you step on this property again
youre done
good afternoon walt
i told you im not going to confession
why didnt you just call the police
what
i do work
with some of the hmong gangs
and i heard there was trouble
in the neighborhood
why didnt you call the police
well
you know i prayed
that they would show up
but nobody answered
what were you thinking
someone could have been killed
were talking life and death here
when things go wrong
you gotta act quickly
when we were in korea and a thousand
screaming gooks came across our line
we didnt call the police we reacted
were not in korea mr kowalski
ive been thinking about our conversation
on life and death
about what you said
about how you carry around
all the horrible things
you were forced to do
horrible things that wont leave you
it seems it would do you good
to unload some of that burden
things done during war are terrible
being ordered to kill
killing to save yourself
killing to save others
youre right
those are things i know nothing about
but i do know about forgiveness
and ive seen a lot of men
who have confessed their sins
admitted their guilt
and left their burdens behind them
stronger men than you
men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things
and are now at peace
well i gotta hand it to you < padre >
you came here
with your guns loaded this time
thank you
and youre right about one thing
about stronger men than me
reaching their salvation
well halle-fucking-lujah
but youre wrong about something else
what that mr kowalski
the thing that haunts a man the most
is what he isnt ordered to do
there
you finally look like a human being again
you shouldnt wait so long between
haircuts you cheap son of a bitch
yeah well im surprised
youre still around
i was always hoping youd die
and theyd get somebody
who knew what they were doing
instead you just keep hanging around
like the doo-wop dago you are
thatll be 0 bucks walt
ten bucks jesus christ martin
what are you half jew or something
you keep raising the prices
it been 0 bucks for
the last five years
you hard-nosed polack son of a bitch
yeah well keep the change
see you in three weeks prick

here you go
well what is it
it a gopher
so you can reach stuff
you know it makes things a lot easier
this is from me
it a phone
oh i can see that
i just thought
well we thought
that it would make things easier
well thank you karen
there nothing wrong with making things
less hard on yourself
karen right dad youve worked hard
your whole life
maybe it time
you started thinking about
you know taking it easier
jeez that another thing dad
you really should get rid
of the coffin nails
but i dont know we were thinking
about the house
you know what with mom gone
it gotta be a lot to maintain
around here
mm-hm
let alone clean
and i dont know youre here all alone
yeah and there are
these great places now
you know these communities
where you dont have to worry
about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow
where the people are like you
active and alert but are alone
and would benefit from being
around folks their own age
yeah dad look you gotta check it out
weve brought some brochures
these places are nothing like
what youd think theyd be
theyre great
no no beautiful
theyre really nice they really are
these are top-notch like resorts
it like staying in a hotel practically
theyre beautiful
they really are
yeah
they take care of everything
theyll clean up theyre really nice
they have wonderful stores
you can buy new shoes
theyre amazing they really are
youd have a good time
play some golf maybe
meet other people
son of a bitch
kicking us out on his birthday
how about that daisy
he wont let anybody help him
well we tried can we just drop it
no one can say we didnt try
the hell with him
you know what we shouldve done
we shouldve stayed home
with josh and ashley
at least they were smart enough
to not come
goddamn kids have more sense
than we do
we miss mama dont we daisy
yeah
yeah
« hey walt »
what are you up to
were having a barbecue
you wanna come over
what do you think
there tons of food
yeah just keep your hands off my dog
no worries we only eat cats
really
no im kidding you moron
come on you can be my special guest
no im fine right here
yeah
son of a bitch
okay so what have you had to eat today
oh i had a piece of cake
and a little beef jerky
come on over and get something to eat
weve got beer too
well i might as well drink with strangers
rather than drink alone
after all it is my birthday
really happy birthday wally
dont call me wally
well no pabst but plenty of beer
as they say when in humong
ha ha hey what am i doing wrong
every time i look at somebody
they look at the ground
youre fine
what she saying
she said welcome to her home
oh no she not
yeah no she didnt
she hates me come on
yeah she hates you
okay hey
hey what are all you fish heads
looking at anyway
i think we should go
into the other room sorry
a lot of people in this house
are very traditional
number one never touch a hmong person
on their head not even a child
hmong people believe that the soul
resides on the head so dont do that
well sounds dumb but fine
yeah and a lot of hmong people consider
looking someone in the eye
to be very rude
that why they look away
when you look at them
anything else
yeah
some hmong people tend to smile or grin
when theyre yelled at
it a cultural thing
it expresses embarrassment or insecurity
it not that theyre laughing at you
or anything
yeah god you people are nuts
but the food does look good
smells good too
well of course it hmong food
yeah okay
can i come back for seconds
here you go
thanks
you know you mentioned

to buy all this stuff
well i guess even a bonehead
like you could understand
that a man acquires this
over a period of 50 years
yeah but
all right look here
take these three items right here
you can have this
wd-40 vise grips and some duct tape
any man worth his salt

walt kowalski once said to me
that i didnt know anything
about life or death
because i was an
« over-educated 27-year-old virgin »
« who held the hands of superstitious old
women and promised them eternity »
walt definitely had no problem
calling it like he saw it
« but he was right »
« i knew really nothing about life or
death until i got to know walt »
and boy did i learn
and i wanna leave my house to the church
because dorothy wouldve liked it
now which brings us to our last item
and again
please excuse the language
in mr kowalski will
im simply reading it
the way it was written
and id like to leave
my 972 gran torino to
« my friend »
thao vang lor
«  on the condition that
you dont chop-top the roof »
« like one of those beaners »
« dont paint any idiotic flames on it
like some white-trash hillbilly »
« and dont put a big gay spoiler
on the rear end »
« like you see
on all the other zipperheads cars »
« it just looks like hell »
« if you can refrain
from doing any of that »
« it yours »
