scraping from above
scraping
clattering
goddamn it
jesus
scraping
yells
karl
there nothing
oh karl
jesus christ karl dont do that
very sorry but you see no rats
no rats thanks a lot that terrific
bell ringing
oh my god
laughing
nurse
okay unroll your fist
arm up
very good that wasnt so bad was it
remain perfectly still breathe normally
doctor
tell me if you feel a vibration
regan
you feel anything
can you feel this
i dont feel anything
put this in your mouth
keep it there
this tells your temperature
when the red light goes on
that your temperature
i dont want it
regan humming
a disorder of the nerves
at least we think it is
we dont know yet exactly how it works
it often seen in early adolescence
she shows all the symptoms
hyperactivity
her temper
performance in math
chris
yeah why the math what is that
it affects her concentration
chris
ah-ha
now this is for ritalin
okay
ten milligrams a day
is that a tranquilizer
it a stimulant
a stimulant my god
she higher than a kite now
her condition isnt quite what it seems
nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic
behavior in a child
the ritalin seems to work
to relieve the condition
and as to how or why
we really dont know
but uh her symptoms could be
overreaction to depression
that out of my field
my daughter isnt depressed
well you mentioned her father
and the separation
you think i should take her
to a psychiatrist
no i think we should wait
and see what happens with the ritalin
i think that the answer
okay
let wait two three weeks
all right and the lies she been telling
that part of it huh
lies
like saying her bed shaking that stuff
have you ever known your daughter
to swear
to use obscenities
no never
hmm interesting
similar-similar to things like her lying
it uncharacteristic for her
i dont understand she doesnt swear
well she let loose quite a string
while i was examining her mrs macneil
i find that hard to believe
what did she say
her vocabulary is rather extensive
well give me an example like what
specifically what did she say
specifically mrs macneil
she advised me to keep my fingers
away from her
goddamn cunt
i cant believe it
laughs
she--
you dont think a psychiatrist
no i think the best explanation
is always the simplest
well well wait well wait and see
yeah
so in the meantime
try not to worry
how
the edema affected her brain
you understand
she dont let no doctor come near her
she was all the time screaming
talking to the radio
you shouldve called me when it happened
listen
regular hospital not gonna
put up with that
we give her a shot and bring her here
until the doctors fix up her leg
then we take her right out
two or three months and she out
good as new
miss
yes
we want to see mrs karras
do you have an appointment

karras moans
inaudible dialogue
screaming
i dont want it
regan honey it to help you
i dont want it
hold still honey
i dont want it
you fucking bastard
remember also o lord
thy servant mary karras
who has gone before us with the sign of
faith and sleeps the sleep of peace
all
lord i am not worthy to receive you
but only say the word
and i shall be healed
may the body of christ bring me
to everlasting life
well it a symptom
of a type of disturbance in
the chemical-electrical activity of the brain
in your daughter case the temporal lobe
up here in the lateral part of the brain
mm-hm
it rare
but it does cause bizarre
hallucinations
and usually just before a convulsion
a convulsion
the shaking of the bed
that doubtless due to muscular spasms
oh no no that was no spasm
look i got on the bed
the whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor
and shaking the whole thing
with me on it
mrs macneil the problem
with your daughter is not her bed
it her brain
so um ahem what causes this
lesion lesion in the temporal lobe
it a kind of seizure disorder
look doc i really dont understand how
her whole personality could change
in the temporal lobe it very common
it is
it uh can last for days even weeks
it isnt rare to find destructive
even criminal behavior
hey do me a favor will you
tell me something good
dont be alarmed if it a lesion
in a way she fortunate
all we have to do is remove the scar
let move her
man regan can you sit up scoot over
a little more
good
regan im just gonna move you down
on the table okay
nurse
let me do this
it okay
see there we go
man
it just for a short time
nurse
youre doing fine
man
very sticky
good now regan youre gonna feel
something a little bit cold and wet
okay now youre gonna feel
a little stick here dont move
grunts
good
okay youre gonna feel
some pressure here now dont move
gasps
groaning
man
hook up
machine clanging
gasps
doctor
there nothing there
no vascular displacement at all
do you want me to run another series
i dont think so
id like you to see her again
excuse me doctor
chris macneil is on the phone
she says it urgent
you got some time
of course
doorbell buzzing
regan screaming
dr klein
yes im dr klein
this is dr taney
how do you do
things have gotten worse since i phoned
come upstairs
is she having spasms again
theyve gotten violent
did you give her the medication
yes
what was that
thorazine
before that it was ritalin
regan screaming
chris doctors
this is dr taney
regan mother please
chris what is it
please make it stop
it burning it burning
chris
do something doctor please help her
please mother make it stop
he trying to kill me
mother mother
growling
groans
all right regan
let see what the trouble--
chris
regan
in demonic voice
keep away the sow is mine
fuck me fuck me fuck me
screaming
screams
regan
stay away from me stay away
taney
hold her steady hold her tight
regan
dont let them
crying
regan screaming
she heavily sedated
shell probably sleep through tomorrow
what was going on in there
how could she fly off the bed like that
pathological states can induce
abnormal strength
accelerated motor performance
for example
say a 90-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck
runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground
youve heard the story same thing here
same principle i mean
so what wrong with her
we still think that the temporal lobe--
oh what are you talking about
for christ sakes
did you see her or not
she acting like she fucking
out of her mind
psychotic like a split personality or
oh jesus im sorry
there havent been more than
00 authentic cases
of so-called split personality
mrs macneil
now i know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry
but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first
so what next
a pneumoencephalogram
i would think to pin down that lesion
it will involve another spinal
oh christ
well what we missed in the eeg
and the arteriograms
could conceivably turn up there
at least it would eliminate certain
other possibilities
groaning
klein
dr taney says the x-rays are negative
in other words normal
you keep any drugs in your house
no of course not nothing like that
are you sure
well of course im sure
id tell you
christ i dont even smoke grass
are you planning to be home soon
i mean uh to la i mean
um
no i uh--
im building a new house
my old one has been sold
i dont know
i was gonna take
i was gonna take regan to europe
for a while after she finished school
why do you ask
i think it time we started looking
for a psychiatrist
siren wailing
phone ringing
hello
sharon
shit
god
sharon
what do you mean
leaving regan by herself
doorbell buzzing
her window wide open
the room is freezing
didnt he tell you
who
burke is--
what burke got to do with it
nobody was here
when i went to get the thorazine
i had him stay with her and
oh
i should have known better sorry
i guess you should have
how were the tests
we have to start looking for a shrink
hi chuck come on in
i suppose you heard
heard what
you havent heard
burke dead
he must have been drunk he fell from
the top of the steps right outside
by the time he hit m street
he broke his neck
chris
oh god
sobs
no
yeah i know
crying
sharon--
oh my god
screaming
oh my god
psychiatrist when i touch
your forehead open your eyes
are you comfortable regan
yes
how old are you
twelve
is there someone inside you
sometimes
who is it
i dont know
is it captain howdy
i dont know
if i ask him to tell me
will you let him answer
no
psychiatrist
why not
im afraid
psychiatrist
if he talks to me i think hell leave you
do you want him to leave you
yes
im speaking to the person
inside of regan now
if you are there you too are hypnotized
and must answer all my questions
come forward
and answer me now
chris gasps
regan growling
coughing
are you the person inside of regan
who are you
growls
screaming
help me
klein let go
screaming
father karras
have we met
no we havent met
but they said i could tell
that you look like a boxer
william f kinderman homicide
what this all about
it true you do look like a boxer
like john garfield in body and soul
exactly john garfield
people tell you that father
do people tell you
you look like paul newman
always
well you know this director
who was doing the film here
burke dennings
ive seen him
youve seen him
youre also familiar how last week
he died
only what i read in the papers
father what do you know on
the subject of witchcraft
from the witching end not the hunting
i once did a paper on it
really
from the psychiatric end
i know i read it
all of this desecration in the church
do you think this has anything to do
with witchcraft
maybe some rituals used in
the black mass maybe
and now dennings
you read how he died
in a fall
let me tell you how
and please father
confidential
burke dennings good father
was found at the bottom of those steps
leading to m street
with his head turned completely
around
facing backwards
didnt happen in the fall
it possible
possible however--
unlikely
exactly
so on the one hand
weve got a witchcraft kind of murder
and on the other hand a black mass-type
desecration in the church
you think the killer
and the desecrator are the same
maybe somebody crazy
somebody with a spite against
the church
some unconscious rebellion
karras
a sick priest is that it
look father this is hard for you
please i understand
but for priests on the campus here
youre the psychiatrist
youd know who was sick at the time
who wasnt
i mean this kind of sickness
youd know that
i dont know anyone who fits
that description
ah
doctor ethics
if you knew you wouldnt tell huh
no i probably wouldnt
not to bother you with trivia
but a psychiatrist
in sunny california no less
was put in jail for not telling the police
what he knew about a patient
is that a threat
no i mention it only in passing
incidentally
i mention it only in passing
i could always tell the judge it was
a matter of confession
chuckling
hey father wait a minute
do you like movies
very much
well i get passes
to the best shows in town
mrs k though you know
she gets tired never likes to go
that too bad
yeah i hate to go alone
i love to talk film
discuss to critique
you want to see a film with me
i got passes to the crest it othello
who in it
who in it
debbie reynolds desdemona
and othello groucho marx you happy
ive seen it
ah
one last time you can think
of some priest who fits the bill
come on
no answer the question father paranoia
all right all right
you know who i think really did it
who
the dominicans go pick on them
i could have you deported
you know that
i lied
you look like sal mineo
barringer it looks like a type of disorder
that uh rarely ever seen anymore
except in primitive cultures
we call it uh
somnambular-form possession
quite frankly we really dont know
much about it at all
except that it starts with a conflict
or a guilt
and it leads to the patient delusions
that his body has been invaded
by some alien intelligence um
a spirit if you will
look im telling you again
and youd better believe me
i am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum
well it out of--
and i dont care what you call it
im not putting her away
well im sorry
youre sorry jesus christ
eighty-eight doctors and all you can
tell me with all your bullshit is
of course there is one outside chance
for a cure
but um i think of it
as a shock treatment
as i said it a very outside chance--
would you just name it for god sakes
what is it
do you have any religious beliefs
chris no
what about your daughter
no why
have you ever heard of exorcism
well it a stylized ritual
in which the uh rabbi or the priest try
to drive out the so-called invading spirit
it been pretty much discarded
these days
except by the catholics who keep it
in the closet as a sort of embarrassment
but it uh has worked in fact
although not for the reasons they think
of course
it purely force of suggestion
the uh-the victim belief in possession
is what helped cause it
so in that same way
the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear
youre telling me that i should
take my daughter to a witch doctor
is that it
karl
did you put this in regan bedroom
she going to be well
karl if you put this in regan bedroom
i want you to tell me now did you
no not me
i didnt
this was under regan pillow
did you put it there
of course i didnt
i didnt put it
knocking on door
karl excuse me madam
what
a man to see you
chris what man
kinderman
might your daughter remember perhaps
if mr dennings was in her room
that night
why do you ask
mm
might she remember
no she was heavily sedated
it serious
yes im afraid it is
may i ask
we still dont know
watch out for drafts
a draft in the fall when the house is hot
is a magic carpet for bacteria
excuse me madam anything else
no karl were fine thank you
it all right karl
why are you asking all this
it strange
the deceased comes to visit
stays only 20 minutes
and leaves all alone a very sick girl
and speaking plainly mrs macneil
it isnt likely he would fall
from a window
besides a fall wouldnt do to his neck
what we found
except maybe one chance in a thousand
no my hunch
my opinion
he was killed by a very powerful man
point one
and the fracturing of his skull point two
plus the various other things
we mentioned
would make it very probable
probable not certain
that the deceased was killed and
then pushed from your daughter window
but nobody was in the room
except your daughter so how can this be
it could be one way
if someone came calling
between the time miss spencer left
and the time you returned
judas priest just a second
the servants they have visitors
not at all
you were expecting a package that day
some delivery
not that i know of
groceries cleaning uh a package
i really wouldnt know
see karl takes care of all that
i see
would you like to ask him
no never mind it
it very remote
no never mind
yeah
would you like some more coffee
please
chuckles
that cute
your daughter she the artist
thank you
youre welcome
incidentally um
you might ask your daughter
if she remembers seeing mr dennings
in her room that night
look he wouldnt have any reason
in the world to go up to her room
oh i know i realize
but if certain british doctors never asked
what is this fungus
we wouldnt today have penicillin
correct
well when she better ill ask her
yeah couldnt hurt
okay
uh in the meantime
that okay
i really hate to ask you this but--
what
for my daughter
could you please give an autograph
of course uh where a pencil
right here here
oh
shed love it
and what her name
i lied it for me
chris chuckles
the spelling is on the back kinderman
okay
you know that film you made um angel
oh yeah
i saw that six times
really
it was beautiful
ha ha thank you
youre a very nice lady
thank you
youre a nice man
uh ill come back
when she feeling better
bye
bye
regan
please no
demonic voice do it

demonic voice
you bitch do it do it
regan
please no
screaming
regan in demonic voice
yes let jesus fuck you
let jesus fuck you let him fuck you
both grunting
aah
give it give it to me aah
ugh
lick me lick me
coughs
grunts
screams
sharon
chris
mrs macneil open the door
banging on door
open the door
as burke
do you know what she did
your cunting daughter
screaming
chris macneil
please go away
im father karras
im very sorry hello
i should have told you
i wouldnt be in uniform
yeah that would have helped
have you got a cigarette father
sure
thanks
cold
yeah
uh--
how did a shrink ever get to be a priest
it the other way around the society
sent me through medical school
oh
where
harvard bellevue johns hopkins
places like that
i see
youre a friend of father dyer right
yes i am
pretty close
pretty close
did he talk to you about my party
he sure did
about my daughter
no i didnt know you had one
he didnt mention her
no
oh
didnt tell you what she did
he didnt mention her
priests are pretty tight-mouthed
then huh
that depends
on what
the priest
sure
i mean what if a person
uh came to you
you know that was a murderer
or criminal of some kind
and they wanted some kind of help
i mean would you have to turn him in
well if he came to me for spiritual advice
id say no
you wouldnt
no i wouldnt
but i would try to convince him
to turn himself in
mm-hm
and uh how do you go about
getting an exorcism
i beg your pardon
if um-if a person you know
possessed by a demon or something
how do they get an exorcism
id have to get them into a time machine
and get them back to the 6th century
i didnt get you
it just doesnt happen anymore
mrs macneil
oh yeah since when
well since we learned about mental illness
paranoia schizophrenia
all those things they taught me
at harvard
mrs macneil
since the day i joined the jesuits
ive never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism not one
yeah well
clears throat
it just so happens that somebody
very close to me
is probably possessed
and needs an exorcist
father karras it my little girl
sobs
then that all the more reason
to forget about exorcism
why i dont understand
to begin with it could make things worse
oh how
secondly the church
before it approves an exorcism
conducts an investigation to see if
it warranted that takes time
yeah but--
meanwhile your daughter--
you could do it yourself
no id need church approval
and that rarely given
but-uh
could you see her
yes i could
i could see her as a psychiatrist but i--
oh not a psychiatrist she needs a priest
she seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world and they sent me to you
now are you gonna send me
back to them
jesus christ wont somebody help me
you dont understand--
oh god cant you help her
just help her
crying
regan groaning
it wants no straps
karras
hello regan
im a friend of your mother
id like to help you
in demonic voice
you might loosen these straps then
im afraid you might hurt yourself
regan
im not regan
i see
well then let introduce ourselves
im damien karras
and im the devil
now kindly undo these straps
if youre the devil
why not make the straps disappear
that much too vulgar a display
of power karras
where regan
in here with us
show me regan
and ill loosen one of the straps
as old man
could you help an old altar boy father
in demonic voice
your mother in here with us karras
would you like to leave a message
ill see that she gets it
if that true
then you must know my mother
maiden name
what is it
roars
yells
coughing
thank you
look im only against the possibility of
doing your daughter more harm than good
nothing you could do
could make it any worse
i cant do it
i need evidence that the church
would accept
as signs of possession
like what
speaking in a language
she never known or studied
what else
i dont know id have to look it up
i thought you were supposed
to be an expert
there are no experts
you probably know as much about
possession as most priests
look your daughter doesnt say
she a demon
she says she the devil himself
if youve seen as many psychotics
as i have
youd realize that the same thing
as saying youre napoleon bonaparte
you asked me what i think is best
for your daughter
six months under observation
in the best hospital you can find
you show me regan double
same face same voice everything
and id know it wasnt regan
id know in my gut
im telling you that that thing upstairs
isnt my daughter
i want you to tell me that you know
for a fact
that there nothing wrong
with my daughter except in her mind
tell me you know for a fact
that an exorcism wouldnt do any good
you tell me that
did regan know a priest was
coming over
no
did you know my mother died recently
yes i did im very sorry
no
is regan aware of it
not at all
why do you ask
it not important good night

he gave the cup to his disciples and said

this is the cup of my blood
the blood of the new and everlasting
covenant the mystery of faith
in demonic voice
what an excellent day for an exorcism

what the difference
holy water blessed and that doesnt
help support a case for possession
she killed burke dennings
what
she killed burke dennings
she pushed him out her window
regan speaking gibberish

i am no one
merrin fear the priest
phone ringing
merrin
yeah
ill be right there
i dont want chris to see this
well what wrong what is it
shh
youre convinced that it genuine
i dont know
no not really i suppose
but i have made
a prudent judgment that it meets
the conditions set down in the ritual
you would want to do the exorcism
yourself
yes
might be best to have a man
with experience
maybe someone who spent time
in foreign missions
i understand your excellency
let see who around
in the meantime
ill call you as soon as i know
thank you your excellency
well he does know the background
i doubt there any danger in just
having him assist
there should be a psychiatrist present
anyway
what about the exorcist
have you any ideas
how about lankester merrin
merrin
i had a notion he was in iraq
i read he was working on a dig
near nineveh
youre right but he finished
he came back three or four months ago
he at woodstock now
what he doing there teaching
he working on another book
dont you think he too old tom
how his health
he must be all right
he still running around digging up tombs
mm
besides he had experience
i didnt know that
ten 2 years ago i think in africa
the exorcism supposedly lasted months
i heard it damn near killed him
father
youre mrs macneil
yes
im father merrin
come in
thank you
is father karras here
yes
he here already
father
father karras
it an honor to meet you father
demonic voice screaming
are you very tired
no
id like you to go quickly across
to the residence damien
and gather up a cassock for myself
two surplices a purple stole
and some holy water
and um
your copy of the roman ritual
the large one
i believe we should begin
do you want to hear the background
of the case first
why
man on radio
this is yours to do with as you please
you can choose to escape if you want
but you may never be able to return
dont let anyone decide for you
regan moaning
hail mary full of grace
praying indistinctly
excuse me
thank you
thank you very much
youre welcome
would you like some brandy in that
father
well the doctors say i shouldnt
but thank god
my will is weak
merrin especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon
we may ask what is relevant
but anything beyond that is dangerous
he a liar the demon is a liar
he will lie to confuse us
but he will also mix lies with the truth
to attack us
the attack is psychological damien
and powerful
so dont listen
remember that do not listen
it might be helpful
if i gave you some background
on the different personalities regan
has manifested
so far id say there seem to be three
she convinced that she--
there is only one
regan moaning
what is your daughter middle name
mrs macneil

from the clutches of the noonday devil
this human being

screaming
