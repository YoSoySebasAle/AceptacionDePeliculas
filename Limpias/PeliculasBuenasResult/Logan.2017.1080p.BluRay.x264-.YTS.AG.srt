if i was to repeat my previous observation
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures
it what the guy gave me
wasnt in a position to make demands
i almost died this morning
that seizure was
it was barely a minute

so get to sniffin
my name is gabriela lópez
i am a nurse
and for 0 years i worked for
transigen research in mexico city
transigen is owned by an american company
what i am about to show you is illegal
in the us and canada
they told us we were part
of a pharmaceutical study
but of course that was a lie
these children were born in transigen
they were born here and have never left
they have never seen the sun
or the ocean rain or snow
or any of god creatures
they have no birth certificates
no names besides the ones
we have given them
they were raised in
the bellies of mexican girls
girls no one can find anymore
their fathers are semillas genéticas
special seeds in bottles
birthday no birth
maría
we do not dress them up for halloween
we do not call them baby or kiss boo-boos
dont think of them as children
think of them as things
with patents and copyrights
comprende
si señor
they thought we were too poor
and stupid to understand
were poor yes
but we are not stupid
use your powers
this is business
they are making soldiers
killers
these are babies of mutantes
north dakota
mmm
you took that woman money
you said you would take the child there
what is she
she your daughter logan
alkali has your genetic code
not just mine
logan
i dont want to talk about it
i dont wanna hear about it anymore
logan
just stop

as the children became older
laura laura
they became more difficult
they could not be controlled
the company made their bodies into weapons
tried to teach them to kill
but they did not want to fight
a soldier who will not fight is useless
inside this building
they are working on something new
something they think is better
than the children
something they say is without a soul
would you like to hear
my full lab report dr rice
you cant get good sushi here
it the mexican equivalent
of denver colorado
they must have been successful
about a week ago they told us
to shut our program down
they started putting the children to sleep
we are going to save
as many children as we can
i read about a place up north
a place for mutants
they call it eden
if you are watching this
it means that i am dead
i am not sure if any other children survived
we were separated
there is no more money
that was a lie
she not my child
but i love her
you may not love her
but she is your child
please i beg you
take her to safety

in a fucking leotard can stop it
this is ice cream for bed-wetters
logan

some grade-a bullshit
i dont think laura needs reminding
of life impermanence
didnt you say something about
finding us a new ride
two more pills in one hour

why shane
a man has to be what he is joey

emergency personnel are still on scene
at harrah casino hotel in oklahoma city
where at least 400 guests were stricken
with temporary paralysis yesterday
many are noting a similarity to the
westchester incident over a year ago
that left over 600 injured
and took the lives of seven mutants
including several of the x-men
knock it off
i said knock it off
she a child logan
and point of fact she your
how long has it been
since you took your meds
tell me how long has it been
i dont know
two days
you saw what happened yesterday
if that shit had gone on any longer
everyone in that casino
i did what i had to do to save laura
you didnt do anything
you just freaked out
and had a fucking seizure
i guess you prefer me
pharmaceutically castrated
rambling on like a lunatic
so much easier for you
easier jesus
there is nothing easy
about you charles nothing
yes yes please be
like the rest of the world
blaming someone else for your boring shit
i know pop im such a giant disappointment
you honestly derive no sense of purpose
from what were doing
okay what are we doing hmm
there is a young mutant sitting in our car
yeah i see that
and where were taking her there are others
does that mean nothing to you
yeah means nothing to me
especially since nurse gabriela
made all that eden shit up
with fucking comic books
what are you talking about
give those to him will you
take out two pills and give them to him
logan logan
give em to him
now

and youre screaming at a machine
oh what she can gut a man with her feet
she cant hear a few naughty words huh
she can learn to be better
you mean better than me
actually yes
and by the way laura foot claws
are the obvious result
of her gender you know
is that a fact
in a pride of lions the female
is both hunter and caregiver
good to know
she uses her front claws for hunting
and the back claws defensively
oh yeah
thus ensuring their survival
hey hey
we should help them

dispensing delayed information

im offering you the possibility
of redemption caliban
to protect the world and in
the process save your friends

small price to pay for that
