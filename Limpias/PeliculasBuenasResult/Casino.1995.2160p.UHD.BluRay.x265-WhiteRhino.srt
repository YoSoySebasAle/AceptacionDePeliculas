
when you love someone
you’ve gotta trust them
there’s no other way
you’ve got to give them the key to everything that’s yours
otherwise what the point
and for a while
i believed that’s the kind oflove i had
fireworks exploding
before i ever ran a casino
or got myself blown up
ace rothstein was a hell of a handicapper
i can tell you that
i was so good
that whenever bet
i could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country
i had it down so cold that i was given paradise on earth
i was given one of the biggest casinos in las vegas to run
the tangiers
by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money
$62 700 000
i dont know all the details
nobody knew all the details
but it should have been perfect
i mean
he had me nicky santoro
his best friend
watching his ass
and he had ginger
the woman he loved on his arm
but in the end
we fucked it all up
it shouldve
been so sweet too
but it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us
were ever given anything
that fucking valuable again
at that time
vegas was a place where millions of suckers
flew in every year
on their own nickel
and left behind
about a billion dollars
but at night
you couldnt see the desert that surrounds las vegas
but it in the desert
where lots of the town 3
problems are solved
got a lot of holes
in the desert
and a lot of problems are
buried in those holes
except you gotta do it right
you gotta have
the hole already dug
before you show
up with a package
otherwise
youre talking about
a half hour or
45 minutes of digging
and who knows
who gonna be coming along
before you know it
you gotta dig a few more holes
you could be there
all fucking night
horns honking
who could resist
anywhere else in the country
i was a bookie a gambler
always looking
over my shoulder
hassled by cops
day and night
but here im mr rothstein
im not only legitimate
but running a casino
and that’s like selling people dreams for cash
i hired an old casino pal
billy sherbert
as my manager
and i went to work
and this is ronnie who takes care of the card room
for guys like me
las vegas washes away your sins
it’s like
a morality car wash
it does for us what lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples
and along with
making us legit
comes cash tons of it
what do you think we’re doing
in the middle of the desert
it all this money
this is the end result of all the bright lights and the comp trips
of all the champagne
and free hotel suites
and all the broads
and all the booze
it all been arranged just for us to get your money
that’s the truth
about las vegas
we re the only winners
the players
dont stand a chance
and their cash
flows from the tables
to our boxes
through the cage
and into the most sacred room
in the casino
the place where they
add up all the money
the holy of holies
the count room
now
this place was off-limits
even i couldnt get inside
but it was myjob
to keep it filled with cash
that’s for sure
they had so much
fucking money in there
you could build
a house out of $00 bills
and the best part was that the board of directors
didnt know what was going on
i mean
to them everything looked on the up-and—up
right wrong
verify $5000
the guys inside
the counting room
were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry
theyd do short counts
theyd lose fill slips
theyd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes
and it was up
to this guy here
standing in front
of about $2 million
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody getting wise
the irs or anybody
notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything
somebody always
looking the other way
look at these guys
they look busy right
theyre counting money
who wants to bother them
god forbid
they should make a mistake and forget to steal
meanwhile
youre in and youre out
past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week
just to watch the door
i mean it routine
business as usual
in out hello goodbye
that’s all there is to it
just another fat fuck walking out ofthe casino with a suitcase
that suitcase was going straight to one place
right to kansas city
which was as
close to las vegas
as the midwest
bosses could go
without getting arrested
that suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted
and they wanted
it every month
now
this old mormon fuck here
he had to fly in with suitcases once a month
nice and easy
something
smells good
they made us
something to eat
the bosses came from
all over the place
detroit
cle veland milwaukee
all over the midwest
and they would meet in this produce market in kansas city
i mean nobody even knew it
one ofthe guys made his mother do all the cooking
you ever see
that jerry steriano
now these old greaseballs might not look it
but believe me
these are the guys who secretly control las vegas
mama that man here again
because they control
the teamsters union
and that’s where
you had to go
if you wanted to borrow
money to buy a casino
nobody got a teamsters loan
unless the guys in this room
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases
guys like this antique over here
out of detroit
or especially guys like remo gaggi
the outfit’s top boss
you got a round figure on it
the most important
guy in this room
about 20 pounds
so
that around $700000
uh-huh good
i know it a little
early for las vegas
but i want to
welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of
the gaming industry
as far as
the world was concerned
andy stone
the head ofthe teamsters pension fund
was a legitimate guy
a powerful man
he even played golf
with the president
on behalf of the teamsters pension fund
it my pleasure
but andy also took orders
and when he was told to give
a loan to philip green
for $62700000
for the new tangiers
he did what he was told
here was
the perfect front man
what else could he be
he didnt want
to know too much
especially that the bosses made the teamsters lend him the money
he believed
the teamsters gave him
that money
cause he was smart
i know full well how much competition we have in this great city
and where they
got green from
who the fuck knows
all i know is that green
was a real estate hustler
who barely had
enough gas money
to pick up his
own fucking check
and it was the bosses man
andy stone who gave all the orders
not the chairman of
the board philip green
i understand i understand
now they needed somebody they could trust to run the casino
and who better than ace
he was already in
vegas a couple years
and he had
the fucking place clocked
but typical ace
give him a shot at running a casino
and he tries
to talk you out of it
i dont know if
i could do this
the gaming commission would never give me a license
i have two dozen gambling
and bookmaking pinches on me
you dont have to have a license to work in a casino
all you gotta do
is apply for one
state law says you
can work in a casino
while theyre
processing your application
they got a 0-year backlog
and when
they do find out
why would they
want to find out
were putting $00
million into this desert
why lock us out
besides
theyll never find out
just keep
changing yourjob title
like from casino executive to food and beverage chairman
they take your application
they put it at the bottom of the pile
i know guys been working there for 30 years dont have a license
sing sing sing playing
it a tough proposition
andy
if i did it
id have to run it my way
you got it
im serious no interference
nobody gonna interfere
with you running the casino
i guarantee it
singing everybody start to sing la-di—da
and that’s how they
gotace to take over
they wanted him because ace ate
slept and breathed gambling
they worked out
a real cute job title too
tangiers public
relations director
but the only thing he ever directed was the casino
he made his first bet when he was 5 and he always made money
but he didnt
bet like you or me
having some fun with it
shit like that
where the hell did
you learn how to deal
he bet like
a fucking brain surgeon
place the checks properly
that the way you do it
he had to know everything
he d find out the inside stuff nobody else knew
and that’s what
hed put his money on
even back home years ago
when we were first hanging out together
hed know if
the quarterback was on coke
ill take columbia for 20
if his
girlfriend was knocked up
he d get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals
he even figured out
the different bounce you got
off different kinds of wood they used on college basketball courts
he d work on this
shit day and night
there was nothing about a game he didnt know
ace got down at six
get me down at six
season after season
the prick was the only winner i ever knew
but he was so
serious about it all
i dont think he
ever enjoyed himself
but that’s just
the way he was
but back then
the bosses didnt give a fuck
about if he enjoyed himself
ornot
to them
he was a cash register
all they had to do was ring the bell and take money
especially remo
who was a fucking degenerate gambler
who always lost
muttering
all those fucking sweeps
i mean
unless ace made his bets
enough now
ace made more money for them on a weekend
than i could do
heisting joints for a month
whatever ace picked up on the street
he told remo
i mean
fixed fights doped horses
crooked fucking zebras
locked-in point spreads
he told fucking
remo everything
and to tell you the truth
i dont blame him
keeping remo
happy with money
was the greatest
insurance policy in the world
son of a bitch
how the hell
did you get oklahoma-michigan
nobody ever had that
how the hell did you do it
that why they paid so well
you see
he never tells me nothing
ace what do we
got on for next week
well it a little too early
id say thursday would be good
is that all right
okay you come by the house
ill come by
at 700
good job my boy
keep it up okay ace
hey nicky
ill be right out
nicky see that guy
keep a good eye on him
he making
a lot of money for us
and he gonna continue
making a lot of money for us
so keep a good eye on him
not like the fucking feds out there
without brains
okay
all right
want me to take this
now
on top of everything else
i gotta make sure nobody fucks with the golden jew
chase couple of
shooters for the ladies
yeah we made a great pair
i made book and nicky made sure we always collected
the old men loved us
and why not
they all made money with us
how did nicky collect
don ’‘ ask
where the fuck is the money
hi melissa heidi
hi sam

itwas nine i laid nine
it was eight
ace tell him
the line on the bear game

i didnt know whose it was
i didnt want it to get lost
well thank you
why dont you take that pen
and shove it up your ass
fucking jag-off
i was just
fucking asshole
look out joe
woman shrieking
nicky grunting
man groaning in pain
man whimpering
what that you hear
a little girl frankie

is that a little girl
what happened to
the fucking tough guy
told my friend to stick it
up his fucking ass
nicky take it easy nicky
man whimpering
while i was trying to figure out why the guy was saying this
nicky just hit him
no matter how big a guy was
nicky would take him on
you beat nicky with fists
he comes back with a bat
you beat him with a knife
he comes back with a gun
and ifyou beat him with a gun
you better kill him
because hell keep coming back and back until one ofyou is dead
listen
with me protecting ace
he made
a fortune for the bosses
i mean
that’s what got him to vegas
he was a money machine
a tremendous
earner for these guys
as soon as he took over
he doubled the fucking drop
with ace
the casino never saw so much money
and the bosses
they couldnt be happier
hoochie coochie man
playing
singing
i got seven hundred dollars
and dont you mess with me
but you know im here
everybody knows im here
in vegas
ihad to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working
they were close to the
you know good old boys
without us these guys
they’d still be shoveling mule shit
you gotta keep
a cleaner station
ifyou need mr clean
page him all right
wont happen
again sam
mr rothstein
wont happen again
mr rothstein
is this guyjust
a dumb fucking white man
what the story
you need him
i cant get rid of him
he the county
commissioner cousin
iwouldnt give
the burn a mop job
i had no choice
i had to take care ofthem
these yoke/s ran the state
they passed the laws
they owned the courts
hey i need a room
good to see you
i had dozens of politicians and officials in that place every week
get the senator
whatever he wants
why not make them happy
the presidential suite
for politicians like our state senator up there
everything was on the house
these guys won their comp life when they got elected
so why not take
advantage ofit
still the politicians came cheap
we could handle them
it a whale
like k k ichikawa
who plays $30000
a hand in baccarat
that’s the one
you gotta watch
he plays fast and big
and he has the cash
and the credit
to turn out your lights
a year ago
he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the cayman islands
downstairs he takes us
for $2 million
and upstairs he takes free soap
shampoo and towels
a billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms
free private jets
and $2 million of our money
but we got him back
i had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz
i dont know what went wrong
im awfully sorry
i cant understand it
these mechanical
things happen
hey but better
here than up there
he missed the commercial flights to japan
i cant believe it
what can i do
we got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself
i am sorry
maybe you get my money back
no no gambling
and once he was back
he played small
he bet $000 a hand instead of his usual $30000 a hand
to the bank with
a natural eight over a five
but i knew the trick
with whales like ichikawa
was that they cant
bet small for long
he didn’t think of
it as winning $0000
he thought ofit
as losing $90 000
so he upped his bets
until he dropped
his winnings back
and gave up $ million
of his own cash
in a casino the cardinal
rule is to keep them
playing and keep
them coming back
the longer they play
the more they lose
in the end we get it all
compared to what playing
singing
god damn it
trying to make it
real compared to what
sock it to me
in vegas
everybody’s gotta watch everybody else
six
who gonna give me that
since the players are looking to beat the casino
the dealers are
watching the players
six
make the six
the boxmen are
watching the dealers
the floormen are
watching the boxmen
the pit bosses are
watching the floormen
the shift bosses
are watching the pit bosses
the casino manager
is watching the shift bosses
i m watching
the casino manager
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all
plus we had a dozen guys up there
most of them ex-cheats
who knew every
trick in the house
singing trying to make it real compared to what

i have something for you
you got me covered
and you do
thank you very much
take care
i got some
lucky pills for you
yeah
who didnt want ginger
she was one of the best known
bestﬁked and most respected hustlers in town
she could keep a guy awake for two or three days
before
sending him home broke
to the little woman
and his bank examiners
any change
oh i hit a few games
on the way back
that was all bullshit

$6800
thanks
it kickback city

thank you you too
she took care of
the dealers pit bosses
hey mitch
floor managers
but mostly
she took care of
the valet parkers
the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything
ginger took care of
the parkers
because they took care of
the security guards
who took care of the cops
who let her operate
i need that stuff tonight
no problem
you are a doll
the valet parking job
was such a money-maker
they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession
but one thing
i could never understand
was that she could have
everything under control
except for her old pimp boyfriend
lester diamond
gin you know i got other people in this
i got partners
i want you to
understand
that i am looking out for you
in this thing okay
youre gonna get yours back and youre gonna get back first

youre my woman
i know
the ginger knew wouldn ’‘ even look at this creep
yeah
good luck
he was a moocher
a card cheat
a country club golf hustler
a scumbag
chasing dentists
for a few bucks
careful
the guy was always broke
he always had a story
and she could
never turn him down
the way ginger saw it was that lester was just an unlucky guy
somebody had to
take care of him
somebody had to
take care of him
but nobody had to
take care of nicky
ifyou find any cash
well whack it up with you
he took care of
himself only too well
that why every badge back home wanted to nail him
| folded these
things beautifully
and iwould
appreciate a little respect
jesus christ dont look at me pal
i gotta live with her
even after a vacation
they hassled him at the airport
frank marino was there to meet him but so were the cops
this time they wanted him for some diamond burglary in antwerp
they were ready to
blame him for anything
put your things away
they were usually right
hold it
nicky enjoyed
being a gangster
and he didnt give
a damn who knew it
come on
there we go look beautiful
that’s what worried me
cause it turns out
nicky was about to
be sent to vegas

oh there arent
what that huh

there no more thanks hon
i couldnt wait to
get my hands on vegas
but the bosses didnt send me there to have a good time
they sent me to make sure
that nobody fucked with ace
and nobody interfered
with the fucking skim
hey

you mean
i have your permission

and this
sheriff a real cowboy
even the coppers
bury people out in the desert
i dont care
i wanna get away
from back home

nick i got pinched
twice for no reason
you really gotta be careful
im running a licensed place
everything legit
dont worry about it
im not gonna do anything
im especially not gonna involve you in anything
ace saw vegas one way
you tell this guy im coming
course
but i saw it another
i saw it as untouched
they had bookies pimps
and drug dealers i could shake down
who the fuck were
they gonna run to
so i started
getting everybody in line
best of all for
the first time in my life
i figured out
a way not to lose
yeah
he had a foolproof scheme
it wasn’t very
scientific but it worked
when he won
he collected when he lost
he told the bookies
to fuck themselves
what were they
gonna do muscle nicky
nicky was the muscle
tony how you doing
hey how you doing
good
you got that thing for me
what thing
oh nicky
i thought you was laying
iwas laying
no no im taking
i was taking
you sure
im positive
im a little confused
youre a little confused
maybe if i stick
your fucking face
through this window
youll get unconfused
give me the money
sorry i didnt mean
anything by it
yeah
that why you had it ready
my fucking head
fucking head huh
smarten up
dont fuck around tony
now nicholas santoro will tell us about our first president
george washington was born
but still it was nice
and quiet for a while
ginger and i
presented nicky and jennifer
all over town like
regular ozzie and harriets
beautiful swing
ace got my son little nicky
involved in little league
turned out one of
the other coaches
was a fucking
metro intelligence cop
but it didnt matter
it was all about the kids
he gotta realize everything cant be a home run
that exactly
what i tell him
but that
the kind of kid he is
and nicky being nicky
he made his presence known
especially at the casino
where he definitely did not work
people got the message
that’s why
the bosses sent me out here
they wanted me to make sure
nobody robbed the joint
like these two
fucking balloon heads
they were gonna try to bang us out of 200 fucking grand
yeah right im sure
how are you
what are you doing here
im over here now
over here
yeah with them
were waiting on carmine
yeah were looking
for carmine
he was here before
he had a suitcase
and then he left
carmine left
carmine left
he gone
he not here
carmine out
i think maybe he went across the street or somewhere
well listen
good luck with the joint
thanks eddy
yeah lots of luck
good luck to you too
they forgot to
sign their papers
yeah they dont
need those anymore
out of respect
guys from other crews got a warning
everybody else watch out
like these yoke/s here
who never heard of nicky or the bosses
cause theyre the morons who give you the most trouble
even after we catch them
they try sneaking back with beards and wigs and fake noses
you can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet
like this guy
he’s betting lavender chips
at $500 each with
only one little problem
he’s always guessed right
if he wasn’t so
fucking greedy
hed have been
tougher to spot

with over
$ million in cash and jewels
tucked in a bank in vegas

she loved that shit
but a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around
crooked cops and kidnappers
dont take checks

with that mr collins
so i put $2 million in
cash in a los angeles bank
under the name of mr
and mrs tom collins

and since i d either be in jail or locked in a closet
when i needed

sam
let me ask you a question
you must really
trust your wife
yeah sure i do why
no it good
it just unusual
to tell you the truth
so many of my clients dont
okay
never will i know happiness
with ginger and the money in place
i felt covered
and to play it safe
i switched job titles again
and made myself
food and beverage director
this way
nobody would bother me about a license
imean vegas was
like a dream for me
trouble was
nicky was dreaming his own kind of vegas
i put money out
on the street
charging three points a week
juice to the dealers
dont make us
come looking for you
you wont have to
thanks nicky
they were degenerate gamblers
coke freaks
in no time
i had half the dealers in the tangiers in my pocket
the next thing i did
i started busting out high-stakes poker players
it was so obvious
all of nicky’s half-assed mechanics were signal-happy
im gonna open for $500
signaling back and forth
gambler
nicky thought
nobody was watching him
he was wrong
and i didnt want any ofthose agents near my place
four aces
i cant believe this
gambler
i wished nicky and
his crew would just get lost
what am i gonna do
go back home and start a war
nicky’s a made guy
and im not
i cant do that
careful gaming agents
are all over the place
so im not allowed
to get lucky in this place
youve been lucky all week
theyre looking
to nail you
ace was so fucking
worried about his casino
he forgot
what we were doing here
a million times
i wanted to yell
in his fucking ear
this is las vegas
we’re supposed to be out here robbing
you dumb fucking hebe
i dont give a shit
who he connected to
tell him to take his
feet off the table

and use his head to

guy was with me

but you know what he did
i walked over to him politely and he tells me to go fuck myself
then he called me a faggot

you called my friend a faggot
you tell him to fuck himself
is that what you did
you fucking hick

i m sorry about this really

thanks pal
you took your boots off
you put your
feet on the table
you shit-kicking stinky
horse-manure-smelling motherfucker you
you fuck me up over there
ill stick you in the desert go apologize
get the fuck
im sorry
you know ace could
be a very touchy guy
especially when
he got bigger in town
like when he hired that jonathan and david away from the palace
by building them a new stage and giving them a silver rolls-royce
but he knew how to
bring in the crowds
knew all the fucking angles
he brought over the whole
femme fatale show from paris
but he forgot how lazy
them european broads can get
he weighed them
once a week
to make sure they didnt
blow up like balloons
youre eight pounds over
what the reason for this
mr rothstein sir
never mind the sir
why is she eight pounds over
im trying to offer
you the respect
mr rothstein is
good enough for you
sometimes when you put that pressure point on them
all you do is
give me answers
just give me
the right answer
i guess she frightened if she doesnt lose weight
she may get fired
that right
she will get fired
send her back to paris
just stop everything
this woman an institution
she lazy
i gotta give the guy credit
imean he does
the most obvious thing
this is the only
town in the country
where a bookie
joint is legit
so why not take advantage
right
so he took bookie
joints off the street
and opened them up
inside the casino
within a few years
he had every casino
on the strip trying
to copy off of him
between my innovations
and nicky’s
dedication to his job
i soon had the best
operation on the strip
be careful
there a lot of heat on you already
why somebody complaining
im hearing
things from security
the sheriff looking to put you in the black book
that black book is
a bunch of bullshit
they got two names
for the whole country
and one of them
is still al capone
if they put you in that book
youre gonna be in trouble
you will not be able
to walk into a casino
im trying to make a living
that all
im just telling you
dont say i didnt warn you
all right
mrs
rothstein straight ahead
very nice thank you
smile
just look
for his hard work
and dedication
and the new life-blood
he has instilled in las vegas
sam has established himself
as an indispensable member
of the gaming community
as the head of the tangiers gaming corporation
it my pleasure to
welcome sam rothstein
to the vegas
valley country club
applause
back home
theyd have put me in jail for what i m doing
but out here
theyre giving me awards
it is with great pleasure that i accept this certificate of appreciation
from the charitable foundations of greater las vegas
congratulations sweetheart
sam raised more than weve ever raised before
but my greatest
pleasure was watching
my wife
ginger work the room
they all loved her

she could be the most charming woman you ever saw
people loved to
be around her
youve got to bring amy

mr rothstein
thank you
thanks for that compliment
he was a young
kid from the casino
nice kid bright boy
what balls on
this fucking kid
the next day i fired him
ginger had that
effect on people
i think she even
encouraged them
do you wanna see this one
ginger exclaims
daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much
but as much as
they loved her
fabulous
they didnt know
what really moved her
look at this
daddy gave me this
and with ginger happy
i was able
to concentrate on
what i knew best
loose machines are
right back over there
what are they
doing back there
okay
you cant even see them there
what about the progressives
with the high jackpots
where are they
these machines are hidden
these are our best machines
they bring all the action
no wonder the drop is off
the action is in the front
not the back
bring them up front
all right iwiii
listen carefully
there are three ways of doing things here
the right way the wrong way
and the way that i do it
you understand
i do ill get right on it
and thank you
dont thank me
just do it
youre the slots manager
i shouldnt have to tell you this
dang you are right
mr rothstein
i am so sorry
so i ended up working
what 8-hour days
ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of vegas
come with me please
i have a better table for you sorry
what did you say to
that fucking jerk
i told him iwas
mrs sam rothstein
well you might as well
get something out of it
well
it wasnt long before what i was afraid was gonna happen happened
nicky managed to
get himself banned
from every
casino in las vegas
from then on
i couldnt be seen talking
to him anywhere
in or near vegas
what the fuck is
that supposed to mean
detrimental to gaming and he will be
ejected from any casino in las vegas
and the casinos can be fined
as much as $00000
every time he shows up
you believe this shit
yeah i believe it
you got banned
because of notorious
and unsavory reputation
motherfucker
is there any way around this
no there no way
let say for instance
i wanna go in a restaurant
which happens to be in a casino
to get one of those
sandwiches i like
forget it you cant even set
foot in the parking lot
that how serious it is
in other words im fucked
in so many words yes
it just didnt
sink into his head
about the black
book and what it meant
not being able to go into a casino is one thing
but being in this
book etched your name
into the brains of
every cop and fbi agent
youre listed in
there with al capone
but nicky didn ’‘ care
i gotta do something
i gotta do something
they aint getting rid of me
theyre not
getting rid of me
im staying here
fuck them fuck them
so
once they pulled that shit
i started doing my own things
nobody ever thought of doing
to keep an eye on things
i brought in my brother dominick
and some desperados
and started knocking over high-rollers
casino bosses bookmakers
anybody right here in town
i had a good
fucking crew going for me
i had sal fusco
a great second-story guy
jack hardy
he worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit
and then there
was bernie blue
this guy could
bypass any alarm for me
it was like old times
and i opened up my own jewelry store too
the gold rush
sometimes i used to go along on a heist
just for the fun of it
but i didnt like the people i was ripping off looking at me
so i used to turn their fucking pictures around
what taking so long
this is
a motherfucker
learn how to open the things so you dont have to take them
some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them
tell pepe if he
switching stones on us
he better take
a camel back to nigeria
telephone rings
yeah
theyre in penthouse k
checked in alone
yes
are they out now
yes dont worry
thanks
he had tipsters all over town
bel/men
this looks good
but you got to hurry
yeah okay
valet parkers
theyre checking in
okay ill tell him
pit bosses
room 230 at the sirocco
secretaries
mint condition coins
mint condition
they all got
a piece of the score
car coming
they were very careful
they always bypassed
the alarms or else
if not they’d drill
enough holes
to knock through the walls
with a sledgehammer
nicky was grabbing
everything he could
nobody out there
was expecting a guy like him
to nicky
las vegas was the fucking wild west
ijust got a shipment
of diamonds from israel
what the fuck
they expect from me
i had to earn didnt i
you know
this diamond has flaws in it
there no flaws
im doing this for 25 years
you better clean your ioupe
because there no flaws
whenever we got
local merch
we d usually send it to
palm springs or arizona la
i had some
sand niggers out there
you know arabs
are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here
i know his language
$40000 the whole package
$20000
that my final offer
he suddenly talks english
let talk turkey here
$25000
i actually
turned my bedroom
into a bank vault
where i kept the choice stuff
i couldnt leave it
at the gold rush
in case we got
raided by the cops
or if my crew got cute
i had the only key
jennifer didnt give a fuck
she used to fall asleep on the couch watching tv every night
this stuff was all mine
i didnt send any
of this back home
i couldnt because i wasn’t even supposed to be doing it
the bosses were making so much money with the casinos
that they didnt want anybody
making any waves for them
you gave all
the guys a piece of that
i took care of everyone
yeah
that’s why there
was no organized street stuff
in vegas before i came here
but how much cash
could i bury in my closet
understand
and im sure you do
in a venture of this kind
you have to be prepared to
take some kind of loss
i put some of the money into legitimate deals
with charlie clark
ace banker
you will try to push it through
mr clark yes
im giving you $50000 cash
then i put some more money into legitimate places
like my restaurant
is that the last
yeah
i had my kid brother dominick
run it for me
fuckers

all right thanks a lot
enjoy have a good time

restaurant buff
and over the years
he always made money with it
in vegas

showgirls and movie stars

that all you care about
you dont care about me

no you dont
how could you say that
youre a beautiful woman
youre destroying yourself

oh god
oh god
sobbing
okay okay
ill try ill try
ill try |wi||

at me okay
|wi||
no matter what the problems were outside the count room
it was all worth it
the cash kept rolling in
and the suitcases
kept coming and going
and let me tell you
the fucking bottom line here is cash
the only problem was
that after a while
the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light
wait a minute
you mean to tell me
that the money were
robbing is being robbed
that somebody
robbing from us
we go through all this trouble and somebody robbing us
like i said
it part of the business
it considered leakage
leakage my balls
i want the guy
who robbing us
even john nance
that’s the guy who ran the scam
he knew there wasn’t much
he could do about it
you gotta know that a guy who helps you steal
even if you
take care of him real well
he’s gonna steal
a little extra for himself
makes sense dont it right
try and make these hardheaded old greaseballs understand that
what the point of skimming
if were being skimmed
it defeats the purpose
they take money
because theyre my guys
so you gotta
give them some leeway
but the bosses never believed in leeway
so listen to what they do
they put artie piscano
the underboss of k c
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim
what were you doing
i was with my goomah
what are you doing
with your goomah
i gave her a schiaffo
the only trouble was
piscano was a disaster
this guy could fuck
up a cup of coffee
what you
been doing
im out there
more than im here
and if anybody had
known where this would lead
they wouldve been better off
making fucking novenas
you gotta go back
and talk to that guy
i never got my expenses
for the last trip
vvhatexpenses
im laying money
out of my own pocket
and i never get
anything back
you gotta go back out there
im gonna start
keeping records
no records artie
what are you gonna do
with records pay taxes
i cant keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips
what the hell are
we doing over here
youre going
to las vegas at my expense
what the fuck
i mean after all
no matter how many
novenas you could make
nothing was gonna
stop what came up next
i cant believe
youre doing this
we made a deal
you came to me
it turned out phil green
mr integrity
had a partner
nobody knew about
and when she showed up
demanding money from the tangiers
why are you doing this
because youre wrong
im not
yes you are
i am not wrong
green tried
to stonewall her
|wi|| see to it that you do not get away with this
so she sued him in court
the court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff
anna scott
against tangiers corporation and its president
philip green
john marmot on
behalf of mr green
victor oberon on
behalf ofanna scott
mr oberon proceed
gavel pounding
thank you judge
i believe he was fair
and im delighted with the decision
we got a problem
it didnt go too well
green has to
open up the books
has to show how he
got the financing
and hey that not good
mutters
she was doing pretty
good with her lawsuit
but before she could start
counting her money
the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court
so they sent me
reporter
what
reporter
reporter
reporter
we were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago
it was never a partnership
reporter
now
instead of the cops only looking at nicky
they started
looking at green too
and he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man
i had to start
giving interviews
so everybody knew the casino
was on the up-and—up
so how often do you
really fill in for him
green here about two or three times a month
and he busy
with real estate deals
so in green absence
youre the boss
i serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board
and my responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations
so day-to-day
then youre the boss
well in a sense
you could say that
i am the boss
when mr green is away
you could say that
have you read this
it about mr rothstein
it says
the midwest bookmaker with mob ties
says that he is
the real boss
of the $00 million
tangiers casino empire
do you believe that
did he really say that
why of course he said that
it right here
has that man even
filed for his license yet
i dont know
we have to check the files
without getting your shorts in a knot
would you do that
check closely
cause we may have to kick a kike ass out of town
thank you

mr chairman
members of the commission
mr rothstein is
pleased to be here today
and when the day
finally came i was ready
i felt so confident that all i had to do was present my case
we have documents
one of which
is a report by
retired fbi agents
which completely absolves mr
rothstein from any wrongdoing
counselor
i want to have this marked
this commission
is prepared to act
on a motion
denying the application
denying
do i hear a motion seconded
mr chairman
i second the motion
do i have
a vote on the motion
mr chairman
the ayes have it
this hearing is adjourned
youre kidding

adjourned
mr chairman senator
you promised me a hearing
you didnt even look
at the fbi reports
when you were my guest
at the tangiers hotel
did you not promise
me a fair hearing
i was never your guest
you were never my guest
i dont comp you
about three times a month
id like to answer that
mr rothstein is
being very typical
he lying
the only time i
was at the tangiers
was dinner with
barney greenstein
was i at that dinner
tell me
was i at that dinner
you were wandering
you were
you were in the building
you know i was at that dinner and you swore to me
i would have a fair hearing
did you not
did you not
well tell me i was
at least at the dinner
allow me that much
give me that much at least
yes you were
thanks for not calling me a liar
you son of a bitch
good evening
a routine licensing hearing
turned into bed/am yesterday
when the flamboyant
tangiers casino executive
sam ace rothstein
accused the state  top gaming officials of corruption
at my hotel and you asked for copies of your bill
so you could put them
on your expense account
in a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial
rothstein followed stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue until
his own lawyers urged him to leave
you have a past
i have a past
and my past
is no worse than yours
but you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment
long suspected of running the tangiers without a license
yesterday hearing
was to determine
if someone with
rothstein history
was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post
fucking hypocrites
what the hell
he gonna do now
i dont know
what he doing
he knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours
what the matter with him
maybe he could run things
with anotherjob title
wouldnt be the best
but what can we do
however he runs things
it gotta be quiet
let him hide
upstairs in the office
say he a janitor
i dont give a shit
but please
whateverjob he takes
make sure
it something quiet

audience laughing

oh no no oh no
oh jesus
hejuggling
let’s not take county commissioner pat webb too seriously
i recently
challenged him to a debate
on this program
and he declined
what are you
worried about pat
you dont have to
send me any questions
you can ask me
anything you want
what the hell is he
doing on television
he on all night
screaming about how
he gonna take this
to the supreme court
he crazy
he going to
washington with this
he out of his fucking mind
it a pity we
have such hypocrisy
some people do
what they want
other people have to
pay through the nose
andy go see him
tell him maybe it time
he should quit
what they did was
totally unconstitutional
were on the list to be heard before the supreme court
they dont give a fuck
about the supreme court
they want you to walk away
walk away
andy you cant be serious
how can i walk away
dont you see
what at stake
the old man said maybe your friend should give in
when the old man says maybe
it like a papal bull
not only should you quit
you should run
the problem is every time they mention myname
they mention nicky too
how the fuck does that help
the heat he brought down
is murder
the police department
was cooperative
but he pissed
them off so much now
that nobody can
make a move anymore
what are you proposing
i dont know
he doesnt listen to me
maybe he should
get lost for a while
they aint
sending nicky nowhere
itd give
everybody time to maneuver
i would forget
about the maneuver
i would just get out
sighs
i cant do that
of course as soon as andy got home
nicky heard about our talk
next morning
bright and early i get the call
ive got to do some shopping
you want to go
but just getting a call
from nicky wasn’t easy
even the codes didnt work
so we figured
out another act
if a phone tapped
the feds can only listen in
on stuff involving crimes
so on routine calls
they have to click off after a few minutes
yeah i got
a sprained fucking elbow
yeah
meet me at 300
caesar
00 yards down the road
why
dont ask questions
suzy cream cheese
has the exact same outfit
i saw something
something very cute
okay he out
it the brown unit
and he with a bogey
i think it frankie
nicky started out before me
because it wasn’t easy for him
to get around
pulled out fast
nicky couldn ’t go for a ride without changing cars at least six times
before he could
shake all his tails
and because ofthe planes
he had to use underground garages
meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous
it a scary place
i knew about
the holes in the desert
and everywhere i looked
there could have been a hole
normally my prospects
of coming back alive
from a meeting with nicky were 99 out of 00
but this time
when i heard him say
a couple of hundred
yards down the road
i gave myself 50-50
where the fuck you get off talking to people about me behind my back
what people
you think i
wasnt gonna find out
what are you talking about
you said im bringing heat
on you
i gotta listen to people
because of your shit
youre ordering me out
you better get
your own fucking army
i didnt order anybody
i told andy stone that you had heat and that was a problem
you want me to get out
of my own fucking town
let the bullshit blow over
so i can run the casino
anything goes wrong with the casino
it my ass it not yours
i dont know whether you know
but you only have your fucking casino because of me
im what counts out here
not your fucking country clubs or your fucking tv shows
and what the fuck
are you doing on tv anyhow
igetcahs
from home every day
they think you went batshit
im only on tv because i gotta be able to hang around the casino
come on
you could have had the food and beverage job without going on tv
you wanted to go on tv
yeah idid
that way i have a forum
i can fight back
they know
they cant fuck around with me
like they could
if i was an unknown
youre making
a spectacle of yourself

iwouldnt even be in this situation if it wasnt for you
every time i meet somebody

fitted that fast

one he thought was nice
he doesnt know what the fuck a good watch is

fbi agent
and at the end of the day
they came to see me with the pictures
fbi agent
but i didnt want
to look at them
i didnt want to look at the guys who brought them either
your honor as you can see
my clients are elderly and infirm
any incarceration could pose a serious health risk
some of
the bosses were so old
they needed doctors
at their arraignment
pre-trial services
recommends bail as set
were going to take a recess
when it looked like they could get 25 years to life
for skimming a casino
sick or no fucking sick
people were going to get clipped
the day of the arraignment
they had this meeting in the back of the courthouse
see when something
like this happens
you know how things
are gonna work out
it always better
with no witnesses
so what aboutandy
he wont talk
stone is a good kid
stand-up guyjust
like his old man
that the way i see it
i agree he solid
he a fucking marine
he okay he always was
remo what do you think
look
why take a chance
at least that the way
i feel about it
call artie
tell him i dont care what
he got to be in my office thursday morning before 00
it important
i gotta have a conversation with that guy
as much as they liked him
he wasn’t one of us
he wasn’t italian
as far as they knew
he could have talked
otherwise
stoney might still be alive
the first one to
skip was john nance
he found a nice warm
secluded place in costa rica
he thought nobody
would find him there
gun firing
glass breaking
gun firing
but then his kid got nabbed by the feds for drugs
naturally the bosses were afraid hed come out of hiding
just to save his kid
and give them all up
where you going jag-off
blood splattering
but anyway
they all had to follow
everybody went down
fuck you
before you knew it
anybody who knew anything
wound up getting whacked
oh no no no
after ginger took off
she wasn’t much help to anybody
she found some pimps lowlifes
druggies and bikers in la
in a few months
they went through all the money
and all the jewels
the house of
the rising sun playing
singing
to wear that ball and chain
well there is
a house in new orleans
after they found her body
i had a private doctor do another autopsy
he said they gave her
a hot dose
in the end all she had left was $3
600 in mint condition coins
no matter what
the feds or the papers
might have said
about my car bombing
it was amateur night
you could tell
whoever it was
they put the dynamite under the passenger side
but what they didnt know
what nobody outside the factory knew
was that that
model car was made
with a metal plate
under the driver’s seat
it the only thing
that saved my life
the bombing was
never authorized
but i suspect
i know who lit the fuse
hey nicky
and so did
the powers that be
how you doing
it took months for
everything to calm down
but finally
my guys got out on bail
and the bosses
wanted me to send
my brother
dominick out to vegas
always the dollars
always the fucking dollars
i mean
it was still way too hot for me to even go near vegas
so i set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks
i didn t want my
brother fucked around
what right is right
they dont give
a fuck about
holy fucking
what the fuck

mister
you all right

they had other ideas for me
you sure are lucky mister
the town will
never be the same
after the tangiers
the big corporations took it all over
today it looks
like disneyland
while the kids play
cardboard pirates
mommy and daddy drop house payments and junior college money
on the poker slots
in the old days
dealers knew your name
what you drank
what you played
today it like
checking into an airport
if you order room service
youre lucky if you get it by thursday
today it all gone
a whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase
and some
25-year-old hotel school kid
is gonna want his
social security number
after the teamsters
got knocked out of the box
the corporations tore down practically all the old casinos
and where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids
junk bonds
still not sure
probable maybe questionable
let me know as soon
as you can find out
but in the end
i wound up right back where i started
i could still pick winners
and i could still make money for all kinds of people back home
and why mess up a good thing
and that that
stardust pla ying
sometimes i wonder why
i spend the lonely nights
dreaming ofa song
the melody haunts my reverie
and i am once again with you
when our love was new
and each kiss an inspiration
ah but that was long ago
and now my consolation
is in the stardust of a song
beside a garden wall
when stars were bright
and you were in my arms
the nightingale
told his fairy tale
of paradise where roses grew
though i dream in vain
in my heart it will remain
my stardust melody
the memory of love refrain
