i was sheriff of this county when i was
twenty-five years old
hard to believe
grandfather was a lawman
father too
me and him was sheriff at the same time
him up in plano and me out here
i think he was pretty proud of that
i know i was
some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun
a lot of folks find that
hard to believe
jim scarborough never carried one
that the younger jim
gaston boykins wouldnt wear one
up in commanche county
now i always liked to hear about
the old-timers
never missed a chance to do so
you cant help but compare yourself
against the old-timers
cant help but wonder how they
wouldve operated these times
there is this boy i sent to the electric
chair in huntsville here a while back
my arrest and my testimony
he killed a fourteen-year-old girl
papers said it was a crime of passion but
he told me there wasnt any passion to it
told me that hed been planning to kill somebody
for about as long as he could remember
said if they turned him out hed do it again
said he knew he was going to hell
be there in about fifteen minutes
i dont know what to make of that
i surely dont
the crime you see now it hard
to even take its measure
it not that im afraid of it
i always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job
but i dont want to push my chips forward
and go out and meet something
i dont understand
a man would have to put his soul at hazard
he just have to say okay
ill be part of this world
yessir i just walked in the door
sheriff he had some sort of
thing on him like a
oxygen tanks for emphysema or something
and a hose that run down his sleeve
you got me
youll look at it when you get in
yessir i got it under control
howdy what this about
step out of the car please sir
what is it
i need you to step out of the car sir

truss em up and slit their throats
here charlie got one all trussed up
and all set to drain him
and the beef comes to
it starts thrashing around
six hundred pounds of very pissed-off livestock
if youll excuse me
charlie grabs his gun there to shoot the
damn thing in the head
but with all the swayin and then the trashin it a glance-shot and
ricochets around and comes back hits charlie in the shoulder
you go see charlie
he still cant pick up his right hand for his hat
the point bein even in the contest
between man and steer
the issue is not certain
when llewelyn calls just tell him
ill make him safe
course they slaughter steers a lot
different these days
use a air gun
shoots out a little rock about that far into the brain
sucks right back in animal never knows what hit him

kept on goin never said nothin goin by he just rode on past
he had his blanket wrapped around
him and his head down
when he rode past i seen he was
carryin fire in a horn
the way people used to do and i could see
the horn from the light inside of it
about the color of the moon
and in the dream i knew that
he was goin on ahead
and that he fixin to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and all that cold
i knew that whenever i got
there hed be there
then i woke up
