i ever shared a cell with
that whole syndicate comes up for trial
in a few weeks
now what that
you put it on a pole
wind a spool of silk thread around it
and you hold the pole over the water
then you sit under a nice shady tree
and relax
after a while a hungry fish comes along
takes a nip at your hook
and youve got dinner
for the next two weeks
im not gonna think about anything
except the eternal struggle
between man and fish
ive been promised a vacation
you remember
sorry hank that out
phil look at me
college degree lovable personality
and i spend most of my time in prison
an undercover specialist
eight sentences in five years
dannemora sing sing leavenworth
i joined the department
to put criminals behind bars
and here i am stir-crazy
read this
who checks confessions in springfield
every rookie knows scratch morton
went underground after that hotel job
youre not gonna let jarrett get away
with a two-bit prison stretch
maybe
fallon maybe
a hoodlum turns himself in on a phony rap
and beats the gas chamber heh
ill bet he thumbing his nose
at uncle sam right now and loving it
jarrett outsmarted you
that just what we want him to think
were working with the springfield police
we arranged for the confession to check
so what happens
jarrett does a stretch in the penitentiary
in case he get lonely
and wants to talk to someone
were gonna let one of our boys
do a stretch right in the same cell
still going fishing hank
yeah
in what prison
youll enjoy the food wonderful chef
arrested him myself
okay okay what the pitch
youll be committed to the penitentiary
in illinois
youll be one of jarrett cellmates
stick with him until you find out
where he unloaded $300000 in federal
currency without a single bill showing up
also try to learn the identity
of the very special fence
that engineered this deal
fallon
how does he operate
buys stolen money here
30 40 cents on the dollar
peddles it on the european black market
for pfft who knows how much
no questions asked sweet racket
in step with the times
evans well that your assignment
i wouldnt ask you to do another
undercover job if we werent up against it
hello hank
fallon hi
prison records from illinois
your new buddies
fallon
busy little place isnt it
twenty-seven hundred
of the roughest and toughest
and a few who might recognize you
let go to work
find another old client
yeah red draper
questioned him in 46
about a warehouse job
well that makes two for transfer
better run through the arrest once more
oh yeah let see
ill be picked up in a joint
known as tom hideaway
bill hideaway
bill hideaway
on what seems like
an ordinary hood roundup
one of the boys spots me as a lamister
i make a break for it
when i pick myself off the floor
im meek as a baby
how do i get information out to you
visiting days
oh mother again
wife this time

hell be out before youre sentenced
good bo creel would know me
in the dark
this job isnt gonna be
like any of the others hank
you see uh
there insanity in the jarretts
some of it rubbed off on cody
his father died in an institution
ive had a few strange cellmates in my time
but this sounds like the jackpot
when he was a kid
he used to fake headaches
to get his mother attention away
from the rest of the family it worked
as he grew up
the fancied headaches became real
until now they tear him to pieces
any minute
he apt to crack open at the seams
and there goes our case
so youll be working against time
suits me quicker the better
except that cody not an easy guy
to get close to in a hurry
the only person he ever cared about
or trusted is his mother
no one else has ever made a dent
not even his wife
his mother been the prop
that held him up
he got a fierce
psychopathic devotion for her
all his life whenever he got in a spot
hed just put out his hand
and there was ma jarrett
without her maybe codyd
just like his old man
you mean im supposed to take
mama place
never can tell he might need someone
ill practice up on my lullabies

before anybody knows what hit them
without artillery it cant be done
no
listen im a pretty handy fella
with electricity you remember
well i figured a way to fix the generators
you know what that means
i got a slight idea
the generators control everything
searchlights gun turret main gate
who needs artillery
only weve gotta do it alone
were gonna need a car
my wife coming tomorrow
well set it all up
all right kid it a deal
and if it works ill pay you back

solid gold

to get your case reviewed
hello margaret
youre looking well vic
whispering
were being watched
say anything you like and make it good
and listen to me carefully
divorce vic you cant mean that
why what have i done
that fine
jarrett getting out of here
and im going with him
i know how you feel vic but dont ask me
to do anything thatll break my heart
in normal voice
it might be better for you
it my life
let me decide what to do with it
whispering
just the two of us
tell evans well break out
thursday night
tell him to plant a getaway car
with an oscillator
can you remember that
with an oscillator
ill remember darling
in normal voice everything clear
perfectly clear
you wont be sorry vic
when you get out well be happy
ill see to that
whispering nice going
whered you learn all that soap opera

but if that fails
you just have to serve the rest of your term
jerry you couldnt get me out of here
if i was pardoned
all right this is the prison
we place the getaway car in these trees
with the oscillator under its rear axle
and hooked up to the battery
our cars will be parked back here
a mile or so away
one here the other here
we assume that jarrett and hank
come out here somewhere
they pile into the getaway car
and theyre off
you ready ernie
trent ready
the transmitter wavelength is 47
evan
forty-seven-point-one
all right switch it on
transmitter humming
our receivers pick up that sound
from the oscillator
which enables us to cross-plot
their exact position
for example
suppose the impulse received here
has a bearing of 20 degrees
this one here reads 45 degrees
we plot them like so
where the lines cross
that where they are
it doesnt matter how far they travel
as long as our cars are within receiving
distance we can tell where they are
all right ernie switch it off
how far is receiving distance
we had a dry run on a car yesterday
kept tabs on him for 20 miles
that little thing
you could make one out of your
bedside radio ill show you how
sometime when youve got a week to spare

into the tank

cody ah were back in business boys

and not big ed way either
and not for 50 grand
but first a question
supposing you wanna push in
a place like fort knox
and grab yourself
a couple of tons of gold
what the toughest thing
about a job like that
getting inside the joint
a silver dollar
for the gentleman in the balcony
right on the button getting in
which brings me to a story
ma used to tell me when i was a kid
a story about a horse
way back there was a whole army
trying to knock over a place called troy
and getting nowhere fast
couldnt even put a dent in the walls
and one morning
one morning the people of troy wake up
look over the walls
and the attacking army disappeared
men boats the works taken a powder
but they left one thing after them
a great big wooden horse
and according to ma
horn honks
hello there i was wondering
if i could use your telephone
there aint a phone here for five miles
oh im sorry to hear that
good morning
hello
lost your way mister
no i uh wanted to call my office
but these gentlemen say
you dont have a phone here
they wouldnt know
there one in the house
ill show you where it is

more than a nickel
looks like big ed
gonna have company huh
yeah
and we got a new station wagon
how fishing
fine cody good catch
you like the truck idea huh
it admirable
we might all profit by a closer study
of classical literature
cody
mm-hm
oh chemical plant
i guess that long beach way
that close enough for now
you know the way i work cody
i must ask that you dont insist
on knowing the exact location
until youve reached the rendezvous
that all right
the only thing that matters is
how much dough this joint has in the kitty
four hundred and twenty-six thousand
dollars will be placed in their safe
before closing time tomorrow
to be distributed to deserving employees
the following morning
uh provided there no
unforeseen accident of course
like me and my boys
exactly

maybe they found
they went to school together
say maybe theyre buddies after all
well something funny going on there
