this is going to be good i can tell
my son nemo he was mad at me
maybe he wouldnt have done it
if i hadnt been so tough on him
i dont know
he swam in the open water to this boat
and these divers appeared
and i tried to stop them
the boat was too fast
so we swam out in the ocean
he couldnt stop them
then nemo dad
he swims out to the ocean
and they bump into three sharks
he scares them away
by blowing them up
that amazing
then dives thousands of feet
straight into the dark it wicked
dark there you cant see a thing
the only thing
they can see down there is
this big horrible creature with
razor-sharp teeth nice parry
then he has to blast his way
these fish have been
searching the ocean for days
on the east australian current
he may be on his way here right now
that should put him in
sydney harbour
in a few days
this guy will stop at nothing
stop at nothing until he finds his son
i hope he makes it
that one dedicated father

nemo bye dad

sherman barbara
barbara mmm-hmm
i dont understand it
here this thing has a lifetime guarantee
and it breaks
had to clean the tank myself
take the fish out put em in bags and
whered the fish go
car horns
come on peach
you got it that it you can do it
that the shortest red light
ive ever seen
come on peach
cheering
triumphant laughter
now what
pop music playing
