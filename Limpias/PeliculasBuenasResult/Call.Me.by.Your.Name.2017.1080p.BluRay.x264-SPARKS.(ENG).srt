thank you
help yourself darling
thanks

the word apricot
comes from the arabic
it like the words algebra
alchemy alcohol
it derives from an arabic noun
combined with the arabic article al
before it
the origin of our italian albicocca
is al-barquq
it amazing that today in israel
and many arab countries
the fruit referred to
by a totally different name mismish
i may have to disagree
with you there professor
im gonna talk etymology
so just bear with me a second
youre right in the case
that most latin words
do find their origins in greek words
however in the case of apricot
it a little bit more
of a complicated journey
how so
well here the greek actually
takes over from the latin
latin word being
praecoquum or precoquere
so it precook or pre-ripen
as you know
to be precocious or premature
and the byzantines to go on
then borrowed praecox
which became prekokkia
which then became berikokki
which is how the arabs got al-barquq
that courtesy of philology 0

hey professor
hello

just be honest
how bad is it
i think your insights here
are persuasive but
have you been to the river
mafalda
isnt she beautiful
elio
you sleeping
i was
listen to this drivel
tell me what you think
wait
what
cant hear you
for the early greeks
heidegger contends
this underlying hiddenness
is constitutive of the way beings are
not only in relation to themselves
but also in relation
to other entities generally
in other words
they do not construe hiddenness
merely or primarily in terms of
entities relations to human beings
does that make any sense to you
doesnt make any sense to me
i dont think it makes
any sense to your dad either
maybe it did when you wrote it
that might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months
kind
yep kind
hey elio
hey
hey

fantastic
going there today

out of the water
what are you doing

hey boys
the ship went down in 827
on the way to isola del garda
gossip has it this statue
was a gift from count lechi
to his lover
contralto adelaide malanotte
there are four known sets
after the praxiteles originals
this fellow at number three
the emperor hadrian had a pair
dug up at tivoli
but one of the more philistine
of the farnese popes melted them down
and had them recast as a
particularly voluptuous venus
whod like to go for a swim
before we head back
were all such pros if i got my own
statue it would probably be on there
elio
oliver
i have to go i have to go
hey hey

i should stay
and do some work on my book
come on how about a drink
to celebrate the day
okay maybe just one
all right
marzia
the cosmic fragments by heraclitus
the meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing
so that we cannot encounter them twice
but that some things
stay the same only by changing
sorry elio

youre welcome
darling have you seen my heptaméron
mafalda

so ill translate huh
a handsome young knight
is madly in love with a princess
and she too is in love with him
though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it
despite the friendship
that blossoms between them
or perhaps because of
that very friendship
the young knight finds himself so
so humbled and speechless
that he totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love
till one day he asks the princess
point-blank
is it better to speak or to die
id never have the courage
to ask a question like that
i doubt that
hey elly-belly
you do know that
you can always talk to us
my mom been reading
this 6th-century french romance
she read some of it to my dad and i
the day the lights went out
yeah about the knight that doesnt know
whether to speak or die
right
so does he or doesnt he
better to speak she said
but she on her guard
she senses a trap somewhere
so does he speak
no
he fudges
it figures he french
i gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up
i can go im not doing anything today
then why dont we go together

lethal battles of world war i
hundred and seventy thousand
people died

cause i thought you should know
because you thought i should know
cause i wanted you to know
because i wanted you to know
because i wanted you to know

most likely sculpted
under the influence of praxiteles
right
greatest sculptor in antiquity
grow up ill see you at midnight

missed you at dinner
so
welcome home
thanks
oliver enjoyed the trip
yeah
i think he did
you two had a nice friendship
yeah
youre too smart not to know how rare
how special what you two had was
oliver was oliver
because it was him
because it was me
oliver may be very intelligent but
he was more than intelligent
what you two had
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence
he was good
youre both lucky
to have found each other
because you too are good
i think he was better than
i think he was better than me
im sure hed say
the same thing about you
yeah hed say the same thing
it flatters you both
and when you least expect it
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot
just remember i am here
right now
you may not wanna feel anything
maybe you never wanted to feel anything
and maybe it not to me
youd want to speak about this things
but feel something you obviously did
look you had a beautiful friendship
maybe more than a friendship
and i envy you
in my place most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away
pray their sons land on their feet
but i am not such a parent
we rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30
and have less to offer
each time we start with someone new
but to make yourself feel nothing
so as not to feel anything
what a waste
have i spoken out of turn
and ill say one more thing
itll clear the air
i may have come close
but i never had what you two have
something always held me back
or stood in the way
how you live your life is your business
just remember
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once
and before you know it
your heart worn out
and as for your body
there comes a point
when no one looks at it
much less wants to come near it
right now there sorrow pain
dont kill it
and with it the joy you felt
does mom know
i dont think she does
have you been to the gaverine
yes
latkes
may i
happy hanukkah
to you too
