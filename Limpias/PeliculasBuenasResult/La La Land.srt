
it another hot and sunny
southern california day
the temperature in downtown
los angeles is 29°c
and at night will drop to
i think about that day
i left him at the
greyhound station
west of santa fe
we were 7 but he was
sweet and it was true
still i did what i had to do
cause i just knew
summer sunday nights
wed sink into our
seats right as
they dimmed out all the lights
a technicolor world made
out of music and machine
it called me to
be on that screen
and live inside each scene
without a nickel to my name
hopped a bus here i came
could be brave or just insane
well have to see
cause maybe in
that sleepy town
hell sit one day
the lights are down
hell see my face and think
of he used to know me
climb these hills im
reaching for the heights
and chasing all the
lights that shine
and when they let you down
youll get up off the ground
cause morning rolls around
and it another day of sun
i hear them every day
the rhythms in the canyons
thatll never fade away
the ballads in bar-rooms left
by those who came before
they say you got to
want it more
so i bang on every door
and even when the answer no
or when my money running low
the dusty mic and neon glow
are all i need
and someday as i sing my song
a small-town kidll come along
thatll be the thing to
push him on and go go
climb these hills im
reaching for the heights
and chasing all the
lights that shine
and when they let you down
youll get up off the ground
cause morning rolls around
and it another day of sun
and when they let you down
the morning rolls around
it another day of sun
it another day of sun
it another day of sun
sun sun sun sun
it another day of sun
just one more day of sun
it another day of sun
another day has just begun
it another day of sun
it another day of sun

those ivories let hit it
one two three four
that right
i walk alone the avenue
i never thought id
meet a girl like you
meet a girl like you
me
with auburn hair
and tawny eyes
the kind of eyes that
hypnotise me through
that hypnotise me through
and i ran i ran so far away
i couldnt get away
all right i remember you
and i would admit i was a
little curt that night
curt
okay i was an asshole
i can admit that
okay
but requesting i
ran from a serious
musician is just it too far
my lord did you just say
a serious musician
i dont think so
can i borrow what youre wearing
why
because i have an
audition next week
im playing a serious firefighter
so youre an actress
i thought you look
familiar have i seen
you on anything
a coffee shop on the warner
bros lot that classic
oh i see
yeah
youre a barista
and i can see how
you could then look
down on me from all
the way up there
next set
he doesnt i dont
he doesnt tell me what to do
he just told you what to
i know i let him
what is your name
mia
mia
i guess ill see
you in the movies
you know joseph campbell
yeah
i have this idea that
you were reimagining
goldilocks and the
three bears
from the perspective of the bears
you know it thrilling
it could be a franchise
right
so well we dont know if they were
cooped up up there we dont know
george michael
hello
sorry it i know that guy
did you get your keys
yes
can you grab mine
sorry what
will you be able to
grab my my keys
i cant hear you
sorry can you grab my keys
oh
please
oh there we go
thank you
youre welcome
what kind
it a prius
that doesnt help me
with a green ribbon
all right
those look comfortable
they are
thank you for saving
the day back there
well you didnt really
give me much of a choice
it pretty strange that we
keep running into each other
it is strange
maybe it means something
i doubt it
yeah i dont think so
where my car
put that thing to your chin
this
yeah
it makes your head
into an antenna
i think it gives you cancer
but you find your car faster
what
i mean you dont get
to live as long
but you get where youre going
quicker so it all evens out
that sounds terrible
just a suggestion
youre a real
what the word am i looking for
knight in shining armour
weirdo that was the word
okay
not much to look at huh
ive seen better
the sun is nearly gone
the lights are turning on
a silver shine that
stretches to the sea
we stumbled on a view
that tailor made for two
what a shame those
two are you and me
some other girl and guy
would love this swirling sky
but there only you and i
and weve got no shot
this could never be
youre not the type for me
really
and there not a
spark in sight
what a waste of a lovely night
you say there nothing here
well let make
something clear
i think ill be the
one to make that call
but youll call
and though you look so cute
in your polyester suit
it wool
youre right id never
fall for you at all
and maybe this appeals
to someone not in heels
or to any girl who feels there
some chance for romance
but im frankly
feeling nothing
is that so
or it could be
less than nothing
good to know so you agree
that right
what a way to waste
of a lovely night
hi greg
hi oh sorry im late
yeah very soon okay bye

you have a break
coming up do you

sorry
i actually do have
to check im sorry
that the window
that humphrey bogart
and ingrid bergman looked
out of in casablanca
wow
yeah
i cant believe you work right
across the street from there
yeah
that amazing
what was youre
youre bogart name
what his name is it greg
yeah greg
right how long have you been
weve been seeing each
other for about a month
that great
it sweet anyway i love being
around this stuff you know
i know what you mean i get
coffee 5 miles out of the way
just so i can be near a jazz club
really
yeah the van beek
do you know it
all the big swing
bands used to play
there count basie chick webb
anyway it a samba-tapas
place now so
what a samba-tapas place
you know it like a samba
place where they serve tapas
oh
yeah so the joke on history
i dont know that la
they just they worship
everything and they value nothing
were about to roll
stop please guys
youre rolling
yeah
they shoot movies on my street
all the time so no problem
come this way
right
it a lockdown
i love her
and here we go
hey mia how did
you get into this
and roll
get into what
you know movies acting
action
my aunt was an actress
oh okay
she was in a travelling
theatre company
i grew up in boulder city nevada
so across the street
from my house
there was this little library
that had an old movies section
so she she took me
and spent an entire
day watching all
these old movies
like notorious bringing
up baby casablanca
and
cut it there cut
check the tapes
we can talk now
she sounds incredible
she was incredible
and i would put
on all these plays
in my bedroom
and it would basically
just she and i
re-enacting the scenes
from the movies
and then i wrote my
own plays yeah
wow
i love it
so anyway i left college
after two years to come here
and my last audition
was for a teen soap
pitched as dangerous
minds meets the oc
so yeah shouldve been a lawyer
because the world
needs more lawyers
doesnt need more actresses
youre not just an actress
what do you mean
just an actress
you said it yourself you were
a child prodigy playwright
that is not what i said
well youre too modest
to say it but it true
so you could just write
your own roles you know
write something that as
interesting as you are
and you dont have to
audition for this pishi kaka
yeah
look at louis armstrong you know
he could have just
played the marching
band charts that he was given
but he didnt do it
what did he do
what did he do
he made history didnt he
well im gonna stop
auditioning and
im gonna make history instead
well my work is done here
i should probably tell
you something now
to get it out the way
i hate jazz
you okay
what do you mean you hate jazz
it just means that when i
listen to it i dont like it
yeah but it just a blanket
statement that you
dont like jazz
what are you doing right now
nothing
you know i just think
that when people say that
you know hate jazz
they just they dont
have context they
dont know where it
comes from you know
jazz was born in a little
flophouse in new orleans
and just because
people were crammed in
there they spoke five
different languages
they couldnt talk to each other
the only way that they could
communicate was with jazz
you know what about kenny g
what
what about kenny g i mean
what about elevator music
you know jazz music that i know
what about it
from my life
i just i mean find it relaxing
it not relaxing it not
it not
sidney bechet shot
somebody because
he told him he
played a wrong note
that hardly relaxing
where i grew up there was
this station called kjazz 03
and people would just
put on that station
when they had a cocktail party
right
and everyone would just
kind of talk over it
i know
yes it was
okay okay so i think
that that part of the
problem is that you cant
hear it you know
you have to see it you have
to see what at stake
i mean look at these fellas look
at the saxophonist right now
he just hijacked the song
he on his own trail
everyone of these
guys are composing
rearranging theyre writing
and theyre playing the
melody theyre just
and now look the trumpet
player he got his own idea
it so it conflict and it
compromise and it just
it new every time it
brand new every night
it very very exciting
and it dying
it dying mia it
dying on the vine
and the world says let
it die it had its time
well not on my watch
what are you gonna do
ill have my own club
really
yes
were gonna play whatever we
want whenever we want
however we want as
long as it pure jazz
hi this is mia dolan

i got a callback

come on for what
for a tv show the one i
was telling you about
the dangerous minds meets the oc

i just i dont know i
dont know if it safe there
yeah yeah
i dont know if it safe
im sorry
an immensity of our universe
for many days before
the end of our earth
people will look into the
night sky and notice a star
increasingly bright and
increasingly near
as this star approaches us
jim stark
ill go find a place im sorry
as this star approaches us
the weather will change
the great polar fields
of the north and south
will rot and divide and
the seas will turn warmer
the last of us search the
heavens and stand amazed
for the stars will
still be there
moving through their
i have an idea
what is that is that a script
it a play
a play
you better give us all roles
actually it a one woman show

wow is that gonna
happen every time
i think so

well i truly believe that
i made you something
for what
for your club
why does it say seb

what
because no one gonna come
to chicken on a stick
is that a music note
is it an apostrophe
yes
that pretty cool it got to
be chicken on a stick
because charlie parker
got his nickname
i know because he loves chicken
that why they call him bird
so im gonna have chicken beer
jazz chicken on a stick
i know i think you
should drop the chicken
and just have drinks
and jazz and
also there could be
im not dropping the chicken
you could maybe do
it somewhere else
find a new spot
it got to be the van beek
it doesnt have to
be the van beek
i cant let them samba
all over its history
i cant do it
you can let them
but you refuse to
your play incredible
you know the whole world

weird between you two

all right
so
here what we know
yeah
it definitely

here and youll be alright

yeah
because i have to rehearse
yeah but cant you
rehearse anywhere
anywhere you are
i mean i guess
well all my stuff is here

think really think
that would be
okay
the best idea right now but
right
i wish i could
were just gonna have
to try and see each
other you know so
that we see each other
i know but when are you done
what do you mean i mean
when youre finish
with the whole tour
after we finish were gonna go to
recording and then
well go back on tour
you know we tour so we
can make the records
so we can go back
to tour the record
so it like the long haul
what do you mean the long haul
i mean the long haul
that youre gonna
stay in this band for a long time
on tour
i mean what did you
think i was going to do
i dont
i hadnt really
thought it through
i didnt know that the band
would be important you didnt
think we would be successful
no that not really what i
mean i just mean that you
i mean youll be on tour
for what months now years
yeah i dont mean this is it
i mean this is it
could feasibly be
yeah for i could be
on tour with this
for a couple of years at
least just this record
do you like the music
youre playing
i dont
i dont know what
what it matters
well it matters because
if youre going to give
up your dream i think
it matters that you like
what youre playing
on the road for years
do you like the music that i play
yeah
i do
i just didnt think that you did
yeah well
you know you said
keith is the worst
and now youre gonna
be on tour with
him for years so i just didnt
i dont know what what
are you doing right now

why are you doing this
i dont what do you mean
why are you doing this
i thought you wanted me to do this
and it just sounds like now
you dont want me to do it
what do you mean i
wanted you to do this
this is what you wanted for me
to be in this band
to be in a band to
have a steady job

of course i wanted you
to have a steady job
so that you can take
care of yourself and
your life and you could
start your club

i dont understand
i mean why arent we celebrating
why arent you starting your club
you said yourself no one
wants to go to that club
no one wants to go to a club
called chicken on a stick
so change the name
well no one likes
jazz not even you
i do like jazz now because of you
and this is what i thought
you wanted me to do
what am i supposed to do go
back to playing jingle bells
im not saying that im
saying why dont you take
what youve made and
start the club
that people will wanna go to it

passionate about it
and people love what other
people are passionate about
you remind people of
what theyve forgotten

just tell us anything
anything
yes tell us a story
youre a storyteller
whenever youre ready
my aunt used to live in paris
i remember she used to come
home and she would tell us
these stories about
being abroad and
i remember she told us that she
jumped into the river once
barefoot
she smiled
leapt
without looking
and tumbled into
the seine
the water was freezing
she spent a month sneezing
but said she would do it again
here to the ones who dream
foolish as they may seem
here to the hearts that ache
here to the mess we make
she captured a feeling
sky with no ceiling
the sunset inside a frame
she lived in her liquor
and died with a flicker
ill always remember the flame
here to the ones who dream
foolish as they may seem
here to the hearts that ache
here to the mess we make
she told me a bit
of madeness is key
to give us new
colours to see
who knows where
it will lead us
and that why they need us
so bring on the rebels
the ripples from pebbles
the painters and
poets and plays
and here to the
fools who dream
crazy as they may seem
here to the
hearts that break
here to the mess we make
i trace it all back to then
her and the snow
and the seine
smiling trough it
she said shed do it
again
when do you find out
they said the next couple of days
but im not expecting
to find anything out
