raped mrs manion
her husband he a lieutenant
in the army--
there a temporary base in thunder bay
a gunnery or something--
the lieutenant goes to quill place
and plugs mr quill about five times
which causes mr quill to promptly die
of lead poisoning
when did this happen
a couple of nights ago
if you hadnt been out fishing
in some godforsaken backwater
youd have known about it
morning maida
oh there it is

before talking to lt manion

i think maybe you better cancel
all my appointments for today
what appointments people think

and spawn all by itself
may i have your attention

no no ill uh--
ill call you
let you know how things are going
dont let him pay you off
in purple hearts
those professional soldiers
never have a dime

yeah do you think itd be all right
if we talk in the sheriff office

would you mind taking
your glasses off mrs manion
did barney quill do that to you
mm-hmm more than that
you should see all over
you can put them back on
if it more comfortable for you
this is paulie biegler
this is the bucko paulie
hello there
hi manny
hello laura
mrs manion can you meet me down in
my office about 200 this afternoon
it 305 west barnham
of course
fine
is there anything
i can get you hon
im all right hon
right in here
wanted the big ten
they got the ten best-dressed dames
the ten top teams
the ten top tunes
and now the ten most wanted
dont knock it that the american
dream those boys made the grade
you were the
district attorney around here
werent you
ten years
what your experience
as a defense lawyer
not very much
how do i know you can handle my case
i guess you dont know
shall we talk about it
i suppose so
come on lieutenant
dont be so bored
it might very well be that no lawyer
can handle your case
if you mean
getting you off scot-free
you seemed to be forgetting
barney quill raped my wife
i have the unwritten law
on my side
the unwritten law a myth
lieutenant
there is no such thing
as the unwritten law
and anyone who commits a murder
on the theory that it does exist
has just bought himself room and board
in the state penitentiary
maybe for life
now with that in mind
perhaps we can proceed with a
few questions and answers that--
that uh--
can i borrow your lighter
we can proceed with a few questions and
answers that might help your defense
but it probably wont be
yes nice lighter
okay
how old are you
twenty-eight
how long have you been in the service
since 50
you see any action
korea
have any decorations
plenty
is this your first marriage
no
youre not on the witness stand
you dont have to answer yes or no
just give me the matrimonial rundown
is this necessary
ill be the judge of that
my first wife divorced me
charged cruelty
eating crackers in bed
you know the usual stuff
truth was
she found another guy
when i was in korea
i met laura four years ago
in georgia
we were married
right after her divorce
did you know the husband
he was in my outfit down there
you mean you were buddies
ill withdraw the question
it a little old-fashioned
have there been any children
by or from any of these marriages
no
any present prospects
not unless barney quill
started something
what kind of a gun did you use
war souvenir a luger
the police have it now
i suppose youve read the newspapers
the stories about your case
some of them
are they substantially correct
and you didnt see quill rape
and beat your wife
no no
when she got back
to the trailer
she told me what had happened
and how long was it before you went
over to quill and killed him
i dont know exactly
maybe an hour
that long huh
the newspapers say that your wife
volunteered to take a lie detector test
do you know anything about this
only what i read and what she told me
do you know how
the lie detector test turned out
they didnt tell her
yes sulo
we got lunch served for the jail
you want to eat with us
your sister still cook for the jail
oh sure she cooks
well you give her
my compliments sulo
ive got a luncheon date downtown
nice going mr biegler
ill be back after lunch
look im sorry
if i offended you a while ago
no youre not
come on bucko
thank you
pass the salt paulie
thank you
did you give the lieutenant
the well known lecture
if you mean did i coach him into
a phony story no
maybe youre too pure paul
too pure for the natural impurities
of the law
could be that you owe the lieutenant
the chance to find a defense
could also be that you might guide him
a little show him the way
and let him decide
if he wants to take it
want some salt
no im not ready
anyway im not the right lawyer
for this fellow
he insolent hostile--
you dont have to love him
just defend him
what the matter
dont you need a fee
you know something i think
you might be a little bit afraid
afraid of what
that you might get licked
you know there only one thing more
devious than a philadelphia lawyer
and that an irish lawyer
pass the salt
put it down
hello there
i usually answer to the name paul
you gonna have some more jokes
not unless you want to be
the comic
oh i brought you some cigarettes
oh thanks
peace
sure
fine fine now lieutenant
there are four ways
i can defend murder
number one it wasnt murder
it was suicide or accidental
number two you didnt do it number
three you were legally justified
like the protection of your home
or self-defense
number four
the killing was excusable
where do i fit in
to this rosy picture
ill tell you where you dont fit in
you dont fit in any of the first three
why why wouldnt i be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife
time element
if youd caught him in the act the
shooting might have been justified
but you didnt catch him in the act
and you had time to bring the police
and you didnt do that either
youre guilty of murder--
premeditated and with vengeance
that first-degree murder
in any court of law
are you telling me to plead guilty
when i advise a cop out youll know
cop out
that plead guilty and ask for mercy
if youre not telling me to cop out
what are you telling me to do
im not telling you to do anything
i just want you to understand
the letter of the law
go on
go on with what
whatever it is youre getting at
you know youre very bright
lieutenant
now let see how really bright
you can be
well im working at it
all right
now because your wife was raped
youll have a favorable atmosphere
in the courtroom
the sympathy will be with you
if all the facts are true
what you need is a legal peg so the jury
can hang their sympathy in your behalf
you follow me
what your legal excuse lieutenant
what your legal excuse
for killing barney quill
not justification
not justification
excuse
just excuse
what excuses are there
how should i know
youre the one that plugged quill
i mustve been mad
how that
i said i mustve been mad
no bad temper no excuse
i mean
i mustve been crazy
am i getting warmer
okay see you around
am i getting warmer
ill tell you that
after i talk to your wife
in the meantime see if you can
remember just how crazy you were
is mrs manion here yet
she been waiting quite a while
she been through all your albums
from dixieland to brubeck
what do you think of her
soft easy the kind men like
to take advantage of
and do
did you get any money
money
oh oh no
i havent decided
to take the case yet
you know you surprise me sometimes
why ive been around
i uh
hope you dont mind
i think wed better talk
youre a funny kind of a lawyer
the music i mean
arent lawyers supposed
to like music
well not that kind of music
oh i guess that settles it
im a funny kind of lawyer
where your home mrs manion
where did you go to school
where did you live when you were young
no place in particular
we sort of moved around
my father was a construction boomer
building dams mostly
you can call me laura
is your family still alive laura
no
i dont know i have
some cigarettes around here someplace
do you want a cigarette
no i want to offer you one
you could light it for me
oh yes
here
that just like your husband
he gave me this because i liked
the one he had
he like that
he gives me presents all the time
do you have a happy marriage
what went wrong
with the first marriage
well what when wrong is
when i went for manny
well that honest enough
it was more than just that like i said
i grew up on the move and
jack-that was my first husband--
jack didnt like to move
he wouldnt even take a transfer
when he had the chance
i was really bored
manny likes to go were always going
whenever we get the chance
weve been all over
im thirsty
water or would a beer do
i think a beer would do fine
maida bring me
a bottle of beer will you
are you married
no
that nice
what do you do alone in this house
if you arent married
well it a family home
and im the last of the family
there you are
thank you
arent you having one
no not right now
there you are
could muff have a little
in that ashtray he loves beer
you want a beer for the dog
well here we are
hell go to sleep now
isnt he cute
yeah
how about it
are you ready
i mean are you ready
to tell me the story
i know what you mean
now suppose you tell me everything
you told the state police
plus everything you didnt tell
the state police
where should i begin
when did you leave for quill bar
right after dinner
about 830 i guess
manny was late getting home
from the firing range
so we had dinner
he laid down and went to sleep
i hadnt been out of the trailer
all day so
i took muff and a flashlight
and walked over to the bar
i bought a drink
and played the pinball machine
many people in the bar
mm-mm not many
barney came over
and challenged me to a game
for drinks you know
how well did you know barney
well he owned this bar where
manny and i went sometimes that all
had he ever made a pass at you
no nothing like that at all
was he drinking heavily that night
didnt seem to be at least
not when we were playing pinball
were you with him
the whole time you were there
no there were other people
playing too
and what time did you leave the bar
oh about   00 i guess
i left by the side door
muff was carrying the flashlight
he carries it in his mouth
he so cute
running along ahead
with the light shining
was he sober
muff of course he was sober
oh youre joking now
arent you
yes im joking
go on
well barney came from somewhere
not the door i left by
and he said he was going my way
and he could drive me home
he said the bears had been prowling
around and i oughtnt to walk home
the bears come out of the woods
at night to scavenge
theyre harmless enough
arent they
yeah i suppose i wouldnt have been
afraid in the daylight
but the dark isnt the same
yes i know i know
now you got into barney car--
i got in and he drove
straight to the trailer park
he made overtures
no nothing
when we got to the trailer park
the auto gate was closed
mr lemon closes it
about   00 or a little after
so i thanked barney
and started to get out of the car
but he said that there wasnt
any need for me to walk
that he could drive me into the park
on another road
i didnt know
there was another road but
he drove on before
i could say yes or no
were you alarmed
no
im not usually afraid of men
and anyway he hadnt touched me
or even said anything out of the way
well doesnt a woman sort of
instinctively know
when a fellow on the make
oh sure
but that only usual with me
with men i mean almost all men
ever since i was a kid
you for instance
youre interested
but there no reason
to be afraid of you
it was like that with barney
well mrs manion believe me
im not in the least--
call me laura
laura im only interested
in helping your husband nothing more
i dont mean youd try anything
i just mean it--
it the way you look at me
it would be very difficult
not to look at you
oh the way i dress you mean
you dont like it
oh i love it
i just love it
now wed better keep moving along
with this thing
now how were you dressed that night
oh in a sweater like this
and a skirt
and the rest-what about that
underneath i had on a slip
and panties and a bra
no girdle
i dont need a girdle
do you think i do
i dont know i dont know
how should i--
look im only concerned
with a few facts
that might be of help to me
in the defense of your husband
that all
well i dont wear one
okay no girdle okay
all right go on
well he turned off the highway
into a lane in the woods
and he stopped the car
and turned off the lights
and then he grabbed me
and he said
im going to rape you
just like that
did he use those words
exactly those words
muff began to bark
so he threw him out the window
i could hear little muffy whining
outside the car all through it
and barney began to try
to get at me
and i fought him off as best i could
but he was terribly strong
did you cry out
did you scream
didnt seem to be much use
out there in the woods
he began to shout names at me like
army slut and other names
and then he drew back
and hit me with his fist
he hit me again
and i didnt fight anymore
i must have been only
half-conscious but
i know that he tore my panties off
and did what he wanted
now the newspaper said
that a doctor examined you
and said that he didnt think
youd been raped
i dont care what the doctor thought
a woman doesnt mistake these things
all right all right
now go ahead
well i--
i dont know exactly what happened then
i mustve fainted but
the next thing i remember
the car was moving
barney was driving very fast
and he was breathing hard
an ugly gasping sound
we were on the main road
to the trailer park
and he swung in by the gate
and stopped
i opened the door to get out muffy
jumped out first with a flashlight
now wait a minute
i thought you said hed thrown muff
out of the car back in the woods
well he did but muff was in the car
when we got back
he mustve let him back in
i dont remember
all right you opened the door
and muff got out first all right
before i could get out
barney grabbed me and said he was gonna
tear all my clothes off
and attacked me again
i got away and ran i could see muff
through an opening in the fence
he was scooting back and forth
with a flashlight
barney caught me from behind
and i fell to the ground
he fell on top of me and began
to beat me again with his fists
i thought he was going to kill me
i screamed and somehow got
to my feet again and ran
i went through the opening
in the fence
and followed muffy who was running
along ahead with the flashlight
and i kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer
and you didnt see barney again
never laid eyes on him again
dead or alive
well i uh--
i think that enough for now
ive got lots of time
all you want
where can i reach you
im still in thunder bay
but i can drive down again
in the morning
was there something else
no
-thanks for letting me play the records
-oh youre very welcome
thanks a lot
bye
who that
the lady in the case
youre not going to take the case
i dont know
that depends on what manion
has to tell me tomorrow
he thinking things out
oh well that more like it
now if i take the case
i want you in it
me in a big murder case
the sight of this whisky-drinking man
at the lawyer table would ruin you
i need you
you mean that
why else would he say it
id be glad to work with you
outside of the courtroom but
not in the courtroom
suit yourself about that
either way im gonna have
to be able to depend on you
will you lay off the booze
i dont know
i dont know about that paulie
why dont you know
do you think i couldnt
lay off the booze

will you be around tonight
yeah
yeah ill be around
you know maida darling
i might manage it
i might manage to be
a real lawyer again
for a little while anyway
i tried remembering
there were still some pieces missing
i remember
going to quill bar with a gun
and i remember quill face
behind the bar
but i dont remember anything else
not even going home
dont you remember firing the gun five
shots that a lot of noise to forget
yeah i remember hearing shots
but they dont seem connected with me
they seemed far away like
somebody else was doing the shooting
lt manion ill take your case
oh thanks
thanks mr biegler
all right now there
the little matter of the fee
three thousand dollars
that reasonable enough isnt it
oh sure more than reasonable ill
have to pay later right now im broke
youre what
im broke im flat busted
i dont have three dollars
much less 3000
can you raise it
oh yes as soon as i get out of jail
but next week payday
ill be able to give you $ 50
and if you get me off ill give you
a promissory note for the rest
all right now suppose i dont go along
with you unless you pay me half the fee
well ill have to take a lawyer
the court appoints
i got my defense now right
insanity
i think ill stick around
make damn sure you get off
where do we start
were going to need a psychiatrist
neither of us has any money do you
think the armyll stir one up for you
i know a colonel in the pentagon
ill write a letter
good do that sulo
where are you going now
im going to see your wife
for one thing
why didnt you see her yesterday
that right i did
she a very pretty woman
your wife
a man gets used to
the way his wife looks
i guess he does
ill see you
come on in paulie
come on in
you havent been in here
since you vacated have you
hardly recognize the old place huh
mary did it for me she just finished
her decorators course
smart girl very smart girl
look at this
a real genuine picasso print
that very nice
and here try this chair
it sort of does things for you
sit right down
great isnt it
good for the nerves they say
how do you shut it off
here
here we are feel better
i feel all shook up
mitch i just dropped in to tell you
ive got both feet in the manion case
youre going to cop out arent you
no
that a mistake
it open and shut
well maybe well see
judge maitland still in the hospital
maybe youd like to agree
to a continuance
until he gets back
if we go with the case now
well have to try before
some grab-bag judge theyll send in
me id rather have maitland
so would i
but thatd also mean my client
would lie around in jail
for another two three months
before the trial
now if youll drop the charge
down to manslaughter
so i can get him out on bail
well agree to a continuance
you wouldnt do that
if you were still da
i dont know i might
i might since a big fat
lie detector test on his wife
is giving proof to the rape story
hed have the jury with him
how did you know what the lie--
i bit didnt i
yeah you did
anyway the result of a lie detector
test isnt admissible evidence
you cant use it
no but it carries moral weight
mitch i wouldnt sit
in that chair too much
it could shake a fellow brains loose
ill see you later
he remembers you paul
he likes you
he likes the beer in my icebox
what the occasion today
a buffalo hunt
i bought these in arizona
when we were stationed there
arent they smart
i think theyre very smart
here we can sit in my car
here you are
here you go muff
several things have occurred to me
the uh--
the undergarments
barney quill tore off--
who has them now
the police
you mean my panties
all right your panties
i havent seen them since
i gave the torn skirt and sweater
to the police and then
i went with them up that lane into
the woods to look for the panties
but we couldnt find anything
but my glasses
your glasses you mean you were
wearing glasses through all that
no i had them
in a case in my hand
i wear them for reading
playing pinball things like that
i must have tried to get
out of the car and dropped them
you might be interested to know
that your lie detector test

sometimes when manny was sleeping
id come out here and just sit
i had to get out of that trailer
i couldnt stand being cooped up
im-im lonely paul
im awful lonely
i wouldnt have gone to that roadhouse
if it werent for that you know
maybe you were getting in
some good practice being lonely
you mean you think maybe
manny wont get off
thatll be up to the jury
and you can never tell about them
if he didnt
itd be one way to end it
no i dont mean that
i may think it sometimes
but i dont really want it

no thank you laura
im sorry i had to spoil your fun
over at that place
good night laura
good night
hear ye hear ye hear ye
the circuit court for the county
of iron cliffs is now in session
you can be seated
for those of you i havent met
my name is weaver
im from downstate
and im sitting temporarily
while your good judge maitland
is recovering from a severe illness
there no need to dwell
at length upon my methods
one judge is quite like another
the only difference is maybe
in the state of their digestions
or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench
for myself
i can digest pig iron
and while i might appear
to doze occasionally
youll find that
im easily awakened
particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer
with a nice point of law
we will now take up
the criminal docket
case number one--
the people v clarence madigan--
breaking and entering
in the nighttime
will the defendant rise
and come forward
that me your honor
state of michigan
court of iron cliffs
i mitchell lodwick prosecuting
attorney come into iron cliffs
and give the court to understand
that one clarence madigan
alias  one-shot madigan
alias  smoky madigan
did break and enter the dwelling house
of casper katz
and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises
does mr madigan have an attorney
no a man gotta have money to ask
them fellas the time of day
mr madigan
if youre impoverished
it my duty to appoint an attorney
on your behalf
i wouldnt bother your honor
i stole the whisky
im guilty as hell
it was a full case of
expensive bourbon your honor
did you sell this whisky
no i drank it
all of it
you betjudge
are you aware that it will be
necessary to punish you for this crime
it was worth it
well ill accept your plea
of guilty mr madigan
youll be sentenced later
you may now return to your place
thanks your honor
case number two--
the people v frederick manion
the charge-murder
paul biegler for the defendant
my formal appearance is already on file
which of these men
is your client mr biegler
none of them
sheriff will you produce
the prisoner
well i-im afraid
i cant do that your honor
perhaps someone should explain
im not clairvoyant
the defendant is in detroit
being examined by a psychiatrist
shouldnt the court
have been consulted
before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction
your honor were dealing
with the army in this matter
this is the only crack they would
give us at one of their psychiatrists
the court was not present it was urgent
we get the defendant to a psychiatrist
what does the attorney for the people
say to this
it was done with my knowledge
ive always heard this upper pennisula
of our fair state was a queer place
if it customary here to allow a man
charged with first degree murder
to wander about at will i dont suppose
it behooves an outsider to point out
that the law makes no provision
for such quaint liberalism
the defendant is in the care of a deputy
and will be returned this afternoon
well formally arraign the defendant
on his return
for the sake of the docket
can you give me a clue to his plea
the defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute
a plea of not guilty
will be entered
the case of frederick manion will be
placed first on the trial docket
can you hurry it up paulie
if somebody tells that judge
the prisoner was lounging around the
rail station hell give me the works
this will just take a minute
come on over here
well lieutenant
howd things turn out
i was temporarily insane
did he tell you that
yeah says he gonna
write you a letter
i took some notes on my own
the doctor name is smith
anatole ludwig smith
or ludwig von smith i hope
a name like that
would impress the jury
just plain matthew smith
he said that when i shot quill
i was suffering from
dissociative reaction
sounds pretty good doesnt it
what does it mean
it means  i had an irresistible
impulse to shoot quill
that okay isnt it
what did he say about your knowing
the difference between right and wrong
i dont think he said anything
why is that important
wed better not keep
the sheriff waiting youd better go
thank you sheriff
ever heard of a michigan court accepting
irresistible impulse as insanity
no maybe wed better
switch to self-defense
even mitch lodwick would make
a monkey out of us then
damn strawberry soda
want a peanut
no thanks
well tomorrow saturday
we just have a weekend before the trial
when do you want to start working
tomorrow morning early
paulie
hey listen to this parn
never mind that
just find
people v durfee 622
michigan 486 year  886
that it i have it right here
in the alr listen
the right and wrong test
though deemed unscientific
is adhered to by most states but--
now listen to this  but --
but the fact that one accused
of committing a crime
may have been able to comprehend
the nature and the consequences
of this act
and to know that it was wrong
nevertheless--
sweet enduring word  nevertheless
nevertheless if he was forced
to its execution
by an impulse-by an impulse
which he was powerless to control
he will be excused from punishment
the michigan supreme court
did accept irresistible impulse
this is precedent
boy i think weve got
a hold of something here
good old durfee  886
how about that
give me a pad
this strawberry soda is beginning
to taste like real bourbon whisky
well dont get drunk yet
weve got to convince a jury
that our client was
irresistibly impulsed
remember that
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
before we proceed further
it will be necessary for me
to examine you on your qualifications
to sit as jurors
will you please remember
that you are under oath
are all of you citizens
will you please
raise your hand if you are not
are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you
no
are any of you related
by blood or marriage
to any law enforcement officer
so much for qualifications
i will now examine for cause
do any of you have
any business pending
with the prosecuting attorney
mitchell lodwick
do any of you have any business pending
with paul biegler
attorney for the defense
are any of you acquainted
with the defendant
sitting there on mr biegler left
will mrs laura manion
the defendant wife please stand
do any of you know mrs manion
thank you mrs manion
you may be seated
counsel may challenge the jury
for cause
before counsel challenge may i
introduce claude dancer to the court
mr dancer is an assistant
attorney general from lansing
because of the peculiar nature
of this case
i requested the attorney general to let
mr dancer sit in with the prosecution
your reputation precedes you
mr dancer
it a privilege to have you
in my court
thank you
im sure itll be instructive
do any of you have
any business pending
before the
attorney general office
i must apologize for
my disparaging remarks
about the upper pennisula
and its customs
ive seldom seen a murder jury selected
and sworn in less than half a day
you have won my heart
completely gentlemen
mr dancer you asked for the recess
what your problem
it was a little suggestion
i wanted to make
by all means
since the defense plea is insanity
the prosecution has retained
a psychiatrist
under the statute we have a right
to petition for a mental exam
of the defendant
by our own doctor
are you familiar with that statute
uh-huh moderately
i think it would only delay things
to file a formal petition
so why dont we informally agree
to ask his honor for an adjournment
only a day or so and our doctor
can visit with the defendant
it would save everyone time
dont you think so
im sure it will
good
suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway
of course youre a little late
maybe his honor will overlook that
then id like the jury to see that you
think our insanity plea has some merit
there really wont be any need
for our doctor to examine your client
naturally i was only following
the usual procedure
naturally im all for it
do you wish to file the petition
yes your honor--
that wont be necessary
that right
skirmish over shall we join now
on the field of battle
the body of quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds
one of the bullets had passed
through the heart
death in my opinion
was almost instantaneous
and was directly caused
by this wound
dr raschid may i have
your detailed report
certainly
i ask that this report be marked
people exhibit one for identification
so received and marked
the people hand the defense
a copy of the report
counsel may cross-examine
dr raschid your primary purpose
was to ascertain the cause of death
was it not
yes
and yet i read in your report here
that you checked to determine
whether spermatogenesis was occurring
in the body of the deceased
objection
the people call this witness
only to show the cause of death
your honor the entire report
was offered as evidence
and the report contains this information
about spermatogenesis
overruled mr lodwick
the witness may answer
yes i made that examination
on the deceased
and now would you tell
the court your findings
spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death
in other words the deceased in life
was not sterile
he could produce children
that is correct
now doctor if a woman says
that she has had intercourse
with a certain man
and the man is proved fertile
even though no evidence
is found in the woman body
could a lawyer--
say a prosecuting attorney--
could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying
your honor i object
to this line of questioning
were not concerned with if there has
been relations with a man and a woman
as long as an examination
for spermatogenesis has been made
at least were entitled
to know why
overruled you may answer
yes prosecution could use that
though it certainly would not be
conclusive that she was lying
why not
there could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative
the use of a contraceptive
or possibly there was no completion
on the part of the man
now this postmortem
were you also asked to determine
if the deceased had reached a
sexual climax shortly before his death
-no sir
-could you have made this determination
oh yes
so you were only asked to make
such an examination
that might be useful to the prosecution
none that might help the defense
i object your honor
the question is argumentative
counsel is trying to impugn the intent
of the representatives of the people
mr biegler you must be aware
that the question is improper
i withdraw the question
and apologize
the question and answer
will be stricken
and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer
that all
no redirect
the people now call
lloyd burke
will the witness
step forward please
how can a jury disregard
what it already heard
they cant lieutenant
do you solemnly swear
the testimony you shall give
shall be the truth
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
sit down please
will you state your profession
im a commercial photographer
were you called upon
by the police
to take photographs of the body
of the deceased bernard quill
before and after he was removed
from the scene of death
yes sir
were these photographs
of the deceased made by you
they were
the recorder will please mark
these people exhibit 282-d
photos are tendered to the defense
for examination
and the people move their admission
as evidence your witness
no questions no objections
paul he took pictures
of me that night too
just a minute mr burke
these photos offered as evidence are
they the only ones you took that night
why no
i suppose the others
didnt turn out
all my pictures turn out
of course
i beg your pardon
did you give the other pictures
to the police
i did
what were they
were they side shots
or a shot of the moon perhaps
or a black bear scavenging
the thunder bay dump
i object i cant see how
other photographs are relevant
the photos were introduced to show
the deceased met with a violent death
i should think any photo pertaining
to the case would be relevant
the point is good mr biegler
continue
what were these
other photographs of
lieutenant manion wife
you mean they showed how she looked
after barney quill was killed
yes
how she looked is irrelevant
there no evidence to connect
mrs manion appearance to this murder
sustained
im sorry
i just wanted to make sure prosecution
wasnt withholding evidence
now look here
i protest to the defense attorney
persistent attacks
on the motives
of the prosecution
the jury will disregard the mark
made by the defense attorney
there no reason to believe
that the prosecution
has not acted in good faith
my apologies to the prosecution
and to the court
but your honor
as long as protests are being made
id like to make a protest myself
im perfectly willing to take on these
two legal giants anytime anyplace
but in all fairness
it ought to be one at a time
i dont want these two fellas pitching
knuckleballs at me at the same time
it seems to me youre batting
close to a thousand
but your point is well taken
whichever attorney opens
with the witness
he alone shall continue with that
witness until the witness is excused
thank you your honor
no more questions
no questions
my were drawing well arent we
where parnell
parnell isnt he here
no he not here not in his rooming
house and hasnt been there all night
you were the last to see him
where is he
i promised not to tell so dont ask
he hasnt fallen off the wagon
no he was sober
has he gone somewhere
he did borrow my car
for something or other
your car that was smart
he hasnt driven a car in 20 years
hell kill himself
now where he gone
my word is my bond
good morning ladies and gentlemen
you may proceed
your honor
the defense notices a third person
at the prosecution table
were wondering if the court shares
our curiosity as to just who he is
i was about to introduce him
your honor this gentlemen
is dr w gregory harcourt
dr harcourt is the people
psychiatrist in this case
we ask that dr harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer
what are you going to
have him observe--
the constellation oftaurus
or the life and times of a bumblebee
to observe the defendant of course
that fine
the defense has no objection
i just wish to express my relief
that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from lansing
call alphonse paquette
raise your right hand
do you solemnly swear the testimony
you give in this case
shall be the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
take a seat please
will you state your name
alphonse paquette
you work at the thunder bay inn
im bartender there
were you working the night that barney
quill was shot by frederick manion
i was
were you witness to the shooting
i was
will you tell us in your own words
what happened
i was at a table by the door
when lt manion came in
did you know lt manion
by sight and name
go ahead
well he came in and walked
over to the bar and began to shoot
he shot barney when he came
up to the bar
and when barney fell he kept on shooting
at barney behind the bar
then he turned around and walked out
when lt manion entered the bar
how did he appear to you
well he walked slow kind of deliberate
i guess you could say
did he speak to barney quill
not a wordjust walked over
and pulled out his gun
and bang
and then he walked out
yes
when he walked out
how did he appear to you
he seemed just like he did
when he walked in--
like he was the mailman
delivering the mail
when lt manion walked
out of the bar what did you do
well it happened so fast
i guess i was stunned
but then i ran out after him
did you find him outside
yes sir he was walking away
did you speak to him
yes sir i said  lieutenant
youd better not run away from this
did he reply to you
he said
do you want some too buster
was he pointing the gun at you
he was holding the gun in my direction
but the muzzle was low
when he said
do you want some too buster
how was that expressed
did he shout it
was it hysterical
was he hoarse
did his voice tremble
no sir he just said it
cool and hard and looked right at me
did he appear to you
as far as you could tell
to be in complete possession
of his faculties
yes sir as far as i could tell
your witness
mr paquette did you see laura manion
in the bar that night
there he goes again
this is immaterial and irrelevant
i dont see why the prosecution
so jumpy i havent gone anyplace yet
let see where he going
before we start objecting
you may proceed
did you see mrs manion
in the bar that night
she was there
did barney quill leave that night
yes
do you remember when he returned
i think he came back around midnight
now from which entrance did he come
did he come from the lobby entrance
or come from that outside entrance
it was from the lobby
and how did he appear to you then
how do you mean
you understood the prosecution well
when he asked you that question
about lt manion appearance
oh well he was just
old barney like usual
you mean he was just good old sober
reliable gentle
salt-of-the-earth
friend-to-man barney
your honor what kind
of a question is that
i withdraw the question your honor
had barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar
i dont remember
might his clothing have been different
when he returned--
that is might he
have changed his clothes
i didnt notice
was barney drinking that night
well he always had a few shots
while he was talking to the customers
he friendly
oh sure he was good old barney
now how many shots would you say
good old barney usually had
i dont know
wasnt he in fact pretty loaded
that night
objection even if the deceased
was dead drunk
it no defense to this charge
sustained
i suggest you get off this
what would you call a man with
an insatiable penchant for women
a what
a penchant a desire
taste passion
well a ladies man i guess
or maybe just a damn fool
just answer the questions
the attorneys will provide
the wisecracks
well what else would you call
a man like that
we cant see the drift of this
you mean you do see
you may answer
can you think of another name
woman chaser
try again
masher
oh come now
mashers went out with whalebone corsets
and hairnets
did you ever hear
the expression  wolf
sure i heard that
it just slipped my mind
well naturally it would
clanking around in there
with all those rusty old  mashers
have you ever known a man
you could call a wolf
im not sure
was barney quill a wolf
i couldnt say
or wouldnt
objection
sustained
the question was answered
he said he couldnt tell you
mr paquette when barney returned
from wherever he had gone
did he relieve you at the bar
yes
and what did he say then
he said  ill take over
when you came out from behind the bar
where did you go
i went over to the table
where the pedersons were sitting
now you testified that you were
by the door when lt manion came in
is that the reason you were by the door
because the pedersons table was there
yes
and how long was it
before lt manion came in
i dont know exactly
maybe 30 minutes
and you remained at
the pedersons table all that time
yes theyre friends of mine
is there a window beside that table
i think so
you think so
how long have you worked
at the thunder bay inn
about six seven years
does this window beside the table
suddenly vanish and reappear and
come and go in a ghostly fashion
it there all the time
while you were talking to your friends
there did you look out of the window
-i might have
-were you looking for something special
no i wasnt looking for anything
didnt barney quill tell you to go to
that window and look out for lt manion
did he tell you to look out
for lt manion
he did not
barney was quite a marksmen
wasnt he with guns
he won a lot of prizes
did he keep any guns
behind the bar
he might have
isnt it a fact there are three
concealed pistol racks behind the bar
the defendant plea is one of insanity
not self-defense
im sure mr biegler hasnt forgotten
that fact mr lodwick
you may answer
are there concealed gun racks
behind the bar
yes
and how many people know
about these gun racks
i couldnt say
isnt it a fact
that barney would take the guns out
of the racks and twirl them
to demonstrate his skill
to the patrons
i dont remember
come on
try and remember
did you ever see him do that yourself
once or twice he did
that all
no further questions
the witness may step down
call george lemon
biegler going off
in all directions
what he getting at
i have a feeling he afraid
of what well get at
mr biegler putting up
a smoke screen for some reason
i do
take a seat please
will you state your name please
george lemon
what kind of work do you do
im caretaker of the tourist park
in thunder bay
i see the place is clean
and orderly
i check people in and out
and lock the gate at night
and what is your authority
for these duties
im paid by madison township
and im also a deputy sheriff
just courtesy sort of
did you see lt manion
on the night of the  5th
the night barney quill was killed
yes sir
will you tell the court
about how and when
you saw lt manion
about  00 am a knock on my door
waked me up
i went to the door and lt manion
was standing there
he said  you better take me mr lemon
because i just shot barney quill
i told him to go back to his trailer
and that i would call the state police
how did lt manion appear to you
when he asked you to take him
he said what he had to say
and did what i told him no fuss
did he appear to you to be--
as far as you could tell--
in complete possession
of his faculties
as far as i could tell
yes sir
take the witness
mr lemon did you go
to the manions trailer
-yes sir
-did you see mrs manion at the trailer
yes sir
what was her appearance
she was a mess
objection
no evidence has been introduced to make
mrs manion appearance relevant
no evidence has been introduced to make
barney quill appearance relevant
but you didnt object
to the question then
is that because you know barney quill
bathed and changed
after he raped and beat hell
out of this poor woman
your honor everybody in this court
is being tried except mr manion
now listen this is a cross-examination
murder case not a high school debate
what are you trying to do
railroad this soldier into the clink
mr biegler you are
an experienced attorney
and you know better
than to make such an outburst
i will not tolerate intemperance
of this sort
if you once again try the patience
of this court
i shall hold you in contempt
sorry
your honor
i apologize and
it wont happen again
the witness answer
will be stricken
and the jury will disregard
the answer
now you may proceed
mr biegler
yes sir
on the night when lt manion
awakened you and turned himself in
had you been awakened before-had
anything else disturbed your slumbers
no sir
there were no soldiers singing
no sir not in my park
after  000
there were no women screaming
those screams were down by the gate
objection
i see no reason for objecting yet
tell us about those screams
i didnt hear them myself there were
tourists from ohio in the park
and they heard them
and told me about it the next day
now mr lodwick
this testimony is incompetent
hearsay irrelevant
immaterial inconclusive--
well that too much for me
the witness is yours mr lodwick
huh
no questions
the witness may step down
call your next witness
detective sergeantjames durgo
hi paulie
hijim come here
as soon as we break youd better phone
that army psychiatrist
-tell him to be here day after tomorrow
-will do
will you please tell me
where parnell has gone
wont do
well youre fired
you cant fire me
till you pay me
detective sergeantjames durgo
of the state police
were you called to thunder bay by
deputy sheriff lemon ofthunder bay
on the night barney quill
was killed
yes sir my companion officer and i
were the first to be called in
when you arrived at the manion trailer
who was there
lt manion and his wife were there
what did lt manion say to you
he said that his wife had had
some trouble with barney quill
he had gone to the tavern
and shot quill
he asked us whether quill was dead
or not we told him he was
how did lt manion
take this information
he didnt seem surprised
what did you do then
i asked for the gun hed used
did you take lt manion to the county
jail here in iron city that same night
yes sir we drove the lieutenant
down with his wife
on the drive to iron city did manion
talk further about the shooting
he remarked that if he had the whole
thing to do over hed still do it
during all this at the trailer
the drive to iron city
how did lt manion appear to you
he was very quiet most of the time
seemed clearheaded
would you say he was in complete
possession of his faculties
seemed so to me
your witness
sergeant durgo you testified
that lt manion told you
he shot barney quill after he learned
his wife had some trouble with quill
were these the words lt manion
used  some trouble
no sir those were my words
not his
and was it your notion to come here
and use your own words
no sir
and was the suggestion to call it
some trouble
made by somebody here
in the courtroom
yes sir
sergeant would you tell the court
what words lt manion actually used
to describe the trouble
his wife had had
objection
weve been over this before
this information would not be relevant
to any issues before the court
this statement concerning some trouble
was brought out
during the direct examination
of sergeant durgo
up to now youve adroitly restricted
all testimony
as far as laura manion concerned
all right the cat out of the bag
it fair game for me to chase it
this is a sore point mr biegler
and it getting sorer
id like to hear
from the prosecution
burden is on defense to prove temporary
insanity at the time of the shooting
now if the reason for the alleged
insanity is important to this case
then that is a matter
for a competent witness--
an expert on the subject
of the human mind
what the defense is trying to do
is introduce
some sensational material
for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues
how can the jury accurately estimate
the testimony being given here
unless they first know the reason
behind this whole trial--
why lt manion shot barney quill
the prosecution would like to separate
the motive from the act
that like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin
now the core of our defense is that
the defendant temporary insanity
was triggered by the so-called trouble
with quill
and i beg the court--
i-i beg the court
to let me cut into the apple
our objection still stands
your honor
objection overruled
sergeant durgo
tell the court
how lt manion described
the trouble his wife had with quill
he told us that quill
had raped his wife
now can you recall generally what
lt manion told you about this rape
yes sir he said hed been asleep
right after dinner
he was waked up by some noise--
screams he thought
he got up opened the trailer door
and went outside
his wife came running out of the dark
and fell into his arms
as you saw his wife in the trailer
how did she look
she was a little hysterical
shed been pretty badly beaten up
she had big black bruises
all over her face and arms
did mrs manion tell you
about this rape and beating
she did
did she take you to where it happened
yes the next morning
did you find anything there pertaining
to the story mrs manion told you
on the lane in the woods we found
some tire tracks and some dog tracks
and a leather case with
some horn-rimmed glasses inside
we also looked for
a certain undergarment of mrs manion
but we didnt find it
will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench
mr biegler youve finally got
your rape into the case
i think all the details should now
be made clear to the jury
do you agree mr lodwick
absolutely
what exactly was the undergarment
just referred to
panties your honor
do you expect this to come up again
yes sir
there a certain light connotation
attached to the word  panties
can we find another name for them
i never heard my wife
call them anything else
mr biegler
im a bachelor your honor
that a great help
mr dancer
i was overseas during the war
i learned a french word
im afraid that might be
slightly suggestive
most french words are
all right gentlemen
back to your places
for the benefit of the jury but more
especially for the spectators
the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was to be exact
mrs manion panties
i wanted you to get your snickering
over and done with
this pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial
and when it happens there will not be
one laugh one snicker
one giggle or even one smirk
in my courtroom
there isnt anything comic
about a pair of panties
which figure in the violent death
of one man
and the possible incarceration
of another
proceed mr biegler
did you give mrs manion
a lie detector test
objection a polygraph test is
inadmissible evidence in our courts
i only asked if he gave the test
i didnt ask the results
he may answer that
i gave her a lie detector test
at her request
now after all this investigation
did you believe mrs manion
i did
even after the lie detector test
that question constitutes flagrant
subterfuge on part of the defense
objection sustained
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
a polygraph or lie detector test
is not admissible in evidence
because no one
has ever been quite sure
that some people couldnt lie
to a lie detector and get away with it
go ahead
in any case you yourself
in your own heart and mind
are quite convinced
of mrs manion honesty
yes sir
that all
just a moment
did you look for the panties elsewhere
other than the lane in the woods
we looked in barney quill car
his room in the hotel
we didnt find them
do you know why mrs manion
requested a lie detector test
i know what she said
what
she wanted everyone to believe her story
because she knew itd help her husband
was that the only reason she gave
said she swore to her husband said she
wanted everyone else to believe it too
one moment please
ask him in what manner she swore
did mrs manion say how
she had sworn to her husband
yes sir she said
she had sworn on a rosary
this lane in the woods
what it used for where does it go
it used to be a logging road
it doesnt go anyplacejust stops
who uses it now
i think it a road
kids drive down to park
you mean it a lovers lane
i think so
the witness is yours
no more questions
the witness may step down
in view of evidence concerning rape
which your honor
has ruled admissible
the prosecution asks for
a 30-minute recess
in order to bring in another witness
we had not anticipated using
all right
well take a 30-minute recess
recess
why didnt you tell me
about that rosary
i forgot it
we didnt forget it manny said maybe
we shouldnt tell that again
it might have looked like something
else-like i didnt believe her
how much more didnt you tell me
we told you everything else
is that right laura
oh yes everything else
now get this both of you
when you get up on that stand
i want you to tell the truth
i dont want you to tell anything
but the truth
dont try and lie or conceal anything
or you get skinned alive
this fellow dancer gonna move in
dr dompierre did you have occasion
to come to the county jail
on the night of august  5 this year
i did
who called you to the jail
the police authorities
what did they want you to do
they wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm
on the person
of a mrs frederick manion
i made the test
what was your conclusion
negative there was none
your witness
in making these tests did you notice
any bruises or marks on mrs manion
i did
were you asked to determine
the reason for these bruises
i was not
where did you do the lab work
st margaret hospital
in the city
who worked up the slides for you
technician at the hospital
wouldnt it have been better
to have these slides worked up by
a pathologist or expert in this field
yes but the police
were in a hurry
i happened to know this young fella
came on at 700 in the morning
wouldnt it have been especially better
to wait for the expert
if the possible question of rape
hung on the result
it would have been
in the newspaper of august  6
it was stated that you found
no evidence of rape is that true
it is not true
i made no such statement
but did you form an opinion as to
whether mrs manion had been raped
no
why didnt you form an opinion
it impossible to tell if a mature
married woman has been raped
that all
did you have an opinion about whether
she had any recent relations with a man
well as far as no sperm
was present
it didnt appear she had
a recent relation with a man
that all
-just one more question doctor
the fact that no evidence was present
in her body
does not mean that
she was not raped does it
no
do you know what constitutes rape
under the law
yes sir
violation is sufficient for rape
there need not be a completion
no further questions
the witness may step down
the people recall alphonse paquette
to the stand
since counsel for the defense
has forced the question of rape
it becomes necessary to take this
additional testimony from mr paquette
youre still under oath mr paquette
mr paquette
would you take a look at mrs manion
seated there behind the defense table
was she dressed in this manner
the night of the shooting
no
how was she dressed
she had on a real tight skirt and
sweater kind of thing sort of glued on
she was wearing red shoes
with high heels
was she wearing hose
no she was bare-legged
was she wearing a hat
no
what kind of hair does mrs manion
have under that hat
wed be very happy to show the court
mrs manion hair
mrs manion would you
take off your hat please
thank you mr biegler
was she wearing glasses
that night
i think she was
when she played pinball
considering the tight skirt and
the tight sweater and the bare legs
what was the result
in her appearance
would you say her appearance was
deliberately voluptuous and enticing
you could see everything she had
the defense will concede that
mrs manion when dressed informally
is an astonishingly beautiful woman
and we--
mrs manion stand up please
will you
as a matter of fact--
take your glasses off
it pretty easy to understand why her
husband became temporarily deranged
when he saw such beauty bruised
and torn by a beast
your honor i protest
mr biegler is perhaps
the least disciplined
and the most completely out of order
attorney ive ever seen in a courtroom
the jury will ignore
mr biegler oration
was mrs manion drinking heavily
that night
i sold her six drinks myself and
barney came over and got more for her
i dont remember how many
would you say she was tight
-she was high all right
-what did she do to make you think that
she took off her shoes
and went barefooted
when she played pinball shed swish
around to give the machine english
you mean she was flipping
her hips around
yeah
anything else
when she made a good score she jumped
up and down and squealed like women do
she was playing pinball
with barney quill that night
wasnt she
yes
what was her attitude
toward barney quill
friendly
more than friendly would you say
i thought so
why did you think so
shed kind of lean on him
a couple of times she bumped him
with her hip
would you say that mrs manion
was making a play for barney quill
objection that calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness
i withdraw the question
would you say
mrs manion was free and easy
with barney quill
i would
your witness
mr paquette
the attorney for the people
asked you if mrs manion was  tight
and you said
that she was  high
now speaking as a bartender
what the distinction between the two
i dont understand
when we say a person  tight
we usually mean theyre a little stupid
with the drink isnt that so
i guess so
and if theyre  high
theyre gay and enjoying themselves
in other words
mrs manion was happy
is there anything wrong with being happy
in thunder bay inn
no
thunder bay itself is a resort
isnt it
swimming fishing that sort of thing
yes
is there anything unusual about seeing
a barefooted woman in thunder bay
no
so mrs manion taking her shoes off
in thunder bay
that doesnt mean
she being unladylike does it
i guess not
yes or no
no
now you testified that
mrs manion was squealing
and jumping up and down
and swishing her-i think that
was the expression you used--
swishing her hips
around the pinball machine
now was she creating a disturbance
was she attracting a crowd
were the men at the bar all
standing around watching mrs manion
no
but you were very conscious of her
conscious enough so that you can tell us
all about her actions
yes
and certainly barney quill
he was conscious of her because
he was playing pinball with her right
so it seems that only you
and barney quill were acutely aware
of mrs manion and her actions
and her appearance
maybe good old barney when he came up
to get some drinks from you
maybe he winked and said  alphonse
im gonna take this babe and rape her
no he didnt
maybe you said
do it once for me boss
objection
no more questions
the court had about all of this
dogfight it can take for one day
and im sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry
tomorrow the defense takes over
and with expedition prayer
and a little self-discipline
on the part of counsel
perhaps we can reach an end
by saturday night
will you adjourn court
hear ye hear ye hear ye
this court stands adjourned
until 900 tomorrow morning
he banged up a little but there
doesnt seem to be anything else
wed like to watch him
for a day or so
how much damage did he do
wrecked a gate and a barn door
he hasnt got a driver license
hell have to appear
in thejp court when he able
the old fool
speak kindly of the dead
mind if i have a minute
with the corpse
sure
now was it worth trying
to kill yourself
for whatever it is
youve been up to
how is the trial going
im making a lot of noise
and dancer racking up all the points
but come on
where have you been
quill hired mary pilant up north
of sault st marie
struck me funny hed go all the way up
there to hire somebody to work for him
ive been up there nosing around
did you find anything useful
not until i looked up
her birth certificate
born blind river ontario  934
out of wedlock
mother was a waitress
simone pilant
father was a lumberjack
named barney quill
id like to see miss mary pilant
it late mister
i know this is important
real important
real important
yes
miss pilant sorry if i woke you
there a guy to see you
says it real important
what your--
paul biegler
i dont wish to see him
okay
she said it not important enough
call her back and tell her i mentioned
blind river ontario
ill be in the bar
good evening alphonse
drinking or just snooping
i think ill try a little of both
what do you say we start with a beer
on the house
and that all you get-a beer
no questions no answers
im just a lawyer
trying to do my job
what are you so afraid of
let sit over there please
miss pilant i owe you an apology
i was rough when i was here before
i didnt know barney quill
was your father
you didnt come here
just to apologize
no but the apology was part of it
to tell you the truth i was hoping
it would thaw you out a little bit
all i want you to do is listen to me
just for a few minutes
i need some strong evidence to back up
laura manion story about the rape
the prosecution gonna attack
that story pretty hard
and if the jury thinks she lying
that could turn the decision
against manion
isnt she lying
barney didnt do what she said he did
he couldnt have
what did you know about your father
all i needed to know
he took care of me and my mother
for as long as she lived
he was always there
when i needed him
that what i know about my father
mr biegler
will that back up
laura manion story
i dont want to get at you
hurt you
i appreciate your affection
for your father
but as a lawyer ive had to learn
that people arent just good or bad
but people are many things
and i kind of have a feeling
barney quill was many things
i dont want to hear any more
no please hear me out
i believe that barney told al paquette
what happened that night
and he told him to go to this window
and wait for manion
barney stayed behind the bar
next to a gun rackjust waiting
manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door
and the first shot
went right through barney heart
now here what i want you to do
i want you to try to persuade al
to come to the court
as a defense witness and tell the court
what barney told him that night--
that he raped and assaulted
mrs manion
al wouldnt conceal a thing like that
why wouldnt he tell it if it were true
i dont know
but i know this
everybody loves something
or someone
me i love fishing
and an old guy by the name of parnell
manion loves his freedom
hed like to have a little more of it
barney loved you
maybe so does al
i wouldnt blame him
but he doesnt want to hurt you or
for you to know the truth about barney--
that he could be dangerous
and brutal
now if you just ask al--
if you just ask him right straight out
al mr biegler knows
that barney was my father
he thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed--
something you wont tell
lawyer i told you once and ill tell
you again-no questions no answers
wait
did my father rape mrs manion
barney wouldnt hurt a woman
is there any reason you wouldnt
tell me the truth about that
what reason
anything else
im going to leave a pass
for you and al at the trial
you might like to watch
lt manion get convicted
you going to spread it around
about mary being barney kid
no im not going to spread it
around al thank you for the beer
good night miss pilant
all right let get at
this rosary thing
it been testified that your wife
swore to you on a rosary
that shed been raped
by barney quill
did you ask your wife
to swear on a rosary
my wife was hysterical
she wasnt making much sense
i thought if i asked her to take
an oath on a rosary
it might serve to calm her
make her think more clearly
did the rosary help
she was able to tell me
in detail what had happened
all right go on from there
what did you do then lieutenant
well i--
i had her lie on the bed
and i got some cold cloths
for her head
and uh--
oh yes i gave her a drink of brandy
after a while she became calm
seemed to go to sleep
then i went to the closet
i got my gun
and i loaded it
was it in your mind
to kill barney quill
no
then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it
i knew i had to go to quill place
i thought i might need it
why
i knew mr quill kept guns
behind the bar
i was afraid he might shoot me
might shoot you if you did what
what were you going to do
im not sure
i remember having some idea
of finding him
and holding him
while i call the police
well that mr whatshisname--
mr lemon at the tourist court there
he was a deputy sheriff
why didnt you get him
to go with you
maybe because he always
seemed to be just
the old caretaker of the park
maybe because i wasnt thinking
about anything too clearly
except finding barney quill
why didnt you go to a phone call
the police before you went to the bar
i dont know
i was in sort of a daze
it was a horrible thing to see
what had been done to my wife
now you say you were in
sort of a daze
when you got to the bar
did you see that the bar was crowded
i didnt see anyone at the bar
except barney quill
he was the only person i saw
what was he doing
i think he was just standing there
behind the bar
now did he make a threatening move
to get a gun
i dont know
may have i dont know
all right now you say
you went there to find him
to hold him for the police
why did you shoot him
i dont remember shooting him
now when you left the bar
do you remember alphonse paquette
coming up to you
and stopping you and saying
youd better not run away from this
and you replied
you want some too buster
remember that
i seem to have a vague recollection
of somebody speaking to me
but i dont remember what i said
or what was said to me
when did you realize
that youd shot quill
i was getting a drink of water
i remember my throat was so dry
it hurt
and when i put the glass down
i saw the gun on the kitchen sink
beside the tap
i noticed the gun was empty
now id like you to show
the court and jury
just how you knew
this gun was empty
well this gadget here
when it sticks up
you know the last round been fired
on the night of the shooting
did you love your wife
yes sir
do you still love her
very much
the witness is yours mr dancer
how many men have you killed
now wait a minute
your honor a man war record--
in lt manion case a great record--
certainly shouldnt be used
against him
im as patriotic as the next man
but the simple truth is
war can condition a man
to killing other men
i simply want to determine
how conditioned the lieutenant may be
to the use of firearms
on other human beings
i dont like the question mr biegler
but i dont see how i can exclude it
let him answer
i know i killed
at least four men in korea--
three with a hand grenade
and one with my service automatic
i may have killed others
a soldier doesnt always know
now lieutenant
in these acts of killing
did you ever have a lapse of memory such
as you had when you killed barney quill
no sir
did you ever have one during battle
no sir
were you ever submitted
to a constant barrage
constantly in a sweat for many hours
constantly under attack or attacking
many times
were you ever treated for shell shock
battle fatigue neuroses or psychoses
no sir
did you ever experience
any unusual mental state
during the war
well i do remember having
one great urge
what was that
to get the hell out and go home
you would do well to consider
the seriousness
of the situation youre in
im sorry your honor
i sympathize with the lieutenant
i expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail
but the main point here
is that at no time
during your war service did you have
a record of mental disturbance
you were always in complete possession
of your faculties
yes sir that right
no more questions
no redirect your honor
step down please
call your next witness
we call laura manion
to the stand
up these stairs and to the right
thanks
how long after you told
your husband what had happened
did he leave the trailer
i dont know exactly
everything was kind of fuzzy
i was faint
and i laid down on the bed
he sat beside me
i vaguely remember
his getting up and going out
i remember wondering
if he was going for a doctor
and then he came back in
it seemed like just a few seconds
but it must have been longer
i mustve gone to sleep
when he came back in
he sat on the bed
and he had a gun in his hand
and i said  what are you going to do
and he said
i think ive already done it
i think ive killed barney quill
are you sure he didnt say
ive killed barney quill
no i remember distinctly
i think ive killed barney quill
then what did you do
i put my arms around him
and began to cry
and i said
youd better go to mr lemon
and my husband said
i forgot about that
what did he mean
forgot about what
he meant hed forgotten
mr lemon was a deputy sheriff
and he said  yes
ill go turn myself in to mr lemon
yes i see
your honor i have no other
direct questions at this time
but since im sure it difficult
to visualize the part
a little dog played on this night
i should like a few minutes to show
the court this remarkable little animal
do the people object
im sure that if we raise
an objection your honor
mr biegler will declare that we are
haters of all small furry animals
a creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief
bring in the dog
thank you sir will the deputy
bring in the dog please
you can put him right there
hey muff come on
that a boy
and now ill ask mrs manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog
ill ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light
it easy to see that muff doesnt know
who his enemies are
remove the dog please
yes sir
the witness will resume the stand
there we go muff
may i congratulate you
on your well trained pet
may i also say im pleased to see
youre not today
hiding your lovely hair
under a hat
your honor is the assistant attorney
general from lansing pitching woo
or is he going to cross-examine
let get on with it
mrs manion what was your occupation
before you were married
housewife
then youve been married before
yes once
i suppose your first husband died
no
did you divorce your first husband
to marry lt manion
your honor if counsel wants
to know the grounds
for mrs manion divorce
let him ask that question
what were the grounds
for divorce
mental cruelty
naturally and how long after
your divorce was it
that you married lt manion
im not sure
may i refresh the witness memory
for mr dancer
by all means
i believe she told me
that they were married
three days after the divorce
thank you mr biegler
is that correct mrs manion
then unless yours was
a whirlwind courtship
you must have known lt manion
before your divorce
did you
yes
mrs manion what is your
religious affiliation
im a catholic
catholic in good standing
well no the divorce you know
you mean you were excommunicated
because of the divorce and remarriage
yes
mrs manion wouldnt you say
that a catholic
who can blithely ignore one of
the cardinal rules of her church
could also easily ignore an oath
taken on one of its artifacts
say an oath taken on a rosary
i dont think that true
wouldnt you think thered be some doubt
about the integrity of such a person
i dont know
all i know is the rosary
means something to me
i see
well ill pass on to something else
mrs manion you testified
that your husband
came home late from his work
on the night of the shooting
were you a little angry
about his being late
i guess i was a little put out
did you have an argument
not much a little
when you left the trailer
to go to the inn
did your husband know you were going
he was asleep
was part of your reason for going
without his knowledge
because you were vexed
well id been ironing all day
and i--
yes i guess that true
your honor the counsel
has deliberately
cut off my view of the witness
im sorry mr biegler i wouldnt want
to interfere with your signals to her
i object to the implication
i was signaling the witness
this is the shabbiest courtroom trick
ive ever seen
you havent lived mr biegler
i ask for a rule on my objection
mr dancer will you be careful
not to place yourself
between mr biegler and his witness
of course your honor
anything else mr biegler
you do it once more
ill punch you all the way out
into the middle of lake superior
gentlemen gentlemen
this rowing has got to stop
the next one of you that speaks
out of turn will have me to deal with
get on with your cross-examination
would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had been awake
he probably would have gone with me
but would you have gone alone
not if he didnt want me to
would he have not wanted you to
im not sure
i dont know how to answer that
had you ever gone
to the thunder bay inn or
elsewhere in thunder bay alone
at night
yes sometimes
did your husband know you were going
not always
he goes to sleep early
and sometimes im restless
where did you go on these occasions
id take a walk by the lake or
go into the bingo place
maybe to the inn
you ever go to meet another man
no i didnt
i never did that
you mean to say mrs manion
a lovely women like yourself
attractive to men lonely restless
that you never once met--
objection your honor the witness has
answered the question about other men
the counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury
i withdraw the question
mrs manion on these occasional
excursions into the night
did you always go
and return home alone
of course
mrs manion you testified
that the reason you got
into barney quill car was because
you were afraid to go home alone
why were you so frightened
on this night
i said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around
was this the first time
you heard that
bears came around thunder bay
for scraps
no
had you seen the bears before
yes
oh this was just the first time
you were afraid of them
no i was always afraid of them
oh this was just the first time
you were enough afraid to allow
a man to take you home
from one of your evening prowls
objection use of the word  prowls
meant to mislead the jury
sustained
i apologize mrs manion
i didnt mean to imply
that you were a huntress
was this the first time that
you were enough afraid to allow a man
to take you home
from one of your evening walks
well it wasnt just that
it was--
oh come now mrs manion
you should be able to answer that
straight off that a simple question
your honor how can the witness
answer straight off
when the counsel keeps interrupting
the answer
the witness seemed
a little slow to me mr biegler
however let her complete her answers
before you interrupt
of course your honor in any case
mr biegler objection
has given mr manion sufficient time
to think of an answer to my question
youve thought of one havent you
what i was going to say was that
i didnt want to offend mr quill
by making him think that i was
afraid of him or didnt like him
he been very pleasant to my husband
and me when wed been in his bar
that very good mrs manion
very good indeed
your honor please
the attorney for the people
will reserve his comments
for the arguments
i will ask you this question
mrs manion
was this the first time you had been
in barney quill car at night
mrs manion did you hear the question
yes i heard
yes it was the first time
would you raise your voice
a little mrs manion
i said it was the first time
now mrs manion
im quite concerned
about the lost panties
would you describe this article
of clothing to the courtroom
they were nylon
and had lace up the sides
there was a label in them
of the place i got them--
the smart shop in phoenix arizona
what was the color of the panties
i believe white
you believe
i have white and pink
they may have been pink
youre not sure
havent you checked your lingerie
to see which pair of panties
is missing
no
when your husband came home late
from work and you had this little spat
were you already dressed to go out
no
when did you dress
after dinner when he was asleep
it been stated here that you were
bare legged in the bar is that true
in your anger at your husband and
your haste to get out of the trailer
perhaps you didnt put on
any panties either
objection witness has already testified
of what she was wearing
sustained
do you always wear panties
your honor i object
to this line of questioning
it immaterial what mrs manion
does all the time
on the night she was attacked
she was wearing panties
and that all were concerned with
mrs manion seems a little bit uncertain
about the kind of panties she wore
and since these panties have not been
found i submit that it possible
she wasnt wearing any
and has forgotten
that all im trying to get at
you may answer mrs manion
you always wear panties
no
on what occasions dont you wear them
when you go out alone at night
no no objection he says he going
after one thing and goes after another
ill sustain the objection
strike out the last two questions
in mrs manion answer
now mr dancer get off the panties
youve done enough damage
yes your honor
mrs manion
is your husband a jealous man
he loves me
im sure but is he overly jealous
your honor how can the witness
answer that question
what the norm of jealousy
can you put your question
a little differently mr dancer
has your husband struck you in a rage
no your honor
i think mr dancer fishing now
what the relevance of this question
your honor the shoe is squeezing
mr biegler foot
in his own words
this is not a high school debate
this is a cross-examination
in a murder trial
proceed mr dancer
did you ever go out socially
in thunder bay
yes a few times
when your husband outfit moved
to thunder bay didnt barney quill
throw a cocktail party
for the officers and their wives
didnt your husband strike a young
second lieutenant at this party
there was a little scuffle
it wasnt much
what was it about
im not sure i remember
were you too drunk to remember
no i was not
i think it was because
the lieutenant was cutting in too much
when i was dancing with my husband
shortly after on the verandah didnt
your husband slap you hard enough
so that you fell against the wall
he was drinking
wasnt this a jealous rage
i dont know
do you remember why he struck you
wasnt he enraged at you because he
thought youd encouraged the young man
he might have thought so
there are witnesses to this affair
ill ask you again
wasnt this a jealous rage
i guess you could call it that
now ill ask you
on the night of the shooting
what did you swear
what oath did you take on the rosary
it was about barney quill raping me
why did you swear on the rosary
that he raped you
for the reason my husband said--
because i was hysterical
that was the reason he gave for asking
you to swear what was it for swearing
so hed believe me
why shouldnt he
objection the reason for the use
of the rosary has been established
these questions are immaterial
no i think ill take
the answer mr biegler
ill ask you again mrs manion
why shouldnt he believe you
because i wasnt making much sense
did he think youd lie
about a thing like that
objection your honor lt manion had
already testified as to what he thought
-sustained
-did your husband strike you that night
did he hit you that night
well he--
he may have slapped me
because i was hysterical
didnt you swear to a lie to keep him
from hitting you again
no i didnt i did not
hadnt he already beaten you up when he
caught you coming home with quill
objection the witness has already
testified she was beaten by quill
quiet quiet
no more questions
i think the witness
has had enough your honor
the witness may step down
well recess for lunch
recess until  00
im sorry baby
you were fine
dr smith
ive come to meet you
my name is--
im sorry youve been mistaken
maybe im the one youre looking for
are you mr biegler
no im his associate in the case
dont tell me youre dr smith
that me
the army psychiatrist
maybe you expected me
to be in uniform
no
i didnt expect anybody so young
im 40
i sort of hoped youd
have a beard and wear a monocle
i see
is that better
youre on the stand this afternoon
doctor have you formed an opinion
as to frederick manion
mental and emotional state
at the time he killed barney quill
i have
and what is that opinion
he was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting
at the time of the shooting
do you believe he was able
to distinguish right from wrong
he may or may not have been
it doesnt make too much difference
now doctor
as clearly as you can
will you explain
frederick manion temporary insanity
it is known as dissociative reaction
a psychic shock which creates
an almost overwhelming tension
which the person in shock
must alleviate
in lt manion case a soldier
it is only natural
that he would turn to action
only direct simple action
against barney quill would relieve
this unbearable tension
this is not too uncommon for example
in combat some of the more
remarkable heroics take place
in this state of mind
is there another name for dissociative
reaction that we might recognize
yes it has been known
as irresistible impulse
now doctor a man in the grip
of irresistible impulse
would he be likely to go
to his neighbor for advice
or call up the police
to come to his aid
completely incompatible
yes but our man
was able to think of going
and taking out a gun
and loading it before setting out
to find quill
that his conscious mind working but
hed go even if a gun wasnt available
how would a man look
in the grip of dissociative reaction
he might appear to be deadly calm
fiercely deliberate
mm-hmm
would you describe his behavior
as being like a mailman
delivering the mail
that not bad like a mailman he would
have a job to do and he would do it
your witness
doctor
did you find any psychosis
in frederick manion
i did not
any neuroses
i found no history of neuroses
any history of delusion
none
loss of memory
not before this instance
did you find any history--
can you spot mary pilant
she didnt come back after lunch
i think youd better give up
on that one
doctor you stated that the defendant
might or might not
have been able to distinguish
the difference between right and wrong
but it wouldnt have made a difference
am i right is that what you said
approximately yes
did you mean that at the time
of the shooting
he could have known the difference
between right and wrong
he might have yes
dr smith
if the defendant could have known
what he was doing
and could have known it was wrong
how can you come here
and testify that he was legally insane
im not saying
he was legally insane
im saying that
in his mental condition
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong
he would still have shot quill
are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion
yes i am
your honor id like to ask
for a short recess
the attorneys for the people would like
to meet with mr biegler in chambers
glad to oblige your honor
short recess
the jury will remain
someday im going to
horrify tradition
and lay a dense blue cloud
of tobacco smoke
in that hallowed courtroom
what on your mind mr dancer
your honor in view of dr smith
testimony i thought perhaps
the defense might like
to change their plea
change it to what
guilty of course
no well still go for broke
hell paulie you know a guy
not considered legally nuts
in michigan unless
he didnt know right from wrong
why dont you get this over with
your honor will you turn to page 486
what that
appears to be a law book mr lodwick
oh im sorry your honor
i make those things
to help me think sometimes
for perch
no it was for frog
what case is he citing
we gig frogs
in my part of the country
it the same up here
im a trout man myself
but this is a new wrinkle
im gonna try
they do it in the bayou down south
the idea they get a big long pole
and about a ten-pound line
just sort of
drift along a high bank
in a boat
then you see that big old bullfrog
in the crevice
and sort of float this along
in front of him
pop that old tongue of his
snaps out and--
youve got frog legs
for supper
ill be darned
why dont you keep it
try it sometime
thanks i will
four eighty-six
what is it your honor
people v durfee  886
looks like a precedent
would you like to read it
no thank you your honor
i think i recall the case
were hooked
like the frog
dr harcourt where did you receive
your university training
johns hopkins in baltimore maryland
and where do you practice now
im the medical superintendent of the
bonder state hospital for the insane
it been stated here that
dissociative reaction
or irresistible impulse
is not uncommon
among soldiers in combat
do you agree with that statement
i do
but not as it was put
by dr smith
where would you depart from dr smith
dissociative reaction
is not something that comes out of
the blue and disappears as quickly
it can only occur
even among soldiers in combat
if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing
it been testified here that
a psychiatric exam of the defendant
showed no evidence of neuroses
and no history
of dissociative reaction
youve further heard it testified
that the defendant behavior
on the night of the shooting
was cool and direct
as an observer
do you remember this testimony
from this have you formed an opinion
about the defendant sanity
on the night of the shooting
im of the opinion that he was in
possession of his faculties
so that he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind
in other words he was not
in the grip of irresistible impulse
in my opinion he was not
thank you your witness
dr harcourt psychiatry is an effort
to probe into the dark
undiscovered world of the mind
and in there the world
might be round it could be square
your opinion could be wrong dr smith
could be right is that true
id be a poor doctor
if i didnt agree with that
but i believe my opinion
to be right
do you think you mightve changed
your opinion
if youd examined the defendant
as dr smith did
i dont believe so
but dr smith opinion
was made under better circumstances
wasnt it
if you mean that he was able
to examine the man yes
yeah thank you doctor
that all dr harcourt
is there more rebuttal
were over a barrel mitch
we have to use him
we call duane miller to the stand
will the sheriff please
bring in the witness
what can he tell
nothing
he cant tell anything
raise your right hand do you swear
the testimony you give in this cause
shall be the truth the whole truth and
nothing but the truth so help you god
i do
state your name please
duane miller most folks call me duke
where do you presently reside
across the alley in the jail
you know the defendant
frederick manion
yeah i got to know him in the past
few weeks his cell next to mine
what was the last conversation
you had with the lieutenant
except for  hello this morning
the last time was last night
did you discuss his trial last night
yeah some
would you tell the court what lt manion
had to say about the trial
well i said
are things looking up lieutenant
and he said
i got it made buster
he said
i fooled my lawyer
i fooled that head-shrinker
and im gonna fool
that bunch of corn cobs on the jury
liar
youre a lousy stinkin liar
take it easy now
i apologize for my client
your honor
yet his outburst is almost excusable
since the prosecution has seen fit
to put a felon on the stand to testify
against an officer in the us army
your honor i dont know who the
worse offender manion or his lawyer
were close to the end
in the name of heaven
let have peace
and courtesy
for these last few hours
mr dancer you will continue
your interrogation without comment
mr biegler you will not sound off
at every opportunity
and the defendant will remain seated
in his chair and keep his mouth shut
now go ahead
mr miller
are you certain
that lt manion said
ive got it made buster
that what he said
did lt manion say anything else
yes sir he said when he got out
the first thing he was gonna do
was kick that bitch
from here to kingdom come
to whom was he referring
to his wife
your witness
what are you in jail for mr miller
arson
i copped out
and im waiting for a sentence
how many other offenses
have you committed
i was in reform school as a kid
but that all
your honor id like to see
this man criminal record
do you have his record mr lodwick
yes sir
here it is
your record shows youve been
in prison six times
in three different states--
three times for arson twice for assault
with a deadly weapon
once for larceny
also shows youve done short stretches
in four city jails
on charges of indecent exposure
window-peeping perjury
and disorderly conduct
is this your true record
them things are never right
how did you get the ear
of the prosecution
in order to tell them about the
conversation you had with lt manion
-the da was taking us into his office
-taking who into his office
us prisoners in the jail
all at once or one at a time
one at a time
him and that other lawyer
took us to his office and asked us
questions about lt manion
were you promised a lighter sentence
if you went on the witness stand
your honor the people object to--
overruled answer the question
i wasnt promised anything
you thought itd help your troubles
if you dreamed up this story
to please the da
i didnt dream up nothin
youre sure that what manion said
yeah im sure
as sure as you were about your record
well i guess i kind of goofed
on that one
your honor
i dont feel i can dignify
this creature with any more questions
take the witness away
would you like a conference
with your client
i can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise
no your honor
we dont need a conference
ill recall lt manion
to the stand right now
now youve heard the testimony
of this miller
is any part of it true
none
lieutenant do you have any idea why he
might come here with a tale like that
no sir
have you ever talked with this man
what did you talk about
nothing important
certainly nothing about
my personal life or my feelings
that all i wanted to know
lt manion
have you ever had
any sort of
trouble with miller
i dont know what do you mean
an argument something like that
did you ever attack--
physically attack him
your lawyer cant answer
the question for you lieutenant
did you ever physically attack miller
i wouldnt call it an attack exactly
i pushed his head
against the bars one day
why
he said something ugly about my wife
do you remember pushing or bumping
his head against the bars
sure i just told you
then this was not
dissociative reaction
the defendant isnt qualified
to answer that
lt manion
wasnt your action against barney quill
much the same
as your action against miller
and against the lieutenant
that you struck
at the cocktail party
all in the heat of anger with a willful
conscious desire to hurt or kill
i dont remember
my action against quill
how long had you known that your wife
was running around with barney quill
i never knew anything like that
i trust my wife
i suppose you just beat her up
occasionally for the fun of it
nothing has been established
to permit a question like that
he keeps implying things
without getting to the point
let him ask the lieutenant
did he ever beat his wife
ill sustain the objection
would you like to rephrase
your question mr dancer
no thank you your honor
ive finished
then ill ask him
did you lt manion
ever beat your wife on the night
of the shooting or any other time
no sir
is there any doubt in your mind
that barney quill raped mrs manion
no sir
that all
step down lieutenant
we hurt
were hurt bad
your honor i know time is pressing
i dont want to ask for a recess
i would like to leave
the courtroom for a moment
if it important
we can be at ease for a minute
thank you sir
this is highly irregular
your honor
there no reason to make
a federal case out of it
thank you very much your honor
we now have another rebuttal witness
the defense calls mary pilant
to the stand
we must protest this whole affair
the noble defense attorney rushes out
to a secret conference
and now the last-minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the aisle
the whole thing has obviously been
rigged to unduly excite the jury
it another cornball trick
your honor i dont blame mr dancer
for feeling put-upon
im just a humble country lawyer
trying to do the best i can
against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of lansing
swear the witness
raise your right hand do you swear
the testimony you shall give
shall be the truth the whole truth and
nothing but the truth so help you god
i do
sit down please
where do you live miss pilant
at thunder bay inn in thunder bay
and how long have you lived there
for two years
and what your profession
i manage the inn
now miss pilant how is the laundry
handled at thunder bay inn
it chuted down to the laundry room
where is the location of that chute
on the second floor
between room 42 and 43
who lives in those rooms
i live in 42
mr quill lived in 43
would mr quill
coming up from the lobby
have to pass by the mouth of that chute
on the way to his room
would it be very easy for him to drop
something into that chute as he passed
have you ever had occasion to go
down into the laundry at any time
yes part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry
as they come out of
the wash-and-dry machine
would you tell the court what you found
among those pieces of laundry
the day after mr quill was killed
i found a pair of women panties
and what did you do with them
i threw them in the rag bin
when did you learn the significance
of those panties
here
this morning in the courtroom
and then you went home
and got them out of the rag bin
did you bring them with you
i offer this article of lingerie
as exhibit number one
for the defense
theyre white
they have lace up the side
and theyre badly torn
as if theyve been ripped apart
by powerful hands
the label reads
smart shop phoenix arizona
if there is no objection the exhibit
will be received in evidence
that all miss pilant
do you ever talk to mr lodwick
about the death of barney quill
he came to the hotel several times
after mr quill was killed
did you tell mr lodwick that you didnt
believe barney quill raped mrs manion
yes i told him that
did you ever talk to mr biegler
was this also in connection
with the shooting of quill
did you tell him you didnt believe
barney quill had raped mrs manion
how many times did you talk to him
twice
when was the last time
last night
and have you now changed your mind
do you now believe
barney quill raped mrs manion
i dont know now
i think he might have
when did you change your mind
last night
no it was here this morning
when were you given the panties
was that last night
-just wait a minute
use the proper form
of objection mr biegler
on second thought i dont object
id like the jury to hear her answer
the witness may answer
no
i was not given the panties last night
or at any other time
i found them exactly as i said
do you know for a fact
that barney quill dropped the panties
down the chute or did you assume it
i assumed it
had you thought maybe someone else
might have put the panties there
who wanted them found in the laundry
i hadnt thought of that
and in the grip of what mr biegler
might call irresistible impulse
you rushed in here with the panties
because you wanted to crucify
the dead barney quill
isnt that true
no i thought it was my duty--
your pride was hurt wasnt it
i dont know what you mean
he trying to confuse the witness
let him ask her a question
she can understand
yes mr dancer i myself would like
to know what youre driving at
miss pilant
when you found the panties
was your first thought that barney quill
might have raped mrs manion
or was it that he might have been
stepping out with mrs manion
i dont know what he means
mr dancer once again i must ask you to
put straight questions to the witness
here is a straight question
your honor
miss pilant are you
barney quill mistress
no no i was not
it common knowledge in thunder bay
you were living with quill
that not true barney quill was--
was what miss pilant
barney quill was my father
no more questions
that all for me
the witness may step down
we will recess for  5 minutes
after which
we will hear the closing arguments
if possible i would like to charge
the jury before nightfall
think theyre gonna stay out all night
cant somebody say something
what do you want me
to say maida darling
tell me were gonna win
im counting on getting that
promissory note from the lieutenant
i hope i can borrow some money on it
i need a new typewriter
half the time the  p and the  f
dont strike on mine
party of the first part
sometimes comes out
arty of the irst art
doesnt make sense
it embarrassing
arty of the irst art
i kind of like that
has a ring to it
twelve people go off
into a room
twelve different minds
twelve different hearts
and twelve different walks of life
twelve sets of eyes ears
shapes and sizes
and these twelve people
are asked to judge
another human being
as different from them
as they are from each other
and in their judgment
they must become of one mind
unanimous
that one of the miracles of man
disorganized soul that they can do it
and most instances
do it right well
god bless juries
i dont know what id do
if i were on that jury
i really dont know
do you
i loved that paulie
i loved that
humble country lawyer bit
