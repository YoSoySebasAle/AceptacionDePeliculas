he asked to borrow a pencil once
stutters it like she been forgotten
because corcoran missing
richie continues
playing tuba
is it ever gonna end
richie what the fuck dude
what are you guys talking about
what they always talk about
i actually think it will end
for a little while at least
what do you mean
so i was going over
all my derry research
and i charted out all the big events
the ironworks explosion in 908
the bradley gang in 35
and the black spot in 62
and now kids being
i realized this stuff seems to happen
both every 27 years
eddie okay so let me get this straight
it comes out from wherever
to eat kids for like a year
and then what
it just goes into hibernation
maybe it like
what do you call it
cicadas
you know the bugs that come out
once every 7 years
my grandfather thinks
this town is cursed
he says that
all the bad things
that happen in this town
are because of one thing
an evil thing that feeds off
the people of derry
but it cant be one thing
we all saw something different
mike maybe
or maybe it knows what scares us most
and that what we see
stutters i saw a leper
he was like a walking infection
but you didnt
because it isnt real
none of this is
not eddie leper
stuttering or bill seeing georgie
or the woman i keep seeing
she hot
no richie
she not hot
her face is all messed up
none of this makes any sense
theyre all like bad dreams
i dont think so i know the difference
between a bad dream and real life okay
whatd you see
you saw something too
mike yes
do you guys know that burned-down house
on harris avenue
i was inside when it burned down
before i was rescued
my mom and dad were trapped
in the next room over from me
they were pushing
and pounding on the door
woman screaming faintly
trying to get to me
man hurry son
woman it burns
but it was too hot
woman screams
when the firemen finally found them
the skin on their hands had
melted down to the bone
were all afraid of something
cracker whizzes
got that right
eddie why rich
what are you afraid of
crackers bursting
clowns
bill okay

stutters
that where georgie disappeared
there the ironworks
and the black spot
everywhere it happens
it all connected by the sewers
and they all meet up at the
the well house
it in the house on neibolt street

all the junkies and hobos like to sleep
gasping
