ive been standing here for five
straight mornings and that bum there

what do you want to do
come on let go get a ball
wait a minute
is this all you do just take it like this
what about your unions
no other union in the countryd
stand for a thing like that
the waterfront is tougher father
like it aint part of america
do you know how a trigger local works
no how
you get up in the meeting you make a
motion the lights go out then you go out
that how it been since johnny
and his cowboys took over the local
name one place where it safe
to talk without getting clobbered
the church
what
the bottom of the church
you know
what youre letting yourself in for
you got a cigarette on you
right over there
you working hard
yeah
you wouldnt mind working once in a while
to justify this lofty position would you
i finished the work
i counted all them bags
we have an extra detail for you
that if you dont mind
being disturbed or anything
the priest and this doyle girl are getting
a meeting up together down at the church
we want a rundown on the names
and the numbers of all the players
wait a minute all right youre nominated
why me charley
i feel funny going down there
id just be stooling for you
let me tell you what stooling is
stooling is when you rat on your friend
the guys youre with
johnny wants a favor
dont think about it do it
go on join the congregation
i thought there would be
more of you here but
the romans found out what a handful
could do if it the right handful
im just a potato-eater
but isnt it simple as one two three
one the working conditions are bad
two theyre bad
because the mob does the hiring
three the only way to break the mob is
to stop letting them get away with murder
if one of youll answer one question
wed have a very good start
and that question is
who killed joey doyle
not one of you has a line
on who killed joey doyle
i have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it
all right then answer this one
how can we call ourselves christians and
protect these murderers with our silence
jimmy collins you were joey best friend
how can you just sit there
and not say anything
ill always think of him as my best friend
but what do you want me to
who asked him in here
im trying to find out
what happened to joey doyle
maybe you can be helpful
helpful
the brother of charley the gent
theyll help us get to the bottom
of the river
you better leave charley out of this
you dont think hed be helpful
why dont you ask him yourself
maybe i will one of these days
one of these days
now listen you know who the pistols are
are you going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one
are you
dugan how about you are you
one thing you have to understand
father on the dock
weve always been d and d
d and d what that
deaf and dumb
no matter how much
we hate the torpedoes we dont rat
rat now boys get smart
i know youre getting pushed around
but there one thing
we have in this country
and that ways of fighting back
getting the facts to the public
testifying for what is right against
what is wrong
what ratting to them is telling the truth
for you cant you see that
cant you see that
it seems to me weve gone just about
as far as we can at this time
i think youll agree with that father
so id like to close with a few words
from st matthew
come unto me all you
what did i tell you
about sticking your neck out
this is a police problem not ours
these people need help

my head for a baseball

i knew he had the guts but i never
guts why that crummy pigeon
he ought to have his neck wrung
that what we get for mixing
with this punch-drunk brother of yours
he was good for laughs
but this is business
i dont like anyone goofing off
in my business
i wasnt
why are you going around with his sister
just shut up
it just the doyle broad
she got him so he doesnt
know where his feet is anymore
it an unhealthy relationship
definitely
get rid of her
unless youre both tired of living
you got her address
yeah
weve got to do something
to muzzle dugan
or hell raise the biggest stink
this town ever seen
we got the best muscle on the waterfront
the time to use it is now
pronto if not sooner
you know where youre going back in
the hold no more cushy job in the loft
it down in the hold with the sweat gang
till you learn your lesson
let go
wise up
come on youre all right let do it
at last an irish shipment
and loaded to the gunnels
with fine irish whiskey
you see kayo the good lord
takes care of us all the time
that he does
come on out kayo get it up
all right take it up take it away
and dont go walking off with any of that
you know how the boss feels
about individual pilferage
all right all right
now you see the advantage
of a little man in a big coat
let me see you a minute afterwards
whatre you here for
to see that we dont steal
any of mr friendly precious cargo
i want to talk to you
get away from me will you
all right take it up take it away
kayo youre a walking distillery
watch it
get a doctor
he dont need a doctor he needs a priest
i came down here to keep a promise
i gave kayo my word
that if he stood up to the mob
id stand up with him all the way
and now kayo dugan is dead
he was one of those fellows
who had the gift for standing up
this time they fixed him
they fixed him for good this time
unless it was an accident
like big mac says
some people think the crucifixion
only took place on calvary
they better wise up
taking joey doyle life to stop him
from testifying is a crucifixion
dropping a sling on kayo dugan
because he was ready
to spill his guts tomorrow
that a crucifixion
every time the mob
puts the crusher on a good man
tries to stop him from doing his duty
as a citizen it a crucifixion
and anybody who sits around
and lets it happen
keeps silent about something he knows
has happened shares the guilt of it
just as much as the roman soldier
who pierced the flesh of our lord
to see if he was dead
go back to your church father
boys this is my church
if you dont think christ is down here
on the waterfront
youve got another guess coming
get off this dock father
tillio dont do that
whose side are you on boy
let him finish
every morning
when the hiring boss
blows his whistle
jesus stands alongside you
in the shape-up
he sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over
he sees the family men worrying
about getting their rent
and getting food for the wife and kids
he sees you selling your souls
to the mob for a day pay
the next bum that throws something
deals with me
i dont care if he twice my size
what does christ think
of the easy-money boys
who do none of the work
and take all the gravy
how does he feel about
the fellows who wear $50 suits
and diamond rings on your union dues
and your kickback money
and how does he who spoke up
without fear against every evil
feel about your silence
shut up about that
just watch this
you see that
you want to know what wrong
with our waterfront
it the love of a lousy buck it
making love of a buck the cushy job
more important than the love of man
it forgetting that every fellow
down here is your brother in christ
but remember christ is always with you
christ in the shape-up
in the hatch in the union hall
he kneeling right here beside dugan
and he saying with all of you
if you do it to the least of mine
you do it to me
what they did to joey and to dugan
theyre doing to you and you
all of you
and only you only you with god help
have the power
to knock them out for good

theyre asking me to put the finger
on my own brother

i wouldnt care if he gave you
a life pass to the polo grounds

terry guess who here
that joker
from the crime commissioner office
suppose i knew a guy
that knocked somebody off
you think i ought to turn him in
you mean call a cop are you kidding
you dont think i ought to turn him in
you was a golden warrior once
that right
you started the gang
you looking for me
no not exactly
i was just resting my dogs a minute
on the next investigation we get i hope
it got buildings with elevators in them
so far this one just
been climbing stairs
what do you climb them for
it worth it if we can tell
the waterfront story
the way the people
have a right to hear it
dont you think
didnt i see you in the garden
three or four years ago
with a fellow named wilson
i thought you were going
to take him that night
man he really dumped you
he dumped me
what would you say if i told you
i held that bum up for half a round
i could see he was hurt
what did you think i was doing
with them combinations petting him
you just couldnt finish him off
dont monkey around there
why didnt you finish him off
i was doing a favor for some pals
favor
that the way it was
that the way it was
if id have put him down
id have had a title shot
i was ready that night
you sure looked it
that when i figured it was all over
it was all over except for the lousy bet
my own
yeah
i guess id better get going
hit those stairs again
was that a hook or an uppercut
you caught him with that first time
i didnt use no hooks
i was strictly a short puncher
it looked like a hook to me
i had that bum all figured out
he had a good left hand
i let him tag me with the left
hand for a couple of rounds
so just when he starts he thinks
he getting cute i step inside a jab
with a left with a right with a left
i had him in my arms
and from there on in we were just dancing
and that a fact
when those guys want to win a bet
there nothing they wont stop at
i didnt hear them boss
but i seen them nose to nose
like pair of lovers
the flatfoot was eating it up
so theyve been seen together
and he smiled at her
that doesnt mean he going to talk
there is no evidence
until he gives public testimony
thanks for the legal advice charley
that what we kept you around here for
how do we keep him
from giving this testimony
aint that what you call
the main order of business
he a good kid
you know that
he a bum
after all the days i gave him in the loft
he got no gratitude
shut up
im conducting this investigation
this girl and the father
they got their hooks
in the kid so deep he doesnt
even know which end is up any more
i aint interested in his mental condition
all i want to know is
is he d and d or is he a canary
i wish i knew
so do i charley
for your sake
what do you want me to do
it simple drive him out
to this place weve been using
try to straighten him out on the way
if you dont give him to gerry g
you cant do that
maybe the boy is out of line
but he just a confused kid
confused kid
first he crosses me in public
and gets away with it
then the next joker pretty soon
im just another fellow around here
johnny i cant do that
then dont
who do you like in the third
it got to be new hope
definitely
johnny
it my kid brother
that for you to figure out
you can have it your way
or you can have it his way
but you cant have it both ways
am i right truck
definitely
okay on your horse
deep thinker
hi charley
im glad you stopped by for me
ive been wanting to talk to you
sure kid
where to
go to river st ill
tell you where to stop
i thought we was going to the garden
we are but i want to cover a bet
on the way over
besides thisll give us a chance to talk
nobody ever stopped you
from talking charley
the grapevine says that
you got a subpoena
the guys know youre not a cheese-eater
they think you shouldnt be
on the outside so much
but a little on the inside
i have a few things for you at the docks
a steady job
a couple extra potatoes
that all i want
that great when youre a kid but
youre getting on
youre pushing 30 slugger

a little bit longer without it
maybe
there a boss loader slot that
open on the new pier were opening up
it pays six cents on every
00 pounds that goes in
and every 00 pounds that goes out
and you dont have to lift a finger
that $200 $300 $400 a week
$400 a week just for the openers
i get all that dough for not doing nothing
you dont do anything
and you dont say anything
you understand
there more to this
than i thought charley
im telling you there a lot more
youre not thinking of testifying against
some people that we might know
i dont know charley
that what i want to talk to you about
do you know how much the piers are
worth that we control through the local
do you think johnny going to jeopardize
the whole set-up
for one rubber-lipped ex-tanker
who walking on his heels what the
i couldve been a lot better
the point is we dont have much time
im telling you
i havent made up my mind yet

you came down to my dressing room
and said kid this aint your night

so what happens he gets the title shot
outdoors in the ball park
and what do i get
a one-way ticket to palookaville

for me a little bit

a little so i wouldnt
have to take dives for short-end money
i had some bets down for you
