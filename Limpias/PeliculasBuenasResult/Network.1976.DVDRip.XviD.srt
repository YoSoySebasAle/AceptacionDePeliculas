{245}{2524}i sent you all a concept analysis report|yesterday did any of you read it
{2547}{2623}well in a nutshell it said
{2625}{2674}the american people|are turning sullen
{2676}{2766}theyve been clobbered on all sides|by vietnam watergate inflation
{2768}{2845}theyve turned off shot up fucked|themselves limp and nothing helps
{2847}{2932}so this concept analysis report|concludes
{2934}{22047}the american people want somebody|to articulate their rage for them
{22049}{2279}ive told you since i took this job|six months ago that i want angry shows
{2280}{22232}i dont want conventional programming
{22234}{22298}i want counterculture|i want antiestablishment
{22372}{22467}i dont want to play butch boss|with you people
{22468}{2258}but when i took over|this department
{22520}{22582}it had the worst programming record|in television history
{22584}{2265}this network hasnt one show|in the top 20
{22652}{22702}this network is an industry joke
{22704}{22783}we better start putting together|one winner for next september
{22784}{2283}i want a show developed
{22832}{2299}based on the activities|of a terrorist group
{22920}{22978}joseph stalin and his merry band|of bolsheviks
{22980}{23060}i want ideas from you|that is what youre paid for
{23062}{2352}by the way the next time i send|an audience research report around
{2354}{2322}youd better read it|or ill sack the lot of you
{2324}{23253}is that clear
{23255}{2339}ill be on the coast in four weeks can|you set up a meeting with laureen hobbs
{23392}{23479}the business of management|is management
{23480}{2356}at the time cca took control|the ubs tv network was foundering
{23563}{23647}with less than seven percent|of national television revenues
{23649}{2378}most network programs being sold|at station rates
{23720}{23806}i am pleased to announce i am submitting|to the board of directors a plan
{23808}{23873}for the coordination|of the main profit centers
{23875}{23946}and with the specific intention|of making each division
{23948}{2405}more responsive to management
{2406}{2405}point one
{24084}{2468}the division producing the lowest rate|of return has been the news division
{2470}{24303}with its $98 million budget and its|average annual deficit of $32 million
{24332}{244}i know historically news divisions|are expected to lose money
{2443}{2448}to our minds this philosophy|is a wanton fiscal affront
{24483}{2457}to be resolutely resisted
{24573}{24704}the new plan calls for local news to be|transferred to owned stations divisions
{24706}{24790}news radio would be transferred to|the ubs radio division
{24792}{24890}and the news division would be reduced|from an independent division
{24892}{25000}to a department accountable|to network
{258}{2520}what was that all about ed|this is not the time
{25203}{25249}why wasnt i told about this
{2525}{25354}why was i led up onto that podium and|humiliated in front of the stockholders
{25356}{2544}goddamn it i spoke to john wheeler|this morning
{2546}{25479}and he assured me|that the news division was safe
{25480}{25534}if you want me to resign|that a bad way to do it
{25536}{25605}well talk about this tomorrow|at our regular morning meeting

{44598}{44669}a latter-day prophet|denouncing the hypocrisies of our times
{4467}{44724}that sounds pretty good
{44746}{44780}who they
{44782}{44846}hackett chaney was there
{44848}{44923}the legal affairs guy|oh and that girl from programming
{44924}{44983}christensen|what she got to do with this
{44984}{4505}are you kidding|im not kidding
{45052}{4542}i said were running|a news department here not a circus
{4544}{45205}and howard beale|not a bearded lady
{45207}{45270}if you think ill go along with|this bastardization of the news
{45272}{45354}you can have my resignation|along with max schumacher
{45356}{45495}im speaking for howard beale and |that my job youre turning down
{45497}{45565}id go nuts|without some kind of work
{45567}{45663}what wrong with being an angry prophet|denouncing the hypocrisies of our times
{45665}{45706}what do you think max
{45708}{45809}do you want to be an angry prophet|denouncing the hypocrisies of our times
{458}{4598}yeah id like to be an angry prophet|denouncing the hypocrisies of our times

{4652}{4699}afternoon mr ruddy|afternoon
{46200}{46247}good afternoon mr ruddy
{46322}{46378}he waiting for you|thank you
{46529}{4660}nelson chaney tells me beale|may actually go on the air this evening
{46653}{46709}as far as i know|howard going to do it
{46772}{46837}are you gonna sit still for this|yes
{46839}{46904}i think hackett overstepped himself
{46906}{46967}there some kind of|corporate maneuvering going on
{46969}{47030}hackett is clearly forcing|a confrontation
{47032}{47084}that would account for his behavior|at the stockholders meeting
{47086}{4796}however i think he making a serious|mistake with this beale business
{4798}{47273}i suspect cca will be upset
{47275}{47322}at hackett presumptuousness
{47324}{47375}certainly mr jensen will
{47377}{47462}so im going to let hackett|have his head for a while
{47464}{47528}he just might lose it|over this beale business
{47629}{47696}id like you to reconsider|your resignation
{47698}{47758}i assume hackett|wouldnt take such steps
{47760}{4785}without some support|on the cca board
{4786}{47885}ill have to go directly to mr jensen
{47887}{47964}when that happens im going to need|every friend ive got
{47966}{48055}and i dont want hackett people|in all the divisional positions
{48056}{4809}so id like you to stay on
{4828}{48252}of course
{48293}{48359}thank you max
{48360}{4849}this has been|the ubs evening news
{4842}{48479}with howard beale
{4848}{48544}the initial response to the new|howard beale show
{48546}{48595}was not auspicatory
{48597}{48646}the press was|without exception hostile
{48648}{48700}and industry reaction negative
{48702}{48758}the ratings for the thursday|and friday shows
{48760}{48820}were both 4|but monday rating dropped a point
{48822}{48900}clearly suggesting the novelty|was wearing off
{48944}{48996}did you know there are|a number of psychics
{48998}{49068}working as licensed brokers|on wall street
{49070}{4928}some counsel their clients|by use of tarot cards
{4930}{4929}theyre all pretty successful|even in a bear market and selling short
{4922}{49307}i met one of them last week|and thought of doing a show around her
{49309}{49372}the wayward witch of wall street |something like that
{49374}{49434}but if her tips were any good|she could wreck the market
{49436}{49569}i called her this morning and asked her|how she was on predicting the future
{4957}{49635}she said she was|occasionally prescient
{49637}{49748}for example she said|i just had a vision of you
{49750}{49822}sitting in an office|with a craggy middle-aged man
{49824}{49906}with whom you are|or will be emotionally involved
{49908}{49946}and here i am
{50005}{50066}she does all this with tarot cards
{50068}{5037}this one operates|on parapsychology
{5039}{50242}she has trance-like episodes|and feels things in her energy field
{50265}{50354}this lady could be very useful to you|in what way
{50355}{5048}you put on a news show
{50420}{50497}and here somebody who can predict|tomorrow news for you
{50499}{50555}her name aptly enough is sibyl
{50556}{50603}sibyl the soothsayer
{50604}{50666}you could give her|two minutes of trance
{50668}{5073}at the end of the howard beale show|say once a week friday
{50732}{5079}which is suggestively occult|and she could oraculate
{50820}{5089}then next week everyone tunes in to see|how good her predictions were
{5098}{50966}maybe she could do the weather
{5022}{5093}your network news show will need help|if it going to hold
{5095}{554}beale doesnt do the angry man thing|well at all
{556}{5205}he too kvetchy|he being irascible
{5207}{5283}we want a prophet not a curmudgeon|he should do more apocalyptic doom
{5284}{5376}i think you should have some writers|write some jeremiads for him
{5409}{5463}i see you dont fancy my suggestions
{556}{5560}youre not serious
{5562}{5603}im serious
{5640}{5700}the fact is i could make|your beale show
{5702}{5797}the highest-rated news show in tv|if youd let me have a crack at it
{5820}{5874}what do you mean|have a crack at it
{5876}{5920}id like to program it for you
{5922}{5960}develop it
{5962}{52075}i wouldnt interfere with|the news itself but tv is show biz
{52076}{527}and even the news has to have|a little showmanship
{5272}{52227}my god you are serious
{52228}{52328}i watched your six oclock news today|it straight tabloid
{52330}{5244}you had a minute and a half of that lady|riding naked in central park
{5246}{52490}but you had less than a minute|of hard national and international news
{52492}{52557}it was all sex scandal|brutal crime sports
{52559}{52639}children with incurable diseases|and lost puppies
{52640}{52722}so i wont listen to protestations|of high standards of journalism
{52724}{52792}when youre on the streets soliciting|audiences like the rest of us
{52794}{52890}all im saying is if youre going|to hustle at least do it right
{52892}{52966}im going to bring this up at tomorrow|meeting but i dont like hassles
{52968}{53049}i was hoping we could work this out|between us that why im here
{53086}{5367}and i was hoping you were looking for|an emotional involvement
{5368}{5322}with a craggy middle-aged man
{53258}{53306}i wouldnt rule that out entirely
{53388}{53444}all right diana
{53446}{53535}bring up all your ideas at the meeting|because if you dont i will
{5357}{5363}i think howard making|a goddamn fool of himself
{53632}{5373}and so does everybody that howard|and i know in this industry
{53733}{53790}it was a fluke|didnt work
{53820}{53894}so tomorrow howard goes back|to the old format
{53896}{53989}and all of this gutter depravity|comes to an end
{54269}{5434}i dont get it
{54349}{5442}you hung around until 730|and then came down here
{54423}{54493}just to pitch a couple|of loony show-biz ideas
{54495}{54588}when you knew goddamn well|id laugh you right out of the office
{54590}{54647}i dont get it
{54649}{5477}what your scam in this
{5479}{54848}my visit here tonight was a gesture made|out of your stature in the industry
{54880}{54944}and because i personally admired you|since i was a kid
{54946}{55006}majoring in speech|at the university of missouri
{55037}{5527}sooner or later with or without you|im going to take over your news show
{5529}{5590}i figured i might as well start tonight
{55220}{55285}i think i once gave a lecture
{55287}{55365}at the university of missouri
{55367}{55479}i was in the audience i had|a schoolgirl crush on you for months
{5558}{55599}if we could get back for a moment|to that gypsy who predicted
{55600}{55702}all that about emotional involvements|and middle-aged men
{5573}{55789}what are you doing|for dinner tonight
{5602}{56077}i cant make it tonight|call me tomorrow
{5637}{5623}do you have a favorite restaurant|i eat anything

{57393}{57457}my husband ran off|with his boyfriend
{57459}{57569}and i had an affair with my analyst who|told me i was the worst lay he ever had
{57600}{57669}i cant tell you how many men|have told me what a lousy lay i am
{57690}{57748}i apparently have|a masculine temperament
{57750}{57843}i arouse quickly|consummate prematurely
{57844}{5798}and i cant wait to get my clothes|back on and get out of that bedroom
{57947}{58042}i seem to be inept at everything|except my work
{58063}{587}im good at my work
{589}{5880}so i confine myself to that
{5882}{58265}all i want out of life|is a 30 share and a 20 rating

{84762}{84838}they want to put the ongoing struggle|of the oppressed masses
{84840}{84887}on prime-time television
{84889}{84935}i have to regard this askance
{84937}{85055}mr haywood was saying|that our client miss hobbs
{85057}{8554}wants it up front that|the political content of the show
{8556}{8520}has to be in her control
{8522}{85297}she can have it i dont give a damn|about the political content
{85320}{85359}what kind of show

{85589}{85720}i want a lot more film like the bank|rip-off the ecumenical sent in
{8572}{85784}the way i see the series is
{85786}{85903}each week we open with an authentic act|of political terrorism
{85905}{85960}taken on the spot|and in the actual moment
{8596}{8603}then we go to the drama behind|the opening film footage
{86033}{86084}that your job miss hobbs
{86086}{868}youve got to get the ecumenicals|to bring in that film footage for us
{8683}{86277}the network cant deal with them|they are wanted criminals
{8630}{86372}the ecumenical liberation army|is an ultra-left sect
{86374}{864}creating political confusion
{8643}{86489}with wildcat violence|and pseudo-insurrectionary acts
{8649}{86543}which the communist party|does not endorse
{86545}{86622}the american masses are not yet ready|for open revolt

{86849}{86897}into which you can stick|whatever propaganda you want

{97297}{97359}a year in short|ahead of schedule
{97378}{97427}beyond that
{97429}{97497}this network may be|the most significant profit center
{97498}{97556}of the communications complex
{97557}{97656}and based upon the projected rate|of return on invested capital
{97658}{97750}and if merger is accomplished|the communications complex

{34405}{34440}is that clear
{34442}{34506}you think you merely stopped|a business deal
{34508}{34555}that is not the case
{34557}{3466}the arabs have taken billions of dollars|out of this country
{3468}{34674}and now they must put it back
{34676}{34798}it is ebb and flow tidal gravity|it is ecological balance
{34834}{3488}you are an old man
{34882}{34974}who thinks in terms|of nations and peoples
{34976}{35036}there are no nations|there are no peoples
{35038}{35090}there are no russians|there are no arabs
{35092}{3556}there are no third worlds|there is no west
{3557}{3528}there is only one holistic system|of systems
{35283}{35385}one vast and immane|interwoven interacting
{35387}{35490}multi-variant multinational|dominion of dollars
{35492}{35568}petrol dollars electro dollars|multi-dollars
{35569}{35690}reichsmarks rins rubles pounds|and shekels
{3574}{3580}it is the international system|of currency
{3582}{35932}which determines the totality|of life on this planet
{35953}{36062}that is the natural order|of things today
{36086}{3683}that is the atomic
{3685}{36236}and subatomic
{36237}{36342}and galactic structure|of things today
{36384}{36440}and you have meddled

{3749}{37206}there is no democracy
{37208}{3730}there is only ibm and itt
{37302}{37342}and at&t
{37344}{37439}and du pont dow union carbide
{3744}{37478}and exxon
{37480}{37567}those are the nations|of the world today
{37569}{37636}what do you think the russians|talk about in their councils of state
{37638}{37676}karl marx
{37677}{37739}they get out their|linear programming charts
{3774}{3782}statistical decision theories|minimax solutions and compute
{3784}{3794}price-cost probabilities of their|transactions and investments like we do
{3796}{38034}we no longer live in a world|of nations and ideologies mr beale
{38036}{38088}the world
{38090}{3860}is a college of corporations
{386}{3823}inexorably determined
{38233}{3832}by the immutable bylaws|of business
{38375}{38447}the world is a business
{3849}{38594}it has been since man|crawled out of the slime
{38655}{3876}and our children will live|mr beale
{38805}{38852}to see that
{3890}{38950}perfect world
{38988}{39068}in which there no war or famine
{39070}{3930}oppression or brutality
{3976}{39272}one vast and ecumenical|holding company
{39273}{39378}for whom all men will work to serve|a common profit
{39380}{39509}in which all men will hold|a share of stock
{395}{39569}all necessities provided
{39598}{39682}all anxieties tranquilized
{39720}{39800}all boredom amused
{39953}{40068}and i have chosen you mr beale
{40070}{4036}to preach this evangel
{4038}{4080}why me
{40209}{40272}because youre on television dummy
{40303}{40353}sixty million people watch you
{40355}{40423}every night of the week|monday through friday
{40452}{40507}i have seen the face of god
{40569}{40623}you just might be right mr beale
{4067}{40720}that evening howard beale|went on the air
{4072}{40800}to preach the corporate cosmology|of arthur jensen
{4080}{4092}last night i got up here and asked you|to fight for your heritage
{4094}{40972}and you did|and it was beautiful
{40973}{4046}six million telegrams were received|at the white house
{4048}{428}the arab takeover of cca|has been stopped
{429}{48}the people spoke the people won
{483}{4250}it was a radiant eruption|of democracy
{4276}{437}but i think that was it fellas
{4373}{4436}that sort of thing is not likely|to happen again
{4438}{45}because at the bottom|of all our terrified souls
{453}{458}we know that democracy|is a dying giant
{4583}{4660}a sick sick dying|decaying political concept
{4662}{4709}writhing in its final pain
{470}{4800}i dont mean that the united states|is finished as a world power
{4802}{4878}the u s is the richest|most advanced country in the world
{4880}{4929}light-years ahead|of any other country
{493}{42025}and the communists wont take over the|world because theyre deader than we
{42026}{42075}what is finished
{423}{4268}is the idea that this great country
{4269}{42300}is dedicated to the freedom and|flourishing of every individual in it
{42326}{42402}it the individual that finished
{42404}{42496}it the single solitary human being|that finished
{4252}{42630}it every single one of you|out there that finished
{42632}{42753}because this is no longer a nation|of independent individuals
{4278}{4292}it a nation of some 200 million|transistorized deodorized
{4294}{42980}whiter-than-white|steel-belted bodies
{4298}{43053}totally unnecessary|as human beings
{43054}{4330}and as replaceable as piston rods
{43389}{43470}well the time has come to say
{43472}{43554}is dehumanization|such a bad word
{43556}{43632}whether it good or bad|that what is so
{43633}{4369}the whole world|is becoming humanoid
{43693}{43768}creatures that look human|but arent
{43769}{4386}the whole world not just us
{4387}{43898}were just the most advanced|so were getting there first
{43923}{44024}the whole world people|are becoming mass-produced
{44026}{44097}programmed numbered and
{44098}{4448}it was an admissible argument|that howard beale
{4450}{44209}advanced in the days that followed
{4420}{44288}it was however|also a very depressing one
{44290}{44369}nobody particularly cared to hear|his life was utterly valueless
{4437}{4448}by the end of the first week|in june
{44420}{44466}the show dropped|one ratings point
{44468}{4455}and its trend of shares|dipped under 48 for the first time
{44553}{44595}since last november
{44597}{44644}youre his goddamn agent lou
{44646}{44698}im counting on you to talk sense|into the lunatic
{44700}{44770}nobody wants to hear about|dying democracy and dehumanization
{44805}{44862}im sorry im late
{44864}{44950}were getting rumbles from the agencies|the sponsors will bail out soon
{44952}{45004}this is a breach of contract
{45006}{4509}this isnt the howard beale we signed|get him off the corporate universe kick
{45093}{4545}ill pull him off the air
{4547}{45220}i told him ive been telling him|every day for a week
{45222}{45303}i am sick of telling him|now you tell him
{4548}{45526}jesus christ
{4565}{45725}you could help me with howard he|listens to you youre his best friend
{45727}{45785}im tired of all this hysteria|about howard beale
{45787}{45849}every time you come back from seeing|somebody in your family
{4585}{45906}youre in a morbid|middle-aged mood
{45908}{45988}and im tired of finding you on the|goddamn phone every time i turn around
{45989}{46070}im tired of being an accessory|in your life
{46072}{4629}im tired of pretending|to write this dumb book
{463}{4626}about my maverick days|in the early years of television
{4628}{46308}every goddamned executive fired|from a network in the last 20 years
{46309}{46409}has written this dumb book about|the great early years of television
{464}{46492}and nobody wants a dumb damn|goddamn book
{46494}{46546}about the early days of television
{46548}{4669}terrific maybe you can start|a whole new career as an actor
{46688}{46798}after living with you for six months|im turning into one of your scripts
{46822}{46887}this is not a script
{46889}{46968}there some real actual life|going on here
{46994}{47078}i went to visit my wife today|because she in a state of depression
{47080}{4768}so depressed that my daughter|flew from seattle to be with her
{4769}{47225}and i feel lousy about that
{47227}{47325}i feel lousy about the pain|that ive caused my wife and kids
{47327}{47439}i feel guilty and conscious-stricken and|those things you think sentimental
{4744}{4754}but which my generation called|simple human decency
{47639}{47704}and i miss my home
{47705}{47774}because im beginning|to get scared shitless
{47776}{47854}because all of a sudden it closer to|the end than it is to the beginning
{47856}{47934}and death is suddenly|a perceptible thing to me
{47936}{47997}with definable features
{4809}{48207}youre dealing with a man|that has primal doubts
{48209}{48277}and youve got to cope with it
{48279}{48396}im not some guy discussing male|menopause on the barbara walters show
{48397}{48475}im the man that you presumably love
{4850}{48574}im part of your life
{48576}{48620}i live here
{4862}{48658}im real
{48683}{4876}you cant switch|to another station
{48868}{48902}well

{49524}{49577}i dont know how to do that
{49857}{49922}ill be with you in a minute max
{50048}{5034}by the first week in july the|howard beale show was down  points
{5036}{5083}hysteria swept through the network
{5085}{50258}he a plague he smallpox|he typhoid
{50260}{50327}i dont want to follow his goddamn show|i want out of the 800 spot
{50329}{50389}ive got enough troubles|without howard beale as a lead-in
{5039}{50444}you guys scheduled me up against|tony orlando and dawn
{50446}{50532}nbc got little house on the prairie |abc got the bionic woman
{50533}{50602}you gotta do something|about howard beale
{50604}{50656}get him off the air|get him off
{50658}{50708}do something do anything
{5070}{50803}were trying to find a replacement im|going to look at audition footage now
{50805}{50892}and how when the sick heal
{50894}{50966}man i tell you i saw it
{50968}{5053}it was heavy baby
{5055}{509}i saw the earth quake
{5}{5205}and i saw the moon became like blood
{5207}{5308}and every mountain and island|was moved from its place
{530}{5406}no no damn it if we wanted hell-fire|wed get billy graham
{5408}{5494}we dont want faith healers evangelists|or oberammergau passion players
{5496}{5600}what about that terrific new messiah|abc was to sign for our competition
{5626}{5660}that him
{5709}{5772}that him
{5805}{585}jesus turn him off
{5879}{5966}ive got three more|but youve already seen the best ones
{5968}{5205}ive got a guru from spokane
{5207}{52084}and two more hell-fires|who see visions of the virgin mary
{52086}{528}were not gonna find a replacement|for beale let stop kidding ourselves
{5282}{52256}fully-fledged messiahs|dont come in bunches
{52258}{52335}we either go with howard beale|or we go without him
{52337}{52407}my reports say well do better|without him
{52409}{52479}it would be disaster to let|this situation go on another week
{5248}{52546}by then hell be down 6 points
{52548}{5265}and the trend irreversible|if it isnt already
{5266}{52734}i think we should fire howard
{52798}{5288}arthur jensen has taken|a strong personal interest
{52882}{52930}in the howard beale show
{52984}{5303}im having dinner with him tonight
{53033}{5327}let me have another crack at jensen|meet in my office at 000 tonight
{5329}{5396}diana give me copies of all|your audience research reports
{5397}{53249}i may need them for jensen
{5325}{53305}is 000 convenient for everyone
{54058}{5465}i think the time has come|to reevaluate our relationship max
{549}{54234}so i see
{54275}{54333}i dont like the way this script of ours|is turning out
{54360}{54423}it turning into a seedy little drama
{54425}{5453}middle-aged man leaves wife and family|for young heartless woman goes to pot
{54533}{54603}the blue angel with marlene dietrich|and emil jannings
{54605}{54670}i dont like it|so youre gonna cancel the show
{54672}{54726}right|let me do that
{54765}{54833}the simple fact is max
{54835}{5489}that youre a family man
{54893}{54977}it beautiful you like a home and kids|but i am incapable of such commitment
{54979}{55040}all youll get from me is another|couple of months of intermittent sex
{55042}{5535}and recriminate and ugly little scenes|like the one we had last night
{5537}{55232}im sorry for all those things|i said to you last night
{55234}{55292}youre not the worst fuck|ive ever had
{55293}{5535}believe me ive had worse
{55394}{55482}you dont puff or snorkel|and make death-like rattles
{55484}{55543}as a matter of fact|youre rather serene in the sack
{55580}{55650}why is it that a woman always thinks|that the most savage thing
{55652}{55744}she can say to a man|is to impugn his cocksmanship
{55770}{55862}im sorry i impugned your cocksmanship
{55864}{55973}i gave up comparing genitals|back in the schoolyard
{56200}{56266}youre being docile as hell|about this
{5629}{56365}hell diana i knew it was over|with us weeks ago
{56390}{56456}will you go back to your wife
{56496}{56563}ill give it a try|but i dont think shell jump at it
{56565}{5662}dont worry about me
{5663}{56677}ill manage i always have|i always will
{56679}{56728}im more concerned about you
{56730}{56790}youre not the boozer type
{56792}{56887}so i figure a year maybe two|before you crack up
{56889}{5695}or jump out of|your 4th floor office window
{56953}{57028}stop selling max|i dont need you
{57308}{57396}i dont want your pain i dont want|your menopausal decay and death
{57397}{57453}i dont need you max get out|you need me
{57476}{57594}you need me badly because im|your last contact with human reality
{57596}{57646}i love you
{57648}{5774}and that painful decaying love|is the only thing between you
{57743}{5780}and the shrieking nothingness|you live the rest of the day
{5782}{57858}then dont leave me
{5793}{57977}it too late
{58007}{58063}there nothing left in you|that i can live with
{5843}{58253}youre one of howard humanoids|if i stay with you ill be destroyed
{58295}{58365}like howard beale was destroyed
{58366}{58444}like laureen hobbs was destroyed
{58446}{58570}like everything you and the institution|of television touch is destroyed
{58725}{58775}youre television incarnate
{5883}{58867}indifferent to suffering
{58886}{58937}insensitive to joy
{58973}{59065}all of life is reduced|to the common rubble of banality
{5953}{5922}war murder death
{59242}{593}are all the same to you|as bottles of beer
{59336}{5943}and the daily business of life|is a corrupt comedy
{59473}{59553}you even shatter the sensations|of time and space
{59555}{59663}into split seconds|and instant replays
{59754}{5980}youre madness diana
{59845}{5989}virulent madness
{5995}{60024}and everything you touch|dies with you
{6033}{6020}but not me
{60203}{60263}not as long as i can feel pleasure
{60295}{60333}and pain
{6043}{60467}and love
{60739}{60792}and it a happy ending
{60825}{6094}wayward husband|comes to his senses
{6096}{60968}returns to his wife
{60969}{604}with whom he established|a long and sustaining love
{6073}{666}heartless young woman left alone|in her arctic desolation
{6242}{6290}music up with a swell
{6363}{6404}final commercial
{6472}{6555}and here are a few scenes|from next week show
{6846}{6892}howd it go
{62288}{62400}mr jensen was unhappy at the idea|of taking howard beale off the air
{62432}{62484}mr jensen thinks howard beale|is bringing
{62486}{62577}a very important message|to the american people
{62632}{6273}so he wants howard beale on the air|and he wants him kept on
{62765}{62844}mr jensen feels were too catastrophic|in our thinking
{62845}{62905}i argued that television|was a volatile industry
{62907}{62999}in which success and failure|were determined week by week
{63024}{63093}mr jensen said he did not like|volatile industries
{63095}{6384}and suggested with a certain|sinister silkiness
{63220}{63306}that volatility in business|usually reflected bad management
{63337}{63408}he didnt really care if howard beale|was the number one show or the 50th
{6340}{63470}he didnt really care|if the beale show lost money
{63497}{63559}he wants howard beale on the air
{6356}{6365}and he wants him kept on
{6366}{6375}i would describe his position on this|as inflexible
{6376}{63808}where does that put us diana
{63835}{63920}that puts us in the shithouse|that where that puts us
{63987}{64056}do you want me to go through this
{64083}{6474}the beale show q score|is down to 33
{64200}{64285}most of this loss occurred in the child|and teen and 8-34 categories
{64287}{64355}which were our key core markets
{64383}{64447}it the ar department carefully|considered judgment and mine
{64448}{64559}that if we get rid of beale we should|maintain a respectable share
{6456}{6464}with a comparable q level
{6466}{64699}the other show segments sybil the|soothsayer jim webbing vox populi
{6470}{64775}have all developed|their own audiences
{64776}{64886}our ar reports show that it is beale|that is the destructive force here
{6495}{64972}minimally were talking about
{64973}{65045}a ten-point differential in shares
{65047}{65094}i think joe oughta spell it out|for us
{6542}{6526}a 28 share|is 80000 dollar minutes
{6528}{65283}i think we can sell complete positions|on the whole
{65284}{65349}as a matter of fact were just getting|into the pre-christmas gift-sellers
{6535}{65437}and the agencies are coming back to me|with four-dollar cpms
{65439}{65559}if that any indication were talking|$40-$45 million loss in annual revenues
{6556}{65639}want the flak from the affiliates|we know all about it herb
{65640}{65730}you would describe mr jensen position|on beale as inflexible
{65732}{6580}intractable and adamantine
{65846}{65923}what do we do about this beale|son of a bitch
{65975}{66029}i suppose well have to kill him
{66098}{6669}i dont suppose you have any ideas|on that diana
{66252}{66287}well
{66332}{66396}what would you fellas say|to an assassination
{66442}{66503}i think i can get|the mao tse-tung people
{66505}{66567}to kill beale for us|as one of their shows
{66594}{66706}in fact itll make a hell of|a kick-off show for the season
{66708}{66778}were facing heavy opposition on the|other networks for wednesday nights
{66780}{66863}and the mao tse-tung hour|could use a sensational opener
{6696}{67003}it could be done right on camera|in the studio
{67043}{67096}we oughta get a fantastic|look-in audience
{67098}{6773}for the assassination of howard beale|as our opening show
{6799}{67264}if beale dies
{67265}{67363}what would our continuing obligation|to the beale corporation be
{67365}{67439}i know our contract with beale|contains a buy-out clause
{67440}{67493}triggered by his death|or incapacity
{67495}{67577}there must be a formula for|the computation of the purchase price
{67579}{67675}offhand i think it was based on|a multiple of 975 earnings
{67676}{67768}with a base period in 975|which i think was 50 percent
{67769}{67837}of salary plus 25 percent|of the first year profit
{67839}{6794}multiplied by the unexpired portion|of the contract
{6796}{6796}i dont think the show
{67963}{68024}has any substantial syndication value|would you say diana
{68026}{68073}syndication profits are minimal
{680}{6868}were talking about a capital crime
{6893}{68260}the network cant be implicated
{68508}{68609}i hope you dont have any hidden|tape machines in this office frank
{68660}{6873}the issue is|shall we kill howard beale or not
{68733}{68795}id like to hear|some more opinions on that
{68797}{68880}i dont see we have any option|let kill the son of a bitch
{68882}{68922}ladies and gentlemen|let hear it
{68924}{68965}how do you feel
