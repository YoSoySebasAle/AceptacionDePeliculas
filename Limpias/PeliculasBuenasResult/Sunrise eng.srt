sunrise
a song of two humans
this song of the man and his wife
is of no place and every place
you might hear it anywhere at any time
for wherever the sun rises
and sets in the city turmoil or
under the open sky on the farm
life is much the same
sometimes bitter sometimes sweet
summertime vacation time
among the vacationists was
a woman of the city
several weeks had passed since her coming
and still she lingered
they used to be like children carefree
always happy and laughing
they used to be like children carefree
always happy and laughing
now he ruins himself for that woman from the city -
money-lenders strip the farm
now he ruins himself for that woman from the city -
money-lenders strip the farm -
and his wife sits alone
tell me
you are all mine
sell your farm
come with me to the city
and my wife
couldnt she get drowned
then overturn the boat
it will look like an accident
leave this behind
come to the city
come to the city
after the boat has capsized
save yourself with these bulrushes
the rushes will hold you up
scatter them before you reach the shore
and tell everyone she drowned by accident
were going for a trip across the water
i may not be back for quite a while
dont be afraid of me
dont be afraid of me
god is giving you
in the holy blonds of matrimony a trust
she is young and inexperienced
guide her and love her
keep and protect her from all harm
wilt thou love her
forgive me
manicure
youd look grand
with a high polish
come again
thank you
and you must come and see us some time
congratulations she is the
sweetest bride ive seen this year
farmers
if you want to sell your home
and move to the city we pay cash
hit the hole
make the little piggy roll
midsummer
peasant dance
well sail home by moonlight
another honeymoon
i couldnt give up hope
i know the tides i went around the point
finis
