much-publicised fight
the greatest sporting event
in the country history
ill beat green like
he committed a crime
take a look at that guy
where are the real fighters
the pros
all we got today are jig clowns
clown
that right clown
apollo creed will duplicate
the cracking of the liberty bell
by cracking mac lee green
you calling
apollo creed a clown
just look at him
stay in school use your brain
be a doctor a lawyer
forget about sports
as a profession
sports make you grunt and smell
be a thinker not a stinker
this man is champion
of the world
he took his best shot
and became champ
what shot did you ever take
youre not happy
with your life that nice
but i got a business
i dont have to take no shots
no one having gone more
than  2 rounds with him
stick that up your business
what are you so insulted about
you want me to take a shot
ill take a shot
there he goes
rocky how about a bottle
no wine
just a little
buy us a thunderbird
marie your brother know
youre hanging out
screw you yo-yo
these guys teach you
to talk like that
stuff it man
come here
when i was your age
only one girl in the
neighbourhood talked like that
that makes your teeth yellow
i like yellow teeth
it makes your breath garbage
maybe i like garbage
nobody likes garbage
this girl wasnt bad-looking
but none of the guys
took her serious
why
that how guys are
they laugh when you talk dirty
but you get a reputation
you get no respect
i got to use a bad word
whore you understand
you use dirty words and maybe
end up becoming a whore
come on rocky im just  2
that dont matter
you dont have to be one
just act like one
and that it
20 years from now
people will say
do you remember marie
the little whore
at the hoagie shop
oh yeah i remember her
they dont remember you
they remember the rep
hey you got a boyfriend
you aint got a boyfriend
why dont you have a boyfriend
cause you hang out
with them coconuts
hang around with coconuts
youll get nowhere
hang out with nice people
you get nice friends
hang out with yo-yos
you get yo-yo friends
see it simple mathematics
i hope you aint
you hope i dont become a whore
something like that
goodnight rocky
goodnight
screw you creep-o
yeah who are you
to give advice creep-o
are the doctor
reports confirmed
definitely
mac lee green has a
severely cracked metacarpal
in his left hand
damn
we can cancel the fight if
youre set on fighting green
what about all the time
apollo invested
we can find a solution
find me another
ranked contender
apollo already done
$ million worth of publicity
has contracts with
20 different organisations
ernie roman fighting
in france that week
get buddy shaw
he ranked fifth
went to california
and gained 50 pounds
i got hold of every
worthwhile contender
five weeks isnt enough
time to get into shape
shape nothing theyre afraid
everybody in the world
will see this fight
they dont want to be
the chump that gets whipped
all i can say is
im a good promoter
ive promoted fights
in every country in the world
but i dont know
what the hell else to do
i do
without a ranked contender
this fight needs a novelty
this is the land of opportunity
so apollo creed
on january  st
gives a local underdog
fighter an opportunity
a snow-white underdog
on this poster with me
ill tell you why -
because im sentimental
so are a lot of other people
in this country
theyd like to see apollo creed
give a local philadelphia boy
a shot at the title
that the way i see it
that the way it going to be
apollo i like it
it very american
no jergens it very smart

arent you skating
i aint skated since i was  5
that when i started fighting
skating bad for the ankles
youre a pretty good
skater are you
like i was saying
fighting used to be tops
for me but no more
all i wanted was to prove
i could make a good pro
you never got the chance
i aint crying about it
because i still fight
but im a southpaw
what a southpaw
it means youre left-handed
other guys
it throws their timing off
makes them look awkward
you know where
southpaw came from
a long time ago
there was this guy fighting
around philadelphia
he was left-handed
and his arm was facing
towards new jersey
that south so naturally
they called him south paw
southpaw south jersey
south camden southpaw
things probably
worked out for the best
never got a chance
because youre left-handed
that absolutely true
watch out
i just dislocated my finger
look at that
it aint your fault
that an old wound
you see that
it bends like that
push the button bong
it works
ill show you something
seven minutes
i keep pictures of my fights
i done it in the
baby crenshaw fight
i broke both my hands
on his face
i lost that fight
but that a nice picture
you having a good time
you can see i aint
too graceful
i dont move well
but i can really hit hard
but nobody wants
to fight no southpaw
you know how i got
started in fighting
no
am i talking too loud
three minutes
my father -
he was never too smart -
he says to me you werent
born with much of a brain
so you better use your body
so i become a fighter
you know
why are you laughing
my mother said the opposite
what did she say
she said you werent born
with much of a body
so you better
develop your brain
yo time
can i ask you a question
absolutely
why do you want to fight
because
i cant sing or dance
dont fall
im pretty good at this
you like the way i skate
last fight i had with spider
rico he busted my head here
things get pretty rough
in the ring
some people are very shy
by nature you know
i suppose
i say youre very shy
by nature you know
i suppose
the bum from the dark
get a job
some people think
being shy is a disease
but it dont bother me none
dont bother me either
why did i bring it up
because im dumb
we make a real sharp
couple of coconuts
im dumb youre shy
why would anybody
want to be a fighter

youre almost guaranteed
to end up a bum
i dont think youre a bum
im at least half a bum
but ill tell you something

about this shot you got
because like the bible says
you wont get a second chance
yeah all right
you thought of that
well what you need
is a manager
i know because ive been
in this racket for 50 years
50 years
god ive seen it all
all of it
you know what i done
i have done it all
you should have seen me knock
guinea russell out of the ring
that september  4th  923
the same night firpo knocks
dempsey out of the ring
so who gets the publicity
dempsey
right but why

but i aint got no locker
uh anyway

in this business kid

to make a suggestion
dont drink that piss
before a fight
if you dont mind my saying
when i started this racket
us pugs were treated like dogs
for  0 bucks you got
to tear somebody throat out
one time this son
of a bitch that i fought
put a nail right there
his thumb
yeah the glove
he punched holes in my face
i spat through my cheeks
can you imagine that
ill tell you what
i looked like in my prime
i want you to look at something
that the way i looked
before these guys got at me
you didnt take very good
care of the picture
i never had no management
that the trouble
i got all this
knowledge up here
i want to give it to you
i want to make sure all
the shit that happened to me
doesnt happen to you
the fight set
