mr thomas mr rogers
pull the curtains aside
he is english
he is 2 years of age
and his name is john merrick
gentlemen in the course
of my profession i have come upon
many lamentable deformities
of the face due to injury or disease
as well as mutilations and
contortions of the body
depending upon like causes
but at no time have i
met with such a
perverted or degraded version
of a human being as this man
now i wish to draw
your attention to the
insidious conditions
affecting this patient
can you see over there
yes thank you
note if you will
the extreme enlargement of the skull
the right upper limb
which is totally useless
the alarming curvature of the spine
would you turn round please
turn round please
the looseness of the skin
and the varying fibrous tumours
that cover 90% of the body
and there is every indication that these
afflictions have been in existence
and have progressed rapidly
since birth
the patient also suffers
from chronic bronchitis
as an interesting side note
in spite of the
aforementioned anomalies
the patient genitals
remain entirely intact and unaffected
thank you
and his left arm is
perfectly normal as you see
so then gentlemen
owing to this series of conditions
the congenital exostosis of the skull
extensive papillomatous growth
large pendulous masses
in connection with the skin
the great enlargement of
the right upper limb
involving all the bones
the massive distortion of the head
and the extensive area
covered by papillomatous growth
the patient has been called
the elephant man
thank you
you never mentioned his mental state
oh he an imbecile
probably from birth
the man a complete idiot
pray to god he an idiot
where have you been
get out
how can i eat with a noise like that
bytes dont
where have you been
what did you do
our man sick come right away
what is it
like this
what did you do with him
he been like this all night
he was fine when he left here
now look at him
yes i intend to
what happened
he fell
he falls
looks like he had
a very severe fall
he a
clumsy soul
never looks where he going
but that all right
he has me to take care of him
why is he sitting up like this
he needs rest
well that how he sleeps
if he lies down hell kill himself
his
head too big
all right
this man belongs in a hospital
cant you treat him here
listen he my livelihood
were
business partners he and i
he the greatest freak in the world
yes now you listen
youre not going to have
much of a livelihood if he dies
now stop wasting my time
im going to fetch a cab
i truly appreciate this my friend
listen um
there are a lot of things
i could do for you
you see i move in the
proper circles for
this type of thing
in fact
anything at all
if you take my meaning
everything will be taken care of
it good to do business with you
here we go here we go
shhh
can i have a bowl of oatmeal please
yes sir
breakfasting with the
patients this morning mr treves
yes no i it for a patient
there you are sir
thank you good morning
morning
oh treves
just come here for a moment will you
um
what that youve got there
good heavens
you havent acquired a sudden taste
for this sort of stuff have you
yes sir it quite nutritious
possibly
not quite the diet for
a grown man nurse
when you have a moment
just take this up to the patient
in the isolation ward will you
yes sir
dont be frightened
he wont hurt you
wont he indeed
now just a minute treves
something i want to say to you
come in
a hospital no place for secrecy
you know mr treves
doctors spiriting hooded figures
about in the corridors
is apt to cause comment
why wasnt this patient
properly admitted
why is he in the isolation ward
he not contagious is he
oh no sir
no he got chronic bronchitis
and he been badly beaten
well why isnt he in
the general ward then
well sir he
he quite seriously deformed
and um
i fear the other patients
would find him rather shocking
deformed is that it
am i to assume then that
he is ultimately incurable
yes sir
but you must be aware mr treves
that this hospital
doesnt accept incurables
the rules are perfectly clear
on that point
yes sir im well aware of that
but this case is quite quite exceptional
yes i quite appreciate
your problem mr treves
why not contact the british home
or the royal hospital for incurables
perhaps they might
find a place for him
yes ill look into it
would you like to meet him
excuse me
the elephant man
sorry
sorry
i should have warned you
please forgive me
you all right
yes sir
please ask mrs mothershead
to come up here
and tell her to knock on the door
and wait for me

you have to treat him
with kindness and patience
well perhaps youve got time
for that sort of treatment mr treves
but i havent
ive got a hospital to run

he must have had
yes i think i can
i dont believe so
no-one could possibly imagine it
i dont believe any of us can
terrible though his appearance is
so terrible indeed
that women and nervous persons
fly in horror from the sight of him
and that he is debarred from
seeking to earn his livelihood
in any ordinary way
yet he is superior in intelligence
he can read and write
is quiet gentle not to say
even refined in his mind
i should very much like
to meet this gentleman
have you seen this
no

hey up hey up
hey up
now listen this is a letter
to the london times
from the governor of the ospital
there is now in a little room
off one of our attic wards
a man named john merrick
so dreadful a sight that he is unable
even to come out
by daylight to the garden
he has been called the elephant man
on account of his terrible deformity
his appearance is so terrible
that women and nervous persons
fly in terror at the sight of him
and how do you get tickets to see him
your very own sunny jim
well let go and see him then
all right keep your shirt on

bright lights of the english stage
mrs kendal mr john merrick
good day mr merrick
good day
ive brought you some things
i hope you like them
i hope you dont think it too forward
oh oh no
i knew youd understand
ill leave you together
here
i want you to know i dont go about
giving my picture to just anyone

well i
ill i shall put it in
in a place of honour
here next to my mother
she very pretty your mother
oh yes
oh i see youre constructing a
church
no it it a cathedral
do you see
only i have to rely on my imagination
for what i cant actually see so
mr treves tells me
that youre in the theatre
do you live there
oh no mr merrick i just work there
it must be wonderful
just to work there
is it beautiful
youve never been
no im afraid not
oh mr merrick you must go
the theatre the most
beautiful place on earth
of course i am a bit partial
the theatre is
romance
romance
oh yes
which reminds me
ive brought you something else
oh
thank you
have you read it
no oh but i certainly shall
oh romeo and juliet
yes ive heard of this
if i profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine
the gentle fine is this
thy lips two blushing pilgrims
ready stand to smooth that
rough touch
with a tender kiss
good pilgrim
you do wrong your hand too much
which mannerly devotion shows in this
for saints have hands
that pilgrims hands do touch
and palm to palm
is holy palmer kiss
oh then dear saint
let lips do what hands do
they pray grant thou
lest faith turn to despair
saints do not move
though grant for prayer sake
then move not
while my prayer effect i take
thus from my lips
by thine my sin is purged
and then it says they kiss
then have my lips
the sin that they have took
sin from my lips
o trespass sweetly urgd
give me my sin again
oh mr merrick
youre not an elephant man at all
no
no
youre romeo
mrs kendal always at the
forefront of fashion and form
was seen leaving
the london the other afternoon
no dear readers the most
facile actress of our day
has not been taken ill
but rather said she was
visiting a friend
and who was the lucky recipient
of this attention
quick enquiries proved it to be
none other than
mr john merrick the elephant man
with whom our readers are
undoubtedly familiar
after a chat of
three-quarters of an hour
mrs kendal was kind enough
to leave mr merrick
with an autographed
portrait of herself
i saw it in his room
owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature
mr merrick has never been
properly presented to london society
but knowing that wherever
mrs kendal goes
others inevitably follow
the question arises will london
society present itself to him
this walking stick is so dashing
and much more elegant
than my old one
more tea
you see i dont go out
as often as i would like
because naturally some people
do find my appearance disturbing
if you have a chill
i could close the window
er oh no im fine
please er
i mean thank you
thank you
you see
people are frightened
by what they dont understand
and it is hard to understand
even for me because my mother
she was so very beautiful
mrs mothershead i dont think
he should have any more visitors today
and i have to lecture at the college
so ill be back this evening
excuse me sir but if you have time
i would like a word with you
im rather late what is it
well sir i dont quite
i dont quite understand
why it is you allow
that sort of people in there
why because he enjoys it
and i think it very good for him
yes but sir you saw the
expression on their faces
they didnt hide their disgust
they dont care anything about john
they only want to
impress their friends
i think youre being rather
harsh on them dont you
i beg your pardon sir
you yourself hardly showed him
much love and kindness
when he first arrived did you
i bathed him i fed him
and i cleaned up after him didnt i
and i see that my nurses do the same
and if loving kindness can be called
care and practical concern
then i did show him loving kindness
and i am not ashamed to admit it
i didnt mean it exactly that way
now please believe me
of course i appreciate your concern
i appreciate everything that
youve done for mr merrick
thank you
but i am the physician in charge
and i must do what i think is best for him
please now im also very late
if you ask my opinion
he only being stared at
all over again
thank you
night time
freddie
what the matter freddie
ive been thinking about mr bytes
what on earth made you think of him
well im beginning to believe that
mr bytes and i are very much alike
that absurd
it seems that i
ive made mr merrick into a
curiosity all over again doesnt it
only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival
my name is constantly in the papers
im always being praised to the skies
patients are now
expressly asking for my services
of course they do
because you are a very fine doctor
john merrick is happier
and more fulfilled now
than he ever been in his entire life
and it completely due to you
what was it all for
why did i do it
freddie what are you trying to say
am i a good man
or am i a bad man
steady on treves
steady on my dear fellow
come and sit down wont you
gentlemen
i know we usually open these
proceedings by reading the minutes
but on this occasion
in the interests of urgency
i think we should first conclude
the matter previously under discussion
the case of mr john merrick
the elephant man
one moment mr chairman
as far as im concerned this creature
has no business being here at all
i for one am sick and tired
of this competitive freak-hunting
by these overly ambitious
young doctors
trying to make names for themselves
to parade them about in front of
a pathological society
is one thing mr treves
but to waste this committee
valuable time
with requests for shelter for these
abominations of nature
is quite another
you must be more careful
in the light of these facts
our course is clear
the question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient
the question is when will those rooms
be vacated for use by better qualified
more deserving cases
hear hear
i move that this elephant man
be removed from the premises
immediately
we have a sacred duty
to cure the sick
not care for circus animals
mr broadneck
that is my last word on the subject
mr chairman shall we vote
i take it mr broadneck that your mind
is quite unshakeable in this matter
mr chairman do you not have ears
i am unalterably opposed
my mind is made up on this
you shall not sway me
may we now vote mr chairman
at long last
yes broadneck
i think the time has come
gentlemen her royal highness
alexandra princess of wales
good morning gentlemen
i hope i am not disturbing you
on the contrary maam
your presence here
is always greatly appreciated
we were just taking a vote
on mr merrick
her royal highness has shown the
greatest interest in mr merrick fate
indeed i have sir as has the queen
i have a brief communication
from her majesty
which she has requested
that i read to you
to the governing committee
london hospital
i would very much like
to commend you
for the charitable face you have shown
mr john merrick the elephant man
it is laudable that you have
provided one of england
most unfortunate sons with a safe
and tranquil harbour a home
for this immeasurable kindness
as well as the many other acts of mercy
on behalf of the poor
of which mr carr gomm
has kept me informed
i gratefully thank you
signed victoria
i am sure i can count on you
gentlemen to do the christian thing
thank you very much maam
im sure we shall all try
gentlemen i wish to move
that mr john merrick
be admitted to this hospital
on a permanent basis
provided the hospital
receives a yearly sum
equal to the cost of
the occupation of one bed
all those in favour
thank you gentlemen the motion is carried

he wants to say to you
