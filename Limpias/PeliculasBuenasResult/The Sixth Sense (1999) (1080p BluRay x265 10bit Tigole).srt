youre worried that
she said she told him things
things she couldnt
tell anyone else
secrets
you have a secret
but you dont want to tell me
your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away
he forgot it in a drawer

you keep pretty quiet
in school but
youre a good student
youve never really been
in any serious trouble

i just cant seem
to keep track of time
and i didnt have
a very good session today i
theyre both so similar
same mannerisms
same expressions same
things hanging over their head
i think it might be some kind of abuse
cole has scratches on his arm
i think they might be fingernail cuts
defensive cuts maybe
i dont know anna
maybe a teacher or a neighbor
i dont think it the mother
ive seen her with him and
doesnt seem to fit
or i could just be wrong
maybe he just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot
i know that
ive been a little distant i
i know that it makes you mad
i just
feel like im being given a second
chance and i dont want it to slip away

for example a person might
leave something on a desk
for someone else to find
do you know what
free-association writing is cole
no
free-association writing is when
you take a pencil in your hand and
you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing
you don t look at what youre writing
or think about what youre writing
you just keep your hand moving
and after a while if you
keep your hand moving long enough
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didnt even know you had in you
could be something
you heard somewhere else or
feelings you had
deep inside of you
have you ever done any
free-association writing cole
yes
what did you write
upset words
did you ever write any upset words
before your father left
i dont remember
can you do something for me
i want you to think about what you
want to get out of our time together
what our goals should be
something i want
if you could change something in your
life anything at all what would it be
instead of something i want
can it be something i dont want
ok
i dont want
to be scared anymore
you gonna get that
are you gonna get that
hey
dont you see
enough of me at the store
im on my way out to the flea market

how to buy at one of these things
i dont know if i can
deal with the amish today
you cant curse or spit
or anything around them
i just figured maybe
you just wanted to get some air
because youd seemed
kind of down lately

hey
did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories
once upon a time
there was this young prince
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive
and he got his driver
and they started driving
driving driving
driving a lot and
they drove so much
that he fell asleep
and
then he woke up
and he realized they were still driving
this was a very long trip
dr crowe
you havent told
bedtime stories before
not too many no
you have to add
some twists and stuff
ok some twists
like what kind of twists
give me an example
maybe they run out of gas
they run out of gas that good
cause theyre driving right 0k
tell me the story
about why youre sad
you think im sad
what makes you think that
your eyes told me
im not supposed to talk
about stuff like that
once upon a time there was
this person named malcolm
he worked with children
he loved it
he loved it more than anything else
and then one night
he found out that he made a
mistake with one of them
he couldnt help that one
and he cant stop thinking about it
he cant forget
ever since then
things have been different
he not the same person
that he used to be
and his wife
doesnt like the person
that he become
they barely speak anymore
theyre like strangers
and then one day malcolm
meets this wonderful little boy
a really cool little boy
reminds him a lot of the other one
and malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy
cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy
be like
helping that other one too
how does the story end
i dont know
i want to tell you my secret now
ok
i see dead people
in your dreams
while youre awake
dead people like
in graves and coffins
walking around like regular people
they dont see each other

what they want to see
they dont know theyre dead
how often do you see them
all the time
theyre everywhere
you wont tell anyone
my secret right

once there was a boy
very different from all the other boys
he lived in the jungle
and he could speak
to the animals
did you think
the play sucked big time
tommy tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial
he said everyone was
self-conscious and unrealistic
he said the play sucked big time
this tommy kid
sounds like a real punk
i thought the play was excellent
better than cats
cats
never mind
cole i was really interested in
what you told me at the hospital
id like to hear more about it
cole
something up there
cole
i dont see anything
be real still
sometimes you feel it inside
like youre falling down real fast
but youre really just standing still
do you ever feel the prickly
things on the back of your neck
yes
and the tiny hairs on your arm
you know when they stand up

when they get mad

bureau drawer when i was cleaning

the bumblebee pendant
why do you keep taking it
it was grandma
you know what if it broke
you know how sad id be
youd cry cause you
miss grandma so much
that right
sometimes people think
they lose things
and they really didnt lose them
it just gets moved
so did you move
the bumblebee pendant
dont get mad
so who moved it this time
maybe someone came in our house
took the bumblebee pendant
out of my closet
and placed it nicely in your drawer
maybe
god i am so tlred cole
im tired in my body
im tired in my mind
im tired in my heart
i need some help
you know i dont know if you noticed
but our little family
isnt doing so good
i mean ive been praying

it edwardian
beautifully worked
with mine-cut diamonds
and an actual color
burmese sapphire
it timeless
you
got anything a little plainer
plainer
you want a plain ring to go with
your plain fiancé is that how it is
no baby dont get in a tizzy
youre so beautiful
youre like a burmese sapphire
all by yourself
you dont need all that
why dont you try it on
and see how you both feel about it
there how does that feel
i think this piece
communicates a longing
i imagine that
the woman who owned it
loved a man
that she couldnt be with
did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes
i dont know but
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate
and i think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you
i think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things
like like fingerprints
ill just wrap it up
you dont need a guy
with a master
you need a wrestler with
a neck larger than his head
no i need a wrestler
