weve become bored
with watching actors
give us phony emotions
were tired
of pyrotechnics
and special effects
while the world
he inhabits
is in some respects
counterfeit
there nothing fake
about truman himself--
no scripts
no cue cards
it isnt always shakespeare
but it genuine
it a life
im not going to make it

of this mountain
broken legs and all

between a private life
and a public life
my lifeis my life

a truly blessed life

the summit

my mind but
it feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow
that a lot of world
for one man truman
sure that not
wishful thinking
you wishing youd made
something more
out of yourself
come on who hasnt
sat in the john
had an imaginary interview
on  seahaven tonight
who hasnt wanted
to be somebody
this is different
everybody seems to be in on it
ive been your best friend
since we were 7 years old
the only way you and i ever
made it through school
was by cheating off
each other test papers
jesus they were identical
but i always felt safe
knowing that
cause whatever
the answer was
we were right together
and we were wrong together
remember when i stayed up
all night in your tent
cause you wanted
to play north pole
and i got pneumonia
laughing
you remember that
you were out of school
for about a month
youre the closest thing
i ever had to a brother
i know that things
havent really worked
out for either of us
like we used to
dream they would
i know that feeling
when it like everything
slipping away
you dont want
to believe it
so you look for answers
somewhere else but
well
christof
but well the point is
id gladly walk in front
of traffic for you
marlon well
the point is
i would gladly
step in front of traffic
for you truman
and the last thing
id ever do is lie to you
and the last thing
that i would ever do
is lie to you
i mean think about it
truman
if everybody
is in on it
id have to be
in on it too
im not in on it
truman because
there is no it
you were right about
one thing though
what that
the thing that
started all this
yep i found him
for you truman
that why
i came by tonight
im sure he got
quite a story to tell
go to him
easy on the fog
keyboard clicking
stand by crane cam

bravo
announcer 7 billion
were there for his birth
220 countries tuned in
for his first step
the world stood still
for that stolen kiss
and as he grew
so did the technology
an entire human life
recorded on an intricate
network of hidden cameras
and broadcast live and
unedited 24 hours a day
7 days a week to an audience
around the globe
coming to you now
from seahaven island
enclosed in the largest
studio ever constructed
and along with
the great wall of china
one of only 2 manmade structures
visible from space
now in its 30th great year
it
what a week it been
i dont know about you--
i was on pins and needles
the entire time
hello and good evening
im your host mike michaelson
and welcome to  tru-talk
our forum for issues
growing out of the show
but tonight
something very special indeed
a rare and
exclusive interview
with the show
conceiver and creator
so come with us now as we
go live to the lunar room
on the 22st floor
of the omni cam echosphere
where well find the world
greatest tele-visionary--
the designer and architect
of the world within a world
that is seahaven island--
christof
before we begin
id like to thank you
on behalf of our audience
for granting this interview
we know how demanding
your schedule is
and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy
this sir
is indeed an honor
dont mention it
well the catalyst for
the recent dramatic events
on the show has been
truman father kirk
and his attempts
to infiltrate the show
but before we get into that
i think it worth noting
that this is not the first time
someone from the outside
has attempted
to reach truman is it
christof we have had
close calls in the past
man truman
it television
yes
yes i did it
im on  the truman show
mike but there never
been anything to compare
with this most recent
breach in security--
the first intruder to be
a former cast member
a dead one at that
gotta say writing kirk
back in--masterstroke
since kirk started this
crisis in truman life
i came to the conclusion
that only he could end it
truman truman no
construction noises
that off limits
why what
over there
nothing it dangerous
that all
youve got to know
your limitations truman
mike but let remind
viewers exactly why
dad was written out
in the first place
christof as truman grew up
we were forced
to manufacture ways
to keep him on the island
id like to be
an explorer
like the great
magellan
youre too late
there really
nothing left to explore
snarling
christof finally i came up
with kirk drowning
mike most effective
truman been terrified
of the water ever since
christof when kirk read
the synopsis of the episode
he was disappointed
to say the least
jesus
im sure that what caused
him to break onto the set
but how do you intend to
explain his 22-year absence
amnesia
brilliant let take
some viewer phone calls
charlotte north carolina
youre on with christof
man uh yeah
hi christof
i was wondering how many
cameras you got in that town
somewhere in
the vicinity of 5000
man that
a lot of cameras
remember we started
with just one
he was curious
from birth
premature by 2 weeks
almost as if he couldnt
wait to get started
mike his eagerness
to leave his mother womb
was the very reason
he was the one selected
in competition with 5 other
unwanted pregnancies
the casting of a show
determined by an air date
truman was the one
who arrived on cue
mike incidentally i believe
truman is the first child
to have been legally adopted
by a corporation
that correct
the show has generated
enormous revenues now
equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country
people forget it takes
the population
of an entire country to
keep the show running
since the show is on
24-hours a day
without commercial interruption
all those staggering revenues
are generated
by product placement
that true everything
on the show is for sale
from the actor wardrobe
food products
to the very homes
they live in
mike and all of it available
in the truman catalog
operators are standing by
christof let me ask you
why do you think truman
has never come close
to discovering the true nature
of his world until now
we accept the reality
of the world
with which we are
presented
it as simple as that
the hague for christof
hello the hague
all right
weve lost that call
let go to hollywood
youre on  tru-talk
hi christof id just
like to say one thing
youre a liar
and a manipulator
and what youve done
to truman is sick
well we remember
this voice dont we
how could we forget
mike let go
to another call
no no no
it fine mike
i love to reminisce with
former members of the cast
sylvia
as you announced so
melodramatically to the world
you think because you batted
your eyes at truman once
flirted with him
stole a few minutes
of air time with him
to thrust yourself and your
politics into the limelight
that you know him
that you know
what right for him
you really think youre
in a position to judge him
what right do you have
to take a baby
and turn his life into
some kind of mockery
dont you ever
feel guilty
i have given truman a chance
to lead a normal life
the world
the place you live in
is the sick place
seahaven the way
the world should be
he not a performer
he a prisoner
look at him look at
what youve done to him
he can leave at any time
if his was more
than just a vague ambition
if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth
there no way
we could prevent him
i think what distresses
you really caller
is that ultimately
truman prefers his cell
as you call it
that where
youre wrong
youre so wrong and
hell prove you wrong
mike well aside from
the heated comments
of a very
vocal minority
it been an overwhelmingly
positive experience
yes for truman and
for the viewing public
well christof
i cant thank you enough
for giving so generously
of your time tonight
i think it safe to say now
that this crisis is behind us
and truman is back
to his old self
we can look forward to some
exciting new developments
well mike the big news
is that meryl
will be leaving truman
in an upcoming episode
and a new romantic interest
will be introduced
mike aha
im determined television
first on-air conception
will still take place
well another television
milestone straight ahead
you heard it here first
it has been a singular honor
and pleasure sir
christofthank you
thank you mike
