good boy
stay go home go on
go on
was it any better that time
all right
you remember we were talking about
john philip sousa
great march composer
around the turn of the century
he was a very famous man
but he had a huge thing
about recorded music
he would never allow his music
to be recorded
even when thomas edison
came to him
with his brand-new
invention the phonograph
but edison didnt care
he went ahead and did it anyhow
secretly he recorded
his marching band in a parade
which i guess makes it
the very first bootleg
so what do you
think about that
do you think
sousa was right
do you think it okay now
what about today performers
should you be able to just walk
up in the middle of a stage
plug in your cd player to a
marshall stack and that it
it good enough
i dont know
im a lot older than you
but i tend to think that
there an element of music
that cannot be captured
life cannot be captured
the human heart cannot be captured
the moment of creation
itself is fleeting
hey hachi how you doing
hey hachi
good night hachi
hey buddy
you ready to go home
yeah
it all right
it all right
hey hachi
hey boy

im sorry ill learn
andy
it time to go sweetheart
youre a good boy you stay here okay
ill be back
i hear and behold
god in every object
yet understand
god not in the least
nor do i understand who there
can be more wonderful than myself
in the faces of men
