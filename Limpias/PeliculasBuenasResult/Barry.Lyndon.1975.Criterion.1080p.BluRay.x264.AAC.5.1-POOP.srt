
gentlemen cock your pistols
gentlemen
barry father had been bred
like many sons of genteel families
to the profession of the law
there is no doubt he wouldve made
an eminent figure in his profession
had he not been killed in a duel
which arose over the purchase
of some horses
barry mother
after her husband death
lived in such a way
as to defy slander
many a man who had been smitten
by the charms of the spinster
renewed his offers to the widow
but she refused all proposals
of marriage
declaring that she lived
only for her son
and the memory of her departed saint
first love what a change
it makes in a lad
what a magnificent secret it is
that he carries about with him
the tender passion gushes out
of a man heart
he loves as a bird sings
or a rose blows from nature
killarney
now what shall it be
turn around and face the wall
the object of barry attention
and the cause of his early troubles
was his cousin
nora brady by name
i have taken the ribbon from around my neck
and hidden it somewhere on my person
if you find it you can have it
you are free to look anywhere for it
i will think little of you
if you do not find it
i cannot find it
you havent looked properly
i cannot find it
ill give you a hint
i feel the ribbon
why are you trembling
at
at the pleasure of finding the ribbon
liar
company forward march
company eyes left
about this time the united kingdom
was in a state of great excitement
by a threat generally accredited
of a french invasion
and the noblemen and people of condition
showed their loyalty by raising regiments
of horse and foot
to resist the invaders
their scarlet coats and swaggering airs
filled barry with envy
company eyes right
brady town sent a company to join
the kilwangan regiment
of which john quin was the captain
the whole country was alive
with war alarms
the three kingdoms ringing
with military music
at ready
present
fire
redmond what is the matter
nora were you obliged to dance
five times with captain quin
i dont care a fig for captain quin
he dances prettily to be sure
and is a pleasant rattle of a man
he looks well in his regimental stool
he asked me to dance
how could i refuse him
but you refused me
i can dance with you any day
to dance with your own cousin looks
as though i could find no other partner
besides redmond captain quin is a man
youre only a boy and you
hadnt a penny in the world
if ever i should meet him again you will
find out who is the best man of the two
ill fight him sword or
pistol captain as he is
redmond dont be so silly
i mean it nora
but captain quin is already
known as a valiant soldier
it is mighty well of you
to fight farmer boys
but to fight an englishman
is a very different matter
you best have your
englishman take you home
redmond
barry resolved never to see nora again
but such resolutions
steadfastly held for a whole week
are abandoned in a few
moments of bleak despair
no nora no except for you
and four others
i vow before all the gods my heart
has never felt the soft flame
ah you men you men john
your passion not equal to ours
we are like some plant ive read of
we bear but one flower and then we die
you you you mean you
never felt such an inclination for another
never my john
how can you ask such a question
oh darling norelia
nora was chaperoned
by her brothers mick and ulick
whose interests would be affected
by the favourable outcome
of her affair with quin
redmond how nice to see you
redmond
how could you do this to me
redmond in the name of
heavens what the matter
what are you talking about
i think this might be an opportune moment
to return something to you
i
thank you redmond
i must have forgotten it
yes you did nora
captain quin may i have the honour of
introducing my cousin redmond barry
miss brady it would appear
you both have something to
discuss in private with this young man
perhaps it would be
best for me to withdraw
captain quin i have nothing
to discuss with my cousin in private
miss brady it would appear you have
a great deal to discuss in private
good heavens captain quin he is but a boy and
dont signify any more than my parrot or lapdog
indeed
are you then in the habit of giving
intimate articles of your clothing
to your parrot or lapdog
maynt i give a bit of ribbon
to my own cousin
youre perfectly welcome miss
as many yards as you like
when ladies make presents to gentlemen
it is time for other gentlemen to retire
i have the honour to
wish you both a good day
jack quin
what the matter here
ill tell you what it is sir
ive had enough of miss brady here
and your irish ways
aint used to them sir
what is it
well accustom you to irish ways
or well adopt english ones
it is not the english way
for ladies to have two lovers
and so mr brady ill thank you
to pay me the sum you owe me
and i resign all claims
to this young lady
if she has a fancy with schoolboys
let her take em sir

and now he for murdering jack quin
and i tell you what mr brady ive been insulted grossly
in this house
im not at all satisfied
with these ways of going on
im an englishman i am
and a man of property
and as for this impudent young swine
should be horsewhipped
mr quin can have satisfaction
any time he pleases
by calling on redmond barry
esquire of barryville
ill see the boy home
a pretty day work of it
you made master redmond
knowing your uncle to be distressed
for money
and trying to break off a match which
will bring £500 a year into the family
quin has promised to pay off the £4000
which is bothering your uncle so
he takes a girl without a penny
a girl that flinging herself at the head of
every man in these parts these 5 years past
and missing them all
and you a boy who ought to be attached
to your uncle as to your father
and so i am
and this is the return
you make for his kindness
didnt he harbour you in his house
when your father died

is he dead
quite dead
this has been a sad day work
for our family redmond barry
and yeve robbed us of 500 a year
now youd better ride off
before the police are up
theyd wind of this business
before we left kilwangan
come on redmond ill go home with you
how different barry fate
might have been
had he not fallen in love
with nora
and had he not flung the wine
in captain quin face
but he was destined to be a wanderer
and the battle with quin set him
on his travels at a very early age
as you shall soon see
the boy must go into hiding
for a short time anyway
dublin is the best place for him to
he can stay there
til matters have blown over
but the child has never been
away from home before
wouldnt he be as safe here
i wish that were true aunt
belle now you know i do
but im afraid the bailiffs may be
already on their way from kilwangan
now dublin is five days ride
away from here
there not a soul wholl know him there
i dont want to harp on
unpleasant matters you know that
but you do know what can happen
to him if he taken
ill be all right
ill be all right in dublin mother
no lad who has liberty
for the first time
and 20 guineas in his pocket
is very sad
barry rode towards dublin
thinking not so much of
the kind mother left alone
and of the home behind him
but of tomorrow
and all the wonders it would bring
excuse me miss
would it be possible to have
a drink of water
yes sir
good day to you young sir
good day
will you join us in a drink
no thank you
would you like something to eat
that very kind of you
but i have to be on my way
thank you
goodbye
uh excuse me sir
good morning again young sir
dont even think about it
get down off that horse
raise your hands high
above your head please
come forward
stop
how do you do im captain feeney
captain feeney
captain feeney at your service
the captain feeney

may i introduce you to my son seamus
how do you do
how do you do
to whom have i
the honour of speaking
my name redmond barry
how do you do mr barry
and now im afraid we must get onto the more
regrettable stage of our brief acquaintance
turn around and keep your hands
high above your head please
there must be 20 guineas
in gold here father
well well well
you seem to be a very well set up
young gentleman sir
captain feeney that all the money
my mother had in the world
mightnt i be allowed keep it
im just one step ahead
of the law myself
i killed an english officer in a duel and im
on my way to dublin until things cool down
mr barry
in my profession
we hear many such stories
yours is one of the most intriguing
and touching ive heard in many weeks
nevertheless im afraid
i cannot grant your request
but ill tell you what i will do
ill allow you to keep
those fine pair of boots
which in normal circumstances
i would have for myself
the next town is only five miles away
and i suggest you now start walking
mightnt i be allowed to keep my horse
i would like to oblige you
but people like us we must be able
to travel faster than our clients
good day young sir
you can put down your hands now
mr barry
gale regiment of foot commanded
by lieutenant general charles gale
which has so gloriously distinguished
itself during the recent troubles
wants several men to supply
the places of those veterans
who have deserved to be pensioned
as lettermen at one shilling a day
all clever young fellows
who are free and able
and are ambitious of becoming
gentlemen by bearing arms
are hereby invited to step up
and meet the recruiting officer
who promises that they shall meet
with every encouragement
that merit and good behaviour
can entitle them to
those meeting the qualifications
will immediately receive
his majesty royal bounty
of one and a half guineas
with complete clothing arms
and accoutrements
king george and old england forever
left left left right left
left left left right left
for a young man in difficulty
who had killed a man in a duel and
was anxious to find refuge from the law
the opportunity to earn distinction
in the european wars
seemed a great stroke of good fortune
and king george was too much in want of men
to heed from whence they came
hey lad lad
lad
can i have a new beaker
this one is full of grease
covered in grease give the gentleman
a towel and a basin of turtle soup
if you want to vex him
ask him about his wife
the washerwoman who beats him
mr toole is it a towel
of your wife washing
they say she wipes your face
often with one
ask him why he wouldnt see her
yesterday when she came to the camp
mr toole why did you hide so yesterday
when mrs toole came to visit you
afraid of getting your ears boxed
gentlemen gentlemen you may fight it out
with fists if you choose
well form a square for that purpose
gentlemen step this way please
both shake hands
shake hands
take your stance
no biting kicking or scratching
the last man to remain standing
is the winner
gentlemen commence fighting now
barry training continued
at dunley at the camp
and within a month he was transformed
into a tall and proper young soldier
during this time the regiment strength
was steadily increased
by the arrival of other troops
in preparation for joining
their gallant armies fighting in germany
one occasion
brought the welcome appearance of no
other than his second in the fatal duel
captain grogan
it would have been better for all of us
if wed known what had become of you
didnt you think of writing
to your mother
of course
but the shame i felt of losing
her money
my father sword and pistols
i couldnt tell her
your mother wouldnt care
a pin about those things
you are her only concern
now you must sit down tonight
and write her a proper letter
and tell her that youre safe and well
and merry to brown bess
i will
is miss brady well
there are only six miss bradys now
has something happened to nora
she took on so about your going away
that she was obliged to
console herself with a husband
she is now mrs john quin
mrs john quin
was there another john quin
no
the very same one me boy
he recovered from his wound
the shot you hit him with was not likely to
hurt him for it was only made of tow
tow
do you think the bradys would let you kill
500 a year out of the family
the plan of the duel was all arranged
in order to get you out of the way
for the cowardly quin could never
be brought to marry
from fear of you
but hit him you certainly did me lad
with a fine thick plugget of tow
the fellow was so frightened
that he was an hour in coming to
are you in want of cash
you may draw on me for i got a couple
of hundred out of your uncle from my share
while they lasts you shall never want
it would require a great philosopher
historian to explain the causes
of the famous seven years war
in which europe was engaged
to in which barry regiment
was now on its way to take part
let it suffice to say
that england and prussia were allies
and at war against the french
swedes the russians and the austrians
barry first taste of battle
was only a skirmish against
a small rearguard of frenchmen
who occupied an orchard
beside a road
down which a few hours later the
english main force wished to pass
though this encounter is not recorded
in any history books
it was memorable enough
for those who took part
ive only a hundred guineas
left to give you
for i lost the rest at cards
kiss me me boy
for well never meet again
it is well to dream of glorious
war in a snug armchair at home
but it is a very different thing
to see it first-hand
and after the death of his friend barry thoughts
turned from those of military glory
to those of finding a way
to escape the service
to which he was now
tied for another six years
gentlemen may talk
of the age of chivalry
but remember the ploughmen
poachers and pickpockets whom they lead
it is with these sad instruments
that your great warriors and kings
have been doing their murderous work
in the world
a young man could hardly have fallen
into worse circumstances
than those in which barry found himself
but fate did not intend he should
remain long an english soldier
an accident occurred
which took him out of the service
in a rather singular manner
freddie i hope you wont be too angry
with me but
ive got something to tell you
which you wont be happy about
oh what is it
first youve got to promise me
youll keep your temper
jonathan dont be such a silly ass
youre making a great big mystery of it
what is going on
i im afraid i shall have to go away again
only for about a fortnight
oh my god youre not serious
yes im afraid i am there
nothing i can do about it
where are you going to this time
im going to bremen carrying important
messages and dispatches to prince henry
but jonathan you promised me last time it
would be once and for all and never again
yes i know and promise you ive
kept my part of the bargain but
pontersby insists im the only one on his
staff who can be entrusted with the trip
here was the opportunity
to escape from the army
for which he had been searching
it was only a few miles through the forest to
the area occupied by their prussian allies
where this officer uniform
and papers
should allow him to travel
without suspicion
and stay ahead of the news of his
desertion which would be sure to follow
then well have little time together
are you cross with me
damn you damn you you know i
cant stay cross with you for long
oh jonathan
it times like this that i realize
how much i care for you
and how impossibly empty
life would be without you
frederick
barry was glad to see the blue and
white uniforms of the prussian infantry
they showed him that he was out of
the land occupied by his own countrymen
his intention was to make for holland
almost the only neutral country
of europe in those times
and thence to get a passage home somehow
as he rode away
barry felt once more that
he was in his proper sphere
and determined never again
to fall from the rank of a gentleman
excuse me miss
yes
good day
good day
do you speak english
im speaking little
i have not eaten anything all day no food
is there an inn nearby
where i might have a meal
no i dont think so
there is nothing to eat
something since grünberg
do you live near here
yes
would you feed me something to eat
id be happy to pay you
i think so
is it a little boy or a little girl
a boy
and what his name
peter
how old is peter
he one year sold
where might peter father be
you mean where he is
yes
he in the war
and how long has he been gone
sorry i didnt understand
what
how long has he been gone
oh a long time
since springtime
it must be hard for you to be alone
it is
it must be very danger
for you to be in the war
im an officer and must do my duty
you are sometimes
lonely
sometimes
what did you say what your name
lieutenant fakenham
no i mean
what is the name before fakenham
my first name
yes
jonathan
jonathan
would you like
to stay with me
for a few days or sometimes
that would be very nice
goodbye my beautiful lischen
goodbye redmond
i love you
i love you
look after yourself
god be with you
a lady who sets her heart
upon a lad in uniform
must prepare to change lovers
pretty quickly
or her life will be but a sad one
this heart of lischen was like
many a neighbouring town
and had been stormed and occupied
several times before barry came to invest it
during the five years which
the war had now lasted
the great and illustrious frederick had
so exhausted the males of his kingdom
that he had to employ
scores of recruiters
who would hesitate at no crime
including kidnapping
to keep supplied those brilliant
regiments of his with food for powder
good evening sir
im captain potzdorf may i ask to
whom have i the honour of speaking
good evening im lieutenant fakenham
gale regiment of foot
pleased to meet you
can we be of some
assistance to you lieutenant
thank you captain but i must continue
on my way im carrying urgent dispatches
may i ask your destination
im travelling to bremen
to bremen then youre
obviously lost lieutenant
because bremen is in
the opposite direction
are you sure captain
yes
wouldnt you know it
my departure was so hastily organised that
my orderly forgot to prepare proper maps of the area
of course i understand
please do not be offended lieutenant
but may i ask whether you are
carrying your identity papers
yes of course i am
would you allow me to see them
of course
here you are
thank you very much
thank you very much lieutenant i hope
i havent inconvenienced you in any way
not at all
now that we are riding
in the same direction
id be very honoured if youd allow me to
offer you a meal and a bed for the night
and a proper map to be
drawn up for the journey
that extremely kind of you captain
and id be honoured to accept your invitation
barry was treated with great civility
and was asked a thousand questions
about england
which he answered as best he could
inventing a thousand stories
he described the king and ministers
boasted that the british ambassador
in berlin was his uncle
and even offered captain potzdorf
a letter of introduction
his host seemed quite satisfied
with these stories
but at the same time
he led barry on
with a skilful combination of
questions and flattery
you will have to pardon me i know
so little about your country of england
except that you are
the bravest nation in the world
and that we are really fortunate
to have such allies
lieutenant fakenham
let us drink to the friendship
of our two great nations
to our two great nations
arent you lucky
going to bremen tomorrow
i know one of the loveliest women
in europe there
may i ask you to take a letter to her
certainly
by the way to whom are you carrying
your dispatches
general williamson
general williamson
yes
general percival williamson
yes the same
sergeant
this man is under arrest
under arrest captain potzdorf sir
im a british officer
you are a liar youre an imposter
youre a deserter
i suspected you this morning and your
lies and folly have confirmed this to me
you pretend to carry dispatches to a
general who has been dead these ten months
you say your uncle is the
british ambassador in berlin
with the ridiculous name of ogrady
now will you join and take
the bounty sir or be given up
i volunteer
the prussian service
was considerably worse than the english
the life that a private soldier led
was a frightful one
punishment was incessant
and every officer had the right to inflict it
the gauntlet was the most common penalty
for minor offences
more serious ones were punishable
by mutilation or death
at the close of the seven years war
the army
so renowned for its disciplined valour
was officered by native prussians
but it was composed for the most part
of men from the lowest levels
of humanity
hired or stolen
from almost every nation in europe
thus barry fell into the worst
of courses and company
and was soon very far advanced in
the science of every kind of misconduct
help
get me out of here
help
get me out of here
the colonel speech declared that
the king had expressed his satisfaction
with the conduct of the regiment
at the battle of audorf
and with the bravery of corporal redmond
barry in rescuing captain potzdorf
was to be specially rewarded
with the sum of two frederick dor
corporal barry eight paces forward
march
corporal barry
youre a gallant soldier and have
evidently come of good stock
but youre idle and unprincipled
youve done a great
deal of harm to the men
and for all your talents and bravery
im sure youll come to no good
i hope the colonel guideau is
mistaken regarding my character
i have fallen into bad company it is true
but ive only done as other soldiers have done
and above all i never had a kind friend
or protector before
to show that i was worthy
of better things
the colonel may say im a ruined lad
and send me to the devil
but be sure of this i would go to the
devil to serve the regiment
corporal barry fall in
the war was soon ended and barry
regiment was garrisoned in the capital
he had for some time now ingratiated
himself considerably with captain potzdorf
whose confidence in him
was about to bring its reward
good morning redmond
good morning captain potzdorf
i should like you to meet my uncle
the minister of police herr from potzdorf
good morning herr minister
redmond
ive spoken to the minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made
we shall get you out of the army
appoint you to the police bureau
and in time
well allow you to move in a better sphere than
that which fortune has hitherto placed you
thank you captain potzdorf
redmond your loyalty to me and your service
to the regiment has pleased me very well
and now there is another occasion on
which you may make yourself useful to us
and if you succeed
depend on it
your reward will be secure
ill do the best i can sir
there lately come to berlin a gentleman
in the service of the empress queen of austria
he calls himself
the chevalier de balibari
he appears to follow the
profession of a gambler
he a libertine
fond of women of good food
polished obliging
he speaks french and german indifferently
but we have some reason to fancy
that this monsieur de balibari
is a native of your country of ireland
and that he has come here as a spy
naturally your knowledge of english
makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service
and to find out for us
whether or not he is a spy
does this assignment interest you
you may be certain herr minister im interested
in anything that can be of service to yourself
and to captain potzdorf
of course you will not
know a word of english
and if the chevalier asks as to the particularity
of your accent say you are a hungarian
you served in the war
you left the army on account
of weakness in the loins
you then served monsieur de quellenberg
for two years
he now with the army in silesia but
youll have a certificate signed by him
good morning your honour
so you are the young man
recommended by seebach
yes your honour
here are my credentials
your name is lazlo zilagy
yes your honour
monsieur de quellenberg
recommends you highly
monsieur is a very good man
it was very imprudent of him
but when barry saw
the splendour of the chevalier appearance
the nobleness of his manner
he felt it impossible to
keep disguise with him
those who have never
been out of their country
know little what it is to hear
a friendly voice in captivity
and as many a man who will
not understand the cause
of the burst of feeling which
was now about to take place
you seem the right one to me
thank you your honour
are you ill
sir
i have a confession to make to you
im an irishman
and my name is redmond barry
i was abducted into the
prussian army two years ago
now ive been put into your service
by my captain potzdorf
and his uncle the minister of police
to serve as a watch
upon your actions
and to give information to the same court
the chevalier was as much affected as barry
at thus finding one of his countrymen
for he too was an exile from home
and a friendly voice a look
brought the old country
back to his memory again
he goes to church regularly
he very religious
and after hearing mass he
comes home for breakfast
he then takes an airing in his carriage
barry presented his reports
regularly at the minister office
the details were arranged between
him and the chevalier beforehand
he was instructed and it
is always far the best way
to tell as much truth as his story
would possibly bear
it would be seen that the information
he gave was very minute and accurate
though not very important
but who does not acknowledge him
wine or punch your honour
wine
it was agreed that barry
should keep his character of valet
that in the presence of strangers
he should not know a word of english
and that he should keep
a lookout on the trumps
when serving the
champagne and punch about
and having a remarkably fine eyesight
and a natural aptitude
he was speedily able to give
his dear patron much assistance
against his opponents
at the green table
if for instance he wiped
the table with a napkin
it was to show the enemy was strong in diamonds
if he adjusted a chair it meant ace king
if he said punch or wine my lord
hearts were meant and so forth
the prince of tübingen
was a nobleman who had intimate connections
with the great frederick
was passionately fond of play
as indeed were the gentlemen
of almost all the courts of europe
you owe 5500 frederick dor
chevalier
though i cannot say how
i believe you have cheated me
i deny your grace accusation
and beg you to say
how you have been cheated
i dont know
but i believe i have been
your grace owes me
5500 frederick dor
which i have honourably won
chevalier
if you will have your money now
you must fight for it
if you will be patient
maybe i will pay you something
another time
your grace if i am to be so tame
as to take this
then i must give up an honourable
and lucrative occupation
i have said all there is to be said
i am at your disposal
for whatever purposes you wish
good night
was the prince cheated
in as far as i am able to tell of
such things herr minister no
i believe the chevalier
won the money fairly
what are the chevalier intentions
im not sure
the prince told him quite clearly that if he
wished to have his money hed have to fight for it
a meeting with the prince of türbingen is impossible
the prince has left him only that choice
now
will you be able to return here tomorrow
without arousing suspicion
i know they wont allow a meeting
with the prince
but if i say that do you know any reason
why hell pay me the money he owes me
you must tell them i intend
to demand satisfaction
dont look so downcast my boy
there no harm they can do to me my friends
in the austrian embassy will see to that
the worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs
and if they should make your mind easy
you shall not be left behind
have no fear of that
the king has determined to send
the chevalier out of the country
has he already demanded satisfaction
not yet herr minister
but i believe he intends to
possibly today
then this must be done tomorrow
all the arrangements are made
redmond
you said he takes a drive in his carriage
after breakfast every day
yes sir
is there any reason to believe
that hell do any different tomorrow
no sir
good
when the chevalier comes out
to his carriage in the morning
two officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier
his baggage will be sent after him
excellent
at ten oclock the next morning
the chevalier de balibari
went out for his regular morning drive
where is my servant lazlo
i will let down the steps for your honour
what is the meaning of this
please get inside
am i under arrest
were going to drive to the frontier
to the frontier but im on my way
to the austrian ambassador house
im sorry your honour but my
orders are to escort you to the frontier
and see you safely across the border
but im not going to the frontier
im going to the austrian ambassador house
i have very important business there
my orders are to take your honour to the
frontier by any means which may be necessary
but if you come along willingly
im to give you this purse
on behalf of the prince of tübingen
containing 2000 frederick dor
all europe shall hear of this
and so without papers or passport
and under the eyes
of two prussian officers
barry was escorted across the frontier
into saxony and freedom
the chevalier himself had uneventfully
crossed the frontier the night before
and by these wonderful circumstances
barry was once more free again
and began his professional work
as a gamester
resolving thenceforward and forever
to live the life of a gentleman
the four wins
soon there was no court in europe where
he and the chevalier were not received
and they were speedily in the very
best society where play was patronized
and professors of that science
always welcome
the seven
why not the seven
all all yes
no more bets
number seven
loses
place your bets
chevalier will you give me
credit for 5000 louis dor please
of course lord ludd
five thousand
now everything on the four
yes i know everything on the four
no more bets
the four loses
another game
it is not important
now im weary
i would like dinner shall we
excuse me lord ludd
if you dont mind
not at all
they always played on credit
with any person of honour or noble lineage
they never pressed for their winnings
or declined to receive
promissory notes in lieu of gold
but woe to the man who did not pay
when the note became due
redmond barry was sure to wait upon him
with his bill
and there were few bad debts
saluez
it was his great skill
with the sword and readiness to use it
that maintained the reputation
of the firm so to speak
en garde
i will pay you today sir
thus it will be seen that their life
for all its splendour
was not without danger and difficulty
requiring talent and determination
for success
and one which required them to live
a wandering and disconnected life
and if the truth be told though they were
swimming upon the high tide of fortune
and prospering with the cards
they had little to show for their labour
but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets
five years in the army and some
considerable experience of the world
had by now dispelled any romantic notions
regarding love
with which barry commenced life
and he began to have it in mind
as so many gentlemen had done before him
to marry a woman
of fortune and condition
and as such things so often happen
these thoughts closely coincided
with his setting first sight upon a lady
who will henceforth play a
considerable part in the drama of his life
the countess of lyndon
viscountess bullingdon of england
baroness castle lyndon of ireland
a woman of vast wealth and great beauty
she was the wife of the right
honourable sir charles reginald lyndon
knight of the bath
minister to george iii
at several of the courts of europe
a cripple wheeled about in a chair
worn out by gout
and a myriad of diseases
her ladyship chaplain mr runt
acted in the capacity of tutor to her son
the little viscount bullingdon
a melancholy little boy
much attached to his mother
samuel im going
outside for a breath of air
yes my lady
to make a long story short
six hours after they met
her ladyship was in love
and once barry got into her company
he found innumerable occasions
to improve his intimacy
and was scarcely out
of her ladyship sight
good evening gentlemen
good evening
sir charles
good evening mr barry
have you done with my lady
i beg your pardon
come sir im a man who would rather
be known as a cuckold than a fool
i think sir charles lyndon
that youve had too much to drink
ha ha what
as it happens your chaplain mr runt
introduced me into the company of your lady
to advise me on a religious matter
of which she is a considerable expert
he wants to step into my shoes
he wants to step into my shoes
is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me
as i am drawing near the goal
to find my home such a happy one
my wife so fond of me that she is even
now thinking of appointing a successor
isnt it a comfort to see her
like a prudent housewife
getting everything ready
for her husband departure
i hope youre not thinking of
leaving us soon sir charles
not so soon my dear as
you may fancy perhaps
why man ive been given
over many times these four years
and there was always
a candidate or two
waiting to apply for the situation
im sorry for you mr barry
it grieves me to keep you
or any gentleman waiting
had you not better arrange
with my doctor
or have the cook flavour my omelet
with arsenic eh
what are the odds gentlemen
that i live to see mr barry hang yet
sir let those laugh that win
gentlemen
ill get a surgeon
have some brandy sir charles
from a report in the st james chronicle
died at spa in the kingdom of belgium
the right honourable
sir charles reginald lyndon
knight of the bath
member of parliament
and for many years
his majesty representative
at various european courts
he has left behind him a name
which is endeared to all his friends
dearly beloved
we are gathered together
here in the sight of god
and in the face of this congregation
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony
a year later
on the fifteenth of june
in the year 773
redmond barry had the honour to lead
to the altar the countess of lyndon
the ceremony was performed by the
reverend samuel runt her ladyship chaplain
and therefore is not in any way
to be enterprised
nor taken in hand unadvisedly
lightly or wantonly
to satisfy men carnal lusts
and appetites
like brute beasts
that have no understanding
but reverently
discreetly
advisedly
soberly
and in the fear of god
duly considering the causes
for which matrimony was ordained
first
it was ordained for the procreation
of children to be brought up
in the fear and nurture of the lord
and to the praise of his holy name
secondly
it was ordained for a remedy
against sin and to avoid fornication
that such persons
barry had now arrived
at the pitch of prosperity
and by his own energy had raised
himself to a higher sphere of society
having procured his majesty
gracious permission to add the name
of his lovely lady to his own
thenceforth redmond barry
assumed the style
and title of barry lyndon
redmond would you mind not smoking
for a while
redmond
lady lyndon was soon
destined to occupy a place in barry life
not very much more important
than the elegant carpets and pictures
which would form
the pleasant background of his existence
my lord bullingdon
you seem particularly glum today
you should be happy
that your mother has remarried
not in this way
and not in such haste
and certainly not to this man
i think you judge your mother too harshly
do you not like your new father
not very much
he seems to me little more
than a common opportunist
i dont think he loves my mother at all
and it hurts me to see her
make such a fool of herself
at the end of a year
her ladyship presented barry with a son
bryan patrick lyndon they called him
none of those ancient heroes
eer saw a cannon ball
or knew the force of powder
to slay their foes withal
but our brave boys do know it
and banish all their fears
with a tow row row row row
to the british grenadiers
her ladyship and barry lived
after a while pretty separate
she preferred quiet or to say the truth
he preferred it for her
being a great friend to a modest
and tranquil behaviour in woman
besides she was a mother
and would have great comfort
in the dressing educating
and dandling of their little bryan
for whose sake it was fit
barry believed
that she should give up the pleasures
and frivolities of the world
leaving that part of the duty
of every family of distinction
to be performed by him
lady lyndon tended
to a melancholy and maudlin temper
and left alone by her husband
was rarely happy or in good humour
now she must add jealousy
to her other complaints
and find rivals even among her maids
samuel what would the time be
twenty-five minutes past eleven
my lady
shall we make this the last game ladies
yes
good morning ladies
good morning sir
would you mind excusing us
id like a word alone with lady lyndon
im sorry
this coat is made of the
finest littlefield velvet
all cunningly worked as you see
with silver thread
no finer velvet has ever been woven
and you will see none better anywhere
pardon me gentlemen
good morning dearest
good morning
were taking the children for a ride
to the village well be back for tea
well have a nice time ill see you then
goodbye little bryan
lord bullingdon
take good care of your mother
come now give your father a proper kiss
lord bullingdon
is that the way to behave
to your father
lord bullingdon
have you lost your tongue
my father was sir charles lyndon
i have not forgotten him if others have
lord bullingdon
you have insulted your father
madam you have insulted my father
dearest would you excuse lord
bullington and me for a few minutes
we have something
to discuss in private
gentlemen
one
two
three
four
five
six
lord bullingdon
i have always been willing
to live with you on terms of friendship
but be clear about one thing
as men serve me i serve them
i never laid a cane on the back
of a lord before
but if you force me to i shall
speedily become used to the practice
do you have anything to say for yourself
no
you may go
barry believed and not
without some reason that it had been
a declaration of war against him
by bullingdon from the start
and that the evil consequences
which ensued
were entirely of bullingdon creating
i shall make you into
a real magician now bryan
i shall show you the knot that never was
as bullingdon grew up to be a man
his hatred for barry
assumed an intensity
equalled only by his
increased devotion to his mother
very good bryan a little bow
put it on the table for me
thank you
for bryan eighth birthday the
local nobility gentry and their children
came to pay their respects
the inside is quite empty
the outside is quite empty
wave your hand over the top bryan
is there anything there
yes oh
wonderful wonderful colourful
silk handkerchiefs
take a bow bryan
you did that beautifully
very good indeed
let see if you have something
behind your ear
yes you have ha ha
a little ball let make it vanish
it gone bryan
here it is here it is behind my elbow
i want you you to wave your hand
over my green silk handkerchief
and see whether we can produce
a magic flower i wonder if we can
here it comes look at that
we have the colours of the rainbow
you know all the colours of the rainbow
produce but one colour bryan
nothing in my magic cabinet
they produce the colour white
and there is my own
beautiful white rabbit
bryan you did that very well
a little bow
we crept up on their fort
and i jumped over the wall first
my fellows jumped after me
you should have seen the look on the frenchmen
faces when 23 rampaging he-devils
sword and pistol cut and thrust
pell-mell came tumbling into their fort
in three minutes we left
as many artillerymen heads
as there were cannonballs
later that day we were visited
by our noble prince henry
who is the man who has done this
i stepped forward
how many heads was it says he
that you cut off
nineteen says i
besides wounding several
well when he heard it ill be blessed
if he didnt burst into tears
noble noble fellow he said
here is nineteen golden guineas for you
one for each head that you cut off
now what do you think of that
were you allowed to keep the heads
no the heads always become
the property of the king
will you tell me another story
ill tell you another story tomorrow
will you play cards with me tomorrow
of course i will now go to sleep
will you keep the candles lit
no bryan big boys dont sleep
with the candles lit
but im afraid of the dark
but my darling there nothing
to be afraid of
but i like it with the candles lit
it all right you can sleep
with the candles lit
thank you papa
good night
ah redmond
it a blessing to see my darling boy
has attained a position i always knew was his due
and for which i pinched myself
to educate him
little bryan is a darling boy
and you live in great splendour
your lady wife knows
she has a treasure
she couldnt have had
had she taken a duke to marry
but if she should tire
of my wild redmond
and his old-fashioned irish ways
or if she should die
what future would there be
for my son and my grandson
you have not a penny of your own
and cannot transact any business
without the countess signature
upon her death the entire estate
would go to young bullingdon
who bears you little affection
you could be penniless tomorrow
and darling bryan at the mercy
of his stepbrother
shall i tell you something
there is only one way for you
and your son to have real security
you must obtain a title
i shall not rest
until i see you lord lyndon
you have important friends
they can tell you
how these things are done
for money well-timed
and properly applied
can accomplish anything
and to be sure barry was acquainted with someone
who knew how these things were done
this was the distinguished barrister
and former government minister
lord hallam
whose acquaintance he had made as he
had so many others at the gaming table
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus
the thirteenth earl of wendover
i dont believe i do
well sir this nobleman is one
of the gentlemen of his majesty closet
and one with whom our revered monarch
is on terms of considerable intimacy
in my opinion you would be wise
to fix upon him
your chief reliance for the advancement of your
claim to the peerage which you prefer as to get
when i take up a person mr lyndon
he or she is safe
there is no question about them any more
my friends are the best people
i dont mean theyre the most virtuous
or indeed the least virtuous
or the cleverest
or the stupidest
or the richest or the best born
but the best
in a word people about whom
there is no question
i cannot promise you how long it will take
you can appreciate
it is not an easy matter
but any gentleman with an estate
and 30000 a year
should have a peerage
and there standing behind me
was a total stranger
so i looked at him and he said to me
excuse me sir could you tell me
is lord wendover alive or dead
i was so astonished
i couldnt think of what to say
then i became a bit angry
and said to him he dead
the striving after this peerage was one of
barry most unlucky dealings of this time
he made great sacrifices
to bring it about
he lavished money here
and diamonds there
he bought lands
at ten times their value
purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices
he gave repeated entertainments
to those friends to his claim
who being about the royal person
were likely to advance it
and i can tell you bribes were
administered and in high places too
so near the royal person of his majesty
that you would be astonished to know
what great noblemen condescended
to receive his loans
this is by ludovico cordi
a disciple of alessandro allori
it dated 605
and shows
the adoration of the magi
it beautiful
yes
i love the use of the colour blue
by the artist
yes indeed that is very beautiful
what may i ask is the price of this one
well this is one of my best pictures
but if you really like it im sure
we can come to some arrangement

peregrine cavendish
mr peregrine
barry was one of those born
clever enough at gaining a fortune
but incapable of keeping one
for the qualities and energies
which lead a man to achieve the first
are often the very cause of his ruin
in the latter case
now he was burdened with
the harassing cares and responsibilities
which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property
and his life at this period
seemed to consist of little more than drafts
of letters to lawyers and money-brokers
and endless correspondence
with decorators and cooks
gentlemen im going to leave you on your own for
a few minutes you may carry on with your work
yes sir
bully
mm-hm
what does
strenuous mean
bryan im trying to work
but what does it mean
it means an effort requiring strength
what does quadrangle mean
a quadrangle is a four-sided figure
like a square or a rectangle
now please be quiet bryan
and let me get on with my work
bryan please be quiet
have you seen my pencil
no bryan i havent
bryan please stop making so much noise
that my pencil give it
no it isnt
it is it my pencil
ive had this all morning
it my pencil
listen will you be quiet
it my pencil
ill teach you a lesson
what the devil going on in here
i told you never
to lay a hand on this child
one
two
three
four
five
six
will that be all mr redmond barry
yes that will be all
well then look you now
from this moment i will submit
to no further chastisement from you
i will kill you if you lay hands
on me ever again
is that entirely clear to you sir
get out of here
dont you think he fits my shoes
very well your ladyship
dear child
what a pity it is im not dead
for your sake
the lyndons would then have
a worthy representative
and enjoy all the benefits
of the illustrious blood
of the barrys of barryville
would they not
mr redmond barry
from the way i love this child my lord
you ought to know how
i wouldve loved his elder brother
had he proved worthy
of any mother affection
madam
i have borne as long
as mortal could endure
the ill treatment of the insolent irish
upstart whom youve taken to your bed
it is not only the lowness of his birth and the
general brutality of his manners which disgust me
but the shameful nature of his conduct
toward your ladyship
his brutal and ungentlemanlike
behaviour
his open infidelity
his shameless robberies and swindling
of my property and yours
and as i cannot personally chastise
this low-bred ruffian and as i cannot bear
to witness his treatment of you
and loathe this horrible society
as if it were the plague
i have decided to leave my home
and never return
at least during his detested life
or during my own
good day my lord
good day barker
will anyone be joining
your lordship
no i shall be alone
thank you
the roast beef very good my lord
hello neville how are you
ah barry hello
i see youre alone
why dont you come over join me
oh thank you barry
youre very kind but
im expecting someone to join me soon
what a shame lady lyndon and i
have missed your company lately
please give my respects to lady lyndon
and say ive been very busy of late
and not been able to go about much
i shall
by the way on the eighth of next month were
having some guests over for cards
wed love to have you
and lady wendover join us
ill check my diary but i think
im engaged on that evening
well i hope youre not engaged
wed love to see you again
ill write and say if im free or not
i look forward to hearing from you
it nice to see you again
if he had murdered lord bullingdon
barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment
that now followed him
in town and country
his friends fell away from him
a legend arose of his cruelty
to his stepson
now all the bills came down
on him together
all the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage
and which the creditors sent in
with a hasty unanimity
their amount was frightful
barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts
of mortgages and insurances
and all the evils attendant upon them
and lady lyndon income was hampered
almost irretrievably
to satisfy these claims
do you think that good
excellent
who this
it a peacock on the wall
what it say
i saw this bird yesterday
who that
mama in her coach
is she going to london
i dont know
parry
parry
very good
barry had his faults
but no man could say of him
that he was not a good and tender father
he loved his son with a blind partiality
he denied him nothing
it is impossible to convey
what high hopes he had for the boy
and how he indulged
in a thousand fond anticipations
as to his future success
and figure in the world
but fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him
that he should finish his life
poor lonely
and childless
papa
yes bryan
will you buy me a horse
will i buy you a horse
yes papa

want in the whole world more than a horse

oh thank you papa thank you
how much are you asking for him
one hundred guineas
he a nice little horse but i dont
think he worth a hundred guineas
seventy-five seems
more like the right price
ill accept eighty guineas
and not a shilling less
five guineas should never keep two
gentlemen from their drink eighty it will be
done sir
take the horse to doolan farm
tell him he needs a bit of breaking in
and say it for master bryan birthday
next week and i want it to be a surprise
and remember that yourself

and it was at doolan farm
where mick the groom was breaking it in

yes papa
you promise me
yes papa i promise

come in
good morning sir
good morning reverend
im sorry to trouble you
with this mr lyndon
but i believe master bryan
has disobeyed you
and stolen away to doolan farm
on going to his room this morning
i found his bed empty
one of the cooks said she saw him
cross the yard at daybreak
didnt you see him go
he must have passed through my room
while i was asleep
oh my god what has happened here
i noticed the lad riding
across the field sir
and having trouble with the horse
which was playing up a bit
suddenly the animal plunged and reared
and the poor lad was thrown
oh bryan why did you disobey me
im sorry papa
you wont whip me will you
no my darling
i wont whip you
william you take my horse and
ride like the devil for doctor broughton
tell him whatever he doing
he must come at once you understand
yes sir
the doctors were called
but what does a doctor avail in a contest
with the grim invincible enemy
such as came could only confirm
the hopelessness of the poor child case
he remained yet with his parents
for two days
and a sad comfort it was to know
he was in no pain
papa
papa
am i going to die
no my darling youre not going to die
youre going to get better
but i cant feel anything
except in my hands
does that mean im already dead
in part of my body
no my darling that where
you were hurt by the horse
but youre going to be all right now
papa if i die will i go to heaven
of course you will my darling
but youre not going to die
mama give me your hand
papa give me your hand
will you both promise me something
yes
promise me never to quarrel so
but to love each other
so that we may meet again in heaven
where bullingdon said
quarrelsome people will never go
we promise
will you tell me the story
about the fort
of course
we crept up on the fort
and i jumped over the wall first
and my fellows jumped after me
and you should have seen the look
on the frenchmen faces when
23 rampaging he-devils sword and pistol
cut and thrust pell-mell
came tumbling into the fort
in three minutes time
we left
i am the resurrection
and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me
though he were dead
yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth
and believeth in me
hall never die
i know that my redeemer liveth
and that he shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth
and though after my skin
worms destroy this body
yet in my flesh shall i see god
whom i shall see for myself
and mine eyes shall behold
and not another
we brought nothing into this world
and it is certain
we can carry nothing out
the lord gave
and the lord hath taken away
blessed is the name of the lord
barry grief was inconsolable
and such solace as he could find
came only from drink
his mother was the only person in his
misfortune who would remain faithful to him
and many a night when he was
unconscious of her attention
saw him carried off to bed
o blessed lord
the father of mercies
and god of all comforts
we beseech thee look down
in pity and compassion upon this
thy afflicted servant
thou writest bitter things against her
and makest her to possess
her former iniquities
her ladyship
always vapourish and nervous
plunged into devotion
with so much fervour that you would have
imagined her almost distracted at times
in the doleful conditions
which now prevailed at castle hackton
the entire management of the house
and of the lyndon estate
fell to mrs barry
whose spirit of order
attended to all the 0000 details
of a great establishment
come in
you wish to see me madam
yes reverend please sit down
i have some matters i would like
to discuss with you later graham
but just now perhaps you would go
to her ladyship
and have these papers signed by her
yes madam
reverend runt
i need not tell you
that the recent tragedy to this family
has made the services of a tutor
no longer required at castle hackton
and as we are in some
considerable difficulty about money
im afraid i must ask you
with the greatest reluctance
to resign your post
madam im sensible
of your predicament
and you need have no concern about my wages
with which i can willingly do without
but it is out of the question for me to consider
leaving her ladyship in her present state
im very sorry to say this to you
but i truly believe you are largely responsible
for the state of mind she is in
and the sooner you leave
the better she will be
madam with the greatest respect
i take my instructions
only from her ladyship
reverend runt
her ladyship is in no fit mind
to give instructions to anyone
my son has charged me with managing
the affairs at castle hackton
until he recovers from his grief and
resumes his interest in worldly matters
and while i am in charge
you will take your instructions from me
my only concern is for lady lyndon
madam
your only concern is
for her ladyship signature
you and your son have almost succeeded
in destroying a fine family fortune
and what little remains for you
depends on keeping her ladyship
prisoner in her own house
reverend runt
this matter bears
no further discussion
you will pack your bags
and leave by tomorrow morning
god help help
in the midst of these great perplexities
her ladyship made an attempt
to kill herself by taking poison
though she succeeded only in
making herself dangerously ill
due to the very small amount
which she swallowed
this nevertheless caused
an intervention from a certain quarter
which was long overdue
oh my god
if my mother had died
it wouldve been as much
my responsibility
as if i had poured
the strychnine for her myself
for to the everlasting disgrace
of my family name
i have by my cowardice
and my weakness
allowed the barrys
to establish a brutal
and ignorant tyranny over our lives
which has left my mother
a broken woman
and to squander and ruin
a fine family fortune
my friends profess sympathy
but behind my back
i know i am despised
and quite justifiably so
however
i know now what i must do
and what i shall do
whatever be the cost
good morning my lord
good morning
is mr barry lyndon here
yes my lord he inside
thank you
mr redmond barry
the last occasion on which we met
you wantonly caused me injury
and dishonour
in such a manner and to such an extent as
to which no gentleman can willingly suffer
without demanding satisfaction
however much time intervenes
i have now come to claim
that satisfaction
mr lyndon
these are a matched pair of pistols
and as you have seen
your second has loaded one
and i have loaded the other
but as they belong to lord bullingdon
you may have whichever one you wish
lord bullingdon
now gentlemen to determine
who will have first fire
i will toss a coin in the air
and again as the offended party it is
lord bullingdon choice to call the toss
is that agreeable to both of you
yes
if lord bullingdon calls correctly
he will have the first fire
if incorrectly mr lyndon
will have the first fire
is that clearly understood
what is your call lord bullingdon
heads
it is heads
lord bullingdon will have the first fire
lord bullingdon
will you take your ground
one two three
four five six
seven eight nine ten
mr lyndon will you take your ground
mr lyndon are you ready to receive
lord bullingdon fire
yes
lord bullingdon
cock your pistol
and prepare to fire
sir richard this pistol must be faulty
i must have another one
im sorry lord bullingdon
but you must first stand your ground
and allow mr lyndon his turn to fire
that is correct lord bullingdon
your pistol has fired
and that counts as your shot
mr lyndon are the rules of firing
clear to you
yes
lord bullingdon
are you ready to receive
mr lyndon fire
yes
very well then
mr lyndon
cock your pistol
and prepare to fire
are you ready lord bullingdon
is your pistol cocked mr lyndon
yes
then prepare to fire
one
two
lord bullingdon in view of mr lyndon
having fired into the ground
do you now consider
that you have received satisfaction
i have not received satisfaction
mr lyndon are you ready
yes
lord bullingdon
cock your pistol
and get ready to fire
one
two
barry was carried to an inn
nearby and a surgeon was called
right im nearly finished
im sorry to have to tell you this
mr lyndon
im afraid youll have to lose the leg
most likely below the knee
lose the leg
what for
the simple answer to that
is to save your life
the ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery
unless i can amputate there no way
that i can repair the artery
and prevent further haemorrhage
graham
yes my lord
as soon as we arrive at castle hackton i want
you to inform mrs barry of what has happened
dont go into any unnecessary detail
just tell her where he is
and that he has been wounded in the leg
she will naturally want to go to him
see that she is out of the house and on
her way to london as quickly as possible
and that in no event
is she to be allowed the
opportunity to see my mother
or create any disturbance at the house
before she leaves
yes my lord
ah mrs barry how do you do
how nice to see you graham
come in
thank you
you uh you received my note
yes we were expecting you
oh good good i didnt want
to call unannounced
mr lyndon how are you feeling
im feeling much better
thank you graham
wont you sit down
thank you mrs barry
would you like some tea
oh no no thank you mrs barry
not just now
how the world treating you graham
oh not too bad
and uh
are you comfortable here
most comfortable
good good
well uh
shall uh
shall we get down to the matter at hand
by all means
yes
well
mr lyndon
lord bullingdon has instructed me
to offer you an annuity
of 500 guineas a year for life
specifically on the condition of your
leaving england
and to be stopped
the instant of your return
lord bullingdon has also asked me
to point out to you
that should you decide to remain here
your stay would infallibly plunge you
into jail
as in view of the present circumstances
there will soon be
innumerable writs taken out
against you for
debts long-outstanding
and your credit is so blown that
you could not hope
to raise a shilling
utterly baffled and beaten
what was the lonely
and broken-hearted man to do
he took the annuity and returned
to ireland with his mother
to complete his recovery
sometime later he
travelled to the continent
his life there we have not the means
of following accurately
he appears to have resumed
his former profession of a gambler
without his former success
he never saw lady lyndon again
