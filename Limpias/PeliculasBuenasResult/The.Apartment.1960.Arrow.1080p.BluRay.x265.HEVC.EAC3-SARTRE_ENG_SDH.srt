of new york city was 8042783

called in the vice squad who raided him
the vice squad

that youre going with an unmarried man
then one day he keeps
looking at his watch
and asks you if any lipstick showing
then rushes out to catch
the 74 to white plains
so you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee
and you sit there
by yourself and you think
and it all begins to look so ugly

riding home on that 74 train

how selfish can you get
last week i had to use my nephew car
and take sylvia to a drive-in in jersey

i mean in a volkswagen
i sympathize with you
believe me im very sorry

how does it feel to be an executive
oh fine
ill work hard to justify your confidence
im sure you will
about the apartment now that youve got
a raise cant we afford a second key
i guess so
you know my secretary miss olsen
oh yeah is she the lucky girl that
oh no no
i just meant that she kind of a busybody
and passing that key back and forth
why take chances
you cant be too careful
oh i have something
i think belongs to you
me
i mean the young lady whoever she is
i found it when i got back last night
oh thanks
the mirror is broken
it was broken when i found it
yeah she threw it at me
sir
you know how it is
they always give you a bad time
yeah i know how it is
you see a girl every week for laughs and
they think youre gonna divorce your wife
now i ask you is that fair
no sir it very unfair
especially to your wife
yeah
you know baxter i envy you a bachelor
all the dames you want no complications

oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh
singing continues
so i said to him never again either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl
miss kubelik miss
merry christmas
thank you
i thought you were avoiding me
what gave you that idea
in six weeks youve only been in my
elevator once and you kept on your hat
as a matter of fact i was rather hurt
that night you stood me up
i dont blame you it was unforgivable
i forgive you
you shouldnt
you couldnt help it you cant
suddenly walk out on one man
because you have a date
with another man
you did the decent thing
dont be too sure
just because i wear a uniform
that doesnt make me a girl scout
a second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character
and as far as im concerned youre tops
i mean decencywise and otherwisewise
cheers
one more
i shouldnt drink while driving
youre so right by the power vested
in me i declare this elevator out of order
shall we join the natives
why not they seem friendly enough
dont you believe it
therell be human sacrifices white-collar
workers tossed into computers
and punched full of little square holes
how many drinks did you have
three
i thought so
wait i hear the sound of running water
ill be right back
ill be right here
slurring hi
how the branch manager
from kansas city
i beg your pardon
im miss olsen
mr sheldrake secretary
so you dont have to
play innocent with me
he used to tell his wife
i was the branch manager from seattle
four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding
i dont know what youre talking about
before me it was miss rossi in auditing
and after me it was
miss koch in disability
