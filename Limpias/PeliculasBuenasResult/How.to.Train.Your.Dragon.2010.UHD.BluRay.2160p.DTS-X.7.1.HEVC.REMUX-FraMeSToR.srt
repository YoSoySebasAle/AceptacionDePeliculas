
this is berk
it 2 days north of hopeless
and a few degrees south
of freezing to death
it located solidly
on the meridian of misery
my village in a word sturdy
it been here for seven generations
but every single building is new
we have fishing hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets
the only problems are the pests
you see most places
have mice or mosquitoes
we have
dragons
most people would leave not us
were vikings
we have stubbornness issues
my name is hiccup
great name i know
but it not the worst
parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls
like our charming viking
demeanor wouldnt do that
morning
what are you doing here
get inside
what are you doing out
get back inside
hiccup what is he doing out
what are you doing out get inside
that stoick the vast
chief of the tribe
they say when he was a baby
he popped a dragon head
clean off of its shoulders
do i believe it yes i do
what have we got
gronckles nadders zipplebacks
and hoark saw a monstrous nightmare
any night furies
none so far
good
hoist the torches
nice of you to join the party
i thought youd been carried off
who me no come on
im way too muscular for their taste
they wouldnt know
what to do with all this
they need toothpicks dont they
the meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is gobber
ive been his apprentice ever
since i was little well littler
we move to the lower defenses
well counterattack with the catapults
hurry
see old village
lots and lots of new houses
fire
let go
that fishlegs snotlout the twins
ruffnut and tuffnut
and
astrid
their job is so much cooler
eh
aw come on let me out please
i need to make my mark
youve made plenty of marks
all in the wrong places
please two minutes ill kill a dragon
my life will get infinitely better
i might even get a date
you cant lift a hammer
you cant swing an ax
you cant even throw one of these
okay fine but this will throw it for me
oh
see now this right here
is what im talking about
mild calibration issue
hiccup
if you ever want to get
out there to fight dragons
you need to stop all this
but you just pointed to all of me
yes that it stop being all of you
oh
oh yes
you sir are playing a dangerous game
keeping this much raw
vikingness contained
there will be consequences
ill take my chances
sword sharpen now
one day ill get out there
because killing a dragon
is everything around here
a nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed
gronckles are tough
taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend
a zippleback
exotic two heads twice the status
they found the sheep
concentrate fire over the lower bank
hurry up
fire
and then there the monstrous nightmare
only the best vikings go after those
they have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire
reload ill take care of this
but the ultimate prize is the dragon
no one ever seen we call it the
night fury
get down
jump
this thing never steals food
never shows itself and
never misses
no one has ever killed a night fury
that why im going to be the first
man the fort hiccup
they need me out there
stay put there
you know what i mean
where are you going
yeah i know
hiccup
be right back
let get him
mind yourselves
the devils still have some juice in them
come on give me something to shoot at
give me something to shoot at
oof
i hit it yes i hit it
did anybody see that
except for you
ugh
do not let them escape
right
youre all out
oh and there one more
thing you need to know
sorry dad
okay but i hit a night fury
whaa it not like the last few times
dad i really actually hit it
you guys were busy
i had a very clear shot
it went down off raven point
let get a search party
stop
just stop
every time you step outside
disaster follows
can you not see that i have
bigger problems
winter is almost here and i have
an entire village to feed
between you and me
the village could do
with a little less feeding
dont you think
this isnt a joke hiccup
why cant you follow the simplest orders
i cant stop myself
i see a dragon and i have to just kill it
it who i am dad
agh youre many things hiccup
but a dragon killer is not one of them
get back to the house
make sure he gets there
i have his mess to clean up
quite the performance
ive never seen anyone mess up that badly
that helped
thank you thank you i was trying
ow
i really did hit one
sure hiccup
he never listens
it runs in the family
when he does
it with this disappointed scowl
like someone skimped
on the meat in his sandwich
excuse me barmaid
im afraid you brought me the wrong offspring
i ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms
extra guts and glory on the side
this here this is a talking fishbone
youre thinking about this all wrong
it not so much what you look like
it what inside that he cant stand
thank you for summing that up
look the point is stop trying so hard
to be something youre not
i just want to be one of you guys
either we finish them
or theyll finish us
it the only way well be rid of them
if we find the nest and destroy it
the dragons will leave
theyll find another home
one more search before the ice sets in
those ships never come back
were vikings it an occupational hazard
now who with me
count me out
today no good for me
i have to do my ax returns
all right
those who stay will look after hiccup
to the ships
im with you stoick
that more like it
right ill pack my undies
no i need you to stay
and train some new recruits
oh perfect and while im busy
hiccup can cover the stall
molten steel razor-sharp blades
lots of time to himself
what could possibly go wrong
what am i going to do with him gobber
put him in training with the others
no im serious
so am i
hed be killed before you let
the first dragon out of its cage
you dont know that
i do actually
no you dont
no actually i do
no you dont
listen you know what he like
from the time he could crawl
he been different
he doesnt listen
he has the attention span of a sparrow
i take him fishing and he goes
hunting for for trolls
trolls exist they steal your socks
but only the left ones
what with that
when i was a boy
here we go
my father told me to bang my head
against a rock and i did it
i thought it was crazy
but i didnt question him
and you know what happened
you got a headache
that rock split in two
it taught me what a viking
could do gobber
he could crush mountains
level forests tame seas
even as a boy i knew what i was
what i had to become
hiccup is not that boy
you cant stop him stoick
you can only prepare him
i know it seems hopeless
but the truth is
you wont always be around to protect him
he going to get out there again
he probably out there now
oh the gods hate me
some people lose their knife
or their mug not me
i manage to lose an entire dragon
ow
oh wow i did it
oh i did it
this fixes everything yes
i have brought down this mighty beast
im going to kill you dragon
then ill cut out your heart
and take it to my father
i am a viking i am a viking
i did this
agh
hiccup
dad uh
i have to talk to you dad
i need to speak with you too son
i dont want to fight dragons
it time you learn to fight dragons
what
what
uh you go first
no you go first
all right
you get your wish
dragon training you start in the morning
oh man i should have gone first
cause uh
i was thinking you know
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting vikings
but do we have enough bread-making
vikings or small-home-repair vikings
youll need this
i dont want to fight dragons
come on yes you do
rephrase dad i cant kill dragons
but you will kill dragons
no im really very
extra-sure that i wont
it time hiccup
can you not hear me
this is serious son
when you carry this ax
you carry all of us with you
which means you walk like us
you talk like us
you think like us
no more of this
you just gestured to all of me
deal
this conversation feels very one-sided
deal
deal
good
train hard
ill be back
probably
and ill be here
maybe
welcome to dragon training
no turning back
i hope i get some serious burns
im hoping for some mauling
like on my shoulder or my back
yeah it only fun
if you get a scar out of it
yeah no kidding right
pain love it
oh great who let him in
let get started
the recruit who does best
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon
in front of the entire village
hiccup already killed a night fury
so does that disqualify him or
can i transfer to the class
with the cool vikings
dont worry youre small and weak
thatll make you less of a target
theyll see you as sick or insane
and go after the more
viking-like teens instead
behind these doors are just
a few of the many species
you will learn to fight
the deadly nadder
speed 8 armor 6
the hideous zippleback
plus  stealth times 2
the monstrous nightmare
firepower 5
the terrible terror
attack 8 venom 2
can you stop that
and the gronckle
jaw strength 8
whoa
wait arent you gonna teach us first
i believe in learning on the job
today is about survival
if you get blasted youre dead
quick
what the first thing youll need
a doctor
plus 5 speed
a shield
shields go
your most important piece
of equipment is your shield
if you must make a choice between
a sword or a shield take the shield
whoa
get your hands off
there are a million shields
take that one it has a flower
girls like flowers
oops now this one has blood on it
tuffnut ruffnut youre out
what
those shields are good for another thing
noise make lots of it
to throw off a dragon aim
all dragons have a limited
number of shots
how many does a gronckle have
five
no six
correct six
that one for each of you
fishlegs out
hiccup get in there
by the way i moved into my parents basement
come by sometime and work out
you look like you work out
snotlout youre done
i guess it just you and me huh
nope just you
one shot left
hiccup
and that six
go back to bed you overgrown sausage
youll get another chance
dont you worry
remember a dragon will always
always go for the kill
so why didnt you
this was stupid
why dont you just fly away
all right where did astrid
go wrong in the ring today
i mistimed my somersault dive
it was sloppy
it threw off my reverse tumble
yeah we noticed
no no you were great
that was so astrid
she right
you have to be tough on yourselves
where did hiccup go wrong
uh he showed up
he didnt get eaten
he never where he should be
thank you astrid
you need to live and breathe this stuff
the dragon manual
everything we know about
every dragon we know of
hmm
no attacks tonight study up
wait you mean read
while were still alive
why read words when you
can just kill the stuff
the words tell you stuff about
ive read it like seven times
there this water dragon
that sprays boiling water at your face
and there this other one
yeah that sounds great
there was a chance id read it
but now
you guys read ill go kill stuff
another one has spines like trees
so i guess well share
read it
ah all mine then wow
so okay ill see you
tomorrow
dragon classifications

inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools
when startled the thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound
that can kill a man at close range
extremely dangerous kill on sight

gronckle zippleback the skrill
bone knapper whispering death
burns its victims buries its victims
chokes its victims
turns its victims inside out
extremely dangerous
extremely dangerous
kill on sight kill on sight

night fury
speed unknown size unknown
the unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself
never engage this dragon
your only chance
hide and pray it does not find you
i can almost smell them
theyre close
steady
take us in
hard to port for helheim gate
hard to port
steady
hey you know i just happened to notice
the book had nothing on night furies
is there like another book or a sequel
maybe a little night fury pamphlet
whoa
focus hiccup
youre not even trying
today is all about attack
nadders are quick and light on their feet
your job is to be quicker and lighter
whoa
im really beginning to question
your teaching methods
look for its blind spot
every dragon has one
find it hide in it and strike
ugh
do you ever bathe
if you dont like it
then just get your own blind spot
how about i give you one
blind spot yes
deaf spot not so much
hey so how would one
sneak up on a night fury
no one ever met one and lived
to tell the tale now get in there
i know i know but hypothetically
hiccup
get down
watch out babe ill take care of this
the sun was in my eyes astrid
what do you want me to do
block out the sun
i could do that but
i dont have time right now
they probably take the daytime off right
like a cat
has anyone ever seen one napping
hiccup
hiccup
ooh love on the battlefield
she could do better
let me why dont you
well done astrid
is this some kind of a joke to you
our parents war is about to become ours

i could have sworn you had
teeth
uh uh i no no no
i dont have any more
ugh

mmm
hmm
mmm-hmm
hmm
ugh
hmm
and with one twist
he took my hand and swallowed it whole
i saw the look on his face
i was delicious
he must have passed the word
because it wasnt a month before
another one of them took my leg
isnt it weird to think your hand
was inside a dragon
like if your mind was still
in control of it
you couldve killed the dragon from inside
by crushing his heart or something
i swear im so angry ill avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot
ill chop off the legs of every
dragon i fight with my face
uh-uh it the wings
and the tails you really want
if it cant fly it cant get away
a downed dragon is a dead dragon
all right im off to bed
you should be too
tomorrow we get to the big boys
slowly but surely
making our way up
to the monstrous nightmare
but wholl win the honor of killing it
it gonna be me

today is about teamwork
now a wet dragon head
cant light its fire
the hideous zippleback is extra tricky
one head breathes gas
the other head lights it
your job is to know which is which
razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion
prefers ambush attack
crushing its victims
will you please stop that
if that dragon shows either of his faces
im gonna
there

yep the rest of us wouldve done it
so why didnt you
why didnt you
i dont know
i couldnt
that not an answer
why is this so important
to you all of a sudden
because i want to remember
what you say right now
for the love of i was a coward
i was weak i wouldnt kill a dragon
you said wouldnt that time
oh whatever i wouldnt
300 years and im the first viking
who wouldnt kill a dragon
first to ride one though
so
i wouldnt kill him because
he looked as frightened as i was
i looked at him and i saw myself
i bet he really frightened now

uh probably something stupid
good but youve already done that
then something crazy
that more like it
sound your positions
stay within earshot
here
one length to your stern
listen stoick i was overhearing
some of the men and well some of them
are wondering what it is were up to here
not me of course
i know youre always the man
with the plan but some
not me are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all
and what it might be
find the nest and take it
of course send them running
the old viking fallback
nice and simple
shh
step aside
bear to port

id definitely go with the gronckle
you were wise to seek help
from the world most deadly weapon

you ready
this is berk
it snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three
any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless
the people that grow here
are even more so
the only upsides are the pets
while other places have
ponies or parrots
we have
dragons
