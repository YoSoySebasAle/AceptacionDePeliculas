vi
please
hey it ok doc
it ok
there
all dry
what happened
you have to talk to me danny
you havent talked since we left
please doc
please
so
you aint talking doc
werent talking much first time
i met you neither
little boy
set to spend a long winter
at that rotten old place
just him and his mommy and daddy
daddy as dark as that boy is bright
and boy
is he bright he shining like fire
in the one place
the worst place for
someone who shines
you remember the first time
we really talked
when i spoke up inside your head
made you feel good right
knowing you werent alone
daddy tried to kill me
it wasnt all him you gotta know
that place fed his dark
like it fed on your light
and he had some light in him too
just like you got some dark
we all got both
it not done with me
it ever strike you funny
how i showed up when i did
when you needed me
someone did that for me too
my grandma taught me
and i taught you
and some day danny torrance
youll teach someone else
i wont
oh you wont
i wont shine i mean
no more it dangerous
reckon it is sometimes
she found me
shell come back and come back
until she gets me
youre right
the overlook condemned
boarded up
theyre starving old ghosts
and theyre reaching out for you
wont stop with her either
pictures in a book
you said they were just pictures in
a book and they couldnt hurt me
some things
dark things
the shining like food
theyre mosquitoes landing for blood
the overlook
it was always just pictures to me
but i didnt shine like you
nobody shines like you
so you in that damn hotel you
was like a million-watt battery
all plugged in
and it ate it up
you made it real
started soon as you
walked through the door
cant do nothing about that
im sorry to tell you
but youre not a child
youre older now
much older in a way
you gotta hear this
world a hungry place
and the darkest things are the hungriest
and theyll eat what shines
swarm it like mosquitoes or leeches
cant do nothing about that
but what you can do
is turn what they come for
against them
my grandfather
he was a mean son of a bitch
dark inside
same type of dark as your dad
beat me senseless
and my grandma too
and when he died i danced
but he kept on coming back
standing in my room
suit all gray and stinking
from whatever mold was
growing on him in that box
one day
he grabbed me
and he was real
his nails were long
from growing in the grave
and they cut me doc
cut me deep
so grandma
she taught me a trick
gave me a present
i want you to know this box
inside and out
dont just look at it
touch it
stick your nose inside
and see if there is a smell
know every corner
every single thing
why
because youre gonna build one
just like it in your mind
one even more special
so next time that bitch comes around
youll be ready
let get you back to mama
wendyll worry
and she shouldnt have to worry
another day in her life
that woman paid her debt

i see my wife
dan alcoholic
hi dan
im not much of a speech guy
i just thought id hold the chip and
talk about whatever popped up
so here i am
and im thinking about my dad
i saw a chip like this in his hand once
a couple months before he died
five month chip im pretty sure
he hurt me once
when he was drunk
broke my arm
then he dried right out
he died when i was five so
the only way i got to know him
really
got to know him was
when i went dark
when i when i drank
to to dull the
or
whenever i wanted
to break someone face
because the
drinking and the temper
and the anger
those things in me were his
and they were all i could know of him
but now
well now i get to know him
a little different because
he also stood in a room
like this once
wanting to get well
for me
and my mom
and he held the chip in his hand
and the chip said five months
and and on that day
he
before it all
well on that day
all he wanted in the world
was to stand where im standing now
and here i am so
so thank you for us both
i guess
this is for jack torrance
hey charlie
doc
guess i dont need to ask
why youre here
at this hour
do you have pain
do you want me to get claudette
to bring you a pill
pill wont matter
i heard about these
house calls
what a visit from
doctor sleep
really is
so what do you see doc
i see your twin sons
four years old

i do
farmall tractor
a striped umbrella over the seat
five years old
pulling a red wagon
lord look at that
like a deck of cards
all out of order
im not scared of hell doc
i lived a
decent
life
i dont think there is
such a place anyway
i guess im scared
there is nothing
there was nothing before
so what if there is
nothing
after
we dont end charlie
i know that for certain
i dont know much else but
i know that we dont end

raw power like that in
so long
then we need to look into it
sooner the better
yeah
case her parents freak out
send her to a psychiatrist
they get her on pills
could ruin the steam
might muffle her just
no giving paxil to this kid
it like
throwing a piece of saran wrap
over a searchlight

and shell be back

rosie
weve got a problem
talk to me
the looker

how
i dont know
i dont care
we have to have her crow

i dont know i dont
i dont think
that not the important look
i said she huge steam right
yeah it even bigger than that
i tried to turn around in her and
she blew me out of her
like i was nothing
bullshit
no
never happened to me ever
i would have said that was impossible
is she food or do we turn her
we dont turn her
rosie are you sure
if she what you say she is then
then we dont want anyone
with that power in the knot
jeez think about it
what if she neither

and we dont turn her
think of a cow
you butcher one that gives you meat for
a month
keep it alive
take care of it
it gives you milk for years
rosie weve never tried that

worktable in the garage
but they dont talk about it
or if i use it
they look at me different
or not at all
not for a whole day once
wouldnt look me in the eyes
so i try not to use it
because if people find out
eek a freak you know
sure you know
you try not to use it too
youve been trying a long time
and she couldnt look you
in your eyes either
when i was a kid
i didnt understand the shining
i called it tony
i thought he was
my imaginary friend
i thought you were
my imaginary friend
for a long time
how many of us are out there
there a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine
they dont even know it
they always seem to come home
with flowers when their wives are sad
or they do well on the school
test they didnt study for
but i only met two or three people
in my whole life
who knew they shined
the baseball boy shined
his name was bradley trevor
these people
they look like people anyway
they took him
and they ate him
they ate his shine
you could feel it
and they could feel me
i think
at least one of them did
a lady
the lady with the hat
i wanna find them
stop them
because i think theyve done
this to a lot of other kids too
so i have to do something
right
why did you come here
why me
because you can hear me
youd believe me
you shine too
and they hurt people like us
i mean what would you do
if you could get something of his
if you could go to iowa
hang on
i can help you find him
then his parents would know
where he was
they could bury him right at least
we could also get his glove
if i can touch that glove
i can track them
easy easy
because barry the chunk
i think that was his name
for a while before they killed him
he was wearing it
abra
go home
think about your school
think about your parents
think about the rest of your life
dont
dont chase these people
dont aggravate them
and whatever you do
dont attract their attention
dont shine
find something anything
well
almost anything to stop
that shine of yours
keep your head down
keep your shine down
hope to god that these people
or anything like them they
they dont see you
if they see you they come back
abra do you hear me
they come back
keep your head down
stay safe
im sorry
what is it
oh it nothing doc
it nothing
thinking about dad
no im not
you are and you dont want to
dont worry about me doc
im fine
were fine
hey azzie
you got your wires crossed tonight
no that
that room empty az
there no one in that room
hang on doc
dick
oh im so sorry
i i i thought it was
thought i was from the overlook
almost locked me up
still getting visits from them old ghosts
no not for years
horace derwent was the last one
confetti on his suit
said great party isnt it
shit-eating grin on his face
till i pulled out a box for him
that grin went fast
hey it never occurred to me
to ask you back then
what happens to them
in those boxes
do they die in there
do you care
i missed you
has it been a long time
cant tell
this world is a dream
of a dream to me now
eight years
little more
last time i saw you
you was at the bottom
you look better now
why are you here
im here because it all comes around
ka a wheel doc
you listen son
it hurts to be here
so ill only say it once
these empty devils
ever found you when you was a tyke
if theyd even sniffed you
youd be long dead
theyre on the land like
a cancer on the skin
once they rode camels
in the desert
once they drove caravans
across eastern europe
they eat screams
and drink pain
and theyve noticed that little girl
they might kill her
might turn her
or might keep her till she all used up
and thatd be worst of all
you cant let them
why me
because she found you
because she showed up
hell doc why me
you just walked on
into my kitchen one day
and im still on the hook
what the hell am i supposed to do
get her what she asked for
you wont see me again doc
this is my last dream
it seems to me
you grew up fine son
but you still owe a debt
pay it
god damn it what
hey
sorry to interrupt
i told you no distractions
didnt i
nothing to eat nothing to drink
just peace quiet and meditation
i need all my wits
for her tonight crow
that why im here
i found something
how small can an earthquake be
pretty small if the people
of richland court
a short anniston street that dead-ends
at the saco river are to be believed
late tuesday night
several residents of the street
reported a tremor
that rattled windows shook floors
and sent glassware tumbling
from the shelves
although the geological survey
center in wrentham
reports there were no temblors
in new england last tuesday
what do you think
i think maybe
im not a hundred percent but
ill take fifty-fifty
if that actually her
richland court
she did that
shook a whole street in new hampshire
having a place to actually focus
on not just a town but a street
is gonna make things a hell of
a lot easier for me tonight
good catch
how you coming at her
well shell be asleep
ill just wanna look around
see if she is
plant some suggestions
like little worms
let them burrow
a hundred worms about
her dear friends the knot
and when we roll up
shell be so happy to see us
shell just hop right in the van
if she did this
really shook a whole street

and you are the queen bitch
of all time

just saying
be careful

wakey-wakey
slow night mr torrance
not for long i imagine
youre a whiskey man are you not
i was most of the time
on the house
this was your brand
jack daniel
i used to see the bottles in our home
our real home before all this
i smelled one once
it smelled like something on fire
which
i suppose it was
im afraid youve confused me
with someone else
it lloyd
lloyd
i apologize mr torrance
i dont know where everyone is but
itll pick up
oh i know where they are
and youre right
itll pick up
if you dont mind my saying
mr torrance you seem
put upon
put upon
aint that the way
man just living his life
trying to do his work
he gets put upon
pulled into other people problems
i see it all the time
if you dont mind my saying
so we lived in florida
im sorry
mom and i
im afraid i dont know
who you mean
we never wanted to see snow again
so we lived in florida
tiny place but it was
comfortable and we were happy
i mean we were grieving
we were traumatized
but there was happiness too
she
she would look away
shed look at me but shed always
look away after a second or two
it took me a while to notice it
but after the overlook
she wouldnt look me in the eyes
not for long
couldnt figure it out
but it
it was you
she saw your eyes in me
and shed have to look away
it tortured her to have to do that
so i fixed it
i fixed it for her and it was
the last time i ever used it
so that she wouldnt see you
anymore when she looked at me
i was 20 when she died
and back then
i saw when someone was
gonna die i saw flies
black flies
death flies i called them
circling people faces
and in those last weeks
she was covered
her whole face
i could barely see her eyes
and i i tried to comfort her but
i could hardly look at her
and she saw that
she just lay there dying
with her son who couldnt look at her
maybe something warm
to push away such unpleasantries
dont you wanna hear about it
she was your wife
i think youve mistaken me
for someone else
im just a bartender
oh yeah
just lloyd the bartender
pouring joy at the overlook hotel
ill pour whatever you like mr torrance
oh dad
this drink will cost an awful lot
your money is no good here
orders from the house
itll cost more than money
itll cost me eight years
eight behind me and who knows
how many in front of me
your credit is fine mr torrance
man takes a drink
the drink takes a drink
and then the drink takes a man
aint it so dad
medicine
medicine is what it is
bona fide cure-all
depression stress remorse
failure wipes it all away
the mind is a blackboard
and this
is the eraser
a man tries
he provides
but he surrounded by mouths
that eat and scream and cry
and nag
so he asks for one thing
just one thing for him
to warm him up
to take the sting out of
those days of the mouths
eating and eating and eating
everything he makes
everything he has
and a family
a wife a kid
those mouths eat time
they eat your days on earth
they just gobble them up
it enough to make a man sick
and this
is the medicine
so tell me pup
are you gonna take your medicine
im not
look at that im sorry
clumsy old me mr torrance
forgive me
let get you cleaned up
management is concerned
concerned
it horrible what she done to you
pulled you into her mess
a smart man
hed let her handle it
let things unfold as theyre meant to
why should you pay her tab doc
and for what
for this little girl
who started all this trouble
what would management
have me do about that
nothing
easiest thing in the world to do son
just bring her inside
and then well
you accept the things
you cannot change
dan
she here
ok
this place is sick
sick like my momo was sick
it cancer
only worse
what do we do now
we head inside shell find us
well well well
hi there
when this starts run
yes you run dear
and then i will find you
and you will scream for years
until you die
well see who does the screaming
oh well see indeed

you should be afraid
why is that
because you dont know
where youre standing
im sorry who are you handsome
youre the one who killed
my crow arent you

clever
youve made some improvements
havent you
since the last time i was in your mind

youre gonna die here
brave words dear
is that what you really think
youre gonna hurt me
yes
you know
you remind me of myself
i can really see it now
youve got a darkness in you dear
i think the only difference
between you and me
is time
you dont know yet
what youd do
for more time
but i promise you dear
oh youd be surprised
pain purifies steam
fear too so
you understand
i was just like you when i was younger
i was special
and alone
but i met someone who gave me the
gift of purpose of community
and i might have given you
such a gift
if things would have gone differently
no
defiant arent you
so much like me
your mind is so
this isnt your mind is it
this isnt you at all
youre just the bait
enough
run
how the hell did we miss you
you and i should have met years ago
danny
that your name
isnt it
well something happens to the
steam when you rubes get older
it gets polluted
dirty
you know that
i see the grease all over you
you dont shine quite the same
growing up spoils that i guess
seriously handsome
where have you been hiding
i can make you an offer
an offer i rarely make
oh yeah
i cant wait
such a gifted boy
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long
you could live a long long time
live well too
indulge yourself
no consequences
no hangovers
eat well
live long
you must be lonely
being the last one
i mean the last one in the world
sweetie im not the last
far from it
im just the prettiest
