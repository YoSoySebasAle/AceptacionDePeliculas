liberia deficit in your sky rocket
tighter than a duck butt you are
now come on
let me feel the fiber of your fabric
the skinny one is tom
and he the entrepreneur of the bunch
he got a couple of dirty little fingers
in a couple of dirty little pies
nick here however

to have all 20 fat
little fingers and toes
in every dirty bent
and stolen pie in london
between the two of them there aint much
you cant get ahold of
that my 25 grand it all there

so you treat it with respect
what about the chef

cupid stupid
that the last time im getting
any more fruit off of you tom
do you call that fresh
there was more small
hairy armored things
in your fruit than there was fruit
you should open a butcher
not a grocer
well if you will order stuff
from katmandu
dont be surprised if it picks up
a few tourists en route
anyway enough about that
where the money
oi
keep your fingers out of my soup
soap is called soap because
he likes to keep his hands clean
of any unlawful behavior
he proud of his job
and even more proud that it legal
he represents the more sensible side
of the four
you sure you can afford 25
that depends on how you look at it
i can afford it as long as i see it again
if that what you mean
got the rest from the fat man and bacon
fat man bacon and myself
looks like it time to make
that call to harry
who this fat man then eh
eh
do you want a sandwich bacon
it not easy to take a seat
at this card table
the amount of money involved
has to be 00 grand upwards
and there no shortage of punters
the man who decides whether you can play
or not is this man harry
or as some including himself
like to call him hatchet harry
you got it all
00 grand
well if you got it
you got it
now if you dont mind

a monster of a man barry the baptist
the baptist got his name
by drowning people for hatchet

of the business runs harmoniously
the boy got a rare ability

all right all right
so we can say he good
oh no he better than good
he a fucking liability
here hold on
what do you think of these
were selling hundreds
very nice harry
what it for
oh dont play innocent with me bazza
spanking
there 25 from me tom
soap and yourself
that 00 grand to the pound
so why the fuck are you counting it
because i like to
so a reasonable return should be
in the region of 20 grand
that for 25 grand invested
going on previous experience
going on optimism
whatever it going on it should be enough
to send you on a cooking course
youre not funny tom
youre fat
and look as though you should be
but youre not
fat who are you calling jesus
it good in here isnt it
handy for the tube great electrics
i can see why you moved in
dont knock it
it cheap like the budgie
and nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to
a bit anti-social to say the least
what do you mean
he means theyre thieving bastards
i mean when theyre not picking peanuts
out of poop
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their hard-earned drugs
not exactly thick these walls

we will have to see both your cards
if no one loans eddie the money to continue
it a loan or we see both your cards
i will
you will what
i will loan you the money
no i think id rather
just turn them over
im not interested
in what you would rather
i wanna keep going
im also offering you the money
so we dont have to turn them over
because you can borrow
i need 250 grand
no you need 500 grand
to see me
that if i want to see you
well youre gonna have a problem
carrying on aint you
ill see you
okay before i loan you this
i expect if you lose of course
my money back within a week
crystal
that sunday okay
is that it
now let see his fucking cards
hello boy
feeling a bit poorly
i know your friends are responsible
for most of the cash
so im gonna give you
one week to find it
otherwise i will take a finger
off each of you
and your friends hands
for every day that passes
without payment
and then when you run out of digits
your dad bar
and who knows what then
all right my son
this doesnt look good
he then proceeded to explain
the unfortunate position
they were in
harry was going to start sizing up
all their fingers in a week
because he knew there was no way
ed could settle that debt on his own
harry saw it as their money on the table
so it was also their debt off the table
ed would hate admit it
but he could have kissed
the old bastard for that
if he said he wanted to settle the debt
on his own it would have been a lie
now i wish to christ he would have
let me settle the debt on my own
im gonna kill him
stop fucking about tom
and think about what were gonna do
now sit down
what all the fuss about harry
why dont we just boycott the payment
let me tell you about hatchet harry
once there was this geezer
called smithy robinson
who worked for harry
but it was rumored
that he was on the take
harry invited smithy round
for an explanation
smithy didnt do a very good job
within a minute
harry lost his rag reached out
for the nearest thing at hand
which happened to be
a 5-inch black rubber cock
he then proceeded to batter poor smithy
to death with it
now that was seen
as a pleasant way to go
hence hatchet harry is a man you pay
if you owe
dont worry ill think of something
golf the best way
to spoil a good walk
winston churchill said that
i say it a dog-eat-dog world
and ive got bigger teeth than you two
i think our friend
is trying to tell us something

look how much is it you want
im after a half weight
right well that 500 then
pass the scales willie
give us some gear j
any chance of actually seeing the money
the odds are 00-to-one
all as we need is 5 grand
id rather put my money
on a three-legged rocking horse
the odds are 00-to-one
for a good reason bacon
you wont win
where eddie
where do you think
the bottom of a bottle
and has been for two days
it hit him hard
yeah it hit us all hard
yeah but he got to tell his dad
he about to lose his bar
listen to this one
you open up a company
called arse ticklers faggots fan club
you what
you take out an advert
in the back page of some gay mag
advertising the latest
in arse-intruding dildos
you sell it with i dont know
does what no other dildo can do until now
the latest and greatest
in sexual technology
guaranteed results or your money back
all that bollocks
now these dills cost 25 quid a pop
that a snip for the amount of pleasure
theyre gonna give the recipients
but they send their checks
to the other company name
nothing offensive bobbie bits
or something for 25 quid
you take that 25 quid
you stick it in the bank until it clears
now this is the smart bit
you send back the check for 25
from the other company name
arse ticklers faggots fan club saying
were sorry and we couldnt get
the supplies from america
because theyve run out of stock
now you see how many people
cash that check
not a single soul
because who wants
their bank manager to know
they tickle arse
when theyre not paying in checks
so how long do you have to wait
till you see the return
probably no more than four weeks
a month
so what fucking good is that
if we need it in six
no five days
well it still a good idea
he may know we smoke a lot
and burn a bit of profit
but he cant have any idea
how much hard currency weve accumulated
i dont know
do you know
we can just slice it off the top
you guys gotta realize who this chap is
he might look a bit silly
but he a fucking lunatic
and if he gets the slightest inkling
were not throwing straight dice
then you and me are gonna know what the
sharp side of a kebab knife feels like
so you know these geezers well
well enough
ive been buying gear off one of them
for a couple of years
so what are they like then
poofs nothing heavy
four public schoolboys soft as shite
they ponce around in funny hippy clothes
all day talking bollocks
theyre just good at growing weed
that all
business has got bigger
than what they can keep up with
well they cant all be stupid
can they
think about it theyve got a container
load of cash in shoeboxes
theyre selling class-a gear
dont you think there might be someone
sensible involved
what about security
there one steel gate as you go in
but they never lock it
what do you mean never lock it
what have they got it there for then
i must have been there 50 times
it never locked
theyre not suspicious
everyone who goes there a toff
theyre all into that karma crap
if i dont harm nobody
nobody harms me stuff
no way they can get back to you
even if they could theyd be too shit scared
im a geezer
they got no muscle
gutless faggots
fancy one
what all the flapping about
you told the old man yet
hoping i wont need to
ive got a plan
now listen carefully
hello boys
harry
do you want a drink

bad breath colorful language
feather duster
what do you think
theyre gonna be armed with
guns you tit

in the world
now it turning
into a bad day in bosnia

and what exactly
and all we have to do
is find out who carrying them
carrying them well they could all
be carrying them for what we know
no only one of them carries them
going to the job
so i assume the same one
will be carrying them
when they come back from the job
oh you assume do you
and what do they say about assumption
being the brother of all fuck-ups
it the mother of all fuck-ups
stupid

i dont normally have anything to do
with weed nick
but if it is what he says it is
ill take it off him
for 35 grand a key
that is if it is what he says it is
i dont want to see it
after a sample
i dont want to touch it
after a sample
ill leave you in the capable hands
of nathan here
hell sort out the details
but just let me tell you one thing
if the milk turns out to be sour
i aint the kind of pussy
to drink it
do you know what i mean
rory breaker
rory yeah i know rory
he not to be underestimated
he a funny looking fucker i know
but youve got to look past the hair
and the cute cuddly thing
it all a deceptive facade
a few nights ago
rory roger iron rusted
he gone down the battle cruiser
to watch the end of a football game
no one watching the custard
so he switches the channel over
a fat geezer north opens
and he wanders up
and turns the liza over
now fuck off
and watch it somewhere else
rory knows claret is imminent
but doesnt wanna miss the end of the game
so calm as a coma
picks up a fire extinguisher
walks straight past the jam rolls
who are ready for action
and plonks it outside the entrance
he then orders an aristotle of the most
ping-pong tiddly in the nuclear sub
and switches back to his footer
that fucking it says the geezer
that fucking what says rory
and he gobs out a mouthful of booze
covering fatty
he flicks a flaming match
into his bird nest
and the geezer lit up
like a leaking gas pipe
rory unfazed turns back to his game
his team won too
four-nil
oi
is your hair supposed to look like that
all right short stuff
never mind short stuff
listen the next time
we do a job like this
were gonna want more money barry
or were going back to post offices
and cars fuck that
where the others
there was no others
stop fucking around
the others the old ones
i dont know what you mean
there were two old guns there
where are they now
not in the cabinet there wasnt
there was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets
the butler was carrying
but they were ours we sold them
well you better unsell them sharpish
we had to sell them
we needed the money
im not fucking interested
if you dont want to be counting the fingers
you havent got
i suggest you get those guns quick
jesus
if i pick them up
will they stay in one piece
whered you get them
i got contacts
listen tom you point them at me
ill shit myself or do
whatever you say to do
either way you get the desired effect
oh they look very nice i agree
but theyre lacking in criminal credibility
aint they
i might get laughed at
how much do you want for these muskets
700 each
what that
a pound for every year theyve been about
i know theyre antiques
but i aint paying antique prices
theyre a bit long aint they
sawn-offs are out
people want a bit more range these days
range
i dont want to blow the arse
out of this country granted
but i dont want anyone
blowing a raspberry at me either
i want to look fucking mean
of course youll look mean
youll look really scary
anyway enough about that
what about this geezer
who sells drugs
rory breaker standing by
you stand to make a lot of money
tubby tommy
i understand if this has come
as a bit of a shock
but let me tell you how this can be resolved
by you the good father
go on
he likes your bar
yes
he wants your bar
and
do you want me to draw you a picture
look that boy doesnt know
his arsehole from his ear hole
this is my bar
it got nothing to do with him
what and i care
remember you do have
the luxurious advantage
of being able to sustain
your son life
and you do have a reputation
so ill choose my words very carefully
you tell harry to go fuck himself
now
ill put that down to shock
only once
only once can i or shall i
let you get away with that
your son got three days
to find half a mil
but make up your mind
which you prefer
your bar or your son
plank goes in first
there a cage but it never locked
is it plank
never
it dont wanna be
all right once he got himself set
he gets the rest of us in
now we get nasty with a couple of them
shit them up gag them whatever
now these wankers shouldnt give us
any problems
but like any cowboys
therell be a few tools lying around
when the job done
we come straight back here and unload
and robert your father brother
everyone savvy
sweet
have a look at these
and what are we supposed do with these
put them on your head stupid
christ
if you think im gonna turn up there
clean-shaven and greet them
with a grin on my face
you got another thing coming
now these fellas
theyre your neighbors
i thought it might be a good idea
to disguise ourselves a little
right yeah good thinking soap
well done
i brought weapons as well
weapons
what do you mean weapons
these
jesus
let keep them covered up eh
couldnt you have got anything
a bit bigger
what like that
what do you think
i think you need help
bar steward can we have
a couple of drinks please
have you seen your dad
hatchet sent one of his men around
oh shit when
crazy
where did you get these
a fucking museum
nick the greek
how much did you part with
700 for the pair
drachmas i hope
id feel safer with a chicken drumstick
these are gonna do more harm than good
jesus tom do these work
dont know
look nice though dont they
i rather like them
that top of the list
of priorities that is
ladies
back to more important issues
if you dont mind
we have only got two real guns
apparently that what they are
so we find a good place
to hide next door
we wait till it sounds
like the right time
then we jack-in-the-box
look nasty and stuff
cocoon them in gaffer tape
nick their van swap the gear into
the new van and bring it all back here
as long as were all out
of our hiding places quickly
it the last thing theyre gonna expect
oh and if tom or anyone else for that matter
feels like giving them a bit of a kicking
im sure it wont do any harm
yeah little bit of pain
never hurt anybody
if you know what i mean
also i think knives are a good idea
big fuck-off shiny ones
ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile
knives are good because
they dont make any noise
and the less noise they make
the more likely we are to use them
shit them right up
makes it look like were serious
guns for show knives for a pro
soap is there something
we should know about you
im not sure what more worrying
the job or your past

to be a pair of loaded shotguns
and tom had to respect the fact
that they were not loaded
so without anybody losing too much face
tom left through a side door
and chris left with the money
and everybody else got arrested
he not one of them
i think your dad would like
a word with you ed
where are the others

youre lucky youre still breathing
let alone able to walk
i suggest you take full advantage of that fact
you took your time
where the hell have you been
sit down ill tell you
so the traffic warden identified
the neighbors bodies
which sort of puts us in the clear
the only thing connecting us with the case
is those shotguns
and tom took care of them
you did take care of the shotguns
didnt you tom
i wanted to talk to you about that
well talk
well actually no
ive got them sitting in the car
i was gonna sell them back
to nick the greek
but im having a bit of trouble
getting hold of him
you dippy bastard
so
the only thing connecting us with the case
is in the back of your car
which is parked outside
they cost us 700 quid
im not gonna throw them away
and theyre hardly likely to trace them
back to us are they
do you really think it worth
taking the risk for 700
tom youre a dick
now you take those guns
and you throw them off a bridge
and throw yourself off
while youre at it
