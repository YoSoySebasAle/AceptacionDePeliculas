historic
over five years ago
half of all life in the universe
including our own midtown high
was wiped from existence
then eight months ago
a band of brave heroes
brought us back
they called it the blip
those of us who blipped away
came back the same age
but our classmates that didnt blip
had grown five years older
my little brother is now older than me
yeah it math
even though we had blipped away
halfway through the school year
and had already taken midterms
the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning
it totally unfair
it not right
tigers it been a long dramatic
somewhat confusing road
as we draw this year to a close
it time to move on
to a new phase of our lives
pray nothing crazy happens again
because are the avengers even

i had just finished
my fruit cobbler right and
youre a very difficult person
to contact spider-man
youre nick fury
and you just shot ned
it a mild tranquilizer hell be all right
so good to finally meet you
i saw you at the funeral
but i didnt think that was a good time
to exchange numbers
that wouldve been inappropriate
that what i just said
right
the important thing is youre here
i tried to bring you here
you avoided me and now youre here
what a coincidence
wait was this a coincidence
i used to know everything
then i come back five years later
and now i know nothing
no intel no team
and a high school kid
is dodging my calls
here what i do know
a week ago a village in mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone
witnesses say that cyclone had a face
three days later
a similar event in morocco
a village was
just making the rounds
see if anyone needs any counseling
after today traumatic events
no well be okay were fine thank you
great because im
im not qualified to actually
oh he passed out
im not qualified to do it anyway
so good night
that was my teacher sorry about that
you were saying
a village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening
babe you still awake
youre not answering any of my texts
um he asleep betty
oh already
mm-hm yeah
okay
that why it imperative
hey boys so that canal water
today was filled with dangerous bacteria
another person touches that door
we are going to attend another funeral
suit up
let me know if you start vomiting
stark left these for you
really
uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown
stark said you wouldnt get that
because it not a star wars reference
you can lose the mask
everyone here has seen you without it
youd be feigning anonymity
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason
come on
yeah
over there we have maria hill
that is dimitri
and this is mr beck
mysterio
what
doesnt matter it just what
my friends have been calling you
well you can call me quentin
you handled yourself well out there today
i saw what you did with the tower
we could use someone like you
on my world
thanks
im sorry your world
mr beck is from earth
just not yours
there are multiple realities
this is earth dimension 66
im from earth 833
sorry youre saying there a multiverse
i thought that was theoretical
that changes how we understand
the initial singularity
were talking about
an eternal inflation system
how does that even work
with all the quantum
it insane
sorry it really cool
dont ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room
anyway
they were born in stable orbits
within black holes
creatures formed
from the primary elements
air water fire earth
the science division had
a technical name
we just called them elementals
versions of them exist
across our mythologies
turns out the myths are real
like thor
thor was a myth
now i study him in my physics class
these myths are threats
they first materialized
on my earth many years ago
we mobilized and fought them
but with each battle
they grew got stronger
i was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them
all we did was delay the inevitable
the elementals are here now
attacking the same coordinates
our satellites confirm it
thank mr beck for destroying
the other three
there only one left fire
the strongest of them all
the one that destroyed my earth
it the one that took my family
im sorry
and it will be in prague
in approximately 48 hours
we have one mission kill it
and youre coming with us
im sorry did you say prague heh

you know huge superhero kind of stuff
and im just a friendly
neighborhood spider-man sir

youre worried about us
hurting your friends
you who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus
stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
ar tactical intelligence system
and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends
it clear to me
that you were not ready for this
fury asked me to come up here

he felt bad about snapping at you

thank you
i just might take you up on that
you got gifts parker

mr fury i
id love to have you in berlin too
but you got to decide
whether youre going to step up or not
stark chose you
he made you an avenger
i need that
the world needs that
maybe stark was wrong
was he
the choice is yours
let get a drink
im not 2
hey
you gotta celebrate
we did something good tonight
yeah
fury was right
tony did a lot for me
so i owe it to him to everybody
do you
yeah i mean
mr stark gave me
the chance to be more
he wanted me to be better than him
and fury wants me to live up to that
what do you want
what do you mean
what do you want
i dont know
what do you want peter parker now
i know youre thinking about it
i wanna go on my trip
i want to go back on my trip
with my friends
and go to the top of the eiffel tower
with the girl who i really like
and tell her how i feel
and give her a kiss
oh
shut up man
youre not gonna do that are you
no i cant
why not
because i have too much
of a responsibility
my god thank you so much
what are those
are those the
edith glasses yeah
they were just on the floor try them on
let see how they look on you
yeah
yeah
i actually really like them
can i be completely honest with you
please
they look really stupid
oh
but maybe they have
a contact-lens version
you try them on
no come on
try them on
i dont wanna try them on
just put them on
what do you think kid
next tony stark i trust you
for the next tony stark i trust you
what
stark left me a message
with those glasses
for the next tony stark i trust you
im still not following
how many lemonades have you had
he knew every mistake i ever made
he mustve known i wasnt ready
for something like this
why give it to you
maybe he didnt trust me to have edith
he just trusted me to pick who should
it makes much more sense
he knew id do what right
and he not gonna give them to fury
because fury would give himself edith
youre probably right
right so the world needs
the next iron man
and it not me
im a 6-year-old kid from queens
it needs to be an adult
with some experience
and that good like tony stark like you
no peter come on no
edith
hello peter
hi yeah um
id like to transfer your control
over to quentin beck
peter what are you doing
doing the right thing
any transfer will require confirmation
stark gave you the glasses
stark gave me a choice it my choice
to make okay and im gonna make it
youre a soldier a leader
you stopped the elementals
you saved my life
you saved the world okay
hed want you to have them
waiting for confirmation
confirm
welcome to the avengers
they look good on you
thank you
it an honor
yeah
mr stark wouldve really liked you
where you headed
im gonna go find mj
good luck kid
ill give you a fifty-fifty chance
youre pretty awkward
yeah
see you later man
see you
see that wasnt so hard
yes
somebody get
this stupid costume off me
okay we got edith
get these connected to our system
toast toast toast
no this is a big win
but we still got a lot of work to do
toast toast toast
yeah
okay toasts
give me that doug
to the man who brought us all together
our former boss tony stark
boo
the jester king
literally wrapped
in wealth and technology
that he was unfit to wield
like the holographic system i designed
a revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications
that tony turned
into a self-therapy machine
and renamed
binarily augmented retro-framing
or barf
oh $6 million
for my little therapeutic experiment
he renamed my life work barf
i told him it was a mistake
that my technology could change
the world
and then
he fired me
said i was
unstable
to tony
to tony
next to william
william
tony stark was able
to build this in a cave
with a box of scraps
the integration of my illusion tech
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant
powerful illusions real damage
worked like a charm
and it just the beginning
thank you brother
to guterman
guterman
to guterman
the story you created of a soldier
from another earth named quentin
fighting space monsters
in europe is totally ridiculous
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now
i mean everybody bought it
gutes
guterman
to victoria
to victoria
staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site
so fury own satellites
would confirm our lies
inspired idea
to janice
janice
after tony died she was the one
who discovered that edith
was being handed over not to us
not to the defense department
but to a child
thank you
to janice
and to the rest of you
tony stark is gone
there is a window of opportunity
and someone will step up
but these days you can be
the smartest guy in the room
the most qualified and no one cares
unless youre flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands
no one will even listen
well ive got a cape and lasers
with our technology and with edith
mysterio will be
the greatest hero on earth
yeah
then everyone will listen
not to a boozy man-child
no
not to a hormonal teenager
no
to me
and to my very wealthy crew
to us
to us
to mysterio
to mysterio
to peter parker
to peter parker

and they would drown in the water
sorry

there this thing ive been wanting
to talk to you about
for a while
yeah
it our last night in europe
and i had this plan
that i wanted to tell you
im just gonna tell you
mj i
im spider-man
what
that what you were gonna say
that youre spider-man
no im not spider-man
ive been watching you for a while now
it kind of obvious
im not spider-man
what would make you think
that i was spider-man
peter washington
yeah
the fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason
no i was sick remember
i had my the tummy
susan yang thinks youre a male escort
what of course im not a male escort
then youre spider-man
im not spider-man at all
what about tonight you snuck off
and you fought that thing i saw you
you cant have seen me
because im not spider-man
also on the news
it was the night monkey
the night monkey
yeah
that what it said on the news
and the news never lies
night monkey okay
what are you doing
well do the night monkey
and spider-man use the same webs
i mean maybe
maybe he a spider monkey
who knows
were you only watching me
because you thought i was spider-man
yeah
why else would i be watching you
doesnt matter just thought that maybe
what the hell was that
i dont know
what is it some kind of projector
or something
yeah but it really advanced
it it looked so real
it
yeah really real
wait does that mean that
the elementals are fake
that doesnt make any sense
because we were there right
there was fire and destruction and
who would do something like that
mysterio
i am spider-man
and ive really messed up
wait youre being serious
mm-hm
youre 00 percent serious
because it not funny
no im not joking
because i was
i was only like 67 percent sure
mj
so why are you here
why are you on this school trip
i know you have a lot of questions
but we have to get out of here okay
okay okay i cant believe i figured it out
you took everything from me
this is for my family
pause
pause
oop
sorry
yeah can you just fast-forward
to the end
yep stand by
all right fly fly fly zap zap zap
pause im not in love
with this choreography but itll do
kill image
de-cloak drones
all right weapons
you want to weaponize
yep
weapons only stand by
nice
stop
something i dont know what it is
it something
just dou you know what
double the damage and then run it again
you want me to double it up
yeah
all right
cover your ears
whoo that is good that good
we on schedule
oh yeah
uploading software hack
to edith network
with her drones well create an event
big enough to cover an entire city
all right well done
make sure every drone is weapons-hot
we need maximum damage
that is gonna cause a lot of casualties
oh yeah
more casualties more coverage
i gotta cut through the static
london is a beautiful city
and it will suffer but they can rebuild
if im the next iron man
i need to save the world
from an avengers-level threat
but when its new savior descends
all those casualties will be forgotten
janice youll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap
of course do you wanna try
no no that
what going on with my hand
why is that happening
oh one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector
it fine
wait and youre
youre telling me this now
it it one drone
the image will be perfect i promise
that projector is evidence
it going to tell people what were doing
and how were doing it
i am trying to fool 7 billion people here
including nick fury
who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet
if he catches on before ive killed him
he will put a bullet in my head
and nobody wants a bullet
in their head right
right
william can you look at me
pull up edith
hello quentin
hi honey i need a level-five search
full-resource protocol for this device
magnifying
there search everything going in
and out of that building
located
shit
you know william one day
after ive had to kill peter parker
because of this
i hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands
i cant believe i gave beck those glasses
how could i be that stupid
he probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me
you had access to killer drones
yeah i didnt really want them
especially after i almost killed brad
you almost killed brad
look i have to call mr fury
and tell him that beck a fraud
but i think he tapped my phone
so what are you gonna do
i need my suit and i have to go to berlin
and talk to mr fury in person
just ahem
oh ned perfect
the costume looks great
for the costume party
at the prince castle
she knows i told her
he didnt tell me i figured it out
oh
that cool
like a long time ago
oh
look mysterio is a fraud
but he saved me and betty lives
he been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech
yeah he using these like
hologram projectors
whoa that crazy
yeah
so you guys were working
the case together or what
it been mostly me
ned i need you to call may
get her to call mr harrington
say she wanted me to stay
with family in berlin okay

no no no listen
wait until were secure
okay
ahem
right
so is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend
he talking about edith
i know i made a mistake and im sorry
but he is not who you think he is
beck is a liar
mysterio the elementals it all fake
he has some sort of illusion tech
that how he tricked you
and tricked me into giving him edith
it a projector i pulled it off
the fire monster in prague
so all that death
and destruction we witnessed
was created by this
no not just this
i think he using drones
well if this is true then beck
very dangerous and we need to be smart
who else did you tell about this
parker parker
what wrong
it beck he here
what hill
no it just an illu
fury

i created mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in
i control the truth
mysterio is the truth
if you were good enough
maybe tony would still be alive
deep down you know im right
you made your choice
and all you had to do was step aside
and now you have
fury

because i saw him in the back room
of a rest stop with some woman
in his underwear
and he always sneaking away
like back at the opera huh
now he suddenly off the trip
with his family in berlin

see you later
this is breaking news
we come to you with revelations
about last week attack in london
an anonymous source provided
this video
it shows quentin beck aka mysterio
moments before his death
a warning you may find
this video disturbing
i managed to send the elemental
through the rift
but i dont think im gonna make it
spider-man attacked me
for some reason
he has an army of weaponized drones
stark technology
he saying he the only one who
gonna be the new iron man no one else
are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack
there will be significant casualties
do it execute them all
this shocking video was released
earlier today
on the controversial news website
thedailybuglenet
there you have it folks
conclusive proof that spider-man
was responsible
for the murder of mysterio
an interdimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet
and who will no doubt go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time
but that not all folks
here the real blockbuster
brace yourselves
spider-man real
spider-man real name is
spider-man name is peter parker
what the fu
stop your messin around
better think of your future
you gotta tell him
it was fine
the little boy handled it
we helped
talos
come off it
how was i supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake
i mean that was all very convincing
the performances the illusion
that costume the craftsmanship in that
this is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter fine
hey there
i hope your mission is going well
we gave the glasses to parker
about a week ago like you said
and uh it was very touching you know
really really quite touching
talos
um
and uh you know shortly after that
it really kind of went off the rails
and so we need you to come back
because everyone kept asking
where the avengers are
i dont know what to say to that
so youre lucky that spider-man won
everybody back to work
who got my shoes
