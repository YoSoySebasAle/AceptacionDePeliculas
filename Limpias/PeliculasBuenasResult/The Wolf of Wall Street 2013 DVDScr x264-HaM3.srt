well how the fuck else would you
do these job
cocaine and hookers my friends
right
i got to say im incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm i mean
your the clients you have were absolutly
talked the clients
your only responsibility is
to put meat on the table
you got a girlfriend
im new married i have a wife
his name theresa she cut hair
congratulation
thank you
think about theresa
named a game move the money from your
clients pocket
into your pocket
right but if you can make the clients
money at the same time isnt that
advantageous everyone correct
no okay number one rule of wall street
nobody okay if you warren buffet or jimmy
buffet nobody knows
if a stock going up down
orsideways fucking in circle
at least of all stock brokers right
it all in furgazy
you know what furgazy is
yeah furgazy
it a fake
yeah furgazy it
fegazy it a wuzzy it
fairy dust it doesnt exist
it never landed that is no matter
it not on the elemental charge
it not fucking real alright
alright
stay with me
we dont create shit
we dont build anything
no
so if you got a client
who brought a stock at 8
and now it at 6
he is all fucking happy he is
want to cash it and liquidate
take his fucking money and run home
you dont let them do that
okay
because that would make it real
right
now what do you do
you got another brainer idea
the special idea
another situation another stock
to reinvested his earning in this stock
and he will every single time
as theyre fucking addicted
and you just keep doing this
again and again and again
meanwhile he think
he is getting shit rich
which he is on papper
but you and me the brokers
we taking the whole hot cash
the via commision motherfucker
right

i cant tell you how excited i am
you should be
there is two keys to success
in broker business

i do it because i fucking need to
think about you doing with numbers
all day long

jordan belfort
pushing dicey stock
sounding like a kind of twisted
robin hood who takes from the rich
and gives to himself and his merry little
band of brokers read that read it
listen there is no such thing
as bad publicity sweet heart
big article babe
jordan you look great
youre in a huge magazine
the fucking deal i will
mr belfort just give me a chance
mr belfort excuse me excuse me sir
crowd
shut the fuck up
what all this
it the forbes article they
all want to work for you now
hey what did i say
hey you want a job you talk to me
mr belfort
forbes make me a superstar
everyday dozens of money craze
kids be the path to my door
if we hired them they drop
straight outta college overnight
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our stratton taylor
are you fucking serious right now
i mean we were literally putting
clothes on these kids backs
and here comes thisjerk off snffing around
but you know everytime
someone rises up in this world
there always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down
within months we doubled in size
and move into even bigger offices
it was a mad house
a greed fest with equal parts
cocaine testoterone and body fluids
yeah
it got so bad i had to declare the office a
fuck free zone between the hours of 9 and 7
but im counting even that didnt enough
actually the madness started
on our very first day
when one of our brokers ben
jenner christens the elevator
by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant
her name was pam and her credit
she did have this amazing technique
with this wild twist and jerk motion
by the month later donnie
and i decided to double team
on a saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for christmas dresses
eventually ben marriage
that which was pretty amazing
considering she blew every
single guy in the office
he aint got the present and
killed himself 3 years later
anyway i hired my dad max to
maintain order as the enforcer
stratton very own gestapo
we called him mad max  because
of his hair trigger temper
which could be set off by something as
obnoxious as a ringing telephone
who the fuck has the goddamn ball to
call this house on a tuesday night
goddamn it
youre gonna missed it
oh please tell me something i dont know
i wait all wek for the fucking equalizer
and i have to fucking hello
but as soon as he picked up the phone
jean how are you jean
he defect his weird british accent
why yeah jean that would be great cherio
it was absolutely bizarre
fucking half wit
and hang up and then he mad max all over again
you missed it
damn
what tell me what happened what happened
well he discovered it was the mother sister
who he who
tell me who he is
the main guy
you know who the main guy
the main guy
it was his mother sister she showed up dead
of course mad max didnt have to know
everything we were doing at stratton
then there a big target and we
they get lunge at the target they stick
there a bulls eye and the
bulls eye a dollar sign
whoever gets close to the dollar
sign gets the most points
i so full of this shit of
this little fucking thing
yeah you have to hear yourself talk
so if he gets hurt what happens
yeah were gonna a get fucking knock
i dont think he gonna get hurt theyre like
they got like super human strenght
i think he gonna be fine
you cant look him right in the eyes
you cant look him at in the eye
that a fact i saw it on pbs
they get confuse their they wires get cross
you gotta look like the chin like it looks like
im looking at you but im looking at your chin
i feel like you addressing me
right now but youre not are you
theyre like the monalisa they find eye
contact like wherever you standing in the room
the minute they lock in you know
no but there is a limit to
what we could do with them
i mean were allowed to throw shit at em
we allowed to throw food bananas
i know crack button
but for example what i wouldnt do
is maybe like tell the police cock out
and like to get some of the girls
to you know fun or shit like that
that would be that unacceptable
i mean we can let keep that in our pocket
but this guy is more about
thrown thrown at the dartboard
correct yes yes
the thing is this is their gift okay
theyre built to be thrown like a long dart
theyre top heavy like a long
dart so theyre built for accuracy
oh my god this is
can we bowl with this guy
that his fucking brother robbie
he brothers the bowling ball
the brother you put a skateboard on
strapped him onto a skateboard
you toss him down on alley at some pins
no shit that intersesting
can we get that guy
we can get well get that guy too
but it says here this guy will show his cock
yeah instead of going up yeah
they are very armory by the way so you
gotta be very careful with these little guys
safety first safety is first alright
i want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer
gun ready to knock this fucker out
do we want to get like a
mace tasers gun
a pellet gun manybe just like the
no pellet gun is gonna hurt him
i just want him out knocked out cold
i say we stick with the loophole right okay
we dont considered him a human
we just considered it an act
i think were in the clear like a flying
you know a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody
the important thing you
guys gotta keep in mind is
is that these things gossip
they get together and they gossip
it a good point
and the last thing that we need is
them getting together and then saying oh
listen they made fun of us like
like it gonna make stratton look bad
that why i love you
you think of shit like that
that is a come in
we treat itjust like one of us okay
one of us were gonna treat them like one of us
we accept that one of us were
gonna treat them like one of us
we accept that one of us were
gonna treat them like one of us

wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip
which of course i always did
then came the nasdaq who are pretty not great
they cost between $200 and $300 bucks
finally there were the pink sheets skanks
they cost about $00 or less
and if you didnt wear a condom you have
to get a pennicilin shot the next day

wait wait wait
looks like those ludes are working
their magic on donnie right now
the quaalude or lude as it commonly referred to
was first synthetize in 95 by an
indian doctor that not feathers
as a sedative and was prescribed to
stressed out house wife with sleep disorders
but pretty soon someone figured out that if you
resist the urges to sleep forjust 5 minutes
you got a prety kick ass high from it
didnt take long for people to
start abusing ludes of course
and in 982 the us government scheduled
one of them along with the rest of the world
which meant there only a
finite amount of this things left
no shit you cant even buy them
anymore you people all shit out of luck

is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in switzerland
but there are very few swiss laws
which applied to your practises
from a financial standpoint
you are now in heaven
see i told you he was fantastic right
if the us justice department
sent us as subpoena
it will become a
um papier-toillette
we will wipe our ass with it
laughing
unless of course it was an
investigation into stock fraud
which is a crime here in
switzerland if im correct
then there would have to be co-operation
on your part if im not mistaken
yes yes we would
assuming the account is under your name
if it were another name
of friends i get my
cousin

relative

wants for me is to a coorperate
you know turns out i have so much information
about the stock market and the wallstreet
that i could save the government years of
heartache not to mention countless dollars
it gets even better babe
because if i do to sign cooperate i might
only be looking at 4 short years
how much case we could start
fresh maybe sell the house
and any fine that i have to pay
wouldnt due till i serve term
so we still have plenty
money left over you know
you think of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it
