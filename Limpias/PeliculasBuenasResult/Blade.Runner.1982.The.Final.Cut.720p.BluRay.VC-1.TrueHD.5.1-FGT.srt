ive got four skin-jobs
walking the streets
they jumped a shuttle off-world
killed the crew and passengers
they found the shuttle drifting off the coast
two weeks ago so we know theyre around
embarrassing
no sir not embarrassing
because no one ever gonna
find out theyre down here
because youre gonna spot them
and you gonna air them out
i dont work here anymore
give it to holden

i did
he can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him
he not good enough
not good as you
i need you deck
now this is a bad one the worst yet
i need the old blade runner
i need your magic
i was quit when i come in here bryant
im twice as quit now
stop right where you are
you know the score pal
if youre not cop youre little people
no choice
no choice pal
i already had an iq test this year
i dont think ive ever had one of these
reaction time is a factor
so please pay attention
answer as quickly as you can
yeah sure
87 at hunterwasser
yeah that the hotel
what
where i live
nice place
yeah sure i guess
there was an escape from
the off-world colonies two weeks ago
six replicants
three male three female
they slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle
an aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast
no crew no sight of them
three nights ago they tried to break
into tyrell corporation
two of them got fried running
through an electrical field
we lost the others
on the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees
i had holden go over and run
voight-kampff tests on the new workers
looks like he got himself one
so you look down and
you see a tortoise
it crawling towards you
tortoise what that
that leon
ammunition loader on intergalactic runs
he can lift 400-pound atomic loads
all day and night
the only way you can hurt him
is to kill him
i dont get it what do they
risk coming back to earth for
that unusual why
what do they want
out of the tyrell corporation
well you tell me pal
that what youre here for
what this
nexus 6 roy batty
incept date 206
combat model
optimum self-sufficiency
probably the leader
this is zhora
she trained for
an off-world kick murder squad
talk about beauty and the beast
she both
the fourth skin-job is pris
a basic pleasure model
the standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies
they were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions
the designers reckoned after a few years they
might develop their own emotional responses
oh hate love fear anger envy
so they built in a fail-safe device
which is what
four-year lifespan
now there a nexus 6
over at the tyrell corporation
i want you to go put the machine on it
and if the machine doesnt work
do you like our owl
it artificial
of course it is
must be expensive
very
im rachael
deckard
it seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public
replicants are like any other machine
theyre either a benefit or a hazard
if theyre a benefit it not my problem
may i ask you a personal question
sure
have you ever retired a human
by mistake
no
but in your position that is a risk
is this to be an empathy test
capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response
fluctuation of the pupil
involuntary dilation of the iris
we call it voight-kampff for short
mr deckard dr eldon tyrell
demonstrate it
i wanna see it work
where the subject
i wanna see it work on a person
i wanna see a negative before
i provide you with a positive
what that gonna prove
indulge me
on you
try her
it too bright in here
do you mind if i smoke
it wont affect the test
all right im gonna ask you
a series of questions
just relax and answer them
as simply as you can
it your birthday
someone gives you a calfskin wallet
i wouldnt accept it
also id report the person
who gave it to me to the police
youve got a little boy
he shows you his butterfly collection
plus the killing jar
id take him to the doctor
youre watching television
suddenly you realize there a wasp
crawling on your arm
id kill it
youre reading a magazine
you come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl
is this testing whether im a replicant
or a lesbian mr deckard
just answer the questions please
you show it to your husband
he likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall
bush outside your window
i wouldnt let him
orange body green legs
why not
i should be enough for him
one more question
youre watching a stage play
a banquet is in progress
the guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters
the entrée consists of boiled dog
would you step out
for a few moments rachael
thank you
she a replicant isnt she
im impressed
how many questions
does it usually take to spot one
i dont get it tyrell
how many questions
twenty thirty cross-referenced
it took more than a hundred for rachael
didnt it
she doesnt know
she beginning to suspect i think
suspect
how can it not know what it is
commerce is our goal here at tyrell
more human than human is our motto
rachael is an experiment nothing more
we began to recognize in them
a strange obsession after all they are
emotionally inexperienced with only
a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and i take for granted
if we gift them with a past
we create a cushion or a pillow for their emotions
then consequently we can control them better
memories
youre talking about memories
reaction time is a factor in this
so please pay attention
now answer as quickly as you can
sure
87 at huntervvasser
yeah that the hotel
what
where i live
nice place
yeah sure i guess
is that part of the test

bishop to king 7
checkmate i think
got a brainstorm sebastian
milk and cookies kept you awake
let discuss this
you better come up sebastian
mr tyrell
i
i brought a friend
im surprised you didnt come here sooner
it not an easy thing to meet your maker
and what can he do for you
can the maker repair what he makes
would you like to be modified
stay here
had in mind something
a little more radical
what
what seems to be the problem
death
death
well im afraid that
a little out of my jurisdiction you
i want more life
father
the facts of life
to make an alteration in the
evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal
a coding sequence cannot be revised
once it been established
why not
because by the second day of
incubation any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations
give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship
then the ship sinks
what about ems recombination
weve already tried it
ethyl methane sulfonate is
an alkylating agent and a
potent mutagen it created a
virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table
then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells
wouldnt obstruct replication but it
does give rise to an error in replication
so that the
newly formed dna strand carries a mutation
and youve got a virus again
but this all of this is
academic
you were made
as well as we could make you
but not to last
the light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long
and you have burned
so very very brightly roy
look at you
youre the prodigal son
youre quite a prize
ive done
questionable things
also extraordinary things
revel in your time
nothing the god of biomechanios
wouldnt let you in heaven for
sorry sebastian
