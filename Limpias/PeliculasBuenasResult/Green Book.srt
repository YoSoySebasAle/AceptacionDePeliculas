people with your
innate ability to handle trouble

inquired about your availability

problem being on
the road with you

hey doc

so any way we could maybe hit
the road early next morning
so wed be home in time
for christmas eve
well see
appreciate it
could you put out the
cigarette please
why
i cant breathe back here
what are you talking about
smoke going in my lungs
im doing all the work here
thank you
what are you looking at
you speak german huh
that was russian
yeah i was stationed
in germany in the army
i could pick up a little bit
of what you were saying there
watch out for them krauts
theyre all snakes
kennedy shouldve bombed
them when he had the chance
plus now them cuban bastards
aint they supposed
to be following us
they have the itinerary
as long as they get
to the show on time
im not worried about it
and neither should you
i aint worried about nothing
in fact when you see me
worried youll know
tony
youll know if im worried
how about some quiet time
sure
it amazing you said that
how about some quiet time
dolores my wife used to
say that all the time
well not all the
time but you know
she says it when i come
home from work sometimes
you know she been
with the kids all day
and shell say tony how
about some quiet time
exactly like how you said
it i mean it amazing
how is that
salty
have you ever considered
becoming a food critic
no not really
why is there money in that
im just saying you
have a marvellous
way with words when
describing food
salty
so vivid one can almost taste it
hey im just saying it
salty and salt cheating
any cook can make things salty
to make it taste good
without the salt
with just the other
flavours that the trick
i mean you take the
basic ingredients
we should get going
soon if we expect
to get to pittsburgh by dinner
hey when i was in the army i
knew a guy from pittsburgh
except he called it titsburgh
because he said all the
women there had huge tits
that absurd
why would women in pittsburgh
have larger breasts
than say women in new york
guess well find out huh
hey you know when
you first hired me
my wife went out and bought
one of your records
the one about the orphans
orphans
yeah cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire
orpheus
yeah
orpheus in the underworld
it based on a french opera
and those werent
children on the cover
those were demons in
the bowels of hell
no shit must have
been naughty kids
what are what are you doing
gotta take a leak doc
here now
you want me to piss my pants
oh hey doc
good afternoon
take this for any
incidentals we may need
if you want to buy something
you dont have to ask
just keep the receipts please
when it runs low let me know
oh thanks
one more thing
well be attending many events
before and after the concerts
interacting with some
of the wealthiest
and most highly educated
people in the country
it is my feeling
that your diction
however charming it may
be in the tri-state area
could use some finessing
you mean diction
like in what way
like in the only way
the word is ever used
okay
your intonation inflection
your choice of words
hey i got my own problems
now i got to worry about what
people think about the way i talk
there are simple techniques i can
teach you that are
quite effective
i can help you
i dont need no goddamn help
people dont like the way i
talk they can go take a shit
the profanity is another issue
fanabola why are you
breaking my balls
because you can do
better mr vallelonga
which brings me to one more point
as the guest of honour
ill be introduced
when entering these
intimate events
you will be introduced as well
in my humble opinion vallelonga
may be difficult to pronounce
so i was thinking
valle would be more appropriate
tony valle short and sweet
nah
they got a problem
with vallelonga
they can call me tony lip
these are genteel people
tony the lip may be a little
worldly for them
well then it tony vallelonga
all these high-class people
so much smarter than me
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities
youre telling me they
cant pronounce my name
they dont like it they
can shove it up their ass
ill just wait outside
a sound compromise
ladies and gentlemen
tonight we are privileged
to present a great
american artist
he gave his first public
performance at the age of three
at age 8 at arthur
fiedler invitation
our guest made his concert
debut with the boston pops

in psychology in
music and in the liturgical arts

the piano tonight
he dont play like a coloured guy
he plays like
liberace but better
he like a genius i think
when i look at him in

about stuff in his head

but it dont look fun
to be that smart
i miss you very very much

fairly complicated

so where did this tony the
lip moniker come from
it not tony the lip
it tony lip one word
i got it when i was a kid
because my friend said i was the
best bullshit artist in the bronx

that your friends
the people closest to
you consider you a liar
who said liar i said
bullshit artist

because i dont lie ever
im just good at talking
people into you know

i never knew how very
beautiful this country was
now that im seeing it i know

as they say

it a long story tony
what were in a hurry now
let hear it
i have a brother somewhere
we used to get together
once in a while
but it got more and more
difficult to stay in touch
curse of being a
musician i guess
always on the road
like a carnival worker
or a criminal
took quite the toll on
my marriage as well
youre married
was
june
good person terrible
grammar but a kind soul
youd quite like her
june like like lassie mum
unfortunately i
couldnt do a husband
act and a concert pianist act
couldnt seem to
manage both worlds
kentucky fried chicken

that ever gonna happen

chicken in my life

assessment of me tony

because other negroes
enjoy certain types of music
it doesnt mean i have to
nor do we all eat the
same kind of food
whoa wait a minute

and spaghetti and meatballs

for you to make the assumption
that every negro
hey you want some or not

silly don it looks
a lot worse from the outside
and i suppose youd
know from experience
well ive never had
any complaints

it gonna be at least
20 minutes i got
to go all the way

im just going downstairs
to have a drink
tony
i think youre doing
a wonderful job
so
id like to formally offer you
the position of my road manager
with the title also comes
more responsibility but
that also means a raise in pay
no no
no thanks
we agreed on 25 a
week plus expenses
that our deal right
i aint going nowhere doc
i was just going
down to tell them
tony
im sorry about last night
dont worry about it
ive been working nightclubs in
new york city my whole life
i know it a
complicated world
so whered you learn
how to play like that
my mother
your mother really
she taught me how to
play on an old spinet
soon as i could walk wed travel
around the florida panhandle
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls
fortunately a man
who had seen me play
arranged for me to study at the
leningrad conservatory of music
i was the first negro
ever accepted there
that where they taught you
all them songs you play
actually i was trained
to play classical music
brahms franz liszt
beethoven chopin
it all i ever wanted to play
but i was persuaded
by my record company
to pursue a career in
popular music instead
they insisted that audiences would
never accept a negro pianist
on a classical stage
wanted to turn me into just
another coloured entertainer
you know the guy who
smoking while he playing
and sets a glass of
whiskey on his piano
and then complains
because he not
respected like arthur rubinstein
you dont see arthur
rubinstein putting
a glass of whiskey on his piano
i dont know personally i think
if you stuck to the classic stuff
it wouldve been a big mistake
a mistake performing the music i
trained my entire life to play
trained what are you a seal
people love what you do
anyone could sound like
beethoven or joe pan
or them other guys you said
but your music what you do
only you can do that
thank you tony
but not everyone can play chopin
not like i can
the trees have shed
their leafy clothing
and their colours have
faded to greys and browns
i saw millions of trees
all dusted with snow
just like out of a fairy tale
he so expressive
got to admit lip
letters theyre not bad
oh well it in the family
they say our
great-great-great-grandfather
helped da vinci with
the sixteen chapel
you mean michelangelo

to do with writing letters

an arty family

minutes and seconds
until you are in my arms

that what else he got to do
now he thinks im some kind of

ive had to endure that kind
of talk my entire life
you should be able to take
it for at least one night
what i cant get
mad at that stuff
he was saying because
i aint black
christ im blacker than you are
excuse me
you dont know shit about
your own people
what they eat how they
talk how they live
you dont even know who
little richard is
oh so knowing who little richard
is makes you blacker than me
oh tony i wish you could
hear yourself sometimes
you wouldnt talk so damn much
bullshit i know exactly who i am
im the guy who lived in the same
neighbourhood in the
bronx my entire life
with my mother my father my
brother and now my wife and kids
that it that who i am
im the asshole who has to
hustle every goddamn day
to put food on the table
you mr big shot you
live on top of a castle
travelling around the world
doing concerts for rich people
i live on the streets
you sit on a throne

more blacker than yours

what are you doing
doc
doc what the hell are you doing
doc get back in the car
yes i live in a
castle tony alone
and rich white people pay
me to play piano for them
because it makes
them feel cultured
but as soon as i
step off that stage
i go right back to being
just another nigger to them
because that is
their true culture
and i suffer that
slight alone because
im not accepted by my own people
because im not like them either

and if im not white enough
and if im not man enough
