the turista cities
i chose the city
is your family still there
theyre all gone
like dust
my two brothers
died of cholera
my father died of hard work
and my mother died
of broken dreams

the hotels in puerto vallarta

that where i met her
sad beginnings happy endings

why do you want to go there for
i want to pay respects
to my parents
visit their graves

out of escanaba
head west towards the sea

an inch on the map

i’m trying
to save you some time

you spend too much time
with your typewriter danny
in the real world some people
arent just fake dangerous
theyre real dangerous
oh yeah right
this from the guy
who has no tourist card
remember
hey you know what
around here the judiciales
the federal police
are a lot more dangerous
than a couple of biker trash
thank you luz
stop
what
stop
what is it
it an ocelot
what it doing in the cage
oh it to sell to a zoo
or some rich tourist needs
to keep her neck warm
i dont know
ask him how much
he wants for it
we cant put that thing
in my car
yeah i know
what are you asking
the price for
to let it go
he says $3000
he says they are very rare
i dont have that much left
look at it
he should kill the damn thing
or let it go
ask him how hed like to live
trapped in a little cage
he says he does
he used his real name
he either a hostage
or the dumbest accomplice
in the world
he says they paid in cash
for two rooms
if they used
two separate rooms
then it probably not
a hostage situation right sir
right
now stop talking before you ruin
west point reputation
show me
he said the man and the woman
stayed in this room
and the suspect in the other
what are we hoping to find
sir may i ask
nothing
he too smart
to leave anything behind
i just wanted to stand
in his space for a moment
breathe the air he breathed
maybe sniff out a clue
in the ether
you believe in metaphysics
weatherford
no sir
not really
me neither
he says the suspect went for--
stop with the dick tracy
his name is price
price
took a swim in the pool

there a dragnet
over half of mexico
and he having
a fucking pool party
we have the make and the model
of the car señor
it’s just a matter of time
but how much rivera
it not just that im getting
older in this steam bath
or that price might
whack a few dozen people
before we find him--
it also embarrassing
i mean where are
all the bright lights
of the mexican police
and military
while he taking his road trip
aren’t you just
a little embarrassed
we haven’t found him yet
señor it true
but you created him
who should be more embarrassed
she said she wants to be alone
yeah i’ve said that too
i shouldve come back
to see her more
before she died
i lost so many minutes with her
i know
you wish you could go back
listen a little harder
look a little more closely
at their eyes
and speak a few more kind words
many more
if--if you could have
what would you have said to her
i wouldve
thanked her
for fighting
to give me more than she had
she argued with my father
to get me to school
and he beat her for her pride
she let him beat her
but she won
gracias mama
and look at you--

under his vest and--
you werent sure
you agreed to drive him

i could handle it
but i didnt know ok

did you think
i could handle it too
you insisted on coming
remember you just had to come

will get you every time
and you--i was standing
right next to that man
you couldve killed me
no i couldnt i dont miss
so proud to be
a killer of men
to steal a human life
there is a dark spot
on your soul
for every man you have killed
then it must be
pitch black by now
yes it must
god weeps for you
what can we expect at the road
nothing for a while
then concordia--
that an inspection station
and they got guns

a bomb or a knife or a gun
when youre a killer
you think everyone is a killer
when youre done let go

the kid probably doesnt know
how to use that thing
he could hose us all down
in a second if he freaks out
thanks for helping me
appear nonchalant
and don’t try acting out
that little drama
youre playing around
in your head
cause ill be rewriting
the ending you understand

we’re just one big happy family
¿habla español

mexico can be very dangerous
if you are notcareful
¿está bien

yeah maybe too easy
how do you mean
nothing
what the most direct route
north from here
i think were on it
well pull off
let try to avoid
the main roads
is this heap gonna make it
if we dont drive it into
the ground i think so yeah
let find a little town where
we can rehabilitate ourselves
and hopefully the car
i’m bettin on the car
hey luz
you did good back there
i did it for us not for you
yeah well
thanks anyway
what is this
ricardo montalban birthday
these small towns
are always looking
for an excuse for a fiesta
probably remembering
some local
who saw the virgin
in a cornfield or something
excuse me mexican in the car
i’m sorry luz
never mind it true
better for us
easier to get lost
that looks like a hotel
over there
you want to check it out
yeah
you two go check in
ohand no secret messages
to the clerk
no paper airplanes for help
out the window
nothing you ever read
or wrote about
that shit only works
on paper clear
good
because
whether you know it or not
youre both better off
with me now
than you would be
with the authorities
really
now what happens to us
after we ditch you at
the border assuming we make it
hostages temporary insanity
ill think of something
let take care of this life
before we worry about the next
go on
room 7
meet me in that restaurant
across the plaza
ten minutes
were in room 8
go ahead honey
should we go to the police
in this town
some old man
and his brother-in-law
they probably
dont even have guns
by the time the real police
or the judiciales get here
we could be dead
we could get in the car
try to make a run for it
not in that car
but he right
where would we go
the judiciales
are more scary than he is
if he hadnt killed
those three today
wed both be in jail now
and i wouldve been fucked
by three men at least
what should we do
now you want my advice
you think i wouldve
agreed to drive him
if i had known
this was gonna happen
or let you come with us
i dont know
but you shouldve known danny
i’m sorry honey
dont im too angry
to take care of you
i’m too tired
to make love to you
where the fuck are we anyway
somewhere in between--
never mind
surprise me later
you ever watch any of those
vd training films
sir i think
they stopped showing those
after the korean war
damn shame too given all
the disease roaming around here
you got someone back home
no sir
you
nah
i live with
this middle-aged woman
who claims to be my wife
but
i stopped arguing with her
about it a long time ago
i just stay out of her way
i’m married to uncle sam
i’m his bitch just like you
no i dont
i dont see--
i dont quite see it
that way sir
oh ha ha you will
relationships have a way of
creeping up on you
then all of a sudden bam
youre screwed
but you’re young
what are you  2
25 sir
get out
no
old fart
you guys are all the same
iowa
rifle team
class president
4-h club
no youre close sir
oh
ohio
and uh
i couldn’t join
the 4-h club sir
because my cow died
good weatherford
you mustve spent
your junior year
abroad from the academy
growing a sense of humor
thank you sir
keep it youll need it
it might save you
from a razor blade
to the wrists one day
gracias
let me have the car keys
if you feel like leaving
dont let us stop you
oh i wouldnt leave you
stranded here
that why you followed us
to the church
in puerto vallarta--
the car
i did hear the bartender
mention it during the argument
what if danny
hadnt agreed to drive you
i couldnt risk
having him finger me
hed already proved
he had a big mouth in the bar
so what
you wouldve killed me
keep your voice down
youre completely amoral
dont throw your boy scout
code of honor in my face
i’ve been fighting battles
for you for thirty years
for me
yeah that right
while you were jerking off
in college
i was shooting people
and getting shot at
in vietnam and loas
and cambodia and panama
well thanks for killing
all those strangers for me
dont mention it you pampered
ungrateful bag of shit
how many people have you killed
300 and change
300 men
and women and kids
and they were all soldiers
so you were the good guys
that what we thought
whatd they think they were
were they the bad guys
because they werent paying you
well i guess morality
is pretty subjective
look at you
you sold yourself
your car and your girlfriend
for five grand
and youre the most
self-righteous bastard i know
-i dont kill people for money
danny
don’t tell me
the fiesta outside fellas
oh im sorry
i liked that song too
maybe you could like it
a little more quietly
yes maam
sit down
sit down danny
well finish eating
and then take a walk
we all could use one
i dont want to take a walk
i wasnt giving you a choice
would you have shot me too
no
maybe it was the way you looked
when you tripped
coming down those stairs
out of the church
you were waiting for us
outside the church
i walked over to you remember
but i mean before that
you were lying in wait for us
forget it i dont want you
freaking out again
were you or werent you
-i didnt do it did i
i cant believe this
you make me sick
hey keep walking
no
keep walking
dont let it spook you
we all brush against death
so many times in our lives
without knowing it
this was just one
you found out about
it must feel wonderful thinking
you have all this power
it’s just business to me
yeah if youd taken
better care of business
none of this wouldve happened
i mean come on
two guys in broad daylight
on a crowded street
a little sloppy
don’t you think
id been trailing
the civilian for days
first time he was exposed
who was he
i dont know
some guy who’d been selling
something to the chinese
computer technology
they don’t tell me that stuff
the us government that is
so then why are you running
i wasnt contracted
for the other hit--
the navy officer
you mean that was a mistake
i was standing
right next to him
not a technical mistake
a personal one
what do you mean
i knew the guy
i wanted to kill him
danny
i’m right here honey
where were you
restless
i got some fresh air
what are you doing up
i hear him cry out
guilt and remorse
should we go to him
what no
let him live with his ghosts
he created them
no use she done this before
the fuel pump shot
can you fix it
yeah with a new fuel pump
any chance of finding one here
no way not in this burg
i have to take
the old one out
find a replacement in a bigger
town like mazatlán maybe
how do you get there
there are buses going between
these small towns all the time
i could probably get there
and back in one day
how far are we from the border
24 hours
driving straight through
but even if we could
get this thing started
shed never make it
ln fact
were lucky we found out here
oh yeah lucky
so do luz and i go
you go luz stays
i’ll need her to translate
just hold up the old fuel pump
a picture worth
a thousand words
-i’m not leaving her

come on luz
danny has a fuel pump to remove
jeez man can’t you wait
till we get to the beach

to danny since i’ve met him
what do you mean
i’m the girl you leave
the girl you dont marry
you never take home
or even across the border
i’m only fit for someone
living in exile or desperation
i’m the desperation girl
i always get left
the question is when
you deserve a lot more
no
you dont know me well enough
yeah i do
you want lunch or something
something
did you ever pray
yeah during the war
when i was being tortured
i prayed id die
when i didnt i gave up on god
it a sin to pray for death
i don’t think god is
even counting my sins anymore
he is
but he forgives you
we are all sinners
i’m tired
do you mind if i rest
no not at all
luz
luz
i couldnt leave you alone
i know
there nothing wrong
with the fuel pump
danny wanted me
to meet him in mazatlán
yeah i know the 300 bus
i saw him buy the ticket
then why didn’t you--
i wanted you to stay
but only if you wanted to
the first time i was with danny
it was for money
i did work at chulo
but i didnt make enough money
to live on
or to send home
so
sometimes i went with men
those bikers
at the restaurant knew
i am a puta
they didnt know anything
except that youre beautiful
scum like that
think all women are whores
but i was
danny never throws it
in my face
never mentions it
still it always there
i think
in the back of his mind
and now yours
you had a hard time
you had to stay alive
i understand that
what will he think
when i dont show up
hell accept it
if not now then later
am i a bad girl
no no no
god forgives you
were all sinners
bad dream
yeah theyre all bad
i heard you last night
same dream over and over
since the war
lo siento tanto
some memories are too
terrible to live with
i thought they’d stop
after i killed him
killed who
that guy in puerto vallarta
the navy officer
he left me to die in cambodia
in the jungle
my spotter and i
were trapped there
he was supposed to lift us out
if things got hot
and he left us
he just flew away
dios mio
my friend my spotter
was killed right away
and then i was shot kicked
stabbed with bayonets
and that guy in the chopper--
reese--
watched it all
and didnt do a goddamn thing
what happened
i was dragged away
and tortured
the only thing
that kept me alive
was hating that fucker reese
i wanted to live
just to get him
dios castiga
i’m sure god punished him
long before you killed him
not enough
i got away escaped
floated down
some river to thailand
and after they patched me up
and i got out of the hospital
i went to work for the cia
and i never ever
forgot about reese
but i never saw him again
till that day
in puerto vallarta
the day i met you
do you believe in fate
more than that
i believe in miracles
were gonna need one
to get out of here alive
you know that don’t you
yes
if we do
will you come north with me
i have a little place
in the hills
in oregon
deep in the woods--
very quiet very beautiful
it a good place
to be alone with someone
i would like to
we will replace
your bad dream
with a good one
where are you going
i have a plan
i dont know if itll work
but it worth a try
why cant we just take
a bus to the border
no theyll be
looking for me there
here put this on
to replace the one i messed up
in puerto vallarta
i saw you looking at it
in a shop window
thank you
back soon
look at what
i’ve been reduced to
following these idiots around
like a perpetual motion machine
pretty hopeless isnt it sir
yeah
you know
it my birthday today
really sir
no not really
in a few months
but it would bolster
my self-pity
and sense of futility
if it were today
yes sir
mcgrane
it price
where the hell are you
you first
i’m following some mexican
intelligence wunderkind
around the highways and byways
of this dysentery factory
trying to find your sorry ass
now why would you want
to do that
so they dont slaughter you
better make sure they do
what would be the point of that
to eliminate a nasty
and potentially
embarrassing problem
best way to do that
is to get you home
what about reese
what about him
what the price for that
nothing it was a mistake
you know and they know
i dont make mistakes
officially it was a mistake
youre getting older
he stepped in your sights
it was a terrible--
and ironic
yeah a terrible
and ironic mistake
it more convenient
for everyone
if you classify it that way
why did my ride pull out
he panicked
not your orders
no
believe me we just want
to get you out of here now
tell me where you are
tell me where you are
i’m in a little town
called zapata
it’s just north of rosario
right got it
where should we meet
there an abandoned church
north of town
it shouldn’t take me more than
a few hours to get there
i’ll be waiting
goody
thinks he going home sir
he is
in a box
hang a u at the next curve
yes sir
i’m ready
ready for what
honey
surprised
i guess you missed the bus
i told you
i couldnt leave him alone
no you told me youd follow me
remember
adiós mivida all that
i waited three hours for you
at the bus station at mazatlán
i’m sorry
no forget im sorry
this is bigger than im sorry
and i spent the whole night
wondering if hed killed you
or taken you hostage
or raped you
guess he didnt have
to work that hard huh
danny--
what
i love him
what the spanish word
for psychiatrist
youre with this guy
this murderer
this serial killer
for one night--
weve been with him
for almost a week now
oh it a week
it a long-term relationship
i guess a girl could fall
for charles manson in a week
and it was your idea remember
my idea
yeah
that you’d fall for him
thatd you leave me stranded
that you’d fuck him
right under my nose
danny--
i guess once a whore
always a whore
i’m sorry
i’m sorry
i didnt mean that
it all right
no it not all right
forget that i said that
i just--i didnt know
what happened to you
i didnt know why you didnt--
i thought you would go back
forget be safe
can you forget luz
just like that
can you
looks like we could use
a bigger room
yankee stadium
wouldnt be big enough
this is what you’ve been after
from the beginning isnt it
it just happened
i think i found a way
out of here
there no way out of here
there are cops and the army
in concordia
and on the road in here
to zapata
we got to take that chance
she doesnt
he right
they’re just looking for me
you can tell them i forced you
and danny to come along
theyll believe you
they already think
im out of control
think
luz
luz stay
not for me
do it to save your life
that what im doing
here
what are you doing
thisll make it more believable
give us ten minutes
go down to the plaza
make a scene about what i did
to you and luz
that should be easy
your keys
the rest of the money i owe you
you think i could take that
a deal a deal
yeah but i never got you there
buy your self a nice headstone
am i going too fast

to a place i found where
the jungle meets the town
-is that it
yeah
someone is going
to meet us there
i hope so luz come on
wait here
ok
this is a mausoleum
rich people have themselves
buried in the chapel
to be closer to god
we wont be here long
here we go
he holding her hostage
in the hotel
right up there
what that
our salvation maybe
stay here
is that it sir

and there he is--
all packaged and ready for us

just let her go
no we go together
youre going
to push her aside
and thisll be over
in two seconds
step aside luz
no no no i thought
they came to help us
well they lied to me
it doesnt have
to go down like this
tell him we got away well take
our chances in the jungle
no no no it over now
it you or it both of you
now push her aside
get out of the way luz
move her aside

theyll lie to you someday
when youve done
all their dirty work for them
theyll send a younger version
of you to kill you
no please
¡colonel
the girl was with him
she was hit
in the line of fire
did you set the blaze
yes sir
the place is a huge crypt sir
it filled with bodies
appropriate for price
i thought the fire
would make it impossible
to sort out remains
to complicate matters
in case the locals
decided to investigate
i think i underestimated you
weatherford
yes sir
i think you did
what happened
well price is dead
gunfire ignited the flames
where luz
she was caught in the crossfire
no
yes
no
no
no let go of me
it too late it too late
you shot her didn’t you
you bastards
look you want to blame someone
blame price or yourself
or her
were not stupid enough
to think
either of you
was completely innocent
now consider yourself
lucky to be alive
oh my god oh god
señor
all right now
calm down calm down
before the local boys
use you as the scapegoat
youd better get out of here
that would end things nice
and neat for you wouldnt it
son things always end
nice and neat for me
whichever way they go
3000 us right
here your money
all right you got it all
ok
