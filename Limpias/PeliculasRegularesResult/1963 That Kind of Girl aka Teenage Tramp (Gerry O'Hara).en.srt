greece at the time of pericles

he means the campaign against h weapons
oh it time isnt it
nothing personal
but it was hitler that started it all
it was no more hitler
than you or me
the bomb was a historical necessity
given the scientific know-how
the productive capacity
but hitler was the catalyst
oh im not blaming him any more
than the americans or the russians
or ourselves come to that

bye eva it been fun
bye keith
hi sorry janet
he went rambling up about metallic
fatigue and the theory of structure
i just couldnt get a word in
that all right
hey wait a sec
my lecturer still away on holiday
did you enjoy your weekend
did the car go well
all right the valves need fixing
like a coffee
hmm
picked up a smashing blonde
on the way home
oh yes
oh nothing
she was just a refugee from
the ban the bomb march
i gave her a lift
how about you
oh you know i gave mum a hand
i tried to get on with my french thesis
dad was gardening
as if you didnt know
ive been thinking
i want to talk to him janet
but what about
weve got to have it out with him
why now so suddenly
suddenly
janet youve said youll marry me
yes when youve finished your degree
what difference does that make
you know how my parents feel about you
theyll help us
till i begin with the firm
no my father feels differently
i told you he came up the hard way
he started off as ordinary porter
at king cross
and now he a traffic manager so what
im sorry janet i admire him for that
you know i do
but what that to do with us
all right keith you talk to him
but dont say i didnt warn you
if it the money side
that bothering you mr bates
you neednt worry
my parents will look after that
your dad could have all the dough
in the world and probably has
but it your future im worried about
how i look at it
a young man should stand
on his own feet
youve a fine career in front of you
and i dont want to see you spoil it
mr bates it always been understood
that im going into
my father business
yes once youve got
your engineering degree
it wont help your studies
to have a wife on your hands
too many other things to think about
but a couple of blokes in my year
are married already
things have changed
good luck to them
but i still say one thing at a time
i never went to college keith
but i do know a thing or two
about marriage
how long do you need
before you finish your course
eighteen months
if i pass my exams in june
just if and if not
another year
well janet can do
what she likes once she 2
though i still hope she takes my advice
dont get me wrong
you two have been going out together
and janet mother and i
would like to see you getting married
eighteen months isnt too long to wait
she worth it isnt she
dont take it too hard son
talk it over with janet
i told you keith
what does he know about it anyway
oh i hope you didnt say that to dad
honey when he was young
people didnt have
six-year degree courses
it not natural to wait so long
poor old dad he never had
the chance to take a degree
they scraped to send me to university
what it to do with us
they had to wait too he was earning
30 bob a week at your age
it all so bloody silly
when there is no money problem
what had he to say to that
oh you know
hard work never did anyone any harm
and all that stuff
you must have thought about it
thought about what
well sex
it not natural for two people
to see each other
as much as we do without
oh it all so stuffy and suburban
but im a suburban girl keith
no youre not janet
i didnt mean it like that
then what did you mean
look im not that kind of girl
and you wouldnt respect me
for it if i was
and you neednt be
so damn smug and prissy about it
oh i never knew it was prissy
to wait until you were married
before sleeping with a man
but ive asked you to marry me
ive gone down on my hands and knees
of course if you cant wait
you speak just like your father
what you dont understand is
it so much easier for a woman
than it is for a man
is it who put that into your head
look ive done my best
but im damned if im gonna submit
to your family views
on love and marriage
theyre out of the ark
if you feel like that
there nothing i can say
i thought youd forgotten
of course not ive been very tied up
i was just passing by
oh yes and you know something
i was looking for you every night
how nicholas
nicholas is fine
arent you going to ask me for a dance
in england the man usually asks
but let go

you know i liked going out
oh you liked going out is that all
i thought id met someone
who was different
but you were different
you were unspoilt
i enjoyed being with you
but can i help it if someone young
comes along and i like him
no you cant help it
you cant help a thing
and i didnt go near a woman
the whole time i was away
i lay awake at night
just thinking about you
like a 20-year-old kid
and you dont give a damn
because youre another little tramp
elliot i go in now dont
youre coming back with me
no
let me go
no
all right miss hold on
yeah
he got clean away you feel all right
youd better come down to the station
with me and make a statement
now take it easy dear
come along now
there a good boy there a nice boy
did you get a clear look at him
would you recognise him
if you saw him again
he came from behind
but you told the constable
that he stepped out of a side turning
it was dark
are you quite certain
youve never met him before
look i know youve had a fright
im glad it was nothing more
but if you know anything
it your duty to tell us
in the interests of other women
as well as your own
you havent given us much to go on
im sorry
very well we shall have to book it
assault by person unknown
can i go now
well i cant force you
to do this it up to you
but id like you to see
the police surgeon
but i told you
he didnt interfere with me
all the same
i think it would be sensible
a matter of routine
he here now it wont take a moment
i must get back
youll be through in 0 minutes
good afternoon
youre a new patient arent you
i brought this from the police surgeon
i see
i dont know why he send me
i expect he thought
you should have a check
there nothing to be frightened about
now there are just one or two details
i should like
first of all your name and address
nobody will know treatment here
is absolutely confidential
once ive filled in your card
i shall give you a number
then when you hear it called out
youll go straight in to the doctor
now your name first
koenig eva koenig
and your address
so youve been suffering
from a sore throat and a rash
it was nothing
ive had sores all winter but this
a great many women contract
venereal disease without realising it
oh please dont get upset
the great thing is you came to see us
now tell me about your boyfriends
you do understand me
where do you come from
austria
oh fascinating country
ive spent holidays in the tirol
now i know these are intimate questions
but i need the details
has there been more than one
yes
now tell me about
your most recent boyfriend
when did you first
have intercourse with him
it only happened once
and just two days ago
i see
did either of you use contraceptives
did you know him well
have you got his name and address
i only want to know
in case you have to trace him
i could find him
very well
now you said thered been
a second friend when was that
it was some weeks ago
now im going to take a little blood
so that we can make a test
it isnt painful
just keep your arm steady
syphilis
i told you already
it easy enough to pick up
the main risk is for anyone
to have sex outside marriage
well get you right it lucky
you came to us in the early stages
youll have to attend here regularly
mind you
a girlfriend of mine told me
they stick needles into you
and they expand like umbrellas
oh come on now
youll have your penicillin daily
and in a fortnight
the course will be completed
after that youll need periodic checks
for two years
when do i start
now
oh cheer up
it no worse than the blood test
ill take you through to sister now
but there one other thing
i want you to give one of these slips
to each of those boyfriends
you told me about
so that they come here for examination
oh must i
you caught syphilis
from your first friend
in all probability
youve infected the other two
oh no
and the millars
could i have given it to them
i was coming to that
syphilis is normally passed on
by sexual intercourse
but that rash of yours
means the disease has spread
chance infection could occur
if you were handling a child
nicholas it awful
i dont say it likely
now ill take you through to sister
for your injection
and after that you have a word with
the almoner im sure shell help you
i know how you feel
weve all done things without thinking
of the consequences to other people
what am i to tell mrs millar
theyve been so kind to me
it up to you eva we cant force you
dont you see theyll send me
straight back to austria
and i cant face my father i cant
i cant promise anything
but the millars sound
sympathetic sort of people
it a child
if i were you
id make a clean breast of it
tell mrs millar to go to their family
doctor who can get a report from us
now that youre getting
regular injections
therell be no danger to nicholas
if that what worrying you
um ill try
you do that
now about these young men
you say you cant contact
this first friend
eva ive heard about the assault
are you certain you dont know the man
who attacked you
i i
nothing you say to me
will go outside these four walls
not even to the police
i think itd be sensible
for you to tell the police
but as far as were concerned no
not even to the police
yes it was elliot
my first friend
but im frightened
frightened of what hell do
in that case
you can send him the slip by post
if i know his sort
it wont be the first
you know his address
yes
then we seem to be on the way
to settling our problems
youll see the other two
and speak to them
i dont know where keith lives
i dont know anything about him
except he wonderful
but hell ring me
or turn up at the club im sure
keith
hello janet
youve been avoiding me
well after that row i didnt think
you wanted to see me again
oh you know that isnt true
if two people cant have a row
without one of them going off
and sulking oh come on now
ive been thinking about you
all the time
well maybe it was my fault
i suppose
i must have sounded pretty smug
honestly keith
the way you put it to me
i behaved like a bloody fool
i dont know what came over me
then what the matter
janet it isnt that
what
well after we quarreled
i was feeling pretty fed up
i went to a club
you know that girl i told you about
from austria
the blonde
im sorry janet
ill never see her again
keith you didnt
oh keith why did you have to tell me
oh i suppose you were right
id have been much unhappier
if you’d simply gone on
as if nothing had happened
i must dash now
shall we go out tonight
yes let where
let go to the pictures
well go and see a sad film
and have a good cry
fine
bye
eva i just dont know what to say
oh ill have to tell my husband
well obviously well all
have to go to the doctor
first thing in the morning
i did warn you
if only youd paid
the slightest attention to what i said
im sorry mrs millar
it a fine time to say youre sorry
when i think of nicholas
oh it all so loathsome
i didnt know
i didnt think i was harming anyone
oh now come on eva
at least you had the courage
to tell me straight out
and you said they said at the clinic
that it wasnt very likely that
there your family to think about
hello keith will you come in
hello
all right just to say hello
you thought you were in for
a rough time with dad didnt you
theyve gone out for the evening
oh well that a relief
fine way to start an evening
oh ive got some new records
you must hear them
but if we’re going to the pictures
oh let not rush off to the pictures
i havent seen you for ages
ill fix us some supper
that if you could make do with
scrambled eggs or baked beans on toast
anything
then have a drink
while we make the big decision
dad got some beer on the ice
beer fine
difficult arent you
sorry im on my best behaviour tonight
if im gonna slave over a hot stove
for you ill just run up and change
the beer in the fridge help yourself
okay
janet
jan
are you there
janet
you dont have to do that
i want to
i was wrong
everything you said was right
i nearly lost you
you never lost me
i always wanted you
even
and i want your children
keith the lights
darling
we must be careful if id have known
darling i knew
yeah she gave me that form
a fortnight ago
but i knew there was nothing
to worry about
oh how
well you see i work in a library
i looked it up in a medical dictionary
i see
well i knew i neednt worry
after all we didnt sleep together
and if we did id have taken
the necessary precautions
im sorry to tell you that if you
have intercourse with a woman
suffering from venereal disease
no precautions are safe
well then like i said
that question dont arise
but there was sexual contact
if you can call it that
you know how it is
i petted her a bit kissed her
on the mouth
yeah
then what decided you to come here
well now that you mention it
it was a sore ive got
just inside my mouth here
well i mean nothing much
but me neck swollen a bit there
thought i might as well
come for a check
let me see please
cant do any harm
open your mouth wider
hmm
ill be giving you
a thorough examination next door
but unless im very mistaken
that a syphilitic sore on your lip
she was so young and inexperienced
of course i wont be seeing her again
wont catch me with that kind of girl
hello eva
so you finished the course now
yes i just had my last injection
sister told me to come back
in a month for a check
youre staying as long as that
the millars are so kind
at first they said i was to go home
after the injections then
they found they couldnt manage
without you
how the little boy
how old did you say he was
half past three
half past
oh you mean three and a half
my english
and he well
yes they are all well
it was a false alarm
well that a relief
oh by the way i understand that
one of your friends has reported here
for treatment
you did send off that letter
to elliot yes the same afternoon
by registered post like you said
it over a fortnight
he ought to have had it
or the post office
would have sent it back to you
well in view of what he attempted
to do to you
he probably gone
for treatment elsewhere
i tried to find
i tried to find keith
i went to the club each evening
i see and he hasnt turned up
or phoned you
nothing
i wish i could warn him
i have no way
i dont know his full name anything
except that he wonderful
well dont worry too much
of course if he does get in touch
with you he sounds sensible
if he has the infection
he probably seen a doctor
i havent walked so far for ages
oh it been lovely though
yes
i must put them in water
when i get back
dont shut the lid youll kill them
theyll be all right
keith

ive been trying to tell you
all afternoon
what is it

im going to have a baby
are you sure i mean sometimes
three months ago now i missed twice
and then i went to the doctor last week
and he sent me for a test
i see
why didnt you tell me earlier
there was nothing you could do
youd only have worried
we both knew it was a risk
but some people try for months with
i dont regret it do you
of course not if you love someone
you want their children
dont you see
it was the only possible way
for us to get married
with dad feeling like he did
have you told them
not yet
well see them together
and get it over with
your father will be after me
with a shotgun
please take me home
im sorry janet that wasnt funny
i know ive been unfair to you
after all you said to me about waiting
i thought about it night after night
it just didnt seem any other way out
i dont blame you
if anyone to blame it myself
dont worry darling
well see it through
there no point in putting it off
will your father be in now
no keith let me tell him
i forced this on you i can see it now
from now on ill do the worrying
hello may i speak
to miss koenig please
please
it you quite a time
you led me a regular dance didnt you
never mind
we wont say anything more about that
ive been along for my medicine
like a good boy
i dont want to speak to you
mr millar says youre not to ring
you havent been telling stories
have you not to the police
i didnt tell the police
anything about you
there a sensible girl
i dont want to talk to you
im going back to austria
i ran into your boyfriend the other day
havent been seeing him have you
hello
you mean keith
yes that right keith murray
small world isnt it
i told you i was in advertising
we handle his fathers account
murray construction
i bumped into him at their offices
with his fiancée
his fiancée
yes i thought youd be interested
now look eva about us
keith
i thought you were not coming
eva what can i say
i behaved very badly
i should have rung you or something
how did you find my number
it doesnt matter
keith i couldnt tell you
on the telephone
eva what is it
they told me to give it to you at once
i didnt know how to find you
i thought you would ring me
kensington hospital
i dont get it
they want you to go
there a special clinic
theyll explain to you
you see there was someone else
and he was sick
i didnt know about such things
you know the notices in toilets
oh my god
they give you injection
make you better soon
there no need for anyone to know
no
i didnt tell you im engaged
i heard a friend told me
what you dont know is she pregnant
oh hello keith
hello ruth
have you come to see roger
yes
well come in then
thank you
hello tracy
havent seen you for ages
you know exams and everything
i have to congratulate you
we read the announcement
in the local rag last week
thanks
we met her remember
youre a very lucky young man
oh that damn telephone
the secretary is away this afternoon
roger wont be too long
dont worry about me
hello keith nice to see you
hello roger
come on through
thanks
i was delighted to hear about
the engagement keith really delighted
roger i think im in a hell of a mess
oh what kind of mess
ive just been handed this
i see
well suppose you tell me all about it
i dont want you to think
ive been sleeping around
especially now
it only happened once and
there were reasons for that
yes im sure
look ill go to the clinic
if you think i should
but i just wondered if there was
some way of checking privately
tell me have you noticed any rash
any spots on your genitals
no nothing
well first of all
ill give you an examination
and then ill arrange for a blood test
hugh price can do that for us
if it should prove to be positive
i could of course
arrange to treat you privately
but my advice would be to
take advantage of the clinic
anyway lets get on
with the examination
hello
eva
are you alone
oh it you
elliot stop it
i wont listen i wont
what on earth the matter with eva
another of those obscene phone calls
becoming a real menace
him again
he got eva really scared
the man seems to have
some kind of obsession about her
well weve got to do
something about this
do you think you could persuade her
to go to the police
it wouldve saved a lot of trouble
if she had done it before
well it asking an awful lot
of the girl in her present state
but ill try
eva
oh miss koenig
i believe you have
some further information for us
i was so frightened
i couldnt tell you
you think you could identify
the man who assaulted you
i know him
why didnt you tell us this before
it was some months ago now
what made you change your mind
because he keeps phoning me
it not only myself the millars
these telephone calls are they abusive
does he threaten you
he says such terrible things
what hell do to me
improper use of the telephone
is an offence
there no need to be frightened
now that youve come to us
can i have his name please
collier elliot collier
and do you know where he lives
yes he has a flat
number  alban court
in the king road
well that not too far away
well soon put a stop to this
sergeant davis please
collier left that address
rather hurriedly some weeks ago
the day after the incident in the mews
i expect
we shall have to get
the millars permission
to have their telephone monitored
please
oh it means that if anyone rings up
well be listening
and the next time collier rings you
keep him talking
but you neednt listen
to what he has to say
just let him talk
we need time for what weve got to do
so at all costs you must keep him
on the other end
it may not be very pleasant
will you do it
yes i will
what i dont understand is how
i couldve caught this without knowing
you were unlucky
there usually a sore on the genitals
but sometimes
it no more than a pimple
it doesnt hurt and it soon disappears
doesnt that mean it cured
no it means that the infection has
entered on a more serious stage
no one can be cured
of syphilis or gonorrhea
without professional medical treatment
it never crossed my mind
it rarely does
anyone who indulges in shall we say
casual intercourse
would be well-advised to come in
for a regular check
especially if they’re
thinking of marriage
ill give it to her today
i dont know how im going to tell her
well if youll go back
to waiting room now
there are some further tests to be made
doctor
yes
shell be all right
oh i see no reason why not
provided she reports promptly
after all we dont know
that you infected her
and the baby
you say she rather more than
two months pregnant
oh the baby too
if we see her in time
can i tell her that
you can
but send her here soon
that the important thing
thank you sir
yes
am i disturbing you doctor
no sister come in
makes you think
that young fellow i just saw
decent well-educated young boy
and he risks his marriage
through crass ignorance
that and a lack of moral sense
like you id blame the parents
as much as anybody
young people should be told
and told early
there a lot id like to tell these
young things who come sailing in here
it so often a matter of ignorance
these latest figures 40000 new cases
a year and most of them young people
they should know what happens
when syphilis goes untreated
heart disease paralysis with blindness
insanity stillbirths
and with gonorrhea sterility
in women and children born blind
mild enough diseases at the start
but over the years
they take a terrible toll
listen down the slope and past the hut
ill come with you if you like
no no thank you
well youll see the notice
special clinic
thanks it a great help
janet please dont take it like this
ive never been to a doctor
to tell him im an unmarried mother
and that the man
who got me pregnant has vd
i know
but were over the worst
are we
you say it cant hurt the child
but ive read about cases
have you ever seen a mentally
deficient child because i have
janet the doctor told me
itll be all right
this just doesnt happen to people
who respect their own bodies
i feel so cheap like a common tart
were over the worst of it
will you stop saying
were over the worse of it
i mean weve told your parents
about having the baby
there no need for them to know
anything about this
it doesnt make it any better
by hiding it
you havent told them
no i havent
it doesnt make me feel any better
look
as soon as were both in the clear
im going straight
to the registry office
to arrange about getting married
just a few weeks now
no youre not keith
there isnt going to be a marriage
eva i think youd better answer that
hello
this is you-know-who
now you listen to me
is someone there i can hear music
i was listening to the records
eva are you still there
dont hang up on me
yes im still here

women police sergeant carnall speaking
oh you have
he on the line now

that was understood

well ill have to go back
for observation
and ill be making blood tests
for a long time

i phoned to say i was going home
he would like to see you he so upset
he upset
if he would like to see me
oh why are men so stupid
janet
oh hello
we must talk
eva rang me she told me what you said
i mean about the medical check
and i suppose that makes
everything all right
of course it doesnt
that why i had to see you
look ive spoken to my father
the baby my responsibility
as well as yours
i dont want any money from you
or your father
if that what youre getting at
you must be realistic
we may not be millionaires
but well manage

and later on
i mean youve got to face it
your father isnt so young
ill get myself a job
as soon as ive finished at college
im not as helpless
as you seem to think
i never thought
you were helpless janet
that wasnt why i asked you to marry me
what will you call him
you seem to think itll be a him
keith that isnt fair
i do have my feelings
so do i
and youre not giving me a chance
janet
look maybe youll marry somebody else
but the baby needs a father
ill never marry anybody else
how could you be so cruel
all this talk about money cant you see
it not your money i want it you
you said
you shouldnt listen to what i say
you ought to know how i feel
silly
well if were going to be unhappy
wed better be unhappy together
