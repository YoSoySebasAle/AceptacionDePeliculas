viva rivera
viva rivera
viva zoreno
personally i find
him charming
oh do you know tom
that he speaks french
almost as well as english
mm-hmm he does
napier should appoint you
mrs jordan
as public relations
officer
yes youd make a splendid
plantation hostess
one of bryant nippies
oh what an excellent
idea tom
now when can i start
mr bryant
and what will be
your terms
i never talk business
at parties mrs jordan
and never
with beautiful women
aw
really
extraordinary
now i shouldve thought--
that it was a marvelous
opportunity
i quite agree tom
now mr bryant
you cant get out of this
let talk it over while
we dance shall we
delighted
im so glad you dont
mind my husband
rather schoolboy
sense of humor
oh i know some people do
especially rather
pompous people you know
on the contrary
i find him rather
refreshing
im so sorry
that over so quickly
tell me what part
of france are you from
medoc
oh the wine country
yes my father
had a vineyard
as big as one
of our plantations
oh i expect it is
quite small really
but it used to seem big to me
as big as the whole country
and you of course
was his princess
and then one day a rather
beaten-up representative
of the london suburban
wine company
came down the drive
with dust on his shoes
and his suitcase full of empty
bottles and dirty shirts--
and they lived happily
ever afterwards
in a manner of speaking
well it getting
frightfully late tom
i think we ought
to go home
let
well thank you so much
it been such a lovely party
so glad you enjoyed it
oh yes i did
let me show you around
napier one of these days
oh i should love it
mr bryant goes out
of his way to keep
the staff happy and the wives
particularly the wives
tom you are wicked
when youve been out here
as long as i have jordan
you may learn to mix
with our little community
what the hell
do you think i am
a new boy
comparatively speaking
three months
still in his first term huh
waiting for you to teach me
the nicknames
of all the masters
and what they call
the lavatories
in six form b
well i know what the peasants
call you anyway
come on let get some air
goodnight
goodnight
thank you
for the lovely party
what the matter
go on tell me
what the matter
oh i know i behaved
badly at the party
but i always behave
badly at parties
what about that party
that wine tasting party
your father gave remember
when i said i thought
the 953 vintage
reminded me of a rather
vivacious little cup of tea
that i found in the cafe
on the north circular road
remember
you laughed at that once
it was a long time ago
tom
tom coming to bed
coming to bed
tom
it a new year
so they told us
at the party
and what this
the thaw
oh be different please
try
different
what do you mean
different
stop being a child
what do you want me to be
grown-up and mature
like bryant
and all those idiots
with their funny hats
oh god it starting again
what are you smoking
for anyway
oh do you mind
i thought
if you had anything
interesting to say
id keep awake and listen
what do you want me to say
just how you think were going
to go on living together
that all
if you cant live with me
that your problem
oh yes
oh yes it always
my problem
what were you
doing when we met
buying wine for a firm
that went broke
married to a woman who never
cared what happened to you
oh gwen
tch
what a ridiculous name
at least she liked me
just as i was
hmm
with the boyish charm
well that wearing
a bit thin now
if you want to know the truth
and ill tell you the truth
you always wanted me
different didnt you
you always wanted
to change me
well i didnt succeed
in making a man of me
huh you sound like some
ridiculous headmaster
oh it not funny when you
say those things anymore
and it not funny
when youre rude at parties
now look i can be rude
to who i like you understand
im free
as far as being rude
is concerned
im absolutely free
no
youve got a job to look after
and a marriage remember
you make marriage sound
like some bloody awful
purchase agreement
pay up for 50 years
it yours when you die
oh how can you say that
when i came with you
when you didnt even have
a job or money or anything
i came to that dreary hotel
to provide the evidence
and the rooms we lived
in while you change jobs
and saved up to pay
for the cost of the divorce
nobody forced you
well i did it because
you were human
and you were funny
and you were alive
not just angry
with people for no reason
and hopeless for no reason
and never doing anything
that makes any sense
we just cant go on
we cant go on
we could go on if you
just be a wife
a wife
how could i be more
of a wife
well you can hate the same
people i hate for a start
and then you can stay at home
and bath the children maybe
do what
bath the children
if youd ever had any
you see im trying to sleep
i am sorry darling
well it too late
good morning gabriel
senor
you wish i to stay here
yes of course
you will give me protection
gabriel please
this is not my day
what are you talking about
you had the guns
last night
when people hear that
they go into the hills
my cousin
is on his way there
but if he could
stay here 2 3 days
he can sleep in kitchen
he very good cook
and another advantage
he plays guitar
all right
thank you senor
thank you
what is all this about anyway
we have a new president
oh congratulation
what his name
the new president
general zoreno
well viva zoreno
viva zoreno
viva rivera
good morning
hello
where is everybody
all our workers disappear
into their holes
as soon as there
any trouble
theyll be back
in a few days
in the meantime we got
a new face to look at
zoreno
yes
ive arranged for photograph
of him to be laid off
do we have to
just a little courtesy
napier would like
us to extend it
to the new man in power
exactly
is it over
bar the shooting
is there going to be
much more of that
i understand that rivera
has made a run for it
i heard it on the radio
i expect theyll have
caught him by now
there will be a trial
of course in the sports arena
2000 votes to none in favor
of the extreme penalty
they always send their disused
presidents to the sports arena
you made it sound
very quaint
im sorry
there a lot to
be said for rivera
provided we stick
to theory of course
abolishing the death penalty
freeing the press
granting the vote
to a lot of indians
who could neither
read nor write
and then what happens
the army takes over
by the way i see your friend
hernandez is with zoreno
still minister of justice
i always thought
he was intelligent
you better
take one of these
what that for
flag for your car
you may find it useful
if there any in trouble
what am i supposed
to do then
salute and sing
abide with me
you know i wish you
wouldnt make jokes
itd be far better
for your career with napier
if you were to stop
making jokes
jokes
on my way here this morning
i saw a man
he was running beside
the car with his face
all dabbed with
paint like a clown
he kept on sort of clawing
at the window
and then he screamed
something i didnt understand
well
they shot him
you could have done nothing
i could have stopped
just as well for you
that you didnt
why
because napier
might have got in wrong
with the new powers
you wont believe me jordan
but i was thinking of you
here you are doctor
thanks
beautiful isnt it
you know youre
the only napier wife
thatd buy these things
go into the other houses
and what do you get
plaster galleons
in full sail
why do you want to see me
im pregnant
well congratulations
to you both
but tom doesnt know
i wanted
to tell him that
oh surely that
the wife privilege
oh no no no
not about the baby
i wanted to tell him
that im going home
why
say that the climate
doesnt suit me
tell him i cant stay
for medical reasons
tell him that
oh you know what to say
what the real reason
im tired
im sick of smiling
and pretending
that all his sneers and insults
are just school boy jokes
i love to laugh at
last night he
yeah
last night he said
that it was my fault
we didnt have any children
well there no reason
why you shouldnt have
a perfectly healthy baby
if you take care of yourself
ive had two miscarriages
each time wed be moving
leaving a job that
isnt grand enough
for his great
big personality
well please
will you tell him doctor
that tom
well he early
isnt it
i cant think what has
happened unless
unless what
oh nothing
ill leave you two together
you tell him
please doctor
hello doctor
anybody ill
no i was passing
youre home early
oh plantation
is all deserted
so i drove through the town
been a little rough
there i understand
you could call it that
they dont last you know
never last very long
but there are times out here
when you have to look
in the opposite direction
god what a country
suits me
of course it doesnt
suit everyone
your wife for instance
what the matter
is claire ill
nothing nothing
to worry about
but may i speak
to you as man to man
you know the way
it strikes me i--
is it a go
yes like a bomb
but talking of claire

that im trying
to interfere

cant trust anyone
if you want to stay alive
personally i do
you may have your own private
reasons for giving it all up
i still find

for the sake
of your health

very inconsiderate of me
should i be caught
no one here has seen me mr
jordan
and youre not
going to get caught

soldiers with the senora
your husband
went to work this morning
then what happened
come mrs jordan
there is a limit
to our patience
mrs jordan
do not try to put us off
did your husband
not drive his car
good evening
hello darling
well look at all that ash
filthy smoking habits
mr jordan
yes
we have been waiting
for you mr jordan
good because i wish
to lodge a complaint
a complaint
at tribulacion at the bridge
some of your undisciplined
soldiers fired on my car
i can only imagine
they were drunk
you did not stop
we had a report
from tribulacion
of course i didnt stop
for those trigger-happy idiots
whatd you expect me to do
stay and get shot
may even happen
this mr jordan
there was someone
with you wasnt there
i saw him leave
there was no one
look there
a perfectly good ashtray
will you mind
did you or not have
a passenger
answer us
yes i did
a strange sort of passenger
that lies on a floor
hidden under a cloth
i thought that was
rather eccentric myself
but then a solution
occurred to me
i dont think he wanted
me to know he was there
you did not know
perhaps he crawled into the
van when it was in the garage
maybe he wanted a free lift
some tramp rather
it very amusing
oh it true
theyre always doing it
tramps women
children chickens
always crawling into cars
youd think they
want to live there
maybe it the housing shortage
in your beautiful country
well are you satisfied
gentlemen
not quite mr jordan
where is your car now
in the garage of course
i didnt hear you drive up
maybe because you
were shouting so much
now are you satisfied
one more thing
you have another
more thing to tell us
what that
where is your passenger
he still asleep i expect
do you want to see him
no need
for you to come darling
oh id like some air
open quickly
quickly
what are you laughing about
oh it marvelous
isnt it
i mean youve
gotten thrown out
of some strange places
at quick notice
but youve never done
anything like this before
i try to keep you out of it
oh that right
tom jordan the lone hero
with complete disregard
for his own safety
he snatched his wife
from a nice clean bedroom
and saved a sick man
from going to hospital
the regiment is proud of you
oh im sorry
oh but let be
sensible tom
well go straight
back to tribulacion
ill go and see
colonel hernandez
and ill explain
everything to him
thank goodness
he civilized
i think youre gonna
miss your nice little laugh
with colonel hernandez
why
because were going
to los indos river
which is about 30 miles
further on
well cross that somehow
and then well walk
to the frontier
oh i see
carrying a wounded man
with us i suppose
yes if he cant walk
but i can walk mr jordan
if you would stop the car
i owe you so much
please spare me the pain
of causing unpleasantness
between you and your wife
you dont and im not
going to stop the car
mr jordan please
look it wont save
us to drop you
you said that yourself
yes but you would travel
light much lighter
who are you
oh forgive my manners
mrs jordan
i should have
introduced myself
pedro rivera
who
pedro rivera i am i think
president of the republic
i doubt if there was
time for an election
that was quite delicious
oh the wife manages
the fancy stuff all right
it the boiled egg
we cant cook well can we
herbert
it not the egg
itself so much
it the time that seems
to be at fault
really
herbert
it either pure water
or of a rock like consistency
herbert mr bryant
isnt interested in eggs
yeah there a simple
device on the market
for checking the time of eggs
ah now that must
be the jordans
i hope he isnt tight
oh good evening
colonel
mr bryant i am looking
for one of your employees
jordan where is he
well that what
wed like to know
what jordan been doing
some ridiculous joke
i believe it serious
to help a traitor escape
what
a man was found
hiding in jordan car
well if he was found
jordan drove off with him as
he was about to be arrested
we wish to find
this enemy of the state
who is he
our ex-president
rivera
yes
i bet you were member
of his government
when we last met of course
i was justice mr bryant
and justice does not change
with governments
i believe that is true
even in england
so mr and mrs jordan
are expected here
quite a coincidence
yes but they
havent come
we shall see
is there no longer
enough adventure
for you in the manufacture
of sugar mr bryant
lopez
hey colonel
what the game
in england i believe
you call it hide and seek
you knew who he was
of course
swann told me
the president
does it make any difference
well you could have told me
im not a child you know
oh but no everything
has to be so secret
you have to do everything
on your own
oh for god sake i let
one man get killed today
isnt that enough
besides
what
oh nothing
i need to find
a place to cross
mrs jordan
yes
mrs jordan your husband
was worried about your safety
it would have been dangerous
for you to know who i was
look if you expect
anyone to be reasonable
i dont
i only hope we can all stay
together for a short time
of course
operator
operator you cut me
off three times already
what happened
it seems a car has been hidden
in your bushes mr bastian
a car
mr bryant you still say
you know nothing
of jordan movements
there are people
on the other side
they couldnt have
got here already
could they
oh look a fire
what would really happen
if they caught us
theyre not going
to catch us
farm workers
on their way to the hills
all right then well cross
as soon as it gets light
only if theyve gone
wouldnt it be safe
with them
ill not be safe
if i was seen by anyone
mrs jordan
anyone at all
let eat
it still
new year day
yes it is
a year ago today i was advised
to have general zoreno shot
you should
have listened
of course if we were
the swiss family robinson
i would find
the dry martini tree
and wed all have
a nice stiff cocktail
well when in doubt
have a picnic
what a sad song
cheese
on the contrary
it is a song of happiness
but dont they care
what happening
they have seen
too many changes
when i was a child
i worked at one
of those farms
i had to wait
on the great landlord
wherever he went all day
i have to stand
beside him
with a tall glass
filled with ice
one night i woke up
the dogs were barking
a man had stolen something
from the big landlord
and he had him half
buried in the ground
and the horses
rode over him
they woke us up
and made us watch
so we would learn
from his mistake
i grew up and i went away
and studied studied
and when i came back
the dogs barked again
that same landlord
he was planted
in the ground
and the horses
rode over him
all that studying to make
the dogs bark again
you know different dogs
of course this time
but you had
no part of that
what do you want
mr jordan
a good reason
for saving my life
wake up you dont
have to swim
i was dreaming
about the room
i booked last night
at the cosmopolitan
single and with bath
what did you say
i said you
dont have to swim
the great river just about
comes up to my knees
and it firm
gravel underneath
so we can
drive across
what the hell
are you doing
he saw us
all right
it was a mistake
we should have
silenced the boy
he saw us
if you want to come
with us get in the car
come on
we got to get out
of here quick
ill open the back
mr jordan
mr jordan
tom
that my leg tom
one bar of chocolate
and a corkscrew
and no bottles
to open
well at least
they were worth saving
you are very angry
with me mr jordan
i was only trying
to help
trying to help
not for myself
please understand
there are men women
and children there
who will be shot
unless i can get out for help
and you mrs jordan
and your husband
what is one boy
against so many
perhaps it true
now if you think that true
why are we doing all this
please let us
forget about the boy
it not so bad
mrs jordan
in those hills not very far
there a village san pablo
people there are still
my friends i think
they would help us
if we could reach them
oh tom
he looks bad
he alive
isnt he
he breathing
what else
does he expect
let go
come on
mr jordan
your watch
ive even lost
your watch for you
save your breath
for the mountains
come on now
we shall certainly
catch them
napier should
have financed
the fatherland party
mr bryant
not rivera escape
but we did not
do either
no
im afraid
we wont believe that
unless it proved
at rivera trial
and if it isnt
napier plantation
will be taken over
for the benefit
of the people
but weve given your people
work money hospitals
and weve never
indulged in politics
then youd better
start indulging now
on the winning side
for a change
they must be trying to cross
the frontier to bareya
you see we know
they crossed the river
a boy was given a present
a watch with the initials tj
tom jordan perhaps
they came from here
san pablo
no doubt
he helped them
the people there
are very backward
of course they may
not have heard
the good news
of our revolution
i think we shall have
to announce it to them
in a way they
can understand
alto
mama
that
that is san pablo
are they looking
for us
get in there
come on
do you think
they saw us
i hope not
do not be too worried
mrs jordan
we are not so far
from the frontier
well
about that village
cant we go there
we could but
im afraid we might
bring them trouble
thank you
are you very tired
cant be far now
cant it
what are you
thinking about
how long we can live
on a bar of chocolate
well have plenty left
for tomorrow
tom why cant we
go to that village
i could go
i mean i dont think
anyone will recognize me
i mean nobody
could recognize me now
i could get food
i can speak enough spanish
i mean why not
because it will be
dangerous that why
oh tom
oh you wont
ever listen
well im sorry
dont
dont what
apologize
i know it went all wrong
after that party
it seems
so long ago
no tom no
im sorry but i really
dont feel like it
i thought it might
be comforting
itll be more comforting
if you could find us
some food and water
or even a bed
oh lord
im hungry
all right then
let go to sleep
let just go to sleep
oh no
oh no i just
want some food
oh just some food
you bloody
little fool
mr jordan
mr jordan
please
i must rest
i remember once when
my son was a little boy
i took him
to a fiesta
hundreds of indians
came to town
galloping on horses
and my little boy
let go off my hand
and ran out among
those great hooves
i called him to return
but he would not come
i was sure
he would be killed
the horses passed
and there was my little boy
alive and well
i ran over to him
and i struck him hard
it was out
of great relief and love
but my little boy
could not understand that
it gonna rain
of course
what do you mean
of course
this is the temple of the god
of rain and fertility
we shall have
a feast in his honor
mexican enchilada
roast beef
with yorkshire pudding
mine
where mine
youre busy eating it
he eating
my chocolate
he eating my chocolate
that mean
that disgusting
that little piece of chocolate
and now he eating it
ive been thinking
about it all day
that little piece of chocolate
and now he eating it
please
mrs jordan
darling
this is your piece
look at the rain
it like england
you remember when
we first arrived in england
and you were expecting to find
a country full of green lawns
and stately homes and tall
titled men in tweed suits
making witty remarks and
eating cucumber sandwiches
hmm
you remember
the first few weeks all we did
was sit in the railway hotel
and watch the rain
pouring down
on pennington station
and not a lord
came near us
im sorry
im so sorry
that all right
i didnt know
what happened
that all right
it was awful
tom
tom
i see a cactus
i found something
to eat
no mrs jordan
you first
oh no no
you eat it first
please
you are always
so kind
are we
anywhere near yet
that is bareya
you would cross
is the frontier
we always used
to argue about it
ill go down when
it gets dark take a look
your husband does not
approve of me mrs jordan
since the matter
of the boy
no he doesnt
he a very pure man
or shall i say
a man of high ideals
tom
is he pure
for him things have to
be either right or wrong
if they are a little mixed
he is disgusted he gets sick
he saw the good
in revolution
but difficult to work
within the cabinet
did you hear
anything
women and prime ministers
have to be a little complicated
to survive
isnt that right
but you know
men like your husband
they are better
than us
it well guarded
but we can do it
now it dark
let spread out in the woods
very thick all around
so weve done it
we saved you
why mr jordan
that i cannot
understand
just a small
private feeling
they are-they are
nice those feelings
but they never
stay private
im a politician
understand
in the end i may do worse
for you than losing your job
or your home
or even your watch
like what
i may confuse you
mr jordan
weve been waiting
for you mr jordan
what did he say
he says now weve found him
that all we wanted
and now we should
let you go
those are not
my orders
what are
your orders
to bring you to the justice
of the people all of you
a nice public trial
in the sports arena
you will be
allowed a trial
can you guess
the verdict
naturally the verdict
is well known
you mean
well be shot
so why the hell
didnt you say so
oh i cant wait
to hear the prosecutor
when
the tumbler due
the what
the track-the transport
to take us back
it waiting
on the main road
were going
to leave now
just a minute
what about my wife
your wife
she been traveling
for 2 days without any food
a peasant might treat
a woman like that
a peasant
yes a stupid
brutal peasant
senora
my name is gomez
my family has a fine tradition
of courtesy to women
all right
so your mother a woman
now ask my wife
if she tired
i was about
to do so
there no need
for a foreigner to remind me
are you tired
senora
im pregnant
if you wish
to stay here the night
we will take turns
to guard you
thank you
yes mr bryant rivera has
been caught where i expected
here at the frontier
to bareya
congratulations and thank you
for letting me know so soon
that a splendid news
for us yes
but not for you
mr bryant
what do you mean
rivera had
two companions
wait till i see
that fool jordan
you will see him
very soon
meanwhile you will
have to wait here
but im so sorry i have
a rather important--
i said here
what made you think
of that story
what
about being pregnant
it true
wake up rivera
what
wake him up and get ready
to make a run for it
i just wanted
to thank you
for being
so kind to my wife
there arent many people
under the circumstance
whod be
so understanding
that all right
how is your wife
is she resting well
oh yes thank you
as well
as can be expected
you mustnt think i dont
understand family matters
im married too
you know
you are
yes
my own wife gave me
a boy just 3 months ago
would you be interested
to see a picture ive got
id love to
ive got it here
in my wallet
wife and baby
together
where is it
oh here it is
he has a fine
loud voice
we believe he been
destined for the opera
basso profondo
ah good
the cup that cheers no
tell me you find our
people good workers
first rate of course
we give them plenty
of responsibility
but we make absolutely
no distinction
between the british
and the
natives
well of course we dont
actually call them that
why not we call you
extranos outsiders
and which
of the natives
would you trust most
to run the plantation
let me see
well ive got
a lot of time
for my assistant
rafael trujo
sometimes i think
he knows more
about the job
than i do myself
rafael trujo
good
i must make
a note of that name
im afraid youre
going to find england
rather cold
after this mr bryant
one must be aware
of sudden change of climate
theyve escaped
no doubt they would have
crossed the frontier by now
jordan killed
one of my men
as his chief
im holding you responsible
but you cant do that
im a british subject
whoever you are
you can be tried as
an accessory to a murder
but how do you know
it jordan
it might be rivera
rivera
that failed man
rivera
mr bryant
please sit down
i might give you
and napier one last chance
please
i want evidence from jordan
that rivera killed my man
i want it clear
do you understand
no doubts about it
i want the world to know
that the poor old refugee
is a common criminal
stabs a young man in the dark
tries to kill a child
that poor child
a terrible story mr bryant
then theyll have
to send him back
no one is going
to protest
or shed tears
in the sports arena
yes you are going to talk
to jordan mr bryant
in that way you might save
your precious plantations
so you are going
on a short journey
youll be ready
in half an hour
and vidal here
will keep you company
remember accidents can
happen even in bareya
tom
well he in a room
just below us
the doctor
on his way
oh good
gosh i hope he going
to be all right
aw
well he safe anyway
yes
but we cant keep him
with us forever can we
no that true
ooh
something got to be
done about this hair
when we get home
would you like it
if i suddenly went blond
when we get home
i got to find a job
something tells me
im not exactly going to get
a letter of congratulations
at napier
another job bitched up is
that what you were gonna say
no
i wasnt going
to say that
turn it off
for god sake
what is it
oh god
what is it
what is it darling
tell me
oh tom
tom
the best
singer the opera
that what he said
he wanted his son to be
showed me a picture
oh
oh
it all over tom
it all over now
oh tom
where the president
no say
where have they
moved him to
no say senor
where is president rivera
he was taken away
in an ambulance
to santa maria hospital
oh
when my wife calls down
tell her ive gone there
yes of course sir
thank you
congratulations on
your journey mr jordan
i hope you wont find
it was a waste of time
just a minute
where are you
taking him
were trying
to treat him
this is a hospital
havent you noticed
not a place for
a political demonstration
are you
another reporter
no i just
brought him here
now just leave him
to us will you
just leave him to us
he was a great man
mr jordan
what did you say
he was a great man
rivera
i never really knew
not that
it will help him
what do you mean
it only a very short flight
from here to tribulacion
but they cant send him back
he is a political refugee
a great embarrassment
to the president of bareya
now mr jordan i represent
news international
perhaps you
would be so kind--
oh jordan
good to see you again
come sit down
there something i want
to talk to you about
you know youve got us
into a pretty bad jab
but quite frankly and
speaking off the record
i must say i feel the sneaky
sort of admiration
i mean i might well
have done the same thing
if i found you dumped
on my doorstep
you might
what do you want
oh it just this
it very simple
keep the local boys happy
and it would help if youd
sign to correct the record
it a mere formality
ah the beautiful
mrs jordan
he wants us
to correct the record
what does it say
oh it just a formality
to save the government face
i suggest we get
this over and go
and have a good lunch
on the company
you must have forgotten
what a good steak looks like
rivera was armed
with a knife
and we clearly saw him approach
lieutenant gomez and kill him
rivera was asleep
look jordan
all they want you
to do is to say
that he did it
simply to clear us
no
so they can
get him back
listen to me
do be sensible
you know bryant
i used to think that
you were just a bowtie
and a big suit
and a fat smile
put on by the wind
but you are worse
you are much worse
why dont you go away
go home
stop trying to get us
to lie about things
that you wouldnt
even understand
mrs jordan
will you help us
youve got
the future to think of
what are you going to do
let him go through the world
throwing away
every job he ever gets
cant you
make him see sense
tom
hed like to see you now
mr jordan and your wife
well
mr jordan
im here
you are both safe
quite safe
remarkable woman
why did you do it
i dont know
honestly
i dont know
because i hate
violence i suppose
because i cant stand the
thought of men getting killed
and now
to save you i
i killed a man
at last you understand
please
please forgive me
for teaching you this
they wont get you back
no
i dont think so
no
jordan
i appeal to your
jordan i appeal to your
loyalty for the last time
all right youre
a great hero arent you
but what
have you got
what exactly
have you got
