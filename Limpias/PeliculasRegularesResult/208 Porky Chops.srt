
the beautiful north woods
rest and relaxation
solid but solid those trees those birds
those peace and quiet
what a vacation spot
flatbush was never like this
nothing to do but sleep
im going to pound my ear for a week
it sends me right down to
my bobby socks
woodpeckers what a cheerful sound
that aint no woodpecker
what gives here
a lumber jackson one of the local yokels
ill fix that icky
you dont have to
fly off the handle like that
this is going to be a tough job
calls for a whole flock of axes
flock of axes this calls for real strategy
this oughta do it
doggone it
hold it stupid
so youre the one behind all this
read fat boy
you vex me you understand
cease that chop-chop chubby
blow joe hit the road
im going to get me a little shuteye
and so are you now scram ham
i guess i fixed that square for fair
paper boy in the sixth
some guys dont never learn
what a charming chapeau
toodle-oo myrtle
doggone squirrel
wait right here pork chop dont go away
bon voyage tubby
i thought youd never get here
which way did they go
they went that-a-way sheriff
you can head them off at the pass
wait a minute
that little doggone
and that is that so to bed
im not so stupid
i see you you little varmint
youre just a bundle of nerves butterball
you need a vacation worse than i do
you rat in squirrel clothing
ill fix you
ill kill two birds with one stone
ill blow up the tree
and get rid of that doggone squirrel too
paper boy in the sixth
