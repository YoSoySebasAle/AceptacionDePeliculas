i cant promise you anything
but let me have your responsibility
my responsibility
you worked so hard
im a simple journalist
youre much more than that
this is weekly work
but to a painting gallery no
a cartoonist is an eye
a jongleur even more
it is our last work for the evening
but we have beaubourg
the crowd
wonderful
you hate the crowd i hate it
im wary of your contempt lionel
you are anti-cartoonist and in eight days you will praise the depth
you admire painters for their depth dont you
when i told you in paris that i hate comics
you have blamed me severely for using a viper language no
youre charming terry
cant you be serious
all these cartoons  france italy belgium
japan  even japan has caught up with america
shit
american culture is dead
our painting is dead our theater our music
our movies are dead
not your movies harry
no one is funding me anymore im dead a walking corpse
why do you think im in france damn it
ive also died
this cartoon is stupid
when i was a kid in arizona it was my passion
not seen for years
nobody is reading it anymore this t
it dead
snoopy that still has a spark of life
why didnt you invite charles schultz
harry take a decision for a comic book between a dog and a cat
would you like me to make a critical distinction
we invited schultz he refused
and will eisner another refuse
and al capp another refuse
it is dead
were all dead old man
this is what they said
in any case he wasnt free
we contacted crumb speigelman and trudeau
nobody
in america was free
let get the hell out too much smoke
i havent breathed fresh air from kennedy airport
dead we are all dead
no  you cant leave
you are joey wellman im gauthier
im fed up
you too  me too come
hepp catt is still spinning
you are so real
you are so good less  american
and final so hidden so cynical
i cant bear any longer your cynicism
you neither also of course
isnt it amazing
your work up to today although you are no longer 20yo
radiates the innocence of the american emigrant
the dreamer those who inspire hope
those who made hollywood
hi harry
christian gauthier  old scoundrel
good morning how are you
how i envy you for being a compatriot of the great joey wellman
do you know each other
of course not
outside their discipline
american artists ignore each other
woody allen doesnt know updike
mailer didnt know pollock
while they were neighbors neighbors
it not-amazing
it your motto isnt it
hello catt this to fatt catt
it-not-amazing enjoyable
harry is the great director a genius like you
who can forget your remakes have it or not
the public enemy and the train will whistle three times
unforgettable
i scrape the base plates
i machine-gun them and then i machine-gun the plate
hollywood vomits me do you know why
because my remakes are better
i havent seen them
of course not
who is less sticking than you artists
your famous individualism the anarchy each for himself
the establishment despises you
and you despise the establishment
it the secret of your genius come
did you understand not a word
but yes you understood
i invite my friends for a drink
no i have to wait for my daughter elsie
my elsie
joey  go ahead ill wait for her
your wife will be waiting for her bring her  her friends too
she isnt my wife
i dont want to
leave you here in all this smoke
go with mr gauthier
ill come with elsie if she comes by
it bothers me to do that this guy has heard of me
i dont know who he is but he someone
he likes what i do
didnt he say i was on the decline
stop it go ahead
he likes what you do im going
bravo  i must say that you did very well
hush
so do you really like what im doing
so do you really like what im doing
have you seen how i live
it hellish
and you will be surprised that i cant work
no one is afraid of me
a man of my status what to do
i dont intimidate anyone sit down
i chase them away they come back
i am rude insulting they come back
how can i work huh
answer my major work remains under construction
forever unfinished
you must be wondering why
answer i am irreplaceable
it is inhuman to be so irreplaceable
it my cross
so you know everything about gauthier
a very sad and very boring intellectual
and you tell me
at what age did you decide to be a great cartoonist
well
i had never stood against her before
no one stood up to my mother
especially not my father  but i left
for the dental school
i had no idea how to get into a newspaper
neither do i can see how to become a cartoonist
thereupon you meet roy crane
he was doing a comic book for a newspaper
you mustnt know him i asked for his advice
le grand roy crane  wash tubbs and captain easy
wash tubbs
im going to talk to you about al capp
i dont care what they say about al
he was a great man
we made our debut together
i was his assistant on lil abner
dont you know
who doesnt know lil abner
just before starting my own comic book
li’l abner
they demolished him the poor man
they were cows with him
but al capp  believe me
al capp was the smartest cartoonist
much smarter than me
as much as you you do understand
lena knew al capp well you didnt like her did you
she didnt come
i loved al and he liked me
my daughter didnt come to the gallery she had an accident

im inventing a letter every 5 days
i make up a letter that im reading to your mother
that what you are making me to do

i cant come
yes  im no longer living with this woman
and you are forcing me to lie to her

so pack your bags bring your passport
i found at twa an adorable and pretty lady
who is speaking english better than me
and who helped me to phone
ill buy her a return ticket
and ill take her with me
because the only good in this country is that you can pay
paris for me is finished without appeal

when you have your crises she ends up reasoning you
i dont think you will reason with me this time
on my kidnapping
i knew you liked me you are crazy
me too but french
my madness it a number
american madness is formidable purely instinctive
you have a lot to teach me
i dont want you lost in my country
i want to come to my country
mother has never seen a crazy american cartoonist
youll be my gift
she old like you and has no friends
but she very very generous
she forgives me for everything even for my americans
it only published in 50 newspapers
fifty it good no
no not really philadelphia is the only major city that is publishing it
in cleveland his hometown we dont publish it
not in cleveland
superman and bob hope were born there
ill never forgive him not in cleveland
in short what he doesnt want to do it i do especially the funds
is joey assistant you i didnt know
we knew each other for long
i was in animation in hollywood
in the cartoons
joey came to the studio for a film on hepp catt
in cartoons
sacrilege no no
take popeye the cartoon killed an awesome creation
oh my god
him who came from so far
for his exhibition
for you  to see you
and you treated him
as you dont treat even your worst enemy
i dont have worse enemy
im still too young
in the meantime ill do the trick
he was never a father to me
he was protective for everyone
for this woman he lives with
but for me never
he is more paternal towards strangers
dont throw the invitation you can change your mind
stop harassing me
hell leave without ever knowing
how much you have changed
without ever knowing how far away cleveland is for you
without ever knowing how much
you parisianized yourself  francized
christian gauthier
christian gauthier
i cant believe it
christian gauthier invited this scribbler
in his country house
pinch me im dreaming
joey wellman
who has only read illustrated books
ronald reagan despite all his faults
narrow-mindedness filthy ignorance repugnant racism
will go down in history
as the greatest president since truman
and truman from lincoln
the american one hundred percent
for me the greatest president
was franklin roosevelt
no wrong
roosevelt was a great actor like reagan
america decline began with roosevelt
roosevelt was a great man
he did nothing for the jews of europe
in france we understand that
roosevelt was a romantic figure like de gaulle
truman was more in the populist vein
man in the street
you know nothing about american politics
truman has done more than roosevelt
i admire your propensity
to be deaf to everything so agree on nothing
i met truman once
president
he had no idea who i was
i thought you were the author of krazy kat
this come-in-the-bacon from truman
so
truman
arrived at this dinner with others
large vegetables and they introduce me
my young friend he said to me
there are too many cats in your illustrations
put a republican mp in your comics instead
for me a republican
it much funnier than a cat
for me a republican is funnier than a cat
it the stroke of the pencil that so striking
for a cartoonist hepp catt of course
vaguely resembles a cat but
does mickey looks like a mouse
donald  to a duck
however a mouse is a mouse
and a duck a duck
i much prefer daffy to donald
disney was a better strike breaker than a designer
no no disney had a tragic vision
dumbo that ridiculous baby-elephant with wings as ears
even you must have loved it
i hate it
and his mother  poor dumbo mom has gone mad
we had to chain it
chain it what about bambi mother
shot down by hunters by cowboys
not by cowboys
dejected
lena worked for disney
im speechless
draw us a bambi
no
but if but no
i never drew bambi  so
lena what let make an effort
sorry i never did that
joey please
joey draw us a bambi
no i dont know
what has he said
he asked me if you could draw miss piggy for us
toddlers lionel and i
we disguised ourselves as comic characters
you were showing off in grotesque disguises
but me no
come on joey
you are dressed up as a pig
slander
next week im getting organized
the immortal motto
i was sure i was sure
lionel
tonight let organize a comic strip ball
in honor of joey huh
what an excruciating idea
elsie
it my little elsie
my daughter  remember
we waited for her in your car
and there she is
excuse me
this is my thesis
we waited for her all night and she was there
joey your life is a real comic
draw me popeye no wimpy
ill pay you with delicacy on tuesday
my burger today
no wimpy it too simple
ill implore you bugs bunny oh yes
lena does this much better than i do
no no well done joey very well
what did your mother say
that youll have to draw her a drawing
every time you come to see her in france
you cant disappoint us
they understand me in paris unimaginable right
there going to be a costume ball in my honor tonight
awesome
no one has ever spoken to me like you
if only i
i didnt have a mother after dad left
she hated me
youre welcome no secrets
i was an orphan
an orphan when you left us
father and daughter so alike
both so sad
i thought you werent
my son brings me all kinds of americans
directors television fantasists philosophers
boredom
what do you want me to do
i must defend myself
christian loves women but
they dont count for him
he doesnt think about it until one or two in the morning
there christian remembers them
but at 8 oclock in the morning
he forgets them all
he only remembers  his books
lena im recognized here
no one has recognized me with us since 96
i have never been considered as an artist
unbelievable right
why do you suddenly need to be an artist
i feel bad with these people
why are you doing this to me
i thought you liked france
have you seen my wife
you tarzan
you jane
the americans never  understood me
im what i am and that all i am
obviously woody allen is taller than bergman
dont be so stupid lionel
it not-amazing
i invite you to my home for an all-duck dinner
youll bring the duck
joey
as a jew are you with woody allen
for a palestinian state
because  im looking for my daughter
have you seen my wife
why do i have to be titi
courage elsie
i dont want to be titi
you have to learn to be strong
but why
if you dont have the strength you have to be ironic
in life you need one or the other
strength or irony
are you strong
or cynicism
strength irony or cynicism
i want to die
the despair
despair will do just as well
excuse me
im looking for my daughter
harry hates the court you get
he a director right
youve never heard of it
oh he would cringe
can you help me
well  make you the big game
harry was highly  listed in france
how does he give to the actors
all these indications
famous men attract me
you have something on your costume
but i have no repairing marks from you
are you very famous
are you a celebrity
or are we just playing the big game for you
i could have loved you you know
i tried
im not even sure i love your father anymore
spielberg doesnt shoot films but comics
it shouldnt bother you
blablabla comics
why ban comics
there is no longer a bit of energy in the american movies
i counted twelve murders
and an ax-fight in your last movie
energy was still flowing there
it does in violence
because there is no other theme
except for the french
france knows each other in love
america knows nothing about that
rape perhaps but not love
you are crazy harry crazy
you americans
you love your deficiencies
the french love those of others
when i want to see a train station i go to the musée dorsay
when i want to see a museum i go to beaubourg
have you seen elsie
after 2 years with the frenchies i know the picture
a third of the day work
another third sleep
and on the last judge others
basic principle with frenchies
be wary of their hugs
fabulous country if you are an artist
but what a band of cow skins
have you seen my wife
where can we find something to drink here
no
elsie
what are you doing here
and you
i was close and
and  the couch
me too
and  something  below  or above
me too
what did they say
didnt you hear
she asked mr gauthier if he likes americans
and he said
he said
that he didnt understand why an american as bad as you
may have been asked to come to france
did he say that
he said he and his friends are making fun of you
they dont like the americans who play to be european
did he say that
no no he didnt say that
what did he say
he said he likes you
it looked good to me
and he said that i am a monster
he didnt say that
yes exactly
and he right doesnt that remind you of anything
at three years old you locked yourself in the entrance hall
and you invented things to scare you
like there now
it not true that exactly what he said
when i found you i was tenderly trying to get you out
but you were dragging me inside with you
we would sit in the dark
and i would tell you stories to reassure you
it not true
and  i remember  i invented
i invented  this little cat for you  sally catt
i was telling you stories of sally catt
and you asked me again and again
you used to be unhappy
and sometimes you didnt say why
but you were taking me to this cubbyhole
and you were telling everything  to sally catt
i dont believe it  it a lie
you have never been nice to me
this is remarkable
it in french
it is still remarkable you are 9 right no
20 out of 20
mr gauthier hasnt read yet my thesis
he wont read it dad
and
oh you are
im your father
have you seen gauthier
have you seen my wife
superb disguise it nothing
adorable this way of responding
to my me tarzan  you jane
what a beautiful night
irresistible the night air
christian my daughter wrote her thesis for you and i told her
delicious child so adoring in front of her father
it normal isnt it
if im lucky enough to have a child
we can dream is not it
joey
i would like
a girl  exactly  like  exactly
go away or ill jump
perhaps there is a simple explanation
to hang on a wall like a human fly
hide and seek
i saw him kissing lena
hold on
you cant leave like this you are always painted
and shit
but what
why is the water not flowing let it be known that you are here
you landed in my bath demanding an explanation
get out
and then basically
come in
i dont take it against lena im blaming myself
since i have been here
im just spades-spades-spades
and im groaning groaning groaning
elsie this elsie that
lena hates elsie normal elsie cant see her
and im beating her ears with my elsie elsie
poor american so sad
i knew i shouldnt have come
all the mistakes ive made in my life
started  when i left the house
because im cooler
