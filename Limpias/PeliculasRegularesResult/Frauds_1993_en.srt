im at the opera house where are you
oh no
no no
surprise
jesus beth cant you take a joke
roland copping yes
oh fine
thank you very much
good bye
judge there no doubt in my mind mrs wheats
that you considered your life to be at risk
and in extreme conditions you acted
with resourcefulness and courage
i only hope that the scars that you and your husband
now possess will heal as quickly as possible
it is my opinion that the deceased was a tragic victim of his own misguided judgement
and it will be my recommendation that no charges
be laid against elizabeth mary wheats
by the department of
public prosecutions
and it is the finding of this inquest that death occurred by accident
you may stand down
jonathan
dont worry ill get it
yes
mrs wheats
yes
roland copping carton insurance
oh yes please
please come in
my husbands out back in the study

do you mind if i uh
hello jonathan wheats
roland copping carton insurance
oh im sorry it the painting
it reminds me of my childhood
would you like to come into the lounge room and we can
certainly absolutely

much time for them myself but emm
they dont really do much do they
they just sort of
stand there
can i get you a drink beer wine
whiskey
coke
i think we can handle that
splendid
smells new
yes it is
well ill try not to take up too much
of your time mr wheats
it about your claims
one for property
damage one for theft
damage one sofa video recorder
cd player lampshades
carpets table two broken cabinets
theft
one set of
solid silver cutlery

thief with taste eh
well that a rare thing these days
so is this the room
where the guy you know got the
yes
mr copping the guy was a really good
friend of ours so id prefer not to discuss
the subject in front of my wife
it been six months and our lives are
just starting to get back to normal so
understood
please
mum the word mum the word
thank you
well
everything seems to be in order
the police have got their hands full of course
trying to trace the missing cutlery
and whoever was driving the getaway car but
to be quite honest i dont reckon there
much chance of you seeing either of them again
which is
a bit of a shame really
would you like to see anything else
no no no ive taken up too much
of your time already mr wheats
ill just get straight home
and start processing the claim
which should take how long mr copping
oh if all goes well maybe two three weeks
so well be seeing you again
most definitely
well would you like my card just in case
no that ok ive got that
of course if youve got any other questions

so let do it with a bang let do something
hed be proud of
for one night in our lives
let think with out dicks

good evening jonathan
hello beth sorry about the hour
i hope im not interrupting anything
no not at all
i actually need to run a few details
pass beth if that all right
at 0 oclock at night
no mr copping to be perfectly
honest that not all right
dont you think business hours would be
a better time to discuss details
i am interrupting something arent i
um well look if you could just
spare me a couple of minutes
i could get rid of these questions and ill
probably be out of your hair for good
i dont think i have anything to say that
i havent said 00 times already
if you have any questions
i suggest you read the police report
i think ill come back tomorrow
that a good idea
oh for god sake
no let just get this over with
thank you
shouldnt be just a couple of minutes
now about this accomplice
when approximately did you hear the
getaway car driving off
i mean what time
i dont remember exactly
it was the neighbor who reported that
i was too busy trying to get to the opera
so well assume whoever this mystery
accomplice was saw you go inside
waited around in the hope that
michael would get wise and come out
heard the first scream and then
just took off
no i recall it took off just
after i entered the front door
i cant tell you the exact time
you do remember now
no i dont remember
so do you recall
i
i dont know why youre
well what do i take as fact beth
recall or remember
did you identify a driver
no mr copping please
oh im sorry
it an old habit i picked up from my father
he was a war hero you know
this was grand-dad
it very old
you see how they shine
it always said that in the right hands
they would become transparent
the numbers would just melt together
they can do wonderful things
mr copping
what are you talking about
my dice
well theyre very nice dice but
i dont see what relevance they have
to your being here
what relevance
to 3 says we continue our discussion now

very well mr wheats i shall return tomorrow
ill make sure im in
now just hold on a minute

i mean it looks like ours
where did you get this
these things turn up
jonathan
well ill leave it with you shall i
till morning when i return for the search

new search beth boring i know
but it is standard
company policy i can assure you

well at least we know what
happened to rosemary baby
what the hell is going on around here
the guy was here to assess the damage
to the tablenot to play yahtzee on it

best friend house and having
just removed the first load of goods

unexpected arrival of the now missing
cutlery owner mrs beth wheats
realizing that the game up
he decides on a bit of fun
so wielding the old
sunday roast carver
he takes the joke a little
bit too far as usual
his reward oh dear
a six inch crossbow bolt
right through the heart
and the mystery accomplice does not
speed off into the night with the goods

roland copping you know the most honest
and unique period of life is childhood
i mean the only way that child is going
to learn that jumping off the monkey bar
is going to hurt him
is by taking the chance and jumping
off the monkey bar
which i suppose makes children
the biggest gamblers of all
still doesnt last forever
kids grow up
dont they

turning up in a pawn shop
as sad as this must be to hear im afraid

to your silverware

impossible to replace
no i mean yes
im not sure
oh my god

at least you dont have to
eat with your fingers anymore
what is the matter with you
are you completely insane

oh the holiday in tahiti the house in the country
but for the moment id be content with the bmw
where jonathan
roland copping
afternoon nurse
hello
excuse me
hello
metthew
beth hi honey
im home did you have a good day
oh yes yes i did two police turned up
with their crossbow
and your silverware was hung
out to dry on a christmas tree
jesus what happened to you
and why werent you at the office
where the hell have you been
ive been on a little field trip
and if i do say so myself i think ive struck gold
everyone got an achilles heel
and roland copping got a whopper
did you hear me
hello
he sent the police over this afternoon
he set us up i almost got arrested
and then i threw up on them
good girl
i should have thought about this earlier
the first day he came in here he gave us
his card which said please call home
he doesnt have an office he only works
from home it was like an invitation and it
there it all there
where the mobile phone
listen to you you sound like a madman
what the hell is going on
i dont have time to explain
ill tell you everything when im set up
jonathan tell me now
i found a hole beth a hole
i went there today to his house
i followed him
there might be a way out there a chance
that we can turn the tables but we have to play him
at his own game
that it isnt it
whether it playing
with toy soldiers
or ripping off insurance companies
it all just a game
yes
but it his game and at
the moment were losing
get out of my way
one elephant two elephants three elephants
stop it
four
ive had enough
i dont want to play anymore
so
what are the options
we can go to the police and maybe
spend what the next 0 years in jail
or we can give him everything and
let him suck us completely dry
or we can fight
we play or we pay
and i can win just 48 hours that all i need
just two days and this whole thing will be over
two days huh
two days to win this one and it will all be over
oh really
and then what what happens next
another insurance claim
or is that too small now
how about insider trading
does that sound attractive
where does it stop jonathan
please
i cant do this on my own
hello roland
jonathan
ive always had a soft spot
for german craftsmanship
fear not shell have a good safe home
oh i took out a cover note this morning
just in case you decided to cancel the insurance
last chance jonathan
roland copping
we have to talk
is that you beth
yes
fine well when would you like to get together
how about tonight
tonight
is that a problem
no
it not a problem
it not a problem at all
see you next year mr copping
i really am very pleased
you came to my party beth
is anybody else coming
no
i know you didnt know it was my birthday
so i dont expect a present
but i would like to give you one
if you really want to give us a present
stop what youre doing
my life is falling apart
my husband thinks it all
some kind of weird game
so here the deal
you can have the house
you can have the car you can have everything
i dont want it anymore
and in return
you let us go
i wish it were that simple
but the choice isnt mine
you know choice is a wonderful thing
but too much of it can lead to hesitation
and he who hesitates
loses his parking space
so you have to find that middle ground
and ive found 6
oh for god sake
cut it out
i cant
well i can
you cant hurt me anymore roland
you cant take anything
more away from me
because i have nothing
left to give you
i dont care what number your
goddamn dice rolls because i
dont give a shit anymore
happy birthday roland
and in a really weird way
thank you
where are you going

before she gets added to one of my collections
she got nothing to do with it roland
leave her out of it

never rides a bike again
very very clever johnny
