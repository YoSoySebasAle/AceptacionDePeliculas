how about felony murder
no drugs right
so no predicate felony
no conspiracy no nothing
no felony no felony
i cant believe this
no felony
how do you spell felony
homicide racketeering drugs
i mean what are we talking about
hey youre lucky
that white girl didnt die
iab is gonna interview
both of you
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks
now off the record
you actually didnt violate procedure
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you
so if you stick together
you should make it through this
youd better get
your story straight too
cause im not going back to far rockaway
because you two fucked up
and youre gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad
and youd better take this shrink seriously
or youll be off active duty
that fucking piece of shit
just walks
knock it off turk
relax partner
he gonna get his
gentlemen your questions
who made the decision to enter
i did
whose decision was it to enter
mine
did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers
yes we did
did you immediately identify yourselves
the informant position
was becoming untenable
we were afraid she was in danger
turns out you were right
no fucking kidding nine-to-fiver
excuse me detective
are you finished with my client
theyre like lennon and mccartney
not an inch of daylight between them
what do you think
nothing there
they endangered the informant
we cant make them wrong on that
they saw a gun they reacted
they beat the fuck
out of the suspect
but he not filing charges
let see what the shrink says
so what are we gonna
do now doc
are we gonna find out
if im sane enough
to carry a gun chase bad guys
okay why did you become a cop
well it was new year eve
it seemed like a good idea at the time
i didnt have the same opportunities
you had dr prosky
where i come from
it was either a gun and a badge
or a hard hat and a hammer
how do you feel
when you fire your weapon
it like dirty harry said
there nothing wrong
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot
and when the wrong people
get shot
it sucks but id rather be in it
that out of it
there nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench
how do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed
you know
i sort of get numb to it
here
i want you to take this
use it to jot down your thoughts
your questions
anything you may have noticed
about yourself
whatever
i wont ask for it
just for you
i want you to try it
sounds like fun
harder
go turk go
you got third
go go
yeah
look at that
you own it you own it
no matter what they say
about you
youre tremendous
go go turk go
safe
you dropped the ball
a fucking cheap shot man
get away from the bag
or what or what or what
watch the bag
the nypd is bubbling
with frustration
hostility and testosterone
ready to erupt at any moment
think of me
as the release valve
one flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down
you know why you join the force
to get respect
most people respect the badge
everybody respects the gun
hey riley i was talking to jo
you guys caught a stiff named
phillip trager a gun-runner
oh yeah a real piece of shit
how did that go down
i dont know
somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine i guess
walked right into his apartment
killed him with one of his own guns
did the shooter leave a note
or anything
yeah actually
the shooter left a poem
he did
no shit
yeah hey simon
you remember that poem
from the trager case
what are you doing man
turk asking about it
what the hell are you doing
no le digas mierda a eso loco
calmate he wants to hear
about the poem
merchant of thieving class
i slit his throat
and capped his ass
i took his gun i took his
i took his life i took his gun
but too bad he not the only one
that how it goes
something like that
it not iambic pentameter
but it rhymes
rooster
yo
were looking for the same guy
he knocked off a pimp named rambo
a few weeks ago when was yours
last week were running ours with the atf
because of the guns
were back in business on the rambo case
looks like the same guy knocked off
a gun dealer on the three-three last week
no shit
what do you mean that our case
that our case youre taking our case
seniority guys
tag along youll learn something
oh tell me the guy name
is greg brady
please it is isnt it
oh somebody knocking off
the brady bunch
gotta be the partridge family
trager
a gun-runner bites the dust
number
the bullet matched the45
in trager apartment
that was no surprise
so i ran it through atf
it one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop
in virginia last month
yeah probably by trager
that what they think
he matches the description they have
it still doesnt help us find the guy
it just helps us tie him to the victims
which he already doing
with his little fucking poems
excuse me hello
hey turk dont forget
we got a court date later
so
i heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down
spider
so
did he
yeah he got him
down on the ground
the guy was handcuffed
and he just started
kicking him in the gut
and then
he gets down on the guy chest
and he really starts smacking him
hard in the face over and over
and screaming at the top
of his lungs
im gonna break
your fucking face
you little bitch
then his eyes really started
to fill up
i mean they get dark
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him
i thought he was gonna
kill this guy
really
youre a bad little girl
i got work to do
you bet
counselor
my hands are tied here
without a secure
chain of custody
any evidence obtained
after the initial search
must be excluded
you gotta be fucking kidding me
therefore i am forced
to grant defense
motion to dismiss all charges
of rape and assault
against mr van luytens
your honor
you think i want this guy
going anywhere near my daughter
or anyone daughter
for that matter
you messed up
i am unleashing your client
unto the world
im sure well all be
back here again very soon
look at him
look at this motherfucker
hey it gonna come back to you mutt
youre gonna get it
when you walk outside watch your back
easy turk
order in my court

not here not now
not here not now
will you get him out of here
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you cant appeal
order
you know what i mean go go
order detective
dr prosky suggested
that i free-associate
so here i go
you know what i think about
when i pull a trigger
i think about the infield fly rule
i love that fucking rule
it assumes the worst in everybody
it says sorry batter youre a schmuck
for popping up with runners on
and you stupid-ass infielder
you dont get to cheat
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break
my favorite part
the batter out
but the runners advance
at their own risk
well isnt this
a pleasant surprise
that the way life should be
you can be a motherfucker
at your own risk
or not
van luytens one less rapist
who gonna miss him
nobody
number 2 and counting
hot coffee
good morning detective riley
hey good morning
door on your left
any signs of forced entry
doesnt look like it
detective perez is in there
he in there already
all right
hey how about those mets last night
yeah how about em
hey teddy teddy come here
check this out
wow
fuck
oh my god
that big
and powerful
what a plasma screen
lcd
that plasma
no it got to be lcd
it wouldnt be that big
hey guys guys
he was shot at close range
dropped right here
the pussy doesnt look like he put up
much of a fight does he karen
nothing to indicate that
in terms of struggle
no forced entry cuts bruises
hey nobody wants to hear
about your private life officer corelli
that detective to you
officer needledick
looks like it our guy again
who did you get this time
this is jonathan van luytens
he owns a couple
of car dealerships
oh shit
he was up on rape charges
but they got tossed out
last week
look at this
a man devoid of all respect
of beauty charm or intellect
he took what women
would not give
he didnt have
the right to live
that our boy all right
looks like he had a beef
with our old pal johnny
you know him
yeah
he one slippery
son of a bitch let me tell you
yeah
you guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer
you got a point here lieutenant
the point is
youd better both
think seriously
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case
you dont think
were up to this
come on you got what
about 0 years on the job
between the two of you
im telling you you screw it up
badly enough
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension
you want to risk that
yeah
fuck yeah
406 lieutenant 406
okay 406
what does that mean
ted williams
ted williams the last day of the season
is batting 400
sox manager wants to bench him
protect his average right
williams plays
both games anyway
goes six for eight
ends up at 406
the last guy that ever hit
over 400
okay fine it all yours
just dont go moaning to me
when some traffic cop
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding
and he grabs your
5 minutes of fame and you realize
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you
and it would have taken you
000 light years to nail him
not for nothing lieutenant
light years measures distance
not time
well thank you detective
ill make a note of that
ellis lynde 2003
this guy had a history
of cruising gay bars
picking up twinkies
beating the shit out of them
lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment
whoever doing this
gets up real close to the guys
blows their brains out
without any trouble
leaves no fingerprints
and obviously
takes pride in his work
okay what could be
murder number two back from 04
one matthew mitrella
i was shaking
the first couple of times
i killed in cold blood
i kept thinking if i got caught
theyd kick me off the force
i wasnt worried about prison
but losing the gun and the shield
that scared me
i went into work the next day
expecting to feel different
i thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians
and know which ones are dirty
but they didnt
that when i knew
i could keep on
doing this forever
so next stop spider
if we shut down his business
maybe hed be a rat
we got a lawyer
we needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him
she was a good lawyer
me and my partner paid a visit
to club 404 of harlem
a word about him
tom cowen been my partner
for almost 30 years
he the best cop
ive ever seen
im always the one
following him through the door
there a bullet
that was meant for me
that lodged in his torso
he was my role model
the day i stopped
trying to be tom cowen
was the greatest day of my life
hey rooster
i was going through the files
on poetry boy
that an interesting way
to pass your time
okay there was a gun
found on charles randall
when he was arrested
yeah
now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene
but there are a lot of similarities
so i mentioned it to perez and riley
i think somebody should go
interview him in prison
i think there may be a connection
that a good idea
but not perez and riley
i mean not those guys
theyll screw it up
this is too important
turk and i will handle randall okay
good work
detectives charles randall
what the fuck
do you two scumbags want
what a greeting
you like poetry chuck
what
do you like poetry
yeah
roses are red violets are blue
i want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick you fuck
how that
i thought youd rhyme
you didnt
fuck you
fuck both of you
get me out of here
why the fuck did we even bother
going out there
what would it look like
if we didnt go
are you gonna relax
relax
yeah ill just take it out
on karen later
the more im with her
the more abuse she wants
sounds like fun
hey you want to take her
off my hands
be careful partner because i have
a very special effect on women
go wild
whatever
i cant believe i had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot
eh fuck him

im sorry partner
im really sorry
stop worrying about it
whatever happens
im not taking you down with me
dont worry about me
im all right believe me
i dont know what i was thinking
i just dont know what i was thinking
you know what you was thinking
you were thinking
about a 0-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed
yeah i tried to stop you
but you know what
i admired you that day
what you did
that was righteous
and you dont second-guess yourself
on something like that
okay im the killer

or your car window
and for some reason
you open your door
you roll down
your car window for me
so who am i
someone i know
maybe a nice set of tits
and the poems
what about the poems
you have to compose the poem
before you got there right
otherwise what youre gonna
blow out the guy brains
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself
no prints on the poems
so probably
i wore gloves when i wrote it
you obviously know your victims
between that and the easy access
i guess that they know you too
they must
these guys are all scumbags
theyre not gonna trust anyone
open the door for anyone
especially if they dont know them
yeah but i more than know them
i know everything about them
i know their moves
their patterns
i know their schedules
okay so youre following them
youre staking them out
anyone gonna say it

brought some justice down
on that dickless little fuck
now that is who id like to meet

i dont know if i believe this
but im just gonna
throw it out there
you guys say were looking
for one of our own
but what if it was an ex-cop
somebody with an ax to grind
you got one in mind
he thinking about martin baum
our old lieutenant
so what the story with him
he got fired a few years ago
im not saying there any motive
but he knew all the victims
yeah but turk
i knew most of those guys
so did you riley perez
even karen knew em
im just throwing it out there
well maybe you killed em
yeah maybe i did
the poems and the placement
of the weapons
are all weve got
linking the kills
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics
that shouldnt be
too much of a problem
we already got the girl
working on that
that right karen been
humping on it all week as we speak
what did you say
here we go again
you should watch your mouth
oh yeah
he didnt mean anything by it
karen and him are ancient history
college boy cant speak for himself
yeah i can speak for myself
let me speak for myself
fuck you turk
mutt im gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell
im not better than you
youre not better than me man
you put your balls
in your pocket
and you fellow officers
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional you know
please are we gonna move on
here now
what are we doing
where were we
talking about martin baum
what his story
some guys under him
got caught taking money
baum stood up for them
tried to cover it up
he do time
well they pressed charges
but he plead out and resigned
so what his beef with you
i could have lied to protect him
but i didnt
okay but if he got a beef with you
why not go after you
why not kill you why go around
acting like a serial killer
killing all these degenerates
it doesnt make any sense
im just telling you
im telling you it doesnt make sense
im throwing it out there
im saying this is what it is
you want to check him out or not
i dont give a shit
it doesnt make any sense
youre the ones that think it a cop
im just saying here a cop
with a chip on his shoulder
check him out if you want
i dont give a shit
calm down and give a better reason
why baum could be a suspect okay
pms gotta be

why do you think
turk was so quick to take the lead
on the poetry case huh
to keep us from finding the killer man
that what i would do
if i was covering my tracks
he sticks us on this baum stakeout
cause it more misdirection
makes sense
i hate that turk man
hey he coming out
he coming out
oh at 245 in the morning

or is he just killing time
come on baum

in the diamond district
so you figure it a cop
doing the poetry killings

that what passes
for police work these days
do you think you got a raw deal
damn straight
life sucks
yeah
everything okay simon
teddy where the fuck were you man
anything else you want to tell us
lieutenant baum
i got something for you in my pocket
huh
a passport credit card receipts
boarding passes
the day brady was killed
i was escorting a client
to brazil
judgment is
the dominion of the lord
and if this person
this worthless rapist
or murderer
as you describe him
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution
it must be granted to him
your name doesnt ring a bell
but ive had so many
altar boys over the years
so many altar boys
that it hard to remember
their names
my name is david fisk
detective first grade
you may not remember me now
but i guarantee youll remember my name
for the rest of your life
father connell
may he rot in hell
3 down one to go
white underwear below the knee
briefs-style
large tweezers
i am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag
ill be right back
all right
hey it another one
handwritten
the old man
who the children trust
unable to control his lust
ashes to ashes dust to dust
the church cant stop him
someone must
ill see what else i can find
what the matter with you
father connell gave me
my first communion
back in bensonhurst
hey guys
sorry we didnt get a chance to call
yeah i bet you are
go over there take a look around
well compare notes later okay
looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest
left him with his pants down
come on
no look
come on dont talk like that
hey look for yourself
have a little respect
next thing theyre gonna tell us
lieutenant baum was an altar boy here
tell me about it
these two guys fucking stink
look doctor
you read the poems
it is possible right
that this guy is a cop
ive never seen it
ive never even heard
about a cop serial killer
come on girls
let go let go
yeah go go go go go
go go go go
safe
doc give us a tip
how are we gonna catch this guy
you dont have to worry
about that
he wants to get caught
you dont have any better place
to have lunch
i wanted to thank you
what about spider
yeah
and for looking in on me
at the hospital
and the encouragement
why would he want that
after a while
getting away with it isnt enough
so is your daughter on the team
no she used to play
but now she 25 living in california
five years sober
and working as a nurse
and her mother
her mother died
when she was very young
he wants everybody to know
that he got away with it
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is
most of these killings were criminals
in rooster and his beat right
and then he all but threatens
to kill van luytens
in front of hundreds of witnesses
and then he sends us
on this crazy wild goose chase
after lieutenant baum didnt he
yes he did
why would he do that why
you gotta show me more than that
so far you got shit
give him more man
you want more
how about the church records
the very ones that turk was
so diligently pursuing
how about that
it turns out our most recent victim
the late father connell
was moved all over the place
eight parishes in 20 years
why would they do that
with a catholic priest it obvious
he giving the children
more than communion behind the altar
now turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child
it very plausible
this priest
this father connell
he gave you your first
holy communion eh
he did
did he every try to do
anything inappropriate i mean
i know what you mean
no never
okay fine
is there any reason
why somebody out there
might think that he did
no
am i a suspect here lieutenant
no
but these bodies
are starting to smell
a lot of it is drifting
in your direction
drifting or being pushed
what can i say
you got connections
to most of these victims
youre not exactly
mother teresa
i never had any problem
with that priest
okay okay fine
that settles it
i had a talk with riley and perez
good cops
dont fuck around okay
just listen
im listening
they think
turk might be our guy
oh man i gotta tell you
from where im sitting
that is so fucking funny
you cant take that seriously
everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact
that were chasing one of our own
but it aint turk
sure as im sitting here
he aint the guy
you know that
yes i do
how do you know that
because i know it
i know it to a moral certainty
okay
this priest
this father connell
he was turk priest
when he was a kid
he told you that
he didnt tell me this priest
was a child molester
i cant believe this bullshit
believe it all right
turk a good guy
you understand
he the best cop you got
dont you tell me what i gotta do
dont you say a goddamn word
to him about this either
or youre finished
can i speak now
feel free
he cares
you know what im saying
turk cares about people
i know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes
it doesnt matter
he cares about protecting people
and if you dont back him
you will regret it
jesus
sorry
i just never rattled
anyone cage before
got a minute
yeah what up
you know me and turk
are buddies right
of course
id do anything for him
he would do anything for you
would you
would i what
would you do anything for him
i dont know
where is this going
he wants you
to have sex with me
really
he wouldnt mind
but that not why im here
okay why are you here
where were you
the night rambo was killed
and trager
got an alibi for those nights

and told me you loved me
in that time
ive killed 4 people
but i guarantee
youre gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life
you dont become a cop
because you want to serve and protect
you join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge
most people respect the badge
