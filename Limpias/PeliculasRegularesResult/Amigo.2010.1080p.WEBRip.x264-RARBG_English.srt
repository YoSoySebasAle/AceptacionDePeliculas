great severity
in that martial law
may be exercised in regions
where actual hostilities exist
men who commit hostilities
with intermitting returns
to their homes and avocations
divesting themselves of the
character and appearance of soldiers
shall be treated
not as combatants
but as bandits
and murderers
guides when it is proved that
they have misled intentionally
and those disguised in the civilian dress of the country
but employed in obtaining
information for the enemy
shall be treated as spies
and suffer death by hanging

he wont find out will he
the amigo did lead us
into an ambush sir
maybe
they cant beat us
i dont know
why they even bother
it their country sir
lieutenant i must inform you
that i must leave this place
above all things
i am a spaniard
living under the rule
of others--
before you leave
throw on your ceremonial gear
and do what youre supposed
to for the amigo
this one head man now
tell him to watch his step
i thought id
catch you sleeping
and i thought youd be back
in the states by now
oh they say im cured
cured from the clap
that a bigger long shot
than us catching aguinaldo
youre shittin me
it just came in
on the wire from manila
they nailed aggy
hot damn
ho ho ho
yeah and he asked our little
brown brothers to give up the game
macarthur ordered
general amnesty
lettin prisoners
go left and right
any insurrecto that wants
to throw in the towel
gets 30 pesos mexican
for his rifle
they can have mine
we gotta celebrate
here we go
champagne glass
right here
oh yeah
i stretched a couple apaches back in the territory
they consider it a
particularly
ignoble death
it makes an impression
on the others
with this bunch
who knows
all right
let get this show on the road
military necessity admits
of all direct destruction
of life or limb
of armed enemies however
men who take up arms
against one another
do not cease
to be moral beings
responsible to one another
and to god
war admits of deception
but disclaims acts of perfidy
and as civil officers of
the hostile occupied country
owe strict obedience
to the victorious government
at peril of their lives
it has been judged
that rafael dacanay
head man of
the barrio of san isidro
shall hang by the neck
until he is dead
you think
this is a shithole
you ought to see
san isidro
they had a smoker
the other day
was anyone killed
a couple on both sides
you know who got it
they didnt send names
there some googoo
theyre gonna stretch
course then this message came in--
damn id better send
along the happy news
well that what i call
cuttin it close
aah
i was just part
of the crowd sir
i didnt tie the rope
sign or make your mark
right here
yeah all right
give him some money
come on
sign or make your mark
right here
this thing can still shoot
well then this is
your lucky day amigo
