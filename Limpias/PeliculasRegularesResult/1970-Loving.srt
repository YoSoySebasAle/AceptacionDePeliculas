yes but it was
a joke
yeah well wait
til you meet him
youll understand
frankly i dont like drawings
my daughter draws
photographs
on the other hand
tell the whole story
and no mistakes
for example i know
it a small point
but it happens
to irritate me
we sell heavy-duty
trucks
to hard-headed
engineering-minded
cost-conscious
businessmen
why you fellas find it
necessary
to put half-naked girls
in our advertisements
isit beyond me
mr lepridon we could
take the girls out
look ill stay with him
ill call you later
i tell you
we built things
that people said
couldnt be done
except
at financial loss
so we went ahead
and built them anyway
well everything seems
to be coming along just fine
of course i really dont know
what the hell it is
im looking at
i guess you might say
the only thing i know is trucks
but i know
i like that bridge out there
that brooklyn bridge
if they ever condemn that
why im going to buy it
have it transported
to indiana by truck
laughs

we can move in
skip here tells me
that you went out
to our plant in indiana
at your own expense
that right sir
what did you think
i was impressed sir
i was very
impressed
and how so
i love trucks
you know i should think
that an artist
would find trucks uh
pedestrian
well that may be true
for most artists sir
but i was a trucker
long before i was an artist
you know you
you dont look
exactly like an artist
