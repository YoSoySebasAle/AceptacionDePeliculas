when isaac

god commanded abraham
to take his son up to mount moriah

sets an example for these children
im sorry
children christopher going

i know
god he was pissed when he found out
about us
how so
he just was

i said he was a homophobe
and you said you knew
we found an arrest on his record

a few years ago he and a friend of his
were caught vandalizing a man home
a gay man
yes
he said that they had been harassing him
for weeks
hmm and what happened

it trey and robbie
theyre like my boys
you have a close relationship with them
lady you have kids
i have one
and you dont know that i would do
anything for them
hey
hey honey
im sorry that ive been such an ass
about the whole wedding thing
i dont know what the matter with me
i know it important to you
i know
and you know what
i do want to start a family
and i swear that i wont be so uptight
from now on
that alone should be worth
waking up for right
for those of you who dont know
trey mccoy was attacked a few days ago
and is recovering in hospital
ive spoken to his dad
and he wants you all to know how much
he and his family greatly appreciate
the support
theyve received from all of you
i would ask that you continue
to keep trey in your prayers and thoughts
while he in recovery
we will begin today service with a prayer
father we ask that we may find comfort
in every sorrow and may see
our way through darkness into light
sin is the ruin and misery
of the human soul
it is destructive in its nature
and god has declared
through many scriptures
that he will punish the unrepentant sinner
and they should be cast down
into the fires of hell
because they not only hate god
they shame him and they do not fear him
god is love
and religion is the law of love
when a soul
becomes filled with the love of god
with a desire for all that is good
it become possessed
of a new hold on existence
there are dark clouds of god wrath
hanging directly over your heads
full of the dreadful storm
and the screaming of thunder
and were it not for god restraining hand
it would immediately burst forth upon you
you are in god hands
and it is uncertain what he will do with you
no situation in life is hopeless
winter has its bright spots
sickness its comforts
and the sharpest affliction some solace
where there is nothing else there is hope
whatever is good is given to all
the sun shines for all
let us not forget what god explicitly tells us
and that is to love thy neighbor as thyself
sinners you have despised
the mighty power of god
consider the danger that you are in
it is a great furnace
a wide and bottomless pit
full of fire and brimstone
that you are held over
trust in the good of mankind
and in the beauty of god
the wrath of god
acceptance
abomination
god is love
and he will punish you
trey trey trey
help somebody help please
trey oh please
i need assistance over here in 2
please

what did he do
well first off he liked to beat
the shit out of me
oh honey
but i didnt know it till after
i married the son of a bitch
but the point is
do you think that the law was there
to protect me
do you
because you think again
i had to protect myself from him and the law
now you listen to me robbie

i said get out man
dont you want more of us to beat to death
you stay away from me
youre not gonna get away with it
now im warning you
or what
you leave me alone
let me ask you a question
did god tell you to do it huh
did it make you feel powerful
does your god approve of murder
let me ask you a
question did god tell you to do it huh
did it make you feel powerful
does your god approve of murder
what do you think
nothing physical linking boyd
there has to be something
besides the strong circumstantial evidence
yeah i think youre missing
the obvious here fisher
mr levinson
yes
sergeant esposito dallas homicide
is there any news
may i come in
i dont understand why
this is taking so long
it seems like you guys
are dragging your feet
is that so
i noticed in the original report
that you and mr mccoy had an argument
just before the incident
what are you talking about
i just wanna know what happened
we had a disagreement
what about
why does that matter
did you two fight a lot
no
what do all these questions have to do
with my next door neighbor
well your neighbor tells me he saw
you and mr mccoy fight quite a bit
and you believe him
he also tells me youve been harassing him
he killed my partner
he and two other people
say he couldnt have
theyre lying
well why would a respected pastor
a man of god lie to the police
to protect his son
a word of advice stay away from chris boyd
he been arrested for gay-bashing
for christ sake
all i know is what the evidence tells me
and your fingerprints were the only ones
on that bat
i explained that
mr levinson you want to tell me
about the life insurance policy
we both had one on each other
did you kill your boyfriend
this isnt happening
it a simple question
get out of my house
and gave us the day and the night
and god made the sky above
and god made the water below
where chris boyd
check the activity room
youre interrupting a meeting
what did you tell them
back off
youre a liar
back off
yes we need help
what going on here
kathleen call stella
where you taking him and why
well well well ms slansky
nice to see you again kathleen
mr esposito
committing another act of justice i see
now i figured id run into you
again eventually
now you stay on the right side
of the law this time
otherwise ill be taking you down too
your boy here been arrested for assault
you leave him alone you mother
she been coaching you son
what are you doing
sit down
i dont want to sit
close the door and sit down
you could have told me
that you were questioning robbie levinson
as a suspect
when youve been doing this as long as
i have
he didnt do it
are you familiar with this case
you mean my case yeah im familiar with it
well then you know that his fingerprints
are all over the murder weapon
which just happened to belong to the victim
he was covered in the victim blood
and to top it all off he about to collect
half a million dollars in life insurance
i mean what am i missing here
the whole goddamn story and chris boyd
oh yes right chris boyd is lying
show me the proof
kathleen slansky statement
oh come on
about that
you do me a favor
you ask that old broad about her husband
her dead husband
i mean look at the facts fisher
you cannot just ignore boyd past
oh all too convenient for levinson
wouldnt you think
just because a man has had run-ins
with homos
homosexuals doesnt mean he a killer
yeah well neither does being a homo
look it looks like
an open and shut case to me
ive already talked to the da about
making a case
you did what
you are not going to just shut me out of this
this is homicide fisher
stick to something you can handle
robbie what is wrong with you
theyre putting a restraining order
out on me
what
yeah to stay away from him
i should have seen this coming
this isnt like you
hey promise me
you wont do something like this again
he lying to the police
robbie
hey you should get some rest
im fine
fine you havent slept for days
you noticed
im sorry
i cant sleep
im not like you
i cant pretend that everything

you never talk to me about your hurt
you never say anything to me
at least when you were a mean drunk you
you told me how you were feeling

christopher
chris
is that you i thought i heard you come in
is something wrong
why do you put up with him
what are you talking about
you shouldve gotten out
when you had the chance
chris arent you staying for supper
he that is joined unto the lord
is one spirit
flee fornication
every sin that a man doeth
is without the body
but he that commits fornication
sins against his own body
know ye not that your body is the temple
of the holy ghost which is in you
what shall we say then
shall we continue in sin
that grace may abound god forbid
for in that he died
he died unto sin once
but in that he lives
he lives unto god
let not sin therefore reign
in your mortal body
that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
that the body of sin might be destroyed
and we should not serve sin
for he that is dead
is freed from sin
in the name
of god it has got to stop
and if somebody doesnt do something
this plague is going to infest
the entire country
come back to god son
youre sick

wouldnt you do it with a fully-loaded gun
just to be on the safe side
ive never gone out to shoot to kill someone
