challenging
actually im thinking
about giving it up
the racket getting to me
i was working with patients
whod undergone severe trauma
to the patella
here in the front of the brain
you get whacked there
you start going in circles
lose all sense of direction

in people magazine
you did the pressure
started getting to me
my hands started shaking
dropping scalpels everywhere
somebody pulling our leg

tourism is
the biggest stuff there is
folks getting knifed
in the french quarter
annoys the hell out of
the tourist commission
there was an attempted
mugging this evening
really
-the victim got away
-oh good
-you know nothing about that
-no
you match the description
of the intended victim--
a man with a baby stroller
a bag lady says she saw
the man enter this hotel
the desk clerk
says that man was you
certainly narrows it down
doesnt it
mr blue were you involved
in an attempted mugging
no ted i dont think so
would you mind
calling me lieutenant
ms blue
would you care
to make any comment
not at this precise time

of chapter two
in which jeff and jane
lead a sane life
i dont think
it fair or nice of you
to complain about me

there was a zero risk factor
three guys
running out of a bank
packing heat
probably stoned
people in a hurry

ahead of the firing squad
-she in new orleans
-we think so
she got men planted
in labs and factories
all over the south
industrial theft
steals weapons
chemicals sells them
so you got to find her
and send her back
-there no extradition
-has to go voluntarily
and you think
foster worked for novacek
he was the middleman
that funnelled stuff to her
and through him
well find the big guys
so we have
to find the middleman
there you go janie
dont squirt daddy
