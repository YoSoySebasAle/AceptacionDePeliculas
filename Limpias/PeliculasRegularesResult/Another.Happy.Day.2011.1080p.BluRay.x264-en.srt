if the dog could see his outfit
hed fucking immolate himself
my mom designed that outfit
she opened up a business
well that what she said
i think it a good idea
trying to be supportive
oh this poor dog
that fucking fashion
it a dog man that abusive
that what ive always
said about lynn
she has to make
everything about her
and her family and her
problems and their issues
it not about her
it about dylan
it his wedding
he wants her at the wedding right
he wants alice at the wedding
and she has her therapist
so she can talk to paul
i mean who goes to a therapist
to talk to their ex-husband
i dont know why you ask me
these kinds of questions
well cause elliot
doctors just wanted
no there isnt
so nobody in your family
had any history of depression
or obsessive
compulsive disorder
no no
severe an
well whered he come from mom
the planet mars

didnt he drink heavily
well yeah

he um you know he
what
he shot himself
he shot himself
yeah
well id say that something
it was a different time lynn
it was during the depression
a lot of people shot themselves
you know i wasnt
crazy about sweden
i mean it was
it was freezing
really even in june
yeah you know maybe it was
just my preconceived
notions of sweden
pro probably
it probably just
psychosomatic
i have anxiety
careful
im on medication
well we all know that
limited spectrum of our
intellect and what we are
our ancestors struggled
and fought and died
oh no fucking way
it gonna be weird like
meeting mom ex-husband
i guess so
ive never even like
seen a picture of him before
i did
well what he look like
kind of generic
know who he looked like
he looked like tj
our old babysitter
but didnt paul used to be
like physically abusive

dr marcus said to
why would there be a fight
it just going
to be me and paul

dad genes you know
but then alice is
also fucked up so
dont cuss ben
sorry i wont but like
the only one who
is normal is dylan
and you didnt raise
him like at all

only common denominator

okay sorry
hello lynn im dr stanwyck
it nice to meet you
come on in
thanks
hello lynn
hey
you look great
thank you
hi lynn
hi i didnt realize that
of course dont be silly
why wouldnt i be here
you did say that this
was a family crisis
yeah i told paul
it was pressing
exactly
let all sit down
so as lynn explained
to me over the phone
your son dylan
our son our son
right right i understand
dylan and alice are the
children you and paul had lynn
now dylan has asked alice
to be the maid of honor
at his wedding sunday
is that right so far
yes
that right that right
and um alice
it not a very easy time
for her right now
so i was thinking that
itd be a good idea
if paul and i could um
talk through some issues
before she came down on friday
daddy
daddy
where are you
how is any of this my fault
i havent seen or spoken
to my daughter in 7 years
and i have no clue as to why
it not what i wanted
no it what alice wanted
is that really what alice wanted
or is that what you wanted
you havent made any effort
to make it any better over last 7 years
if that even the truth
then i will ask alice
to explain it to me
because i wanna start
resolving this once and for all
and put it behind us
no that is exactly what im
trying to get you not to do
lynn
not speak with his daughter
is this some sort of scheme
to get me down here to tell me
that i cant speak to my own
daughter at my son wedding
maybe this isnt for you
to decide anymore
maybe that what
youre afraid of
i mean alice is old enough
to decide herself
that right
this is between me
and alice lynn
it doesnt concern you
patty seriously
this has absolutely nothing
to do with you
i think this has everything
to do with me
i am her stepmother
how could you be her stepmother
when she doesnt even
consider him her father
well he is
no he isnt
yes he is
yes i am
no youre not
being a father entails
certain responsibilities
yeah so does being a mother
okay everybody look
i understand this is an
emotionally charged issue
but let try to stay
on course here
i dont think lynn means to say
that what alice is going through
is your fault paul
fine
but i should be able
to talk to my daughter
yes you should
about whatever
going on in her life
if my daughter is going through
some sort of self-destructive
phase then i want to he
wait what what
you think this is a phase
that not what he said
that exactly what he said
it not what he meant
im just trying
to protect my daughter
from who
from what
from you
what did he
i just explained it to you
you just so enjoy trying
to tear this family apart
isnt that what
this is all about
so that his story now
is that the story you tell
everybody paul
that i wanted to leave
alone with my daughter
and not raise my son
is that what you told her when
you were crying on her shoulder
did you leave out the part
where you said go lynn go
go and take alice
but if you take dylan
ill take both your kids
what else did you leave out
all i know is that
i love my daughter
and apparently
she doesnt know that lynn
and i dont understand it
i dont understand that
i dont give a fuck
what you understand
because what i know
is that my daughter
has been silently slicing
at her arms and legs
with a straight-edged
razor for six years
a straight-edged razor
now what dont you understand
you solipsistic fuck
daddy
daddy
scared
daddy
oh daddy oh my god
daddy
what the hell are
you doing out here
dont say that word
third time in a month
i just cant take it anymore
are you filming this
um
oh
youre treating me
like an animal
well that what going on
it either this daddy
or the old folks home
you make the choice okay
okay boys lift it
im not an animal
she running a little late
i hope youre ready because
we have so much planned
brandon how you doing buddy
heather looks beautiful
she lost a lot of weight
yeah she looks great
i saw paul today
dad told me howd it go
oh it went very well
i think were really
making progress
yeah really
well doesnt he look wonderful
how long has it been
since youve seen him
six months
four months
six months well
im glad that at least you have
this little bit of time
to spend with your mother
shit
patty keeps asking me if im
gonna walk her to her seat
oh absolutely
i understand completely
are you kidding me
youre my mother
ugh i bet she has something
ridiculous like a vibrator
on the bed or something
ridiculous she disgusting
listen listen
so i open the bathroom door
and i find elliot in the buff
completely naked
putting on lynn lipstick
hey what up
just bonding with family
but theyre all over there
yes ben i realize that
thank you
so uh whatre you doing then
nothing ben
im doing absolutely nothing
does everyone seem
happy out there

um the grass

overgrown to you
no not at all
landscapers do a great job
you dont have to
worry about that
it my property
i feel like i should be
taking care of it myself
yeah but it a good thing
that you dont have to right
you know that elliot hasnt
even said a word to me

didnt even say hello
you know elliot

you got all the money
in the world
and he goes to all
the best schools
he gets thrown out
of the best schools dad
you guys are just too
lenient with him
you dont discipline him enough
he has to have
some consequences
okay we do discipline him
elliot has a chemical imbalance
in his brain
it real
he has depression
obsessive compulsive disorder
he has tourette
syndrome for god sake
he suffers from severe anxiety
and he has difficulty
managing his emotions

oh my bad my bad
not cool
yo whered that
nigga elliot go
it just so scary
doesnt it scare you
are you even aware of it
when it happening
yeah but it like
it like this
switch gets flipped
and something snaps
inside of me and l
and
well where does it come from
because your reactions
to things are so extreme
it just not normal
it like
the moment i get here
im forced to lie
lie about being
in fucking sweden
and you know
trying to hide the fact
that i have fucking issues
so you cant
you cant escape
i know
like they only see you
in these stages
these intermittent
stages of your life
which are usually embarrassing
because growing up
fucking sucks
they just cling on to them
and bring them up
whenever youre around
that because
that all they have
they dont know you elliot
so it just like the only
thing that ties us together
are these horrible fucking
moments of our lives
i mean shit you wish had
never happened
it like everything
youre trying to avoid
you dont want alice
to come here
and deal with all the traumatic
shit of her childhood
and youre trying
to explain to them
that this could be really
fucking detrimental
but they dont understand
they never will
so you drive yourself crazy
alice cuts herself and i just
turn into fucking glenn beck
so
are you gonna tell
dad about this
yeah i have to
it exactly where
it supposed to be
im lynn hellman
uh hi foreman fred
may i help you with anything
well not unless
you have a solution
on how to get a twelve foot
stake into the ground
without damaging
the irrigation system
did you just wake up
no
you know i was just thinking
that maybe the tent
wasnt in the right position
that maybe if we move it
and if you face it this way
we lynn um spent a lot of
time with dylan and heather
going over all this
im sure they wouldve
appreciated your input
about a month ago
but irregardless
i think that fred and ive
got it covered dont we
we certainly do
of course i have taken
orders from this little lady
for how many years
5 years
oh jesus

you on the other hand
you havent aged a day
well you know im not gonna
ever let you see me
without my full fluff and fold
and a mighty fine
fluff and fold it is
oh you you are a sweetheart
youre gonna get me
in trouble with paul
i think this pollen
is giving me a migraine now
im just gonna go inside
go inside
well ill make sure
and share your thoughts
with heather and dylan
i know theyll appreciate it
donna donna
donna
like that hat donna
thank you thank you
i can not the way she just
waltzed on to our property
somebody had to help
heather with the wedding
her mother has lupus

whatever it is
she cant help at all
it just so sad poor heather
paul company put up
the entire tent for free
saved her family a fortune
all that flirting is so
inappropriate
and that and that
that tarzan outfit

i just woke up
oh
i had a horrible night sleep
dont get defensive
no one cares
no one cares
do you think alice
like might wanna kill herself
no of course not
but like one day
do you think shell
no ben no
she gonna be fine
i guess
no totally
all right
i was wondering
do you think autistic
people know theyre autistic
i think it depends
on how severe it is
but in most cases i imagine so
yeah because
i know i was diagnosed with
like mild asperger syndrome
but i didnt think
i was autistic
no youre definitely not
why did someone say that
yeah
donna was talking about
it to bonnie and grandma
with you in the room
yeah but they were whispering
they didnt know i could hear
but ive got like
amazing hearing
i mean like i could
hear shit below 20 hertz
i just dont understand
why you have to redesign
the whole dress
im just putting
sleeves on it mom
it not that big a deal
maybe not to you
what that supposed to mean
all im saying is that
i think that alice
would like to fit in
with the rest of the party
rather than standing out
like a sore thumb
okay you know what
this is not up for debate
now dont get all
huffy and puffy
im not getting
all huffy and puffy
now youre in a state
am i right
hello oh hi paul

they do this every couple
i know that
yeah that lynn

okay paul say hello
to the girls for me
yeah bye-bye
mom
mmm
mom what did you just do
what
did you just invite them over
oh good lord
are you pretending
to be oblivious
or do you really not get it
get what
how that might make me feel
suddenly
there was such a racket
seems like every guy on the ship
was yelling his head off
so i got out of the room
i ran up the stairs
all the way up to the top deck
to see what was going on
and there a woman
standing there
so i look over and im looking
and all of a sudden i realize
that doris
standing there waiting for me
granddad
dude did he just die on camera
it okay
you dont joke about that
look im sorry
i didnt i didnt mean to
cause any sort of
false alarm dont worry
what happened
he did look dead though
he looked like really dead
did something happen to dad
no
yeah something did happen
no nothing happened
something happened
we thought he was dead
elliot
we have it on camera
what did you do to him elliot
what did i do nothing mom
whatre you doing
with that camera
okay he was telling a story
about world war ii and
you brought up politics
no i didnt bring up politics
for fuck sake
elliot
oh you guys have never
heard the fuck word before
okay elliot
just go to your room
mom im not six years old
and i dont have a room
this isnt my house
last i heard
your name was on
the fucking title
oh oh oh
you are a real asshole
oh oh im sorry
you know that
i wasnt supposed to say it
ok just get out
get out
yeah im on my way
hey arent you
eat shit paul
some manners that kid has
oh fuck you paul
im sorry i apologize
im sorry
um would anyone
like some tea or coffee
pass those would you dear
paul wants some
oh they look delicious
wait till you all see alice
oh god what a beauty
and she just
as smart as a whip
really quick yeah
really looking forward to having
a conversation with her
although lynn doesnt think
it such a good idea
i didnt say that paul
good im glad there
no problem then
im just trying to make sure
alice doesnt walk into
a um emotionally
volatile atmosphere
it a wedding lynn
weddings arent volatile
you know paul i dont think
you really understand
just how fragile
alice is right now
and it not your fault
at all
you see the psychology
of self-injuring
is very complicated
and i think what
alice is was doing
in her case is she was
trying to convert
her emotional pain
into something tangible
like a physical pain
i i think we do understand
usually this kind of thing is
about seeking attention
what did i say
something stupid
okay patty could i just
no
it has become a fad these days
it not a fad
i think that
i dont care what you think
i am just trying
to explain to you
what going on
with our daughter
and i think in her case
it about her trying
to gain control
over what
over everything
everything in this
child entire life
has been beyond her control
our divorce
the fact that she was forced
to spend summers with you
the fact that she grew up
without her brother
all of it she had no
control over any of it
but you did
no mom i didnt
paul tell me if im crazy
because i really dont remember
anymore i really dont
i mean i blocked
so much of it out
that i dont know what
true and what not
the night before i left
we were in the kitchen
and you were screaming at me
about something l
i think you
i think you lost your
keys or something
and alice was
holding on to my leg
and you were screaming
you were really screaming
and she was terrified
she wouldnt let go
and then you grabbed me
by my shirt
and you punched me in the face
you grabbed me by my shirt
and you punched me
right in the face
now tell me paul
did that actually happen
yeah it happened
it must feel good
to get something like
that off your chest
hey granddad
have you seen my camera
nope
oh there it is
last night
i didnt sleep as usual
i got to thinking
maybe around like 4 am or so
that you know
it seems like there been
an inordinate amount
of drama since we got here
and it made me think that
if we come down here
for a funeral
instead of a wedding
we might actually all
be getting along
now begs the question
what does that mean
and the only conclusion
ive been able to come to
is that death is actually
a more unifying force
within family than love
that a mind blowing concept
it is a despicable thing to say
really
really
i mean i know this sounds
kind of cynical but
i mean take 9/ for instance
i know i was young
when it happened
but honestly
when i think about it
it may have been the only time
in my entire life
that i ever really
truly felt connected
to every single member
of my family
like some strange
intangible nexus
just unveiled itself
for a moment
i know it still there
that not what im saying
i guess i just think it
weird that it takes tragedy
to bring it out
well l perhaps it just
the way you were brought up
mmm
i am myself
and my circumstances
did you hear about alice
yeah i feel bad for her
supposedly it bad
it such a bizarre
thing to do to yourself
i dont get it
now theyre gonna sew
sleeves on her dress
she so gruesome
lynn says it this
generation anorexia
anorexia i can understand
everybody wants to look good
but this is just gross
it is
you dont do it do you
any of your friends do it
no of course not
see so it not
generational donna
i didnt say it lynn said it
i just hope she looks nice
well it may not matter
why what do you got
lynn said something about
not wanting to bring alice
into this environment
how could she do
such a thing you know
do what
alice isnt coming
to the wedding
what
that is not necessarily a given
she wants everything about her
because she wants all the attention
she just like her mother
who said she not coming
donna said that lynn said it
i did not
yes you did
how could she do that
how could she just not come
i dunno
what
how could she do that
how could she not come
how can she ruin
her brother wedding
what is wrong with you
who said she not coming mom
you should just tell her
to stop all this silly drama
this isnt about her
it about heather and dylan
it their day
i know that she is coming
who said she not coming
it doesnt matter who
said it for god sakes lynn
it was said
you shouldve just told
her to call her father
and to resolve this whole thing
instead now it all ruined
oh fine
hey everybody
oh thank god
what up alice
how are you
im good
yeah mom
hi
how are you
im good im good
you look good
thank you hi
im not waiting
to give you a hug

thank you so much
for being here
hey what cooking everybody
let do all the introductions
and be pseudo polite
for the love of granddad
elusive god

i know you do you must because
youre too freaking gorgeous
i suppose it good

no l i can cut it
i dont mind
donna donna please stop it

i bet you there someone
waiting in the wings
i think you lost
your keys or something
but you were screaming at me
and alice was holding
on to my leg
and she was terrified
she wouldnt let go
and then you grabbed me
by my shirt
shit alice im sorry
it all right
i didnt think about it
dude are you like crying
i think alice handled
the family very well
yeah she and dylan
were cracking up
about that dog in the outfit
a cowboy
i just dont know what im
supposed to do about paul
that a tough one
i just dont get
what the appeal is
of paul
no the cowboy dog
are you even listening to me
yeah yeah of course
i just cant get over that dog
well try lee
he had these little holsters
and
little chaps he was wearing
so im pretty sure
grandma a sociopath

i think it requires
investigation
i think you should write
your thesis paper on this
yeah call it
heart of darkness 4
thesis papers dont
have such poetic titles
yeah
what the fuck are you doing
with drugs elliot

they were the little kids
and you were the big sister
and it in the past and
that where it should stay
um and hopefully everything
forgiven you know

the symbolic nature
of this seating arrangement
here come the hellmans
no sense of equilibrium
the family members catalyst
like yellow cake and tritium
from a fight well blow
our way to center stage
this is rage this is rage
this is a crew with some rage
let slay the beast to save
the feast animals in a cage
get em no cops
on this green earth
going to keep us from rising
we fuck up genes these rings
and all the things
we brutalizing
not one yuppie on this family
will be my own relation
right hand up i go seven
sieg heils at hellman nation
oh shit elliot
coming all the way from mic
straight to annapolis
just to fucking kill it
in one my goodness
oh my goodness bitches
oh my god making my baby
batter boil boy woo
theyre like 65s
oh my god look at that one
look at that one she a
motherfucking thoroughbred
oh she all classy and shit
i bet she got black
satin sheets
mmm little runway strip
to park my plane in that
mmm get my dick wet tonight
id tap that
boy you dont even know
shit about tapping shit
yeah i do i found this
book on my mom bed
all about the g-spot
ive been trying it out
on a few bitches
you know how i can
be totally certain
that youre full
of shit right now
im not but how
because if your mom really
knew where her g-spot was
she wouldnt have to make
costumes for dogs
oh snap nigga
seriously you understand
whatre you guys laughing at
baby batter
shut the fuck up ben
hey elliot better dance
with me tomorrow night
um dancing isnt
particularly my thing
wait that not true
you can do the macarena
really elliot
you dont know what the fuck
youre talking about ben
yeah i do cause mom taught
you and you taught me
you were good remember
you guys know about
my brother ben right
you know how he
has severe autism
you dont wanna talk
about it too much
because if you talk about severe
autism to the retard too much
then he gets low self-esteem
and that not good
right ben
isnt that right
samantha care for a smoke
you dont
it would make you look
so much more attractive
oh my god she is
such a fucking bitch
better to be pale
it better to
is he all right
he fine
ill tell you you
cant find a better beer
than this michelob ultra
it almost zero carbs
how bout that
interesting
is he all right
he fine
we have them made
for us in indiana
and really the money is
right
now the deal with gm
was for carriages
they dont look the same
cubic zirconias look the same
i know but im talking
it just a status thing
i just dont get that
it interesting
most people think that when
rock n roll first hit
boom that there
was nothing else
not true because what most
people dont remember
was that there was
this strange time
maybe three or four years
when everything sort of
coincided so that you had
you had your perry comos
and your bill haleys
and your pat boones
and you had people
like jill corey
you remember
no
yeah you do because
i played you that song
make like a bunny honey
im gonna go call granny
and check on everybody
see how they are
at the hospital
good tell them were
praying for them
hey
hey
look um
i just want to say l
i think we got off on the wrong
foot back at the house
and and all i really
wanted to convey to you
was that that i really
have missed you
that we all have missed you
your mother said that you
werent feeling good
and so i just didnt
know what to expect
well after
everything you heard
i hope i didnt disappoint you
disappoint me
no no way no no
what does that mean
sorry im just being
kind of awkward
um
dylan told me that you
gave him a big promotion
that yeah
that really great
he deserves it
yeah
done a great job but he
gotta build towards something
like youre doing
yeah thanks
i mean i had to take
some time off but um
im doubling up on courses
for september
so i can graduate on time
that good
yeah
im im so happy you
finally found something
i mean i really love it
you know i
i dont know i feel like maybe
i have something to
offer there in a way
alice i know everybody thinks
that i dont understand
everything
and maybe theyre right
but i want to i do
thanks paul
and you know if you ever
want to just phone me
or just wanna talk
maybe youre feeling
down or something
i just dont want to
lose touch with you again
if that what you want
yeah i mean id
id really like that
maybe we could um
get lunch or something
i mean um maybe it could
maybe it could
just be me and you
she my wife
alice
i know
uh excuse me barkeep
yeah
um can i get three shots
double shots
of your finest whiskey please

what i was like saying
is that like my mother
really is the one who like
raised dylan not your mother
and like i dont mean that in
like an offensive way
it just like the truth
and like i guess
like what i want to say
is that like i think it
like pretty disrespectful
that like your mother
forced dylan to choose her
to walking down the aisle
mmm
so yeah
you wanna know
something hilarious

it 23 ante meridian
and im reporting to you
live and on the scene
outside the home
of joe and doris baker
in the heart of queen anne city
annapolis maryland
where just moments ago
the diabolical force
known as the hellman family
has finally submerged this
quaint waterfront town
into complete and utter chaos
with their overly sensitive
self-destructive daughter
alice scissorhands
and the rather unseemly
and highly inappropriate
behavior of their mama familias
some have begun to wonder
how will tomorrow
events unfold
oh wait one moment
im getting something
preliminary reports
are suggesting
that no matter the outcome
doris baker is
and will remain quietly furious
the question that begs to be
answered however is
will they unite
for just one day
or will all hell break loose and
split this family in two
like a maryland blue crab

everything must change
nothing remains the same
everyone must change
no one and nothing
remains the same
now the young the old
and mysteries do unfold
cause that the way of time
nothing and no one
remains the same
there are not so
many things in life
you can be sure of
whoo
except the rain
comes from the clouds
sunlight from the sky
and hummingbirds do fly
young becomes the old
and mysteries do unfold
that the way of time
nothing no one
remains unchanged
there are so little things
so few things in life
you can be sure of
except rain comes
from the clouds
sunlight from the sky
and humming birds do fly
everything changed
everything
everything must change
