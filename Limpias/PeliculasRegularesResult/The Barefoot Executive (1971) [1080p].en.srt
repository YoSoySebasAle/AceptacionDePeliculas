how i ever let myself

relatives ill never know
tires screeching
hi steve
hi jen
i uh got something here
for wilbanks
steve youre supposed to
deliver the mail not read it
it doesnt hurt anything
steve youd better keep moving
mr wilbanks should be here
any second
and you know how upset he gets
when he sees you hanging around
you mean he not in yet
mm-mm
well i cant say i blame him
after that show last night
steve please just forget

that one really takes the cake
oh good morning
mr wilbanks
good morning
did you happen
to get my note
yes i got your note
every time i put my hand
in my pocket i got your note
now you listen to me steven
im not interested in your
theories on ratings
and im certainly not interested
in doing a show called
abraham lincoln doctor dog
whatever that is
what is it
uh well sir
it very interesting
you see we had a guest speaker
from our school last night
a mr ez potter
youve probably heard of him
ez potter
yes sir
he from up north
up north
where up north
tulare
tulare
yeah
he got a surefire approach
for making a top-rated tv show
he does
yes sir and it
very logical too
you see
it been historically proven
that the american people
have always preferred stories
about number one abe lincoln;
number two doctors;
and number three dogs
so the most popular and
highest rated show of all
would be a show about
abe lincoln doctor dog
and that is the kind of a show
your tv friend from tulare
wants me to make
well actually he not
in tv sir he in radio
radio
yes sir they dont have
a tv station up there
they dont
abraham lincoln
doctor dog
yeah
title kinda long but
it sounds like a good idea
wait in the car
oh
now you listen to me post
you get this straight
your job here
is to deliver the mail
and that is all you are to do
is to deliver the mail
i am not interested
in your quacky theories
that come from your
quacky teachers that teach
in your quacky night school
yes sir but
actually in this case
it wasnt a teacher
i know what he was
he was a radio man from tulare
anything important jen
oh yes sir
mr crampton called
from new york
he did
well why didnt you
tell me that
when the president
of the network calls
you dont let me stand around
talking about abraham lincoln
dog doctor
uh abe lincoln
doctor dog sir
there a difference
i dont care what it is
how long ago did he call
about an hour ago
an hour  well you
shouldve called me at home
well i did
but you werent there
your wife said you were
out on some deliveries
oh y-ye-deliveries yeah
well get him on the phone
oh he said it wouldnt be
necessary to call him back
just pick him up
at the airport next tuesday
he didnt want to talk to me
d-did he see the ratings
well i imagine he had
because he asked
if you had
he did  where are they
no sir theyre
in the other pile
well why didnt you say so
you can see im under pressure
well he sure
in a bad mood
steve
why did you bring up
abe lincoln doctor dog
on a day like this
wilbanks  oh no
i was just trying to help
nothing wrong with that
groaning
ohhh these are terrible
these are catastrophic
just relax mr wilbanks

oxygen in your system

who had that problem

used to help her
to blow into a paper bag
have you ever tried that

to the airport
well have a nice trip
to the airport
something must be wrong
wilbanks were always
third in the ratings
which would be all right but
there are only three networks
we come up
with loser after loser
disaster after disaster
but chief ive been through
47 pilot films this year--
well maybe it your staff
have you got
experienced people
well experience is hard
to come by chief
all youve got
available to you today
are a lot of young kids
running around
trying to tell you how
to run your business
speaking of kids telling you
how to run your business
this is for you mr crampton
sighs
is that from steven post
why would you bother the chief
with a thing like that
isnt it bad enough
that im bothered by him
he says he got a foolproof
method of determining
the top-rated programs
hmm he ambitious
he rated all
of last night shows
check with
the overnight ratings
youll see im right
dont pay any attention
to that kid chief
hell drive you nuts
he 2 years old
and he thinks he should
be running the network
well i dont think age has
anything to do with it boss
i didnt ask you
what wrong with a young man
running the network
look at william pitt
he was only 24 and he was
president of england
and look at alexander the great
how old was he when he conquered
macedonia
how would i know
just drive the car
yeah and look at all
them little kids that was kings
of all them different countries
like this little kid
that was only four years old
and he was king of france
and there one kid--
he was the king of england
he was only nine months
nine months  a person
became king of england
at nine months
i dont remember
anything about that
you dont
laughing snorting
tell him
to drive the car
drive the car
you rated every show
exactly like our rating service
howd you do that young man
i guess i just have an instinct
for what people like sir
oh instinct my foot
he got an instinct for
getting people in trouble
just a minute wilbanks
you cant listen
to a lot of young punks
francis
im surprised he not
out demonstrating
francis
im out here to replace
some shows that--
well theyre
not doin too well
how would you like to look
at some new films with me
gee sir id be honored
that carrying it too far
but i think i could do a lot
better if i took them home
you see my powers
of concentration are
much stronger that way
wilbanks
never mind your powers
of concentration
no film leaves this studio
that company policy
no he right just be
in our viewing room at 600
francis well see how good
the boy really is
nervous chuckle

well he doesnt
seem to be himself
he has no energy
no spunk nothing
he even stopped
watching tv
oh he probably just got a hold
of some bad bananas
or something
bananas  would they
bother a chimp

bad ones they would
hmm

selecting our tv shows

well i mean--

of course i believe it
i knew it all the time
jackhammer running
uh madam
well what do you think
of the rumor of a chimp
selecting our tv shows
a chimp picking tv shows
ridiculous
yes well you know
how those rumors
get started
i know i--
wait a minute
those stations have been
switching and cancelling
my favorite shows for years
maybe a chimp
is behind this mess
oh no madam
it a plot
youre all in on it
no madam
we have nothing to do--
i am so sick and tired
of liking a show
and having it
pulled off the air
or put in another time
madam--
please--
it just drives ya crazy
im getting to the point
where i--
id like to take
the television set
and throw it out the window
the last show i liked
they took it right off the air
the minute i got to like it
off the air
madam--
how do i know what happened
to them  i dont even know
what happened to john
has the man
from the justice department
arrived yet
everybody here sir
good
that good
pounding gavel
gentlemen television
has had problems before
we can work this one out
if we keep cool heads
chattering
keep cool heads
your wilbanks says youve
got a monkey picking programs
and you want us
to keep cool heads
i was delirious
dont give us that
for the past ten years youve
been the third-rated network
suddenly you jump to
number one now there
has to be a reason
you dont have
the personnel to do that
now just a minute clifford
ive plenty of personnel
i have people all--
well i--
oh shut up
mr crampton
weve had a tacit understanding
to share technological advances
now it seems to me that youve
betrayed that understanding
together
we have not
just a minute gentlemen
i must speak
for the justice department
we can have no understandings
between networks
tacit or otherwise
oh come on harry how can
the department call a little
chimpanzee a techni-tech--
so there a chimp
i never--
then there is a chimp
chattering
crampton pounds gavel
gentlemen please
admittedly
there is a chimp
and he does like tv
and it seems he does
prefer the top-rated shows
and he does go to
the refrigerator and get
a beer during the commercials
chattering
gentlemen
if the american people ever
found out that a chimpanzee
was selecting programs
it would be the end
of tv
gentlemen
i have a simple solution
to the whole problem
yes
we must destroy the chimp
oh no no
i cant see it at all
chattering
crampton
oh we cant do that
oh no we couldnt--
oh b--
why wed have those
societies for the prevention
of things all over our backs
that would be the end
of our dog food accounts
gentlemen i think
i have an idea
i hope it better
than the bananas
it practical and humane
you see a chimp belongs in a
jungle not in a network office
we know that dr schmidt
that the problem
what we do is buy the chimp
return him to the jungle
hell be happy the networks
will continue on as usual
and we will be rid of
steven post once and for all
brilliant schmidt
brilliant
bravo  beautiful
that the one
we certainly have the money
and every man
has his price
chattering
so that what they think huh
every man got his price
well dont worry
i dont
steve why dont we
take him and blow this place
forget this whole rat race
i dont want them
to put him in a jungle
jen they cant get to me
i cant be bought
$500000

$500000 that a--
that a lot of money
well of course

and that all
there is to it
