of a gypsy girl

mysterious
as the birds in the forest
i see clearly
your past and future your dreams
youve come from the dew in the forest
and there they will be waiting for you
strange creatures they are
and you must take care
if it obsesses the young lady

make her free from such a dream

we have to
go back

the devil enters the body of
the person he wants to control
uses the organs of that body
for his own pleasure
and performs feats
far above the capacity strength
and ability of
the person thus possessed
here in the holy book
for the knowledge of mankind
since the days of our lord and even
before satan and the other demons
have persecuted the souls of christians
they make no distinction
between men women and children
he the devil
uses the bodies of others as his own
destroying those he wants to dominate
perverting their language
and distorting their lips
froth exits their mouths
rather than words
lead a virtuous life and place
yourselves in the hands of our lord
you must live within
the rules of our religion
the only true religion
otherwise
the devil will find
a place inside our bodies
and take our souls away
and then
we shall burn in hell forever
throughout eternity
your souls will find no rest
your bodies will suffer eternal torture
the wrath of satan has no mercy
repent
oh god please help me
i dont want to burn in hell
calm down
justine what wrong
answer me
are you feeling better now
what happened
i dont know
she shouldnt be left alone
she should rest for a while
i can look after her
please dont leave me alone
i can stay with her
would you like to stay alucarda
alright
well leave her in your care alucarda
if you need anything i wont be far
monsters monsters
they have done this to you
justine dont tell of our secret
i hear voices
voices from the past
the same dark voices
they were soft at first
i was looking at the trees
and the voices began to speak to me
coming from the forest
i can hear them clearly justine
only you and me
only you and me justine
my god im so scared
we will make them pay bit by bit
for all they have taken away from us
alucarda

one with the other
and then

giver of all gifts
of flowers and fruits
jesus give me strength
please
behold the body of thy new servant
my lord
dont abandon me
manifest your spirit
satan lucifer
do not abandon me lord
we beseech thee satan
god
save justine
dont abandon her lord
please keep her from harm
today we will continue studying
the teachings of saint theresa
and this is what the devil does
to beget his evil
he obtains help from our virtues
even if the gain is small
his harvest is great
but god in his infinite wisdom
understands the wiles of the devil
and so gives us the strength
to face them with noble thoughts
and prayer
in this way
i trust that you have been listening
yes sister
then you can repeat
what i have just read
well alucarda
stand up child
and this is what the devil does
he grants us virtues
to expand his kingdom
the only valid one
god with his lack of knowledge
does not understand this truth
and opposes it with
false thoughts and prayers
god silence
i renounce the other god
and all the saints
dont listen dont listen to them
lord and master
dont listen go out of the room
go go go
i promise to do all that is evil
i will declare you name to all and will
not cease to serve the lord of darkness
my body my soul
and my life belong to you
call the mother superior quickly
what wrong with you girls
god help up please
please stop it
alucarda my child
this is blasphemy
listen to me sisters
this is blasphemy god help me
how dare you blaspheme
are you mad
have you taken leave of your senses
answer me answer me
i only repeated what you said
god forgive you
you have just invoked the
kingdom of darkness
and rejected the infinite wisdom of god
and now you deny it
and alucarda too
liars repent
here in front of the cross
beg ask for forgiveness
sister germana
reverend mother thank god youre here
i have to inform you of the strange
and blasphemous behaviour of these girls
mother in front of me
sister mary and all the pupils
justine and alucarda
denied the lord our christ
they used the most evil language to
recognise satan as their lord and master
i cant believe it
but it true
what have you to say for yourself
sister mary
send for the doctor
perhaps they are ill
father lazarus will be here soon
i want them both
to be prepared for confession
go hurry now
yes
i need more light
she gets worse by the minute doctor
how long has she been like this
since this morning
but she has got much worse
her pulse is faint
her heart is weak
this girl is very sick
pray justine
pray my child
pray for the sake of your soul
pray pray justine pray
what is it girl
what the matter
easy girl easy
it is your turn now alucarda
yes my child
i i
yes go on
i was told to come to you
speak up then
i was asked to answer a question
and i did
and sister germana is angry with me
and for a very good reason
i am not what you may think father
the facts were
explained to me my child
you have sinned
i dont recall doing anything wrong
liars rot in hell for eternity
i know for sure
that you are doing wrong
dont miss this opportunity
which has been granted you
you can tell the truth
here and now
perhaps i have done wrong
i couldnt have lied
i love life with
with
go on
justine
is a close friend of mine
i love her
you call yourself blessed and
believe in eternal life and worship god
i worship life you worship death
i love justine
you love to kill
we have made a pact
and sealed it with our blood
justine and i
the fault isnt ours but yours
you cover your body with a black cassock
as if you are ashamed of it
but youd like to
possess me wouldnt you
take me
take off your cassock
what happened father
what happened
please sister get her out of here
my god no no
all we can do is wait
well know better tomorrow
i hope shell recover
im convinced she will
with the help of the lord
the things she said were so horrible
please lord do not abandon us
in such times of difficulty
you did not hear what she said
it was the devil
as if the devil himself
was speaking through her mouth
these words cannot come from
anyone else only the devil
the devil
the devil
father lazarus
do you really believe that because
we belong to the church
we are safe from the devil influence
i remember when i visited
the archives at the vatican
i read many incidents
that had been confirmed
incidents like this
in 49 at the monastery of cameron
some nuns became immensely strong
they barked like dogs
and predicted the future
they contaminated
the rest of the community
and made the monastery
a temple of the devil
in 550 the nuns
of the convent of nazareth
became possessed
they climbed trees like cats
and levitated for hours
in 555 in rome itself
in an orphanage just like this one
three orphans were responsible
for horrible things
which could only be the work
of a diabolical mind
two of them became seriously ill
and the third finally died
killing all three
justine and alucarda may be possessed
mother
the devil is elsewhere
not in those poor girls
it looks like we are
the victims of a conspiracy
justine and alucarda
are possessed by the devil
it not surprising that satan
has chosen these delicate creatures
his plans are directed against
the holy church and its representatives
they may not be possessed
by the devil himself
but at least by
one of his evil messengers
what are we going to do
we must pray that god can help us
jesus christ
deliver us from this nightmare
dont let them
possess us
how long has justine been like this
almost a week
and then she became ill
she fainted during the hymns
and said the light affected her
that it
a heliophobic demon
a sixth category devil
who hates light
he acts at night when
the shadows protect him
we must destroy him
in order to free the girls
we must prepare
an exorcism
justine poor justine
i wont let them harm you
i wont let them take you away
ill take you somewhere
where you can be safe
my poor justine
youve got to help me
no
you must get up
sister what dyou think youre doing
open the door
come child
do not despair my child
we are here to deliver you from evil
it not the child but
the demon inside her that resisting
i shall prove this by
exposing la marca diaboli
the devil mark she has on her skin
the mark of the devil
remove her clothing
god of heaven jesus christ
die soon
die soon
this is all the evidence i need
you have all seen her
they cannot stand the name
of our saviour they are possessed
youll die soon
silence her
i order thee evil spirit
in the name of the one who judges
the one who has created
and can destroy the world
the one who has the power
to send you to hell
go depart
leave the bodies of
these two servants of god
they must return to the holy church
by the power of my faith
and of the holy ghost
i demand that you
return to your bottomless pit
humble yourself at the feet of christ
because his faith is greater than yours
christ before whom you tremble
christ who takes lost souls from the
fires of hell to the light of heaven
now depart
back where you belong evil spirit
god commands you
do not resist
god the father commands you
god the son commands you
god the holy ghost commands you
the holy cross commands you
the faith of st peter
and st paul commands you
all the saints command you
the holy cross commands you
all the faithful command you
depart seducer enemy of virtue
stop it
stop it i say
stop it
doctor how dare you
interrupt our holy ritual
holy ritual this is the most
shameful thing i have ever witnessed
this is not the fifteenth century
i thought reason
had replaced superstition
this is not an act of faith
this is the most primitive expression
of ignorance i have ever seen
you
you
you have just killed justine
how dare you
damn you damn you
release her
im taking this girl with me before
you kill her as you killed justine
my lord
oh my christ
you were witness
how did this happen
where is the love he spoke of mother
to cleanse her spirit
you have destroyed her body
but the lord will not abandon her soul
because it is pure
may he have mercy on you
for all that you have done
enough sister
yes who is it
open the door please
doctor what happened

daniela

youre safe with us
try to rest now
can i stay with her
for a little while father
yes darling but not too long
ill be downstairs if you need me
your father want to frighten me
he doesnt alucarda
you were dreaming
im afraid of dreams
the things i see are so real
my father is a good doctor
hell cure you
have we ever met before
i dont think so
because
i do remember people voices
you are very pretty
and you are beautiful
please dont go
stay with me
rubbish pure rubbish
who is it
it me doctor felipe
something terrible has happened
at the convent
youve got to come
but it five in the morning
the reverend mother sent me
you are to come right away
im familiar with the terrible things
at the convent what is it now
she didnt say
only that you had to come
ill be right down
thank god youve come dr hasley
justine shroud
who did this
that what we would like to know
she was brought here
to be prepared for burial
she was here all night
until a few hours ago
who was with her
sister veronica
where is she now
we dont know doctor
the least you should have done
was to say with her yourself
doctor
doctor please
no one in the convent
has been sleeping since justine died
we have been flagellating ourselves
as we flagellated justine
then someone took justine body
there no other explanation
i must notify the authorities
no theyll want to know how she died
our religious community the scandal
dont worry
the death certificate will say justine
died of an unforeseen accident
which is partly true
doctor mother superior doctor
come quickly
oh my god
she been burned to death
it looks as if
the fires of hell have reached her
take her to the chapel
i want to look at the corpse again
ill go with you
no
i want to examine it alone
if you dont mind
take her to her cell
father what is the meaning of this
this nun was dead and yet
she moved
the devil moved her limbs
she was dead
but the forces of evil
had not abandoned her
how can you explain this
from a scientific point of view
it happened is happening
in front of your very eyes
do you still doubt
i dont know
youre the only one here
who has the answer
these are the doings
of the transgressor
the seducer the enemy of virtue
the perpetual persecutor of innocence
the arch enemy of almighty god
you mean the devil
the devil
i still cant believe it
and yet this destruction was by someone
who hates all religious manifestation
to that being this chapel
was a terrible antagonist
when i studied at the university
of paris i was taught
that demonic possession
was pure nonsense
or the sad result of
the workings of an insane mind
they taught me that religion
was a farce and a form of slavery
that the time has come to
break the chains of superstition
im a man of reason
and im faced with
something supernatural
which frightens me
this woman was dead
yet there was evil inside her ready
to come alive and attack the innocent
this could only be as you say
the work of what you call the devil
yes it was the devil
who entered our sister body
and turned her from the altar of the
almighty to the fires of hell
someone must have contaminated her
justine
and we must find her
before there are more victims
more corpses more possessed
yes we must find justine
or what is left of her
you wont believe how things were
but that why we exorcised
justine and alucarda
they were possessed by the devil
is that why alucarda
was at the ceremony
her behaviour was evil diabolical
oh my god no daniela
doctor
danielas alone with her
daniela
thank you father
mother superior daniela gone
i understand
we must find them immediately
or daniela also will be possessed
well all search for them
thank you mother
are you ready doctor
yes father
we must find alucarda
where should we start looking
i think i could help find her
how would you know sister angelica
i remember some of the places
they used to go together
let go then
promise me you wont hurt her
please doctor
dont worry
this way doctor
mother superior
please bring father lazarus
yes doctor
sister theresa where your cross
ive lost it
thank you sister
doctor
