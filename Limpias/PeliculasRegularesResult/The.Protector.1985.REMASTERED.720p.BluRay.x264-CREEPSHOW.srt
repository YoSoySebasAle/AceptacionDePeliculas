and he screamed “police brutality”
all the way to the commissioner office

his own daughter to launder money
listen you lousy chink bastard
you keep bugging mr shapiro daughter
theyll scrape you off the floor
with a putty knife
his name benny garucci
he an ex-karate champ
id like to bust his fuckin head open
with a crowbar
but youre gonna have to hold him
he a tough son of a bitch
i wonder why shapiro needs
that kind of muscle here
are you kiddin he can afford to have
the whole fuckin marine corps
standin by to protect him
if he wanted to
that fuck owns half of manhattan billy
i wouldnt mind teaching garucci
a little lesson in manners someday
ladies and gentlemen
laura shapiro marketing is very pleased
to introduce to new york city
the sensational edmund wong
and his fabulous collection
of shimmering cocktail wear
nice dress
nice tits
everybody on the floor
dont move back off
no
no
new york finest
cant even keep a girl from being snatched
tight out from under your goddamn noses
we had our guns out
you might as well had your dicks out
for all the good it did
ill take my dick out
when im going to use it captain
we couldnt shoot
without hitting the girl
i think you two men
did the right thing
well thank you sir
any word from shapiro
he has no idea why
his daughter was snatched
weve been monitoring his phone
for the past 2 hours
no ransom demands no orders nothing
you might find this interesting
what is it
a record of all the phone calls made
in the last 2 hours
by shapiro hood benny garucci
six calls all to the same number
country code 8-5-2
hong kong
how the hell dya get this
friend of mine at the phone company
the blonde
no the redhead
what the hell does all this
got to do with hong kong
there somebody waiting outside
who might just be able to answer that
send in mr cantrell please
men this is bob cantrell
from the justice department
are these the men
who kidnapped laura shapiro
well how the fuck should we know
they were wearing masks
excuse me lady
what this all about
these men all work for a powerful
hong kong crime boss named harold ko
harold ko
what do you know him
anybody who knows hong kong knows ko
a real snake
yeah and a tough one to catch
now weve suspected shapiro and ko
of running drugs
from hong kong to new york for years
but weve never been able
to pin anything on them
why the hell would ko want
to snatch shapiro daughter
we dont know maybe theyve had
a falling-out of some kind
whatever the reason
there a good possibility
that laura shapiro now being held
in hong kong
it impossible nobody could smuggle
a girl into hong kong that quickly
it impossible
not for ko
he right ko got most of the island
in his back pocket
sir if laura shapiro in hong kong
we should check it out
forget it wong
my chinatown contacts can give me the names
of some good informers over there
it might be worth a try
garoni could come with me
he knows hong kong from his vietnam days
youre way out of line wong
like it
if you men could find laura shapiro
and pin it on ko
you might just be able to shut off
the largest heroin pipeline
to ever come out of the orient
okay we got nothing to lose
why dont you two men go to hong kong
as special advisors to the local police
and see what you can come up with
yes sir
see you captain
thank you captain
thank you
here the keys to that jeep
you asked for
thank you
you sure you dont want a driver
no were okay
thanks for getting this through customs
for us inspector we really appreciate
superintendent whitehead will meet you
tomorrow afternoon at four
you got it billy
yeah thanks see you tomorrow
thanks a lot inspector
{billy good night sleep well
man you love it
we could stay at a better place you know
were on an expense account
nostalgia billy my boy nostalgia
memories of magic nights on r&r
i remember during nam
there was nothing around here
but a bunch of horny grunts you know
and the women billy
the women madam mia
and besides nobody gonna look for us
in a dump like this
what that
an old chinese coin
a friend of mine in chinatown
gave this to me
it sort of a calling card
yeah
yeah
looks like a bunch of shit to me
i still say it ludicrous
the idea that anyone could smuggle
a girl into hong kong
without my office knowing about it
is simply impossible
improbable not impossible
now listen to me you two
i spoke to your captain
and he told me
about your dodge city tactics
we dont appreciate people like you
in hong kong
i want you to assure me
that youll behave
with the utmost discretion
discretion is my middle name sir
show them out inspector
yes sir
thank you sir
gentlemen you must forgive
the superintendent
he been trying to nab ko for years
considers it a personal mission in life
i think he worried you will succeed
where he failed all these years
dont worry about it inspector
im used to pissing off superiors
we ran down the phone number you gave us
shanghai massage parlor
that where benny garucci called
from new york
apparently it a rough place
they dont necessarily specialize
in giving massages
if you know what i mean
you bet your ass i do
let check this place out
maybe we can shake ko tree a little
billy youre a mind reader
you two be careful
one of the reasons ko has managed to stay
out of prison for so long
is he doesnt mind killing anyone
who threatens him
if he thinks youre getting too close
to finding laura shapiro
your names will be on the lips
of every assassin in hong kong
it a friendly little town
you got here inspector

my daughter was quite correct
i am retired
but a man like you

could you have them find out for us
gentlemen dealing in information
like that is extremely dangerous
especially when it involves people
like harold ko
listen if there something
youre not telling us
we can take you in
and let the local cops deal with you
are these men bothering you sir
that is not necessary stan

if you hate me then you must hate ko
help me find him
help me destroy the man
who killed your father
father
my father told me to help you
even though he dead i must obey
the fortune-teller was a friend
of my father
if my father found out anything
the fortune-teller will know
you look for a girl
that was taken from new york by mr ko
how do you know
the i ching tells all
nothing is hidden
there has been war
between ko and shapiro
yes but the war is over
a man has come across the water
to make peace
benny garucci
yes
my people tell me
a pact will be made tomorrow night
and the girl will be returned
where the girl
i do not know
but you must not look for her
the i ching is not good
i see only danger
death and betrayal
thanks
wait a minute
i must say a prayer for my father
and consult the i ching
what do your sticks say
is the fortune-teller right
i ask the questions billy
but i never read the answers
close the gate
thanks
i trust you found the girl well
yes sir just as you promised
when mr shapiro refused to pay
for my last shipment
i lost much face
i trust it will never happen again
it was a simple misunderstanding sir
be assured that mr shapiro remains
your faithful friend and partner
he wishes no ll feeling towards you
im glad to hear this
but mr shapiro is worried
those two cops from new york
theyre getting too close
to our operation
calm your fears
the girl shall be returned to you tonight
as for those two police officers
they caused me great dishonor
they will be taken care of
garucci went to this big container shipyard
before he went to see ko
now it my guess
he was checking on the girl
before arranging an exchange
with the big man
the fortune-teller said the exchange
will be made tonight
so we have to break in and get
the girl out before that can happen
tall order man
