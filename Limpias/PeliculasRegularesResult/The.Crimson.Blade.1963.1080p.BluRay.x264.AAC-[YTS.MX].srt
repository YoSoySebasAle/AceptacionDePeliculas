why did beverley
call judd a traitor
when youve been in the troop
a little longer my friend
youll learn that our beloved colonel
fights with the hand that pays him best
cant say i blame him
youd better search the house wyatt
detail six men to help you
beautiful quite beautiful
your daughter is it not
colonel beverley
hmm
well now are you going to
tell me what i want to know
if you dont youll die
so will she
only more slowly
tell me where i can find the king
and youll both be granted
a free pardon
im waiting
what your answer
my answer is simple
i commend you and the
murdering despot cromwell
who is your master
to the bottomless pit of hell
where you will surely go
long live the king
thank you edward beverley
and you philip
may god be with you always
i want to remind you gentlemen
that this district is the core
of the strongest royalist resistance
in the country
it is my duty to stamp it out
we are to remain here
until the last royalist is hanged
all right that all
captain sylvester our operations
for the following week
will be for troop a
to cover this area here
troop b here troop c here
troop d to remain at
headquarters in reserve
and charles stuart sir
issue a proclamation
cryer hear ye
hear ye
hear ye
to whoever shall bring
information to the state
leading to the apprehension
of the traitor charles stuart
the state offers a reward
of one hundred guineas
and to whoever shall
withhold such information
the penalty is death
you say you recognised
charles stuart
how
well er begging your pardon
your honour
it was the man who was with him
that gave me the er inkling
as you might say
calling him sire
and your majesty
lieutenant hawke
sir
take a troop to the coast road
yes sir
all right you can go
er your honour ah
begging your pardon your honour
well
i performed my duty as a loyal citizen
yes
ah there the small question
of the reward
what about it
well er when will it
please your honour
to permit me to collect it
if your information leads us
to charles stuart
youre entitled to your reward
ah thank you your honour
itll be presented to you
in public
oh your honour please
not in public
why not pray
well the people
theyd kill me
many of them are misguided enough
to retain allegiance to the king
i i mean the
the traitor charles stuart
if they so much as suspect
what ive done
i shall need protection
youll get your protection
thank you your honour
captain sylvester make arrangements
for this man to be
confined in the village jail
indefinitely
but your honour
no-onell get at you there
captain sylvester
sir
please show him out will you
yes sir
your honour i
take him away
if our friend information
should prove false
you may hang him
it will be a pleasure
i like a man to be
paid in his own coin
yes indeed
if i had my way with traitors id
you were saying
it was of no consequence
dont confuse a collaborator
with a so-called traitor
one is a snivelling coward
seeking to enrich himself
or to save his own skin
the other may find himself
ideologically disposed to change sides
do you understand
every man has a reason
for switching his allegiance
only he can adjust
the rights and wrongs of the matter
to his own conscience
my daughterll be arriving
in a minute
shell be staying here at the manor
youd better go and expound
some of your
admirable philosophy to her
and how is my beautiful clare
im well thank you tom
my father
oh he his usual shall we say
im worried about him
oh
his reputation is spreading
over the whole country
everywhere he goes he leaves
a trail of hatred behind him
well he waiting for you now anyway
wait tom
yes
where colonel beverley
youd better ask your father
arent you still in his confidence
oh yes im very much
the blue-eyed boy
in fact it may interest you to know
he now looks upon me
in the role of
son-in-law
at least that the impression he gives
that a pity
oh why
i dont enjoy disappointing people
not even your father
not even my father
judd clare
sylvester please excuse us
corporal
did you make your journey
to see me
or to ask after the health
of an enemy of the state
colonel beverley only crime
was one of loyalty to his king
oh very touching tribute
to his memory
his only crime as you put it was
sufficient to sign his death warrant
you didnt lose much time
did you father
my duty lies in
the service of cromwell
your duty
when you first changed sides
i tried to push your ignoble actions
to the back of my mind
i tried to delude myself
that you had some reason
other than greed for what you did
but now
now i see you very clearly
a traitor a murderer
cringing to master cromwell for a favour
or a crumb from his table
how dare you speak to me like that
now you listen to me
carefully clare
cromwell has appointed me
officer in charge of the district
chief intendant of the forest
and magistrate
i intend to exercise
those powers to the utmost
in the service of the lord protector
who recognises my ability
if i have forgotten
that i was once a royalist
it is because i now believe
in the new order
and whether you
believe in it or not
you will conform
do you understand me
yes father
i understand you
sylvester colonel
we have a very special guest
get him to hampton court
see to it
sylvester and the other two
shoot them
take him away
bring the other two to
the stable yard wait for me
order a firing squad
judd jacob leave them
remain where you are
officer by the left halt
right turn
prepare to load load
take aim
fire
what happened
father dead
oh no
colonel judd yes
and the king been taken
as far as the roundheads
are concerned
they dont even know we exist
jacob has been pressed into
the service of colonel judd
so for the time being
he can come and go as he pleases
jacob youll bring us
whatever information you can
disposition of troops
movement of transport and officials
well hit them wherever we can
with bullets fire and steel
these are not haphazard raids
theyre skilfully designed
and executed
but by whom
well
the man youre looking for sir
is known as the scarlet blade
but you wont find anyone
in the district to betray him
you had better look to yourselves
they are taking more people
for questioning
officer
squad halt stand at ease
stay where you are
whichever of you is present
answer your names
and stand over by the door
parsons

john drury
didnt mean to alarm you
quick now what news of the king
i i found a directive
from cromwell to my father
he to be lodged for
two weeks at hampton court
and then moved to the tower
well try a rescue then
meantime there work
to be done here
with getting refugees
away to the coast
but when they reach the forest
they must have help food water
and a place to rest if possible
now if you cant do this on your own
you must find somebody
you can trust to help you
take this and study it
it the place of the next rendezvous
twelve men and women will be arriving
at midnight the day after tomorrow
two of them are
personal friends of the king
they are trying to arrange
for his asylum in france
hide quickly
he coming in here
clare

a few pennies for me tom
a few pennies
what did he have to do

get out
which leg was it
leg
i thought you said she was lame
the near hind leg
i see
you know horses are no more
to be trusted than women
this one an old faker
id have her shot if i were you
clare
i would change my coat
for you any day
no wait please trust me
who is it
good evening clare
ive come to escort you
to dinner

im not ready yet
would you wait outside please
no ill wait in here
if you dont mind
get out immediately
youre looking very beautiful
tonight clare
will you leave
no
who are you ringing for
my maid
if you havent gone
by the time she comes
ill get her to fetch my father
do you know something
i love you even more
when youre angry
it does something for your complexion
all i want to do is help you
and im giving you no choice
let put our cards on the table
youre aiding royalists
to escape the country
and youve been doing it
for some time
i also happen to have
a good memory for faces clare
i remember the face of the man
you were talking to in the stable
major john drury
you see we were in the
same company before the war
what do you propose to do
nothing help you
and if i refuse your help
then call your father
you can tell him about me and
ill acquaint him about you
im sure the news will do
something for his complexion as well
it all right mary
i needed some fresh perfume
i found it
is it a bargain
in return for your help
nothing
im merely content
to be around you
watching you like
a guardian angel
what greater love
hath man than this
you know if you werent so
overwhelmed by your own charms
i might grow to like you a little better
you will
i promise
tom i want you to
understand one thing
if were to work together
it for the whole country
it isnt for us
dont change your coat
just for the adventure
youll be serving
the king and his people
do it with your heart
now shall we go to dinner
it looks as if were in for
a hilarious evening doesnt it
judd
the lord protector oliver cromwell
all oliver cromwell
two of the men they questioned
this morning died under torture
indeed
glad i wasnt detailed
three men were branded
another man was tied
allow me to compliment you wyatt
on your delicate choice
of dinner conversation
im captain blake from the
garrison at westerly sir
this afternoon we were attacked
and the station burned to the ground
by whom
there were about 30 men sir against 2
i asked by whom were you attacked
he in the grounds
call out the guards
get after him every one of you
sound the alarm
the scarlet blade
well
he got away sir
ten officers and a hundred men
on duty in the grounds
and you let him get away
someone going to answer for this
i want a full investigation
how did he get into the grounds
how did he slip past the guards
mmm
i think i can tell you
this man who calls himself
the scarlet blade
knows every inch
of this estate why
because he was once a
member of this household
it quite simple logic
you still wonder who he is
i think i can show you
that your scarlet blade
the late master of beverley himself
was cromwell most bitter enemy
he once told me he would fight our
lord protector even from the grave
that precisely what he is doing
well gentlemen
your logic is indeed
admirable colonel but
but what
beverley two sons were
reported killed at preston
im aware of that
they were reported killed
did you see the bodies
no sir
most of you fought at preston
did any of you identify the bodies
by whom were they reported killed
i can tell you
by a prisoner of war
i received the news myself
and recall a certain feeling of elation
which overruled
any doubt in my mind
subsequently that prisoner
whose name was major john drury
escaped
and has been a thorn
in our sides ever since
well sylvester
oh excellent colonel
may i compliment you
on the brilliance of your deduction
we now know who
the scarlet blade is
this is indeed revelation
however sir if i with your permission
might ask one small question
permission granted
how is it going to help us find him
we will resume dinner gentlemen
may the best man win
id like to know what youre thinking
im thinking about the scarlet blade
he seems like a lad
after my own heart
if we can enlist
edward beverley help
well have created a link between
this house and a forest escape route
go on
there a secret passage leads
from the house to the forest edge
how did you discover that
the other night i saw jacob
enter the passage so i followed him
tom why would an old servant
of the beverley family use it
to meet his master
wait youve given me
the germ of an idea
if youre prepared
to risk jacob neck
i think i know how we can
use him to find edward beverley
how
ill tell you if my plan works
ive got to go and see your father
im trusting you tom
youll have to trust me wont you
sylvester and in the forest
this traditional place of execution
known as the gallows tree
and if as i suspect
jacob is an accomplice
of the scarlet blade
then therell be an attempt at rescue
we shall be waiting for him
it quite ingenious
thank you colonel
i had a letter today
from the lord protector
in the first paragraph
he congratulated me
upon securing the arrest of the king
but in the second
he deplored the fact
that the scarlet blade
was still at large
if your little ruse results
in the capture of this man
i shall bring your name
to cromwell notice
thank you
hmm
like a glass of sherry
please
we will dispense with
the formalities of a trial
the old man should be arrested at once
and notice of his execution posted
so that the news reaches
edward beverley in good time
execution to take place
at noon tomorrow
of course i could be wrong
jacob could be quite blameless
in which case we shall have
hanged an innocent man
that would be most distressing
wouldnt it
still i fear that is a hazard
we shall have to risk
yes indeed colonel
but of course we could always
console ourselves with the idea that
jacob died in a very good cause
couldnt we
ive told you listen
it not only your life
im concerned with
it the life of the man you serve
where can i find him
you know whatll happen dont you
hell try to save you
and get cut to pieces
before he gets within
thirty yards of the tree
then theyll hang you anyway
if i wanted to trap edward beverley
id let him walk into the ambush
theyre preparing for him
if i let this happen both he
and all his friends will be caught
dont you understand this jacob
how can i find him
well
i hope i can trust you
how can i find him
youve heard of the dragon tree
yes i know it
there a footpath close by
follow it
it takes you deep into the forest
you will come to an old oast house
there you will find edward beverley
ill need something
to prove im a friend
this ring
master edward himself
gave it to me
take it
why do you want
to help us captain
let us just say
my heart in the royalist cause
your heart
your sword fights for cromwell
how did the two
become disconnected
my royalist cause
happens to be a lady
she helped me to see
the error of my ways
who is the lady
the daughter of colonel judd
judd
and dont condemn her because of her father
at least she didnt turn traitor
it on account of her
that i came to see you here
and because of her
that you can trust me
as for trusting you
i shall reserve my judgement
what is your plan
this is the gallows tree
and here the path leading to it
they are coming
“what about the soldiers
theyre waiting for us
both sides of the gallows tree
right get to work
officer troop dismount
it taking them
a long time getting back
i hope nothing gone wrong
they had the element
of surprise on their side
dont blame me if they didnt
take full advantage of it
here they are now
edward
pablo
this is captain sylvester
captain sylvester
this is my brother philip
im glad to see you alive jacob
thanks to you sir
philip tell the men
to make themselves scarce
and double the sentries
shall we go in
clare this is edward beverley
im afraid our hospitality
is a little rough
i gather some of my father soldiers
have already experienced it
let us get to
the point of the meeting
you may know i have been helping to organise
escape routes for royalist refugees
but there are limits
to what i can do for them
i can direct them to the forest
i can show them the way
to the coast road but
beyond that they have to
fend for themselves
some of them have been taken because
they lack arms to defend themselves
i can supply them with arms
and occasionally an escort
good
now this is a matter
which concerns us even more
the king is being lodged
at hampton court
in two weeks or even less
he may be moved to the tower
thisll be our last opportunity
to rescue him
hell have an escort
of at least a hundred men
a well-prepared ambush
will take care of them
indeed
a party of royalist refugees will be
arriving tonight at twelve oclock
theyll be waiting
at the beverley crossroads
some of them are old men
women and children
can you find ponies for them
constance
well weve got four broken in
thatll have to do
now i know where to find you
goodbye edward
we must be gone
edward beverley is being
supplied with information
by someone inside these walls
how else could he have
countered the trap i set for him
what have you got to say
lieutenant hawke
we didnt stand a chance sir
we were attacked by an ambush
that must have been prepared
long before we arrived
heard the news captain sylvester
yes sir
ten men killed
fourteen wounded
and the rest put to flight
that miserable scoundrel
jacob proust rescued
and edward beverley as
far away from capture as ever
captain sylvester im charging you
with the responsibility
of seeking this man out
and bringing him to justice
those are your instructions
im placing my trust in you
thank you sir
i shall endeavour to take
full advantage of it
all right dismiss
pablo what is your name huh
theresa
theresa
ah that is a beautiful name
my name is pablo
you may call me uncle pablo
you dont have to be frightened anymore
you are going on a little boat
with big sails
to a land where there will be
no trouble for you anymore
some of them have been
travelling a long time
they must get some rest
philip will take them on
to the coast tomorrow
therell be an escort
to lead them through the forest
you go ahead ill follow
you realise that one day
youll be caught
i suppose so
these people are prepared
to sacrifice their homes
and risk their lives
rather than exist under cromwell
one day theyll return
to a free country
im glad to help them
i suppose you think
these are strange words
coming from colonel judd daughter
having met the daughter
i dont think the words are strange
until a few days ago
i had only two thoughts in my mind
to destroy cromwell and put
the king back on the throne
and now
i want to live
l also
i must go
itll all be all right
dont worry
do come in
what kept you
i had work to do
you know that
with edward beverley
tom youve no right to be here
i dont like my privacy
intruded upon
and i dont like you
to question me
im risking my neck for you
i think i have
every right to intrude
and to question
and to make love
we made a bargain
what bargain
you said you would help me
there were to be no conditions
i once told you what i was
im an adventurer like your father
he changed his coat for money
and i for love
you touch that cord
and ill blow your plans to pieces
i dont like the woman i love skulking
in the forest with some vagabond
tom “what
supposing i were to tell you ive
fallen in love with this vagabond
are you insane
no im not insane
im telling you the truth
ive met the man i love
a man youve known but a few hours
and dont protest to me
that love isnt related to time
oh im the one that insane
for setting a trap for myself
you offered to help
yes i offered to help
and now i can sit back
and see the course of history
shaped by people
like you and beverley
full of noble enterprise
but lacking the common guts to put
their own cause before their feelings
i wonder how the king would feel locked
in his rooms at hampton court palace
if he knew about this
and if your devotion
for the king is so great
then you use edward beverley
as you will
but i dont like to be used
i trusted you
and i you
i still trust you
judd captain sylvester
will you come in here please
major bell this is captain sylvester
major bell has been appointed
my deputy by the lord protector
i am leaving for london
immediately to see him
you will of course render major bell
full support during my absence
good night gentlemen
i have here a list
of the various raids
carried out by beverley
since colonel judd
took command here
ten days ago one of the
lord protector emissaries
was attacked and killed
eight days ago four wagons
carrying arms were ambushed
and the escorting soldiers
were killed
on the same day a farmhouse which
served as a barrack for twenty men
was burned to the ground
four days ago
a man called jacob proust
who was to have been hanged
was rescued
i understand you were
in charge of that operation captain
i was in charge
of the detail yes
oh you werent present yourself
i had other duties
to perform at the time
oh yes i see you were engaged in
the purchase of horses at wymington
where i should have thought
you could have relegated that duty
to a junior officer under
the circumstances hmm
however whilst im here
you will personally take charge
of every operation i conceive to
secure the capture of edward beverley
i already have an idea i wish to
discuss with you in this connection
but it can wait till the morning
is that all
that all
captain sylvester sir
ah ask him to come in
good morning captain
have you breakfasted
yes thank you
well be seated
now well deal with
routine matters in due course
but first the outlaw beverley
you realise that this man capture
during colonel judd absence
would reflect very highly
upon all of us
particularly yourself
i have a plan
which may well prove successful
first of all i should like to point out
that search parties are useless
this man too wily a fox to be
caught in his own territory
search parties will
nevertheless continue
now i understand that
beverley has a sister
in future search parties will be
concentrated in the forest area for her
if we succeed in finding this girl
weve virtually found her brother
a life for a life
exactly
well hold her
till he gives himself up
and you will be in charge
of this operation captain
ill see to it
ive just had a message
from major drury
theyre moving the king
in three days time
drury trying to organise an ambush
can you see edward for me
whatll i tell him
tell him ill meet him tonight
at the oast house
i cant make it before then
i think im being watched
ill see what i can do
tom
hmm
you will get through
to him wont you
ill do my best
halt
divide the men into sections
spread them so they take in
an area of six miles
detail two men with me
and reassemble here in eight hours
thatll be after nightfall sir
not frightened of the dark
are you sergeant
jenkins
clare tell edward to make contact
with every available man
tomorrow major drury will return
to give details of the ambush position
the men must be ready to leave
immediately they get the signal
fifty of his men will be
waiting near hampton court
were badly in need of arms
ssh
who is it
man open in the name of cromwell
quickly hide over there
if youre looking for royalists
there are none here
ill decide about that
im a loyal citizen
ill decide about that too
i am the commanding officer
of this garrison
do you wish to save your life
on what terms
tell me where i can
find your brother
never
im giving you the opportunity
of saving your life
if you refuse to talk
ill find him anyway
and youll both die
youll never find him through me
no
but if you give yourself up how do
you know theyre going to release her
you only have their word for it
and what is it worth
someone has betrayed us
who
the only two people
who know where to find us
are captain sylvester and
clare judd
i am thinking of sylvester
and clare
pablo yes
youve lived all your life
by instinct
and that the way you
judge people am i right
you are right
what is your judgement
i can also use my head
and it tells me that this girl
she has done things for your people
i believe that she loves you
and in this my head tells me
what my heart already knows
but this captain sylvester
when i first see him
i want to kill him
because of his uniform
because of him
edward wait
if you go all our plans all our efforts
to save the king go with you
there will be no-one
to carry on our work
except you
i can go in your place
no-one knows which of us
is edward beverley
sylvester knows
how can he say
without betraying himself
i havent as much
to lose as you
edward please let me go
philip i am not going to
give myself up
clare
i was coming to you
you know theyve got constance

stay here
psst
come on
the courtyard

colonel judd returns tomorrow
i intend to cheer his homecoming
by the sight of you
hanging by the neck
on beverley green
take him away
whatever you are
roundhead cavalier
adventurer
whatever you like to call yourself
youre still an officer in uniform
and you cant just stand by
and watch this murder
tom i beseech you
go to major bell and ask him
to wait until my father returns
and when your father returns
what do you suppose hell do
at least it would give us some time
there might be some way
of saving edward
if only we had a little time
i think you want him to die
why should i want him to live
so that he free
to take you away from me
tom “what
did you betray us
did you
you still love him dont you
you did betray us
oh how could you be so vile
i once told you that
i didnt like to be used
remember
clare
this shows the place
of the ambush
beverley men should leave tonight
can you get that to him
edward been taken
no
ill try to get it to philip
there there something else
major drury
do you remember captain sylvester
very well
it was he who betrayed edward
he knows about the ambush
has he talked
i dont think so
but he will where is he now
in his quarters round that corner
the first door you come to
very well ill take care of him
guard those plans with your life
and get them to philip
as quickly as you can
drop the knife
i was just about to knock
indeed
sylvester guard
turn out the guard
bell what happened
someone tried to kill
captain sylvester sir
major drury wont be
troubling us again sir
he dead
as mutton
philip therell be twenty cavalry
concealed in these woods
riflemen over here to the left
and this is the main road
from hampton court
it well planned clare
it going to work
itll never work
what do you mean
sylvester will betray us
philip how many men have you got
more than fifty
pablo how about you
my people do not fight for a cause
they love no country
no country loves them
i give philip my blessing
and my help that is all
but youd fight for a life
for edward
that is a different matter
have many of the men left
not yet theyre waiting for me to tell them
tomorrow morning your brother
is due to be hanged
we can save him philip
well if only that were possible
oh it is it is possible
with the help of our men
and pablo we could save him
the whole district will be
turned out to witness the execution
our people and pablo
could mingle with the crowd
there will be only soldiers
the people have been told
to keep to their houses
then we must make a surprise attack
and the king
there no chance for the king
because sylvester will talk
yes
or because youre
in love with my brother
dont you love him
yes of course i do
but he wouldnt thank me if i risked
the life of one single man to save him
but the king stands for the
lives and freedom of all his subjects
then youre going to
throw away the lives of fifty men
because the cause is lost
the king as good as dead
you dont really believe that
if sylvester betrays us
he will have to betray himself
i love my brother very much
but i know that he would do
exactly as i intend to do
if he were in my place
you know im right
ready
who the man about to be executed
edward beverley sir
stop the execution
colonel
im ordering you to stop this execution
your orders were to
apprehend beverley dead or alive
in my view
this man is safer dead
you will refrain from expressing your views
in the presence of junior officers
you will be good enough
to wait upon me at the manor
take the prisoner to the cells
captain sylvester
i want to know the identity
of everyone concerned
with edward beverley
he is to be subjected to
the most extreme forms of persuasion
necessary to loosen his tongue
see to it
sir
release the rope
aye sir
take him away
guard dismiss
tie him up
major bell do you realise that we are
not dealing with one isolated criminal
that this man is the leader of a
dangerous royalist underground movement
i am aware of that sir
then why sir were you not aware
of the necessity to
extract information from him
it was not necessary
no
it might interest you to know that
there is a plot
to rescue charles stuart
its origin stems from this district
beverley is undoubtedly
concerned with it
and he is not working alone
i stated that it was not necessary
to extract information from beverley
because i already know the name
of the principal accomplice
indeed
before you left for london
you told me that someone
had been supplying beverley with
information from inside these walls
i can now tell you
who this person is
and for that reason i saw
no purpose in delaying the execution
i accuse captain sylvester
you have proof
i have proof
request captain sylvester
to see me immediately
if your accusations are correct
sylvester will know of
the king imminent removal
from hampton court to the tower
an attempt to rescue the king
will be made then
go to london immediately and warn
them of the possibility of an ambush
i also advise that the king
should not be removed at present
carry on
captain sylvester
you are under close arrest
you deny nothing
nothing
but i warn you colonel
you bring me to trial
and ill seek clemency
by pleading state evidence
no doubt that will be considered
provided you plead now
i want names
you may be concerned
with only one for the moment
that of clare judd
your daughter
that the name of the woman
that inveigled me into this plot
clare judd
your daughter
what are you saying
she managed to ensnare me
under the pretext of love
she used all her feminine wiles
to trap me
all this will be
part of my defence
maybe none of it
will be taken into account
but at least you colonel
being a staunch
advocate of justice
will have the satisfaction of seeing
justice handed out to everybody
including your own flesh and blood
captain sylvester
no
judd captain sylvester was
shot while resisting arrest
you will observe that his pistol
is still in his hand
get him away
youve been accused of
assisting in the royalist cause
is that true “yes
youve been working
with edward beverley
yes
did you ever stop to think
what would happen to your own father
when your traitorous acts
were disclosed
did you ever have any
feelings for anyone
other than yourself
when you turned traitor
youre the last person
to preach to me
it only you
im concerned with now
fortunately for both of us
there now no danger
of the king rescue taking place
and in a few minutes there will be
no-one left to denounce you
except myself
the king is doomed
nothing i or anyone else can do
can help him now
i am prepared to die
for what i believe is right
if you refuse to release
edward beverley
ill proclaim to the world
what ive done
you would never dare
you dont know me
you will not only condemn yourself
you will condemn me
whatever your feelings are
towards me
i am still your father
give me your pistol
get out
ive tried to make you talk
but now stand up
get on your feet
get a horse
edward
go on go on
they must be almost there by now
were too late
oh please please
were throwing away our only chance
our lives
for nothing
no
clare
forward
philip
edward
children pablo pablo
theyre coming
quick martha some old clothes

to keep to the forest
forward
