third year he gonna bust my balls
mike what say we share
notes again this year
you take mine you mean
michael suzanne
beautiful
forget it gant
here you go partner
thanks
im dr david redding dean of
third-year studies and chief of surgery
you know every year i look
out at the group assembled here
and i ask myself
the same question
why would anyone knowingly
do this to themselves
for the next year
your days will not end
the work will never stop
your rank will command
absolutely zero respect
and worst of all
after it over
you will be faced with
the horrible realization
that there is nothing
in your medical career
that will ever be as rewarding
as third year
third year is like
being an 8-year-old rookie
and being called on to pitch the
seventh game of the world series
blindfolded
doesnt get any tougher
just remember though that
none of you would be here
if you werent pretty good
rookies to start with
now for survival purposes
you have been divided into small groups
that you will stay with all year
through each of your rotations
the very best in each specialty
will be selected to enter
residency in that area
there are three internships
in pediatrics
two for ob-gyn
two for internal medicine
and one and only one
for surgery
that my little
neck of the woods
your future will depend on how
many honor grades you accumulate
during the course of the year and
whether or not you honor in your specialty
size
i know that very important to you
for me the only thing
that really matters
is making you into
the best doctors possible
because it is hands-on from this moment on
people for the rest of your professional days
well doesnt everybody
look official
im bobby im dr redding
physician aide
it my job to show you people
how little you really know
and i love my job
every morning you will be at the
hospital an hour before the doctors
to check on your patients
primary care
then the entire team with your
resident will make the rounds
during these sessions you will be pimped
pimped
pimped questioned
probed and humiliated by the residents
for interpretations
diagnoses complications
cases that are really juicy will
be reviewed in grand rounds
which is the same as regular rounds except
that everybody in the house is there
if you intend to make honors youd
better know your shit on grand rounds
ive been in this place
a long time
and ive never seen anyone
screw up grand rounds
and come out
with honors nobody
daily summaries are on green paper
permanent summaries are on red paper
please observe the following
demonstration closely
unlabeled blood specimens received
in the specimen receiving room
will be processed as follows
nurses heads rns
lvns nurse aides
it is easy to confuse them
dont
hi
hi
talking allowed
im glad youre enjoying
the privilege
seeing as how we didnt do
too much of it our first two years
i thought now that were in the same group
we could make up for lost time
michael youve convinced me
youre very charming
thank you
but im afraid youve got it
got what
surgeon ego
what is it a disease what
you look to be a classic case
your personality already fits the prototype
and what that
as a group theyre narcissistic
insensitive chauvinistic
and their only definition of
success is to win at all costs
im dr margaret kennan
chief resident of ob-gyn
you will begin the first of
your rotations in my domain
the patient is a 23-year-old gravida
para 0 ab-0 40 weeks gestation
noted one week ago to have
frank breech presentation
external versions
attempted two times failed
so she been admitted
for elective c-section
buenos días señora
ola
dr hayes why is this patient
having a c-section
well
if she were well dr hayes
she wouldnt be here
dr wyler
because the
external version failed
delivering a breech presentation might
expose the baby to unnecessary injury
and what injuries are those
dr rose
nerve damage prolapsed
cord and delay in delivery of the head
what about the possible problems
with doing a c-section dr chatham
aspiration from anesthesia bleeding
infection pulmonary embolism
good
i knew that
some help here
dr kennan seventh baby
got hung up in admitting
she not gonna make it to delivery
okay
get over here
hold her up for me i want you to
breathe just breathe now push
push big push big push
yeah dont stop
breathe in
breathe in
here it comes
big push
hey yeah yeah
good girl relax
you have a beautiful perfect little baby boy
wow
a baby
youre here people
is it too late for law school
all right kenny patient
mrs thompkins
twenty-three weeks
gestation noted hayes
top left
is admitted for strong labor pains
dont
hayes
be careful not to touch
anything it a lab experiment
that youve been growing
for two years use mine gina
so now what if
the ultrasound shows abruption
then the bleeding
will probably stop
okay but what happens
when she begins contractions
do an amnio on her
determine the baby age
in case she needs a section
there no need to do
a tap on her this soon
why dont you just try to stop labor and
see if you can carry her for a few weeks
no way youre wrong
no im right
if it was an abruption
the odds are that the bleeding will stop
and if you can stop her labor
shell probably go to term
i mean there no need
to risk a tap right away
youre right
what are you drinking
herbal tea it from pakistan
you can probably
smell it in pakistan
it doesnt bother hayes
yeah my olfactory cells were destroyed

may i ask you a personal question
mr chatham
i know your father a doctor
these loans are gonna weigh on you
for a good 0 5 years of your career
why dont i just get my dad
to pay for it
we dont have
that kind of relationship
it doesnt work that way
there something about
a hospital serving liver

happy thanksgiving
dr chatham
yes sir
henrietta walker
interesting case
yes sir
cancer patient
im gonna put her
on grand rounds for monday
hello mrs walker im dr michael
chatham your student doctor
just wanted to come introduce myself
ive had some blood work ordered
a nurse will come up here
shortly and take some samples
it might hurt for a moment
but itll go away
i see youre a an elementary
school teacher what grade
mr chatham
i realize this is
a teaching hospital
but since i do not want you
practicing dramatics at my bedside
please drop this transparent act
of the concerned doctor
you will find this infinitely
easier on both of us
if youll concentrate on being direct
accurate and to the point
i know what i have
and i know why im here
i dont need hand-holding
is that understood
yes yes
drink
hayes
thanks buddy
listen why dont you take a break in
about an hour well grab some dinner
you gotta eat or youre gonna be
worthless for grand rounds tomorrow
i cant man i gotta check
on miss walker in an hour
ill get something later
yeah that what i thought youd say
so from suzanne
tell her i said thanks
yeah
gina contribution
i think youre makin
real headway with that girl
get outta here
are you gonna eat that sandwich
yeah
just checking
right
any time dr chatham
yes sir
the patient miss henrietta walker
is a 49-year-old female
presents with sharp epigastric pain
nausea although no vomiting
this has been increasing in the last three months
physical findings
distended abdomen
with diffused tenderness
shifting dullness
and a fluid wave sign indicating ascites
what workup was done
cat scan shows a mass in the area of the stomach
endoscopy and biopsy test
positive for gastric carcinoma
well what your assessment
dr chatham
a large gastric carcinoma with
possible spread to the greater omentum
all right she your patient
how would you treat her
give her several courses of chemotherapy
what else
wait for significant improvement and attempt surgery
all right
let take a look
at the patient
henrietta
dr redding
i have some friends
with me here
let take a look
tell me if i push too hard
dont worry
i wont hesitate
im sure you wont
how are the cats
splendid
any new additions
none since the siamese
ive decided it time
to put my house in order
in case i dont come home
this time
that an admirable thought
but one i think
you could put off
for the immediate future
all right
well i think dr chatham
assessment on the money
questions
i have a question sir
yes
dr chatham
what if there intestinal
blockage secondary to metastasis
tests havent revealed that
what tests
cat scan liver and bone scan
lfts sma-2
those wouldnt necessarily
reveal intestinal obstruction
or possible pleural effusion
which from your presentation
could be included in this assessment
that a good point
dr rose
all right let order an upper
gi series for mrs walker
thank you henrietta
doctors
are you all right
i was expecting to be attacked
but not by someone in my own group
well kenny a fighter he
probably had to fight all of his life
you know it funny when
kenny a tough-ass competitor
everybody says it all right it
okay look where he come from
he had it tough so what
if he an asshole about it
gina if i had pulled a stunt like he did
today in there id have been crucified for it
why because your father
a surgeon
-michael -look it doesnt matter
okay it not important
all that matters are end results
who the best i dont like to lose
kenny may have fired the first shot
but im gonna win this war
michael
the tests suggested by dr rose
have all been run on the patient
all prove negative
thus supporting my initial assessment
that the patient
miss henrietta walker
begin a prescribed chemotherapy
regime beginning in two weeks
continuing for
six concurrent weeks
thank you dr chatham
good follow-up questions
finish up with your patient
dr chatham
and then meet up with us in rounds
yes sir
well i think
that is what is referred to
as a hollow victory
im sorry i guess sometimes
we get carried away
it the competition
it im sorry
no need to apologize
it entertaining
you know i could have gone
to a private hospital
pension and disability
are pretty generous
when youve been a teacher
for 25 years
i chose to be here
why
because this is a teaching hospital
and being a teacher
i relate to the process going on around me
it it makes me feel less sick
like im back in my classroom
so how am i doing teach
youre doing pretty well
dr chatham
just dont concentrate
so much on the facts
facts are pretty important
around here
so are people doctor

mayo scissors
dr chatham
it was great working with you
it a pleasure working with you
thanks good to meet you
so youre doing well here
honoring
well so far in everything but
medicine there some stiff competition
youre in one of the best med schools
in the nation whatd you expect
i remember when you were in the
national 4-and-under tennis finals
you breezed through the first
four rounds without dropping a set
then you came up
against that kid gomez
you remember
yeah
he beat you the first set
and then you let down
you were better you were
much better than he was
but when you let down he took advantage
of you and he beat you three straight sets
afterwards i never saw you drop
your guard again dont do it now
that was 0 years ago howd
you remember that kid name
it was a pivotal moment
you always remember
the pivotal moments
good to see you son
you too dad
draft please
sure
hi
mind if i sit
meeting someone
no
sure
here you go
thanks
sure
why is it that when a guy comes
into a bar to be alone with his drink
no one thinks twice about it
but when a woman comes in alone everyone
assumes she waiting to be picked up
why is that
i have no idea
you know your father
really is a terrific surgeon
i guess youve heard that
a million times
yeah
about a million and one
you know
i was eight years old before i found out
his first name
wasnt doctor
all the time
that he lived at home
i used to go to the hospital
and make rounds with him
i loved the way people
there treated him they
like he was royalty you know
dr chatham we need you for this
dr chatham
we need you for that
it wasnt long before i realized those
people knew him better than i did
and i wanted to be just
like him and as good as him
i mean so that
he would talk to me too
what gets me
worse than anything
even now
like today when i see him
yeah
i feel exactly like i felt
when i was eight years old
im still trying
ill leave you by yourself
what do you recommend
dr hayes
well given the little
girl allergy to penicillin
i recommend we start her
on erythromycin
sounds good
here you go sweetheart
well have you feelin better
in a flash bye-bye
thank you doctor
be well
for your cough
all you need to do is when you go home
grind up about seven or eight
peppercorns and mix it with some honey
itll take care of your throat
really
yeah
ill try it
okay
peppercorns and honey
is that some new combination
they taught you in pharmacology
well
i -what do you suggest after that
eye of newt
three eagle feathers
jump up three times
and bark at the moon
it sort of a secret
family recipe actually
well i suggest that you keep it just that
dr maloney a secret
you see when a patient
receives information from you
they perceive it
as coming from a doctor
and you are not a doctor
what specialty
are you heading for
well i was hoping pediatrics
good luck
let me tell you about
the stars in the sky
and a girl and a guy
and the way they kiss
hayes

to cut it or the patient
can we just concentrate
on the operation thank you
all right now today
we have a simple cholecystectomy
if we dont traumatize
the surrounding tissue here
we can have this patient
going home in a couple days
you ready dr ballentine
let do it
okay scalpel
dr wyler id like you
to perform the honors
now if you can just make
an incision from here to here

here in the midline from here
at least he had the decency to wind up on the floor
vivian
yes
hi
lauren hi
hi lauren
hi
what are you doing here
i got off early
i thought id bring something we
could have dinner together is that okay
i dont have time
to take a break
not even to eat
i grabbed something earlier
i asked you if it would be okay if i
stopped by and you said it would be
yeah i thought
it was gonna be later
yeah well it cant be later cause im
working a shift tonight you know that
i dont remember what shift youre working on
lucky you remember anything

all i want is 0 minutes with
my husband that i never see
i think were gonna take a little walk
no im sorry dont go
no it okay there
things that we need to do
it okay
it fine
dr rose what if we were to come in under
the bed of the ninth rib instead of the th
suction
we would risk traumatizing the pleural space
possibly resulting
in a pneumothorax
what other approach
could we use hayes
well the patient has
a very large tumor
and the added exposure by going in
through the ninth rib would lead me
hang in there hayes
come on buddy hang in there
im fine im fine it would
lead me to use that approach
i think youre right
are we all in agreement
pressure looks good
two-silk
suture
dr chatham
what if the patient were to spike tonight
in post-op and develop a distended abdomen
clamp
worry about intra-abdominal bleeding check for sepsis
what kind of workup
would you do
complete cbc look for
an increase in white count
get a blood culture
urine culture chest x-ray
more suction please
very good
hemostat and sponge
cut
damn vivian
hayes

diet and some supplemental fluids
to get you up

make it through the operation
no it mainly to help you
after the operation
i told you before

cut this
scissors cut
what do we have to
watch for here rose
superior mesenteric artery
cut right here
scissors okay
it completely
encased the aorta
we cant get it out without
compromising the intestinal blood supply
well what did the pre-op
ivp show
the mass didnt cross
the midline
all right
were out of here
isnt there
something we can do
you know dr rose
sometimes you have to know when to quit
and hope to come back
to fight another day
maybe after some chemo
we can come back in here but
close him
two layers of nylon please
shit
go ahead
man close him up
suture pick-ups
how ya doin
look there no way
you can test for that
it not your fault
come on
what do you care
what are you talking about
i could have tested for it
i shouldve thought of an angiogram
next time
what do you mean next time
youve got it
wrapped up chatham
im gonna stay at nell
i left the number on the table
for how long
i dont know a while
i just gotta get through
this year on top
you knew that
this would be hard
i knew youd have to work i
didnt know youd have to resent me
i dont resent you i
kenny every time you walk in here
and im waiting for you you resent me
every time i call you
you resent me
every time we go out with your
friends and i dont have anything to say
forget it you dont hear
and i can take that
what i cant take is how this
goddamn competition has changed you
you havent made me
a part of things
the patient weight is 20 pounds
hemoglobin is up to 07
however future weight gain will not be
as dramatic falling off by 20 percent
therefore offsetting any advantage that
we may gain by delaying the operation
very good
dr ballentine and i are gonna do our little
work in the or so we can get you out of here
well it about time everyone
stopped talking and did something
i agree dr ballentine is
gonna be performing the surgery
and ive also asked dr chatham
to scrub so he can assist
so well all be seeing you
in the or
okay spirits up
are you nervous
no
that was good
i am scared
dont be there no reason to be scared
everyone here is the best you
dont need to worry about it i promise

dr chatham work in here for a little while
come on chatham

metzenbaums

esophagus to the jejunum

to drain this
with a long ng tube
and multiple drains
let get all the packs out of
here and take a sponge count
dont wanna leave anything in there
yes sir
can you wrap up here
i got a plane to catch
all right thanks very much
people youve been great
dr chatham
yes sir
you did real good in there
thank you sir
why dont you
close up shop for us
yes sir
dr chatham
report to post-op
dr michael chatham
to post-op
sarah how she doing
i checked her last 20 minutes
ago there definitely a dip
dr ballentine leave any instructions
no
thank you
dr ballentine
sir dr ballentine
what
henrietta walker condition is getting worse
her blood pressure dropping
her pulse is thready
and her urine output
is very low sir
that just third spacing after
abdominal surgery it happens all the time
sir i know about third spacing
i think this may be cardiac
dr ballentine
report to er stat
dr ballentine to er
stat
just increase her fluids
and keep an eye on her
sir i was thinking
what about adding dopamine
if we did it would increase her
chatham you think too much
just increase her fluids
how is she doing
bp way down
and urine output almost at 0
what are you gonna do
dr ballentine excuse me i need
to talk to you about miss walker
i cant right now
sir she not responding
we have to do something
do what
she not dehydrated sir
she in cardiogenic shock
she needs some dopamine
to increase her cardiac output
sir i learned
about this in medicine
look every third-year student
thinks their patient has
what they just learned about
shell respond to the fluids ill
get up there as soon as i can
when that when she codes
get the hell out of here
look the best thing you can do is
just let it go and hope for the best
did you try redding
no i cant reach him
he on a plane somewhere
youre stuck man
it ballentine patient
he the doctor
chances are he right
what if he not
you cant buck protocol
theyll kick you out youll lose
the internship everything go home
youre beat there
nothing more you can do
stat
waiting on a co-signature
do you have any idea of the
seriousness of what youve done
yes sir broke protocol
you cut yourself off
from the hospital
you challenged and overruled
a resident of mine
whose experience outweighs you
by quite a few years
sir it was clear miss walker was not
responding as expected to the medication
her readouts were extremely low
i had to do something
no dr chatham
dr ballentine
had to do something
he was also aware of the
factors affecting her condition
and it was his studied opinion to
continue the medication as planned
sir he was not aware
well then it your
responsibility to make him aware
at the moment i thought the patient life
was more important than the rules sir
what would you have done
that not the point
i cannot run a program
where a student is allowed
to act on his own
no matter how good his intentions are
i would rather accept the
responsibility of breaking the rules
than losing
a patient life sir
and if your choice had
proved to be incorrect
would you have been prepared to
accept the responsibility for her death
saving someone life does not
make you infallible dr chatham
were human
we make mistakes
i think you have the makings
of a fine doctor
but you havent even begun to experience
the complications of a human body
now until youre able to understand
the limits of your knowledge
im not gonna allow you
to practice in this hospital
youre suspended from all duty
until further notice
yes sir
i dont believe it
i counted it up i spent 68 hours
away from this place since we got here
that 28 days
i dont know where to go
hey
we need goblets on 6
you got it
you doing okay
yeah
how school
chatham got suspended
what happened
broke a rule
he went against ballentine
so i guess that makes you
number one
congratulations
the day you left
i operated on this guy
we opened him up
and there was nothing we could do for him
i felt so helpless
i would have done anything
to help that guy
michael felt the same way
the thing is
he saved ballentine ass
but he getting screwed for it
i dont know
what important anymore
except i know
that you are
do you think youre coming home
dad
michael
what are you doing here
your mother called me
i wanna know what happened
i made a decision
that what happened
there a lot of people who
think i did the wrong thing
i know i did the right thing
im prepared to accept
the responsibility
listen when i
was starting out
i wanted to believe that
medicine was an exact science
but there are
too many variables
too many random possibilities
i finally understood
that my instinct
was as important
as my knowledge
that actually my knowledge
informed my instinct
and that i should trust it
it took a lot of courage
to believe that
but i knew that if i turned my back
on something i really believed in
that id never be able
to live with myself
if you did something because
you really believed in it
you did the right thing son
is your hearing tomorrow
yeah
come on
let talk about it
dr chatham the facts of this
incident are pretty much on the table
except for one area
why dr ballentine didnt respond to your
request for examination of mrs walker
i cant speak for dr ballentine
sir
would you say that you had a close
relationship with the patient mrs walker
i knew her fairly well
fairly well
she was my patient
during my medicine rotation
ive followed her progress
for the past several months
and you kept up with her case even after
you had moved on to a different rotation
yes sir i was
interested in her progress
do you think it possible doctor
that your relationship with the patient
might have clouded your reasoning
and caused you to be unduly alarmed
perhaps even overemotional in
your conversations with dr ballentine
no sir that impossible
i responded to the evidence
michael is there any reason
that youre aware of
that dr ballentine didnt
respond to your prompting
dr ballentine is
an excellent physician
he been in this situation
numerous times
now given that information can you think of
any reason why he should ignore your advice
no sir i cant
thank you doctor the
board will review the information
dr redding will make a final
determination in a day or so
you may go
thank you sir
dr redding
hey rose
congratulations
on the internship
it not official yet
but it will be way to go
it was a pleasure
working with you sir
dr redding
dr rose
about michael chatham
i thought you should know the problem
between him and dr ballentine is personal
michael been seeing
gina wyler
dr ballentine
had been dating her
are you implying that dr ballentine
would jeopardize a patient
because of a problem
with michael chatham
im saying it a factor
that hasnt been taken into consideration
in michael chatham suspension
you understand if what youre telling me
has any bearing at all on his suspension
youre the one that has
the most to lose by it
i guess that why im here
im the most credible person
you could hear this from
habit
she doing fine
gonna be released next week
yeah
michael
hi
hi
i came by but you havent been home
ive been out
are you okay
yeah im fine where are you working tonight
emergency listen i think
that you should know
kenny went to see redding
about donald
whatd he say
why dont you ask him
will you come by
and visit me later
yeah sure
okay
kenny
how it going
listen i heard you talked to redding
yeah dont hold your breath
he wasnt knocked out by it
whyd you do it you got
