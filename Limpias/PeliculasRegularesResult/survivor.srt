security breach
everybody in the conference room in 0
nero franks maltese national
over the weekend he tried to board
an oceanic airlines flight
from heathrow to chicago
alarms went off when franks
presented his passport
it didnt have the new digital watermark
franks tried to run
mi5 thought he was a suicide
bomber and took him out take a look
nero franks was a
scientist with no priors
working for a german chemical outfit
his specialty was
combustible gas munitions
the brits and the germans
are still looking
for a possible terrorist connection
but no joy so far
so here the issue for us people
now our enemies know
they cant forge visas
that means theyll be looking
for ways to get real ones
the kind you hand out every day
were working with all the british security
agenciesbut theyre stretched really thin
budget cuts plus they have
homegrown terrorists to worry about
were not saying that u hv
to give the 3rd degree
90% of our applicants
are straightforward
it the remaining 0%
that i lose sleep over
any app that tweaks u the
wrong waytake it straight 2 kate
she excelled at this work in washington
what sam really means is
youll need someone to blame
if the wrong guy gets through
so use me
what im really interested in
is anyone with scientific expertise
specialists in chemicals or gases
any questions
all right gang back to work
that fine madam
your visa will be ready tomorrow
she never seen the ball drop
in times square on new year eve
have a good stay
in the united states sister
thank you sir
so do you promise to watch me
when im on american idol
oh absolutely
what
have a good stay
thank you very much bye-bye
dr balan good afternoon
i was told my paperwork is in order
this wont take long
romanian citizen
you have listed a medical conference
as the reason
for visiting the united states
yes
this conference is for pediatricians
youre a general practitioner
i work in a clinic
for newly arrived immigrants
many of my patients are children
dr balan it also says that you consult
for vicker pharmaceuticals
im curious why we dont have
a letter from them
ive only been there a few months
is there a problem
i certainly hope not
let me see this file
im not done with my review
a word
you dont think it strange that a gp
who also happens to be a researcher
wants to attend a pediatrics conference
there nothing odd about moonlighting
as a consultant to make a few extra bucks
besides naomi already did
the background check
balan fine
ill be the judge of that
look i know you were a high-flyer in dc
i am not here on vacation
even when it slow were not
processing people fast enough
were seriously understaffed
so when paperwork gets held up by security
people start missing flights
and im the one that has to deal
with their complaints
unless you wanna suffer
the ambassador wrath
im doing my job bill
we all are
we have a problem
a new security expert
from washington
her name is kate abbott
she knows about vicker
so no visa
she trouble im telling you
ill take care of her
this way please
sweet of you to stop in
there something you need to see
ill have it done tomorrow
lisa
hey
im so sorry
it okay i saved us
a bottle of bubbles
oh youre the best
so how did it go
would you believe i sold every damn one
no
yes
but i saved those for you
i know you have a thing
for the underworld
thank you
oh wow
so all work and no play huh
it complicated
is everything a state secret with you
it so beautiful
hello
hi naomi it kate
im so sorry it so late
it okay is something wrong
you remember a guy
you processed a while ago
sri lankan researcher
by the name of fazli sameer
uh yeah i was checking him out
when bill pulled the file
why
he said i had too much on my plate
and hed handle it
okay all right thanks so much bye
actually dr balan
did ask me for a reference
request slipped through the cracks
ill get my secretary
to draft one today
oh would it be possible to see
dr balan security clearance
what this really about
i just thought since i was here itd be
about that
if you were even remotely familiar
with the british defense ministry
standards on secrecy
were on the same side here
you need to present a proper written
authorization from the home office
to even inquire
about security clearances
dr perry i
it time for you to leave
get inspector anderson for me please
hey howie
hey sweetie what up
listen i need the list
of this month visa files
yeah
there no authorization
oh parker probably forgot to call
could you remind him
yes oh
bye
bye bye-bye
you wanted to see me
miss abbott i believe you know
inspector paul anderson
from counter terrorism command
good morning
why are you making inquiries
into the security status
of a british resident dr emil balan
he applied for a visa to come
to the united states
so you took it upon yourself to go to
his workplace and interrogate his superior
rather than contacting my office
dr balan needs his visa today
i just thought it would be faster
not to go through proper channels
what this about paul
the director perry
contacted me personally
to complain that ms abbott had been
making unauthorized inquiries
then he called his friend
the home secretary
who asked me
if you have issued the visa
no i havent
is there a problem
ambassador crane
inspector sorry im late
i didnt know you were joining us
i didnt either
the home secretary just called
so what the problem
i cant discuss the details
of an ongoing investigation
were talking about a medical professional
with serious political connections
is this really a matter
of national security
sam
it her call im standing by it
ill inform the home secretary
accordingly
but let me tell you something about balan
that you probably dont know
a few years ago
his wife applied for a visa
for emergency medical treatment
in the united states
she died because some bureaucrat
kept asking for one more piece of paper
under the circumstances
you might consider showing her widower
a little compassion ms abbott
ambassador
congratulations youre already making
enemies in high places
keep it up
sam get control of this situation
you okay
yeah
thanks for backing me up

thank you
help
naomi
alvin joyce
help
there someone hurt
abbott still alive
where
following the embassy survivor protocol
that what theyre trained to do
make sure she doesnt survive
what are you hearing sally
a restaurant blew
the place looks like a killing zone
gas made the explosion
according to first responders
radio chatter it was a bomb
im working on getting
security video feeds
where was the hit
just a few blocks away
do we have anyone in the area
the visa crew took bill
to lunch at gaston
christ waring lane
oh god
american embassy
all right sir
how long until this is fully out
hours
how many
four of yours two waiters
saleswoman from the glassware shop
and five passersby
and more than a dozen wounded
the blast originated
where your people were seated
has anyone claimed responsibility
no
the bomb took out most of the security
cameras near the restaurant
dont know how much
of the feed well recover
is that all of em
we found this in the shop
abbott must have been in there
when the bomb went off
do you think she dead
we cant find her
joyce robert alvin naomi
theyre all dead
oh my god
bill talbot was supposed to be
at that restaurant
he stayed behind
to take a secure link call
if he was running late
he should be somewhere
between the embassy and the restaurant
get a lock on the trackers
on bill and kate ids right now
okay that was the search team
there still no sign of abbott
so what do we know about her
only child born and raised in montana
parents are deceased
stanford university
then a two-year scholarship for graduate
studies at the university of london
she applied to the state department
scored high enough to get into
the bureau of diplomatic security
she single-handedly unraveled a plot
to bomb the american embassy in 20
okay so she knows the city
and she good at her job
tell me something i dont know
well she better than good
london considered a senior posting
she speaks four languages three of them
being russian arabic and mandarin
wait she cia
we dont know
okay until proven otherwise
we assume abbott is alive
that makes her a material witness
and quite possibly a suspect
get her details out to the police
mi5 the media
if she wandering around injured
surely a security camera will pick her up
no shell know better than that
but put her friends especially
that photographer lisa carr
under surveillance
abbott might reach out to her
i had a lock on kate locator
but the signal keeps breaking up
kate knows were tracking
her embassy id
she following protocol
heading for the safe zone in the park
talbot already there
ill be there in two minutes
kate
bill
thank god youre all right okay
okay
bill theyre all dead
i know i know
all right come here
bill i tried to save them
there nothing left
let walk here
i tried to save them
i know relax
there was there was a man
with a gun outside he almost
why couldnt you have left things
alone kate now i have no choice
kate
bill
look look over there see
danny come here
get away she got a gun
it was an accident
he tried
someone call the police
somebody help him
someone call the police
yeah yeah lancaster gate yeah
excuse me
damn it
witnesses saw abbott holding a gun
and talbot staggering toward the fountain
and this time we have video evidence
please paul
give me the chance to find her
im sorry sam i have my orders
look i know that you track your people
using gps chips in their ids
it how you knew
that talbot and abbott were here
hang on a second
where bill id
im sure well find it my point is this
assuming abbott still has her id
you can find her
and it best im there when you do
the kid video went viral
the home secretary saw it
got on to the foreign office
now she wanted for deadly assault
and questioning in a terrorist incident
kate has diplomatic immunity
you cant touch her
you know we wont take chances
with people like that sam
come in
who are you
trevor i work with fred
i only work with fred shut the door
he ill do you want my help or not
the signal is active
youd better hurry
what happening
with those trackers sally
someone must have taken bill talbot
it moved away from the park
at the moment it stationary
off russell square
there still a problem with kate
the tracker must have got damaged
in the explosion
what the last location
we have for her
lamb market off curzon street
and youre sure no one else can track her
absolutely only you and me
i need to get to her sally
that exactly what anderson
is expecting you to do
and hell be right behind you
with an sas team
kate knows what to do sam
it more important
we find talbot tracker
whoever has it might be able to tell us
what really happened in that park
the fireworks in dubai
that was you right
now you can follow
whoever has one of these
and the second item
straight from the lab
used by the security services
dials you into their field agent
communication system
you shouldnt have asked about dubai
were in the italian gardens
on the north side of kensington gardens
where a short time ago
sally
the met has issued a warrant
for kate arrest
horrific explosion earlier today
at a popular restaurant not far from here
this is sam parker leave a message
god damn it
and bill talbot tracker
fell off the grid five minutes ago
taken by a witness here
we can show you these images now
there is a woman seen
running from the scene
section 5
sally it me
where are you ive been monitoring you
but your tracker keeps shorting out
you have to give me your location kate
kate kate
damn
sam what going on
did you find talbot tracker
no just a dead guy
what
talk to me about kate
she called in two minutes ago
hung up before i could get a location
sam you need to get back here
the ambassador on the warpath
he must have missed abbott
tell the pickup teams to stand down
let see what so interesting
about that hotel
what do i have to do to convince you
oh come on please give me a break
just one phone call
look it was a present
it sterling okay please
local call only
okay
hello
it me
kate oh my god ive been watching
the news where are you
lisa please i need clothes and money
all right ill go to your place
uh no no no it not safe um
can you just come meet me
and bring me some of your things
where
somewhere where there a lot of people
st pancras station
by the christmas market two hours
what the composition of the gas
a precise mixture of hydrogen
methane and fluorine
the volume in new york
will be four times greater
so will the results
made to the exact specifications
necessary to trigger this device
im curious why not use
a detonator in new york
at major events
the police carry
beeper-size radiation detectors
there bomb-sniffing dogs
hazmat units
if there any sign of an alert
even a false alarm
the first thing the authorities do
is kill all communications
jam radio frequencies
shut down all cell phone towers
then we have the counter snipers
placed in a 500-meter radius
however
i shall be firing
outside their perimeter
soon my friend
so now there only the girl
just make sure my shipment
gets to new york that all i ask
the large gas explosion
ripped through the housing estate
in tower hamlets
thanks
what have you got for me maureen
the president is demanding answers
i just spoke with the british home
secretary they dont have her do we
abbott tracker was damaged in the blast
we lost her signal for the moment
but even if we get it back
the brits have snatch teams ready to go
if i try to make a move on abbott
and happen to get lucky on her location
i lead her right to anderson
sam she a liability
kate had nothing to do
with bill murder
go ahead
um this morning kate took
the monthly visa list
the flash drive contains
all of the background checks
and references on the applicants
if we find there been
a possible terrorist breach
that usually the first place we look
she said youd okayed it
did you
no
what about the backup systems
five files were permanently
deleted earlier today
the entry log shows
that it was abbott id
it gets worse
we checked the security log
abbott has been working a lot of nights
when there no one around
it possible that she created documents
to get somebody into the country
and then erased the records
to cover herself
may i remind you that just five
weeks ago you sent her over here
with glowing recommendations
because we needed the best
if i recall correctly
she was one of your protegees
although im sure youll deny that now
i was skeptical at first
but it turns out you were right
she an extraordinary asset
yeah just not for us
that complete bullshit
and deep in your scared little souls
you all know it
we dont assume the worst
of our best people
and we damn sure dont sell them out
at the first sign of trouble
but most of all
we dont forget motivation
and kate is sterling
she lost some
of her best friends on 9/
then why is she still running
she on the move
where kate
the last time we got a signal
leicester square
and that was 0 minutes ago
it was barely registering
jesus you look how i feel
how are you holding up
were monitoring
anderson communications
his people are looking hard
but in all the wrong places
how did it go upstairs
they want me to try to bring in kate
use anderson if i have to
from anderson forensic lab
dont ask how i got it
the bomb has traces of chromium
we havent seen that since
paris two years ago
the watchmaker
or whatever he calls himself these days
whoever wanted the visa crew dead
paid for the best operator in the business
he had so much reconstructive surgery
no one knows what the hell he looks like
she in st pancras station
ill have to take the chance
and where abbott friend
she just turned off the euston road
into st pancras station
all right stay with her im on my way
please allow
passengers off the train first
please allow passengers
off the train first
for your safety and security
cctv is in operation in every station
code lucifer repeat code lucifer
lisa
suspected suicide bomber
at northeast entrance
okay move move move move move
what the matter
did you bring the money
did you bring it
kate youve got to tell me something
stay here dont move
until someone tells you to
what
kate kate
move move
move move move abbott
you had your chance to help me sam
make sure he doesnt follow us
abbott
there no way out abbott
it a dead end
this way sir
damn it
it this way
abbott
abbott stop
stop
stop
follow her
abbott
no this way
i think she went this way
shit shit
shit
shit
we can seal them off from the street
what you think she gonna take
an officially marked tourist exit
there are hundreds
of other ways out of here
she could be anywhere
what
jesus
fucking technology
bitch
sam
oh come on
you know i didnt do any of this
gotcha
you sure it was the same guy you saw
after the restaurant explosion
yes and he was in the park
after bill tried to kill me
so he could have followed you here
give me your id
we dont need anybody else tracking you
you think he tracked me all this time
sam who is he
his code name is the watchmaker
he one of the most wanted
assassins in the world
you doing okay
how did you know i would come here
i didnt
i just came looking for answers
what are we doing with our lives
i put everything into this
and what am i now a suspect a target
maybe both
were doing this because
we believe in that old-fashioned idea
of country right
or at least protecting
our fellow citizens
our friends
right now im doing it
to protect my own hide
that good thinking
what that
it the flash drive i got from howie
last month we processed
over 600 visa applications
and bill personally intervened in five
of those cases including balan
now for each applicant he used
a different member of the visa team
and when i started asking questions
he ignored me slammed them through
so what the connection
between the applicants
i dont know yet
but we do know balan is an expert
in combustible gases
maybe bill had the answer
bill said something strange in the park
now i have no choice
he must have kept some information
about the people he let in
a little leverage in case he needed it
who puts a padlock on a bedroom door
hello my lovely
god
is this bill son
yeah
johnny died in afghanistan
something about this
just doesnt add up
it like bill was expecting him to walk
through the door at any minute
take it apart
everything
look at this
hi dad im doing okay
hope you are too
itll be christmas soon
wish we could be together
johnny been alive all this time
do you think there a chance
i doubt it look at his eyes
he swimming in dope
someone kept him alive for as long
as possible to get this footage
but how did they know it was
bill son or who bill was
they must have someone
with access to army records
doesnt have to be a major player
a guy inputting data could be enough
once they knew it was bill
they threatened to kill his son
if he didnt give them what they wanted
which makes bill actions understandable
but not excusable
because once bill got his people into
the states it was only a matter of time
before he eliminated everyone
who handled the paperwork
then he got the bastard
who murdered them to come after me
the watchmaker would never deal
with low-level guys like bill
his business is
with whoever had bill son
you said there were four others
besides balan
yeah and every single one
of them is in america
we need to move now
ill get archer to meet us out front
come on come on come on
what wrong
let get the hell out of here
sam
kate
kate
sally
kate
is sam still alive
barely
he pretty badly hurt kate
hold on anderson on the scene
he coming on the line with crane
madam ambassador
im at bill talbot apartment
sam parker been critically injured
jesus
witnesses saw abbott running from
the scene and we found her embassy id
where is she now
we dont know
if you get her in your sights
do not hesitate do you understand
yes i do
the longer she lives
the more people die
kate
im here
im so sorry
they think you tried to kill him
what that insane
i need to get into the embassy
to the vault
the building on total lockdown
there no other way
kate listen to me
the place is crawling with marines
you know im innocent
and i know im right about this plot
you have to get me in sally
im at the north roll-up door
im buzzing you in now
im shutting down the cameras
in the stairwell and the vault
in and out as fast as you can
attention security breach
at basement level
oh god no
there a terrorist
headed for the states
emil balan he traveling
on a romanian passport
oceanic airlines flight 428
out of heathrow to jfk
they have to stop him sally
we missed her she got herself a new
passport and then wasted the hard drive
the name she used the passport number
theyre gone she could be anyone
get abbott picture to security
at all london airports and train stations
yes yes yes what is it
the purpose of your visit doctor
medical conference
there still time to stop balan
madam ambassador if you act now
no dont you see what abbott doing
she is trying to get us to chase
a shadow instead of her
youre supposed to have left
for new york
im not sure im going
what the hell are you talking about
i found your reaction
to that little explosion quite instructive
the way your eyes lit up
the greed i saw in them
fortunes are made
when there blood on the streets
and very soon there gonna be
a great deal of blood
on the streets of new york wont there
just as there was after 9/
however when the new york
exchanges reopened
people who bet against the market
made a fortune
this isnt an act of terror
or a bold political statement
balan may wish to avenge
his wife death
but for you
it just about making money
$00 billion is in play i would say
the word just doesnt quite fit
if i stay home you wont make a penny
what do you want
half
half of your short-selling profits
on the new york exchanges
the day they reopen for trade simple
is the girl dead
very
for security reasons
please do not leave baggage unattended
baggage left unattended will be removed
and may be destroyed
ill grab these too
yeah got it
there you go thanks
thank you
thank you

is a security officer and a serious threat
find her
