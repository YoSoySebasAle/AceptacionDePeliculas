shoot lots of closeups
found anything yet
just a collection of compacts
here inspector
thanks
no fingerprints inspector
naturally
and no other leads
no
here the permission
to remove the body
so early
the examining magistrate in a hurry
alright
the hearse is here
inspector
inspector
just carry on
are you finished here
yes couldnt find anything
so sweet so dead
they were slashed with a blade
a very sharp one
in the area of the mouth
and the chin
there are marks of a hand
like a vice
l believe the deed
happened like this
he must have
grabbed her like this
and then the mortal cut
and the other injuries
a series of uncontrolled stabs
but not to the living person
but to
the dead body
to stab someone like that
you must hate him
or be a maniac
photos were found next to the woman
showing her in the arms of a man
a lover presumably
his face was made unrecognizable
it possible
as soon as youre finished doctor
id like to have your report
certainly inspector
in full detail
shall we go
l examined the photos
left beside the body
if we figure out
why the man face was erased
we might have a lead
why not
the face was scratched away
with a razor or something similar
we could blow up the photos to see
if there are any moles or other blemishes
but then what
should we ask every male in town
to strip for us
id take a look around
the environment of the victim
right but unfortunately
that a very closed world
she was the wife
of a general
you think her friends will tell us
with whom she went to bed
and what do you
intend to do now
ill throw out the net
and hope well catch
all the right fishes
you said at the day in question
you had some tests done at the hospital
youre just wasting
your time with me
l dont go to whores
and i pity the guys who do poor fellas
ah yeah maybe you hate them
isnt that right cleopatra
all men should be brothers
l really dont hate anybody
and why do you keep saying murderer
could be a lady
yes sure
and what would you be
one who doesnt get on anybody tits
on the contrary
her husband a general untouchable
be quiet
inspector
inspector sir
those losers
it always us
yeah right
look who coming
hey cleopatra how the pharaoh
good one
i got rid of the journalists
theyre always expecting a miracle
if they were in our place
found out anything
no these folks belong to
a whole different circle
well i think it no use
but keep interrogating them
im going home
alright inspector
call me if you need me
sure thing
aw the asshole taking off
and were supposed to spend the night here
are you paying for the business i lose
calm down calm down
now well type up
a nice report
after that you may all go back
to your honorable jobs
his job
aint too shabby either
what bothering you
try to stay calm
relax
and stop worrying
so much
yes it easy to say that
this is worse than the mob
just unbelievable
no trace of her lover
what did you expect
and who should name him
the betrayed husband the parents
think of the scandal
the problems are always
for those left behind
like me for instance
the papers are attacking us
and the commissioner gave me hell
bring me some proof
and do it quick
try harder capuana
but be very careful
dont step on anybody feet
im begging you
that the motto
do it make him happy
what can it cost you
and how should i do that
every step i take
is wrong
today everything different
l cant question people anymore
that the
magistrate job now
if you catch one
he wont spill the beans
or shows up
with his lawyer in tow
if they dont say anything
there nothing i can do
whoever the murderer is
how it possible
he didnt leave any traces behind
he very smart
and cunning
but these photos of the naked victims
and their lovers
they have some purpose
theyre our lead our only one
do you think
he from around
l think so yes
he acted very skillfully
didnt you say we have
to leave here earlier
unfortunately yes
you know how it is
with my husband
when he organizes a bridge evening
he furious when im late
l better get going then
but you should
hurry too serena
first i have to make myself
presentable gianni
to me
you already are
did you know that you look best
when youre naked
didnt anybody tell you yet
what this
an interrogation
you want me to confess
l wont fall for that
so you have been
told that before
you dont seem to object
do you
just keep playing
with me
ill see you soon
yes
no no
no no
another young woman
found massacred at the beach
all policemen of the town
are looking for leads
that might
convict the killer
your panic
is absolutely unjustified
no one could recognize you
in that photo
i advice you as your lawyer
to stay calm
let them do their work
but somebody knows about serena and me
so what
that inspector
is clever
he cares about his position
and his career
stay calm
he knows he has to move very carefully
with the most guarded discretion
but maybe hell get the wrong ideas
with a butchered woman
the first suspect
will be the lover or the husband
yes yes that right
but not in our circles
the first victim
was the wife of a general
and the second one your poor serena
she had an important name
one of the really important people
and now what should i do
go on living
like nothing happened
and if the inspector
does show up one day
you call me
right away
hello daddy
im sorry
l thought you were alone
were finished i was about to leave
how are you
fine thanks
is there a problem
no problem
we can discuss it later bye
bye
dont take off okay
go play tennis
dont forget the bridge evenings
business as usual
and try to stay calm
alright ill do my best
but it not gonna be easy
this second murder
is a carbon copy of the first one
the murder weapon
was the same too
everything matches
the fioravanti case
even the method used in killing her
and the photos with the lover
how did
the husband react
he in a state
of collapse
he didnt suspect his wife
to be a whore
but are you sure he had nothing to do
with the murder of his wife
maybe he just pretending
maybe he was out for revenge
we checked his alibi
it all in order
were also keeping an eye
on her lover
we know he consulted
his lawyer
but nothing else
no misstep
it sure would be odd if hed taken
photographs of himseif and his mistress
and then put them
next to her corpse
even if his face was erased
sure
that gastone
the one who prepares
the cadavers
he always laughs like that
when he approves of his own work
come have a look
come in come in professor
hello gastone
you cant see the cut
on her throat anymore
and also the other injuries
look you too inspector
look she beautiful
gastone is an artist
a real artist
with wax and make-up
he makes miracles
he loves his work
now dress her put her in the coffin
and set it up in the mortuary
her parents will be here in an hour
okay
how beautiful you are
almost prettier than when you were living
stop
rewind it a little
why what did you see capuana
these are only people
we already know
all of them unsuspicious
go ahead
stop keep it there
it terrible
poor serena she really
didnt deserve to die like that
such a horrible death
that true
and her husband
did you see him
a broken man
considering all the things the
newspapers write im getting scared too
youre scared
and why
should you be scared
because the papers say
the killer is a crazed moral avenger
and it seems only logic to me that
you catch my drift
l dont know
what there to catch
he only kills
unfaithful wives
youre right barbara
you shouldnt be scared franca
at least as far
as im informed
l dont think that funny
first floriana
then serena and now what
who next
nonsense dont let this get into your head
dont meet trouble halfway
it about time
cant we change the subject
good let talk
about men
it not really worth the risk
dont you think
do you
dont you as well
the husband ruled out
and so is the lover
all in all capuana
we have absolutely nothing
oh well
that the way it is
commissioner
l have checked
and re-checked
l could still arrest the husband
if you think it of any use
for heaven sake
anybody just not the husband
you know
he in the public eye
you see this phone
it hasnt stop ringing since yesterday
many recommendations
some real exquisite ones among them
you have any proof against him
no
then leave him alone
no no proofs
he only thought about politics
and she about love
the unfortunate truth is that were sitting
on a barrel of dynamite my dear capuana
one false move
and we all fry
and to be honest
l find it pleasant to live in this town
and you my friend
same here
but i think there as much rotten
in small towns as there is in big cities
wherever they transfer me
l know what to expect
do you have a plan
no the killer knows
the habits of his victims
so he knows his way around
the rich parts of the town
that where i have to look for him
but be careful
l dont want you to venture
into even higher circles
no not here
please
im scared darling
l dont like this place
it dangerous all alone out here
im begging you
but what are you afraid of my love
you dont think im the killer do you
what are you saying
but why out here in the open
it not easy to find an apartment
and i dont want to go to your place
if it about money
dont worry about it
come on
im begging you let go
but renata
im begging you
it you inspector
dont worry
im not here in an
official capacity mr gastone
l was passing by your house and thought
l might have a chat with gastone
the right hand
of casali
how long have you been working
with the professor
two years ever since i got here
ah very nice
please do come in
thank you
very cozy in here
yes please have a seat
smoke
you were saying
i didnt say anything
ah yes
do you like your work
i sure do
otherwise
l wouldnt do it
as you wouldnt do yours
if you didnt like it
well said
and what do you do
when youre not working
l rarely go out
l take care
of my flowers
a nice place
very well kept
you live alone
you want to know
why im not married
oh no that none
of my business
it lovely here
nice and bright
in here
and what over there
the bathroom and the kitchen
l only have two rooms
it not easy for a man of my profession
to find a woman you know
sooner or later
they find out
about the corpses
and then it over
before it even started
and what is this
it a small photo lab
well this is not
a search
l will go now
do you want
to have a look at it
if you dont mind
i dont
please
i have to tell you something inspector
go on
this might sound absurd
but if you didnt know them
would you think theyre dead
look how beautiful
they are
more beautiful than alive
death cleansed them
no more traces of sin
or human misery
and all thanks to me
that why i love my work
you see three minutes
agostini would have made it faster
very funny
besides im driving slower
when im with you
you know what
you like me
yes but i also like
school these days
and public gatherings
talks with teachers protests collectives
l like collectives too
but only the ones with you
you reactionary
youre a spoiled bourgeois
not even shocking current events
shake you
you mean the maniac
who cares about him
he only after the old timers
youre right
but that also affects us
my parents dont want me
to go out anymore
i have only five minutes
for you
youre talking like your father
youre not a good revolutionary
ill stay as long
as you want
but i didnt come here
to talk about politics
yes
what do you want
youre mistaken
this is the residence of the lawyer santangeli
why did you hang up
was that the guy who always dials
the wrong number
who
i dont know what you mean paolo
you do know what i mean
dont try to make me an idiot
you think i dont know your latest mistress
even though she lives next door
im taking the same liberties as you do
very well
that was plain enough
but we shouldnt forget something
what
we have
a reputation to lose
and with that reputation
our wealth this house and a daughter
are you speaking for me
or for you
for both of us
your private life
doesnt interest me
but i dont want a scandal
it strange this killer
he only after
adulteresses
so what
he might rid you of me
you would like that wouldnt you
no not at this price
please do me a favor
pay another visit to your mother
like you do so often these days
but this time you actually go
you thought about everything
didnt you
in my opinion this solution
is acceptable and elegant
when all this is over
you can come back here without fear
please do as i tell you franca
youre in danger
lilly
lilly
hello daddy
everything okay at school
yes
bye
bye
good afternoon
wonderful flowers
madam
to the envy of my wife
your wife doesnt care about them
how your husband
he doesnt care about anything
he not well
ill see you in the evening
at 6 pm
the usual place
scaredy-cat
no inspector
youre following a wrong path
gastone sure is a strange fella
but harmless
he has this morbid passion
for corpses
he beautifies and photographs them
but that all
l once knew someone
who would smash valuable vases
just so he could fix them again
listen capuana
l know youre desperately trying to catch
the murderer who will surely kill again
but gastone is not your man
how can you be so sure
well i know him very well
gastone is not capable
of committing any act of violence
that why he always wants
to erase every trace of it
professor casali i started my career
in sicily and sardinia
where 2 + 2 = 4
there every murder
has a motive
but what motive is there
for these crimes
l dont know
maybe it the work
of a homosexual
a homosexual
yes out of jealousy
my theory
is supported by the fact
that all the lovers faces
have been erased from the photos
that right
or a betrayed husband
just think about it
he kills two three four
unfaithful wives
and then his own wife
who would suspect him
no
or maybe
an impotent man
impotent men often have a mortal hate
for women they cannot possess
in this case
wed have a huge problem
how should i find an impotent man
with a newspaper ad
l have to go
l promised my wife
to come home for supper
at least this one time
why dont you come to my place
for dinner some time
together with your wife
of course
it would be a pleasure
mine too as soon as this is over
it already late
l must go
oh please
it better that way
my love
what that you scared me
youre home so late
youve become unbearable
when you tried to commit suicide
because of me as you claimed
you could at least have done a decent job
and gone to hell
instead of staying here
ruining my life
will i see you in the garden afterwards
why not
mother suffers from insomnia
but shell take her pills
and 5 minutes later
she fast asleep
that it kids your parents dont
want you to come home so late
the same old story
totally exaggerated
im sorry
l made a promise to your parents
all because
of that jerk
why doesnt he screw instead of killing
right on he should have group sex
ill take you home
yes alright
good night
good night
good night
good night kids
bye
im sorry it not my fault
see you
good night
bye
bye see you
my best to your mother
alright then
at half past ten in the garden
okay
yes or no and dont think about it
you know it yes
since day one
isnt that your neighbor
her husband a cripple
and has to go on crutches
she has a lover
they say
and not the first one
at least she has the good taste
not to bring him to her house
will you walk me to the gate
sure
bye
bye
see you tomorrow
lilly
where are you
lilly
make sure you get all the details
get a wide shot from every angle
and lots of closeups
hello casali
good morning inspector
the usual photos were left
next to the body of course
an accident id say
me too
search all his papers
yes
always the same
technique
is there any evidence
of a struggle
yes sure
she was taken by surprise
and tried desperately to resist
just like the others
three murders
in a very short time
the similar techniques
point to the same killer
all killings
seem to be unmotivated
the work of the police
in a case like
faster paolo
youre moving too slow
move move
more force
with more force
spike harder bravo
move to the net
come on come on

he was standing by the pool
l saw him stabbing her
it was a man
wearing a mask
but you saw him
kill her
yes i was like paralyzed
l was frightened stiff
but did you see the killer
yes
did you recognize him

it was too dark
and he wore a stocking over his head
you think he saw you too
yes
he turned around to me

yes let hope for the best
l have to go now
or ill miss my train
im taking the sleeping car
and daddy does he know youre leaving
naturally
he was busy with a client
but he promised to come
to the station to say goodbye
do you have anything to tell me
no
have a good trip
send grandma my love
of course goodbye
the milan-brenner express
is now arriving at track 2
the express from calabria
is running 40 minutes late
the express from calabria
is running 40 minutes late
dead woman
in the sleeping car
the maniac
has killed again
city in fear
panic spreads
everybody sees the killer
police receives numerous calls
a storm of anonymous letters
will the killer strike again
l preferred to come here
on my own free will
my daughter
is still in shock
unfortunately she heard it on the radio
that her mother was killed
just like the others
i understand
thank you
im at your disposal
what do you want to know
youre a lawyer
you know that i have to ask you
some unpleasant questions
naturally inspector
please treat me
like everybody else
therell be fewer misunderstandings
if were frank
your first question
might be
mr santangeli
did you get on that train
indeed that it
l didnt get on
l just saw her
at the very last moment
franca was standing
by the window
l barely managed
to reach for her hand
and to wish her
a good trip
did you see anybody you know
at the station
but who could tell
if someone doesnt intend to find an alibi
he wont pay attention
no
besides
i dont have a motive
there no life insurance
no inheritance
and i dont even
use a razor to shave
but you did forget
an important motive
the revenge
of a betrayed husband
youre an old man
my dear inspector
we live in different times now
franca cheated on me and i knew about it
and my wife knew
that im unfaithful too
we live in a time
where married couples
are looking for other couples
with newspaper ads
to swap wives
do you find that cynical
where were you after your wife departed
after the departure
of the train
please treat me like everybody else
dont beat about the bush
why dont you ask me where were you
when your wife was murdered
alright
then ill ask
what you wanted to be asked
where were you
when your wife was murdered
you should ask that
your commissioner
i was killing him
at the hunt club
in a bridge tournament
of course
i guess were done
with the interview arent we
that right
you can go
you want me to say it again
i didnt call him in
he came
on his own accord
i want to be frank
with you capuana
weve known each other for a long time
that why i dont blame you
but get into your head
that the fuse is burning
this could blow us to pieces
damn it
the lawyer wasnt at the club
i know what im doing
i cant explain my motives
to you
you better go and find out
who his new mistress is
and dont cause me
any more problems
you want me to leave so you can
pass the case on to someone else
dont be ridiculous
you cant give up now
i know it a dirty story
youre the chief of the
criminal investigation division
and you have
my utmost trust
whenever i think
i found the answer
there still
something missing
dont lose heart
and continue your investigation
this damn maniac
must make a mistake some day
maybe
but he hasnt made
the slightest mistake yet
without a doubt he very intelligent
sure
he appointed himself the moral avenger
of the upper class
he knows
all their secrets
all their lovers
and where they meet
he must be one of them
that all we know
that not enough capuana
we have to act faster
we have to catch him quick
if we dont want to get fried
goodbye madam
no
giannina
youre not happy
but you think you are
ah yes
in fact youre scared
scared of a man who threatening you
what man
your husband giannina
for your own good
dont drive him too far
cut it out mom
your husband renata
he trusted you
but now he in doubt
he gone away or pretends he is
in any case youre alone tonight
and without protection
stay here my dear
dont go home
you live too isolated
mom your cards
are getting on my nerves
l see it perfectly clear
renata loves the danger
just like me
after all it the danger
that gives an adventure its flavor
hello
hi
mauro
is he gone
yes he left yesterday
arent you in the mood
for a little night stroll
why dont you
come over
i already told you i cant relax there
someone might see us
but who could possibly
see you
and if your husband
walks in all of a sudden
no he not the type
for surprises
im expecting you dear
come on over
im dying to
make love to you
come on dont keep me in suspense
i want you too
see you soon
renata
renata it me
open the door
renata
youre leaving so early
i just came home
youve been up
all night
yes
i understand
another murder
who is it this time
here read it
oh my god
renata too
it horrible
now there are five
did you read this
theyre attacking the police
i read it
and others will follow
next theyll claim
were on the side of the opposition
why are they making
a political affair out of this
because two of the husbands
are in politics
and the scandal
hurts them
why wont you
just quit all this darling
my father offered you
a good position in his firm
let them go to hell
why dont you accept his offer
you know that not for me
im a cop
what would i do
among refrigerators
yes
when i was transferred here some years ago
i thought i had found some peace
remember
a lovely town
surrounded by green
a low crime rate
only a few
small-time crooks
and then suddenly within two months
the apocalypse
hello capuana speaking
what
and the address sergeant
okay ill come right away
what happened
the maniac called us
maybe we got him
open up
in the name of the law
in the name of the law
open up
dont shoot im unarmed
inside
why did you call us
why
im tired of killing
you see
this is my work
all these whores
wanna know why i did it
in the presence of a magistrate
at the station
but of course
im the man
you were looking for
tell me the truth
l gave you a hard fight
if i hadnt turned myself in
you would have never caught me
l have a diabolic mind
do you know
how i chose my victims
take him away
dont give yourself credit
you never would have
found me on your own
he a publicity seeker
maybe it appears so
but i set the whole thing up
and i hope
it works out
i chose someone who is
the exact opposite of the killer
hoping the real one will fall for it
isnt that right
right if we credit
the murders to a half-wit
the killer feels insulted
and will come out of his hiding
yes this is an
interesting experiment
but the magistrate
it will take him a few days
to discover that he can only
charge the man with misrepresentation
meanwhile i hope that
the culprit gives himself away
alright capuana
i hope so too
i just want you
to be very careful
because of the killer
no because of the press
theyre waiting downstairs
for the usual press conference
good luck in the lion den
yeah yeah
but this time
itll be different
where is the monster now
with the magistrate
what his name
it all on the photos
we gave you
what did he say when he was arrested
that he tired of killing
the he boasted
with his diabolical mind
are you sure
he the culprit
this is what we found in his house
a pair of gloves
a hat a knife
and a black mask
you have
any other proof
of course we also recapitulated
his life during the last few months
but the preliminary arrest
can only be prolonged for two days
i want to make one thing clear
this was not an arrest
and no arrest warrant
has been issued
meaning what
as of now he only a witness
he turned himself in
what your opinion
im not the magistrate
he has to make the decisions
that would be all
gentlemen
thank you
be seeing you soon
