see you ben
eight oclock

the new edition at least
the first one was banned
35 years ago

police officer
mr fremont
you are ben fremont
manager of the argus book store
youre puttin me on
mr fremont id better
introduce myself officially
im sergeant kellog
assigned to the vice bureau
of the county sheriff office
i knew you seemed weird
my partner here
is officer lverson
mr fremont were
placing you under arrest
under section 32
of the california penal code
what the hell for
the code states that any person
who knowingly offers to distribute
any obscene matter
is guilty of a misdemeanour
the district attorney feels that
the book the seven minutes
by jj jadway would be found
obscene if taken to court
you cant arrest me
im just a guy who sells books
ijust work here
dramatic orchestral chord
telephone ringing
lyrical gershwinesque tune
telephone ringing
slapping sound
mike it phil sanford
phil how the hell are ya
well ill tell you about that
in a minute
oh uh
congratulations are in order
i read that you took over
your dad publishing firm
it been a year and a half now
you sound uptight man
the police raided the
argus book store in oakwood
yeah i know the store
but what that got to do with you
they arrested the clerk
ben fremont
on an obscenity charge
for selling a new book of ours
the seven minutes by jj jadway
now mike
this book is not pornographic
anyway fremonfs been in jail
several hours now
and i want him bailed out at once
how do you want to plead
if he pleads not guilty
that means a trial
i want to get him out of this
fast and quietly
ihave got to put a stop to
the little nuisance arrests like this
right at the outset
well now selling pornography
in california is a misdemeanour
as far as i recall it a
maximum fine of $0000
a year in jail plus $5
for every unit of
obscene material confiscated
mike but the kid was arrested
once before on the same charge
ah excuse me phil
let me see that a felony
now that a $25000 maximum fine
just for openers
and a year in prison
damn it mike i cant let
fremont go to jail
for selling sanford house book
wait a minute
there one other possibility
i might be able to get the whole thing
taken care of quickly and quietly
we enter a nolo plea
now that to say a guilty plea
without conceding to the charge
you pay the fine and you arrange
to have the
jail sentence suspended
we have a da out here
a man named elmo duncan
a very decent guy
mike
mike dont worry
ill see duncan tomorrow
arrange for the bail bondsman
and look in on fremont
sorry i unloaded on you buddy
but im sure you know that this
is pretty important to me
get some sleep huh
good night phil
laughing youre bad
youre really bad baby
faye
faye faye
come on now it after midnight
you know were both tired
and you know how i hate
being interrupted
michael daddy isnt going to
like your dirty book
when i go to work for daddy
that when daddy makes the decisions
until then i call my own shots
raunchy big-band music
cmon
daddy was discussing
us today michael
he anxious to know
when youre going to
make an honest woman
out of his daughter
ive got the message
miss osborn
how is your charming fiancée
she fine sir
you must remember me to both faye
and your prospective father-in-law
you know if it werent for
willard osb0rn dinner parties
i wouldnt have to worry
about my weight
what can i do for you
mr barrett
well sir im looking for a favour
anything
anything within reason
im representing the sanford house
of new york city
the publisher of the seven minutes
the seven minutes
oh yes the fremont case
mike
that rig ht
mr duncan may i ask
have you read the book
to be quite frank about it no
well a number of
very important critics say
that the seven minutes
is not hardcore pornography
the sort of thing that
dumped into a drugstore
by quick-buck printers
appealing to the one-armed reader
the book is being
published by one of
the most reputable firms
in the book trade
well let see what
it all about
the complaint was filed
by a mrs olivia st clair
president of the strength
through decency league in oakwood
a couple of my boys read the book
there is no doubt in their mind
it is pornographic
but the real question is
whether or not the seven minutes
is legally obscene
by contemporary
community standards
my client has advised me
that the jadway book
is no more or less explicit than
works of far less artistic merit
s0 why the sudden arrest
well my office has been under
considerable pressure
from mrs st clair
with some justification
we had to satisfy her
and with fremonfs arrest
you appeased the book-burner
weve done our duty but then
you have a duty to your client
im willing to co-operate
within the limitations
of what already has happened
this would satisfy sanford
ben fremont pleads nolo
pays a stiff fine
and in return we have his
one-yearjail sentence suspended
you understand
entering a nolo plea
is tantamount
to pleading guilty
which means the book
will be banned in oakwood
i dont give a damn
about oakwood
let it be unavailable there
and that way you satisfy
the stdl
and their specific community
but still the seven minutes
could be sold
anywhere else in the county
what youve suggested
well sounds reasonable to me
this is a nuisance matter
we can treat it routinely
ill smooth out any ruffled feathers
in the department
and when that done
you enter your plea of guilty
and ill speak to the judge
it probably wont be any more than
a fine and a suspended jail sentence
fair enough
i should have something for you
about this time tomorrow
oh by the way
when you see willard osborn
tell him im
very appreciative
of the time and attention
his network has given me lately
man our next senator
for the state of california
evening luther
baby doll
baby doll
hi
harvey
elmo
in/vin
if our president had looked that good
on television a few years ago
he would have been elected
governor instead
sorry im late luther
things got busy downtown
loud rocknroll music
shut that thing off
ive said it before
and ill say it again
before we make our move
elmo has got to become
a state-wide hero
if the voters can identify
with him were home free
two weeks ago we found
a meaningful issue
namely that much of this
youthful violence
is provoked by salaciousness
in reading matter and in films
then we agreed
to try to implement
the california criminal
code on censorship
by making an arrest
thereby using a book as an issue
on which to build a state-wide case
on which elmo could fight the
smut merchants
yes and by this act
and by the trial that might follow it
elmo would become known
as a protector of the young
and an enemy of
violence-inciting literature
that is a lot of crap
enough of the pool
it pits the district attorney
against some two-bit book salesman
and some obscure printed words that
nobody will ever read or hear about
it should be plain to all of us now
the fremont rouse was a flop
let forget it
let go on to something else
with a little more promise
loud crunching
baby doll will you stop that
now there another
factor involved here
the publisher of the seven minutes
is being represented
by a mike barrett
you might recall
that barrett is engaged
to willard osborn daughter faye
now considering the support
ive been getting
from osborn television network
the time will be
i think it would be foolish
ten
to rock the boat
mtwenty-nine and
shut that off
beep click
elmo right
forget about this penny ante stuff
ourjob tonight is to find
that big issue
rocknr0ll music
hey baby now remember
if you just too small

radio volume turned right up

jerry
on the love train
youre on a midnight ride
the love train
tour through the countryside
the love train
song fades out
car engine cuts off
footsteps insects chirping
police officers
dont move
dramatic sinister music
d0 you have any identification
yeah
this what youre
looking for griffith
where did you find it
by the broken body of a young girl
rocknr0ll music
excuse me sir police chief patterson
wishes to speak to mr duncan
let take it on the speakerphone
yes sir
elmo patterson
what is it tim
sorry to bother you mr duncan
about an hour ago
we logged a brutal 907
rape victim a 9-year-old
caucasian miss shen moore
admitted to county hospital
in a coma
there some big game involved
who is it
frank griffith son
frank griffith
the name means nothing to me
frank griffith handles all of
mr yerkes advertising
he also one of the party
biggest contributors
that the one
the boy denied raping the girl
and he also pleads innocent
to injuring her
any evidence to indicate
the boy was lying
lm gonna look at the sheet
wallet $23 in cash
three textbooks in the
trunk of his car
a fourth book under
the spare tyre
and coincidentally
it was the same dirty book
involved in that bookseller arrest
this morning the seven minutes
elmo tell him goodbye
son of a bitch
weve got our case
tim well discuss this
in the morning
thank you mr duncan
what do you mean
weve got our case
baby doll
shut off that damn radio
music clicks off
cant the next senator from the
state of california
figure this one out for himself
it very simple frank griffith son
a poor kid with a normal sex urge
and theyre trying to pin him
with breaking and entering
raucous laughter
maybe the kid is innocent
who gives a goddamn
but you know who responsible
the real criminal
it that dirty slimy book
the seven minutes
that incited a decent kid
from a good family
to commit felonious rape
yeah but luther
elmo weve finally got hold of
the big issue weve been looking for
barman get the car
jawohl
blair call frank griffith
tell him we just heard
about his trouble
and were on our way to help him
in any way we can
now he is still innocent until
proved guilty in a court of law
what im really saying is that
the law still gives us certain options
are you saying he can
still plead not guilty
frank let him finish
if he pleads not guilty
the case will be placed
on the court calendar for trial
if he pleads guilty
the sentence could be anywhere
from 5 years to life
what good all this
i already told the cops what i did
she hurt herself
dont interrupt
i agree that
as things stand
a not guilty plea would
not only be dishonest but futile
trial a waste of time
now consider this behind closed doors
our district attorney could have
a great influence with thejudge
who was to pass sentence
after a plea of guilty for rape
but i didnt rape her
the book the criminal
not the boy
if the seven minutes
hadnt been available
jerry would have never
committed the crime
i see
i see
he was temporarily inflamed by
that book he was victimised
now well need time to let this
concept sink into the public mind
in order to create an atmosphere
much more favourable to jerry
doesnt anything i say
mean a damn
considering jerry condition
i would offer as a defence
that he was not legally sane when
he allegedly committed the crime
to accomplish this well need
the services of a top psychiatrist
i would suggest
dr roger trimble
i wont let any headshrinker
pick my brain apart im not crazy
louis polk knows the law
if he says your seeing a psychiatrist
will help you with thejudge
it makes sense to do just that
jerry
let your niece calm him down
~ jerry
maggie l__
im sure they were only
trying to be helpful in their way
i dont want my brain
picked in public
i understand jerry
ljust wanna be left alone
jerry griffith is living proof that
a dirty book can destroy a clean boy
im convinced were not dealing
with a mere felony
but a crime that could
endanger public safety
like uh an epidemic of rape
i was referring to
your client distribution
of a menacing work
of obscenity mr barrett
if you plead ben fremont
not guilty
we will prosecute the defendant
to the limit of the law
if you prefer to enter
a plea of guilty
the defendant will receive the
maximum punishment for his offence
a fine and twelve months in jail
n0 deal deal mr barrett
loud clunk of weights
ls that your last word
yes mr barrett
what kind of a plea do you intend
to enten guilty or not guilty
ill have to consult with my client
there can be no compromise
if you plead guilty fremont
will go tojail for a year
and the book will be banned
in the county as a starter
if the plea is not guilty
youll have to take
your gamble in court
really pissed me off
with duncan attitude
aside from being
obviously hostile
he gave me that politician
holier-than-thou number
mike a little to the right honey
higher yeah right here
mmm that feels good
michael
mmm
are you considering turning down dad
position to take on sanford case
what wrong darling
ive got a late date
with the seven minutes
i promised sanford
id make my decision
about defending the book
by tomorrow morning
and taken in its entirety
and not out of context
the book is definitely
not obscene
the seven minutes
is a beautiful book
oh there clay rutherford
right there
he one of the most thorough
investigative attorneys ive worked with
mr rutherford
mr sanford
i took the first plane out when mike
told me you two would take the case
clay has a line-up of potential witnesses
why dont we run through them
our line-up is exactly one witness
you mean so far
no mr sanford
i uh i mean one period
with the existing political climate
were not going to find
many volunteers for this cause
tell him who we got clay
christian leroux his firm published
the original edition of the book
now weve been led to believe that
he considered the seven minutes
to be a work of artistic integrity
sanford ireca/i however that
he sold the world publishing rights
to an alleged pornographer
named norman c quandt
clay any idea of his whereabouts novfi
sanford n0
clay should be able
to get a line on him
our really big issue will be
to prove that jadway wrote the book
honestly sincerely
and with artistic integrity
that why lemux is so
important to us
hello mr barrett
hi donna
mr rutherford sir
clay we can also get some mileage
out of the findings
made by the president commission
on obscenity and pornography
they clearly verify that so-called
obscene books and motion pictures
do not contribute in any way
to an increase in antisocial behaviour
by adults or juveniles
looks like it not going to be as
simple as we thought ls it mike
incredibly philip no the case is
a lot more complicated now
i guess so mike this might not
be the right time to bring this up
but do you want me to stay
for the trial
im up to here with
pre-publication deals back home
no as a matter of fact
it might be better
to keep you out of
the picture entirely
until we need you
as a witness
one more thing to remember
gentlemen
elmo duncan will not
be sitting on his ass
our critics would like to believe
that the church only interest
is in morality and religion at
the sacrifice of freedom of speech
we wish to criticise only those
who would abuse this freedom
we are of the same mind
your eminence
we dont want
a weakened freedom
but rather reinforce it by
penalising those who would corrupt it
the church has seen fit
to extend its co-operation
wewing the seven minutes today
just as it did in the thirties
when it was first banned
in the sacred index
as an extraordinary
destructive force
i couldnt be more pleased
your eminence
i own enlighten
and will help you
mike
now the police report states
that they confiscated eighty copies
of the seven minutes
and the sanford house
sales department account shows
they shipped a hundred copies
to this store
those figures correct
uh-huh
that means you sold twenty copies
before you were arrested
any idea who bought them
zero i only work here days
have you seen the picture of
jerry griffith in the newspaper
his picture and mine too
ive got a better shot of him
right here
and i want you to take
a close look at this
he ever been in this store
not that i can recall
with all this publicity i get
phone calls every day
asking ifl have
the book for sale
even rachel hoyt
the head branch librarian
for the oakwood library
called this morning
very uptight about this attempt
to ban the seven minutes
interesting
she wont wait to order
the book through channels
she wants to pick one up herself
put it on the open shelves
and have a showdown
with the old bags who run the
strength through decency league
would you believe frank griffith
telling the press
it was jj jadway and
the seven minutes
not his son who was responsible
for sheri moore brutal attack
when was the last time
you saw jerry
that was it he sent a friend
over to return the dictionary
do you recall his friend
a long-haired boy the only one
i saw with jerry more than once
i think his name was perkins
i hear youre a good friend
of jerry griffith
who told you that
head librarian
at the oakwood branch
said she saw you with him
a couple of times
he got wheels he gave me
a lift now and then that about it
well lwas told that
you were close friends
you were told wrong man
did you ever meet any members
of jerry family
nope
did you ever hear jerry
discuss his father
nope
when was the last time
you saw him
maybe a week before
he beat on that chick
and you havent seen him since
n0 and i wouldnt want to either
how come
with all the available chicks around here
who wants to owe
the guy who gets it that way
that a bummer
i hear he reads a lot
what the hell do these look like
everybody reads a lot here
yeah i guess youre right
but im only interested
in one particular book
have you ever seen him reading
the seven minutes or discussing it
oh youre sounding like a pig
like a stinkin pig fuck off
the services of father sarsatti
one of the two priests directly
in charge of the sacred index
has been offered as a leading
witness for your prosecution
father sarsatti
is prepared to make public
all the classified information
the church has on the infamous book
and its equally infamous author
do you wish him as a witness
for the prosecution
yes your eminence
i must have him
when do you want him in here
within three days four at the most
i will notify the vatican
father sarsatti will be here
and the lord
will bless our cause
uplifting hymn-like music
im olivia st clair
president of the oakwood chapter
of the strength through
decency league
polite applause
most of you already know
that our president has called for
a citizens crusade against obscenity
both in print and in pictures
that just what the stdl
is trying to implement
our work was never more important
than it is today
st clair the fact that there are
faye why the big rush
it not exactly like
youre the guest of honour
hey there someone i know
maggie how are you
good to see you faye
faye oh forgive me
meet my fiance
maggie russell michael barrett
how do you do
i thought i recognised you
you mean those terrible newspaper
pictures do me justice
i happen to have
a special interest in your case
st clair hard-hitting action
and by that i mean
vigorous positive enforcement
of existing obscenity laws
wed better grab a seat
all over the country
and with courageous americans
see you around maggie
like our guest of honour today
to do the enforcing
it is now with the
greatest of pleasure
that i give you our county
distinguished district attorney
mr elmo duncan
applause
thank you
thank you very much
glad you all could make it
mrs st clair has asked me
to say a few words
on the subject of pornography
as related to our permissive society
i cannot think of a subject
which is more relevant
there is virtually no area
that remains untainted
by the quick-buck artists who
pander to our lowest forms of taste
and the public be damned
just the other evening
my first night off in weeks
i decided to take my wife mary
and our three children to the movies
in our neighbourhood
we had such subject material
as rape lust motorcycle gangs
homosexuals
lesbianism
im going to take a walk
ill be right back
drug abuse you name it
whatever happened to the movies we
used to be able to take our children to
applause
mike remember to tell me what i missed
films that offered
real movie stars
like the charming lady seated to my left
miss constance cumberland
enthusiastic applause
never in the history of our great nation
has there been such a proliferation
of obscene material on the screen
the magazine racks and the bookshelves
the pomographers
mike miss russell
while i had a chance lwanted
to have a few words with you
about your relatives the griffiths
faye mentioned your
relationship with jerry
and
well she said you were
very close to him
were not only relatives
were friends
im prepared to defend jerry
against anyone who wants to hurt him
well i have no reason to hurt jerry
my interest in him
is merely professional
you see from what i know
about juvenile delinquency
im not convinced
that reading-matter alone
can be held responsible
for antisocial acts
i was hoping wed have
a chance to talk about this
i wont even dignify the thought
of such a discussion
i suppose itd be foolish of me to ask
if jerry father would see me
you cant be serious mr barrett
youre annoying me
well im sorry i really am
car engine starts
but you could have snubbed me
good manners miss russell
not good manners mr barrett
i just wanted to find out
if you were really
the kind of son of a bitch
everyone said you were
jerry i feel these sessions
can be very beneficial to you
i dont like to talk about myself
well im afraid your father
and mr yerkes have other plans
concerning your
co-operation this afternoon
you tell him his loser company
aint worth that much money
well fly him back
from the goddamn safari
when people find out he
killing defenseless animals
with a machine gun
it eighty-six for him anyway
raucous laughter what an idea
for art buchwald column
howd it go
well jerry is completely ambivalent
about sheri moore
on the one hand he hates to
discuss the circumstance
but on the other when he does discuss it
he reveals a certain pride in the act
what else
jerry also has a wish
for self-destruction
possibly real but more likely fantasy
i feel he should be subjected
to as few pressures as possible
frank the boy needs help
he in bad shape
what the hell wrong now
well never get him to testify
until we get him back on the track
i think the kid and trimble
should get together
every day between now and the trial
well that makes
a great deal of sense
fine now let see what
happening in the other room
lushly romantic piano music
good to see you merle
griffith trimble

im really looking
fonlvard to this luther

clapperboard snaps shut
and action mr reid
ladies and gentlemen i am sitting in
the home of the frank griffith family
an average american family
if you will until the night before last
when a shattering experience
catapulted them into the headlights
young jerry griffith
whom you see seated beside me
was taken into police custody
and charged with the most heinous crime
a crime which had been
perpetrated by the reading
of an awful ugly and
yes ill use the word
a patently obscene book
until now not one soul
from the television media
has been granted the opportunity
of speaking with young jerry
but he and his father have
graciously allowed me the privilege
of being the first and only news man
to hear the family side of the story
tell me jerry
was the seven minutes
part of your reading assignments
at the university
i really dont wanna talk about it
i couldnt be more in sympathy
with your feelings
but the public does have a right to know
how this book led you astray
tell us now exactly how
the seven minutes prompted you
to run out and violate this girl
emphatic echoing chords
i dont wanna talk about it
frenzied orchestral music
voice trembling
for the first time
in my newscasting career
i am speechless
permit me however
to leave you with this question
how many other killer books are in
the hands of your sons and daughters
yes your sons and daughters
this very moment
now youve seen what a dirty book
can do to a youngster

jerry jerry
nembutals it lucky you
got him here when you did
another five minutes
and hed have been finished
he gave me this piece of paper
with a name and phone number on it
said it was the only one
to be contacted
i thought i told you
jerry he cant be with you he
not allowed to leave the house
what happened where
ill be right there
dr quigley a good man
hell make a discreet report and
everything will be kept very quiet
ijust cant imagine
what made jerry do it
id like to ask you something
go ahead
were you following jerry
no i was looking for someone else
one of his friends george perkins
im sorry you must think
i suspect every move you make
music
jerry was bugged by a couple of things
that happened at the house today
now no-one expects you
to be unfaithful to the cause
luther yerkes was there today
he brought over a psychoanalyst
and jerry was forced to go into therapy
with this guy against his will
luther yerkes at the griffiths
until now id only heard rumours that
he was backing duncan for the senate
then mr yerkes
wheeled out merle reid
to interview jerry
on coast-to-coast television
just simply
you know i always think
excuse me go ahead
n0 no you go ahead
you know my whole attitude
toward you has changed 80 degrees
before i came to work
for the griffiths
there was a woman working there
as a nurse to mrs griffith
after she quit or was fired
that when i was offered the job
maybe she could
give you a little help
do you remember her name
isabel vogler
she lived out in laurelvale
that the most i can offer you
by way of appreciation
for what you did tonight
thank you
now ive got to run thank you
ld like to see you again
no prying i promise strictly social
it tempting but im afraid not
if i was seen with you in public
but if i can ever help you
in any way that doesnt
jeopardise my relationship
with the family
well you have my private number
ill remember that
oh by the way
i read the seven minutes
it a beautiful book
music playing
youve got a suspicious look
on your face
faye
how can you drink that in the morning
is that why you stopped by
to check on my drinking habits
you were supposed to call last night
i got into this thing
part of the investigation
you know the woman you passed by
on the way out of here
well uh that was frank griffith
former housekeeper mrs isabel vogler
now she agreed
to testify at the trial
about the conditions
existing in the griffith home
particularly as to how they affected
one mr jerry griffith
can you trust someone like that
mrs vogler is as trustworthy
as any of duncan witnesses
s0 why the sudden concern
im just worried about the nasty
people youre becoming associated with
over an unworthy piece of trash
first of all the book
isnt a piece of trash
there no-one around to
contaminate me so let cool it huh
well ive gotta get to
the office now or ill be late
faye
faye i really am sorry
about last night
see you later and make up for it huh
both good and bad news mike
give me the bad first
lemux sold out for a higher price
and he flying in from paris
to testify for duncan
the good news is that ive
located norman c quandt
gee that great where is he
he operates something called the uh
arts and sciences cinema company
at 348 donovan drive
imposing title
well it probably
one of the leading manufacturers
of pornographic movies
on the west coast
nudies beavers the whole bit
when could i see him
right now man he expecting you
im on my way
okey doke
quandt there nothing dirty
about these pictures
now back to that creep leroux let
go to my office and check the files
back in 47 i flew over to paris
to get a first-hand look
at some of the highly touted
french stuff
my contact was leroux a publisher of
dirty books and part-time pimp
among other things he made me an
offer for three raunchy paperbacks
one of them was the seven minutes
do you recall him saying anything
about the author of
the seven minutes jj jadway
yeah in fact he turned over
a pack of letters
written by jadway to his mistress
some chick named
cassie mcgraw
yeah
you mean you actually have
letters written by jadway
till a week ago i unloaded them
on an autograph dealer in new york
can you give me his name
the autograph hunter
siren blares
panicked shrieking
inaudible shouting
get outta the place
youll tip the da
you gotta be out of your head
im on the other side
he sent them round
to me before
now get outta here
the autograph dealer
olin adams
55th street new york
olin adams
you got a deal mr barrett
i can send the letters out to you
cod in the morning
no i need them sooner than that
im flying to new york tonight
ill be in your shop between
nine and ten and ill pay in cash
as you wish sir
right
jadway speaking from the grave
those letters can wipe out
leroux contention
that jadway was
a money-hungry pornographer
and weve got isabel vogler
to put down jerry griffith testimony
that the book alone turned him on
we are finally getting it together
phone buzzes

mr griffith places a large amount of
advertising on dad television stations
so naturally you can understand
how daddy felt when he heard
you were going to call a witness
who would malign frank griffith
how did dad feel
concerned enough to pay
a visit to mr griffith
to prepare for any libel
mrs vogler might be offering
beautiful
after his talk with griffith
dad was convinced mrs vogler
is a psychopathic liar
ok so now youve told me
the urgent news what else
dad wants me to tell you
that any thought you have
of using isabel vogler on the witness
stand is out of the question
he was positive about that
oh was he now
i promised him that once i spoke to
you there would be no problem
but there is a problem faye
i will use mrs vogler
on the witness stand

remove the evidence
and yours truly stumbled in on them
it not the first time thereve been
half a dozen other incidents
just as incredible mrs isabel vogler
suddenly refusing to testify
the loss of some
original jadway letters
and the real stunner
was the loss of leroux
the frenchman who first
published the seven minutes
now he saying jadway nothing more
than a squalid pornographer
the man with the big chequeb0ok
got the advantage
maggie exclaims joyfully

for you for your son
and for our common cause
the state of california has charged
an unknown bookseller
named ben fremont
with selling filth
in the form of an underground
novel the seven minutes
which was written by an
expatriate author jj jadway
over three decades ago
now this trial has generated
enormous interest
and in light of impending
supreme court hearings
on the question of obscenity
in films and reading matter
this case could assume a
stature of national importance
please rise
face the flag of our country
recognising the principles
for which it stands
liberty and justice for all
department 0 of the superior court
of the state of california
is now in session the honourable
nathaniel upshawjudge presiding
please be seated and no smoking
gavel bangs
the case of the people of the state
of california versus ben fremont
is the defence ready to proceed
yes your honour
are the people ready to proceed
yes your honour
you may call your first witness
mr duncan
i call sergeant frank kellog of the
county sheriffs department to the stand
please raise your right hand
do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
state your name for the record
sergeant frank kellog county
sheriff office administrative woe
please be seated
sergeant kellog is the man who
sold you a copy of
the seven minutes in this courtroom
yes sir he is
would you point him out
to the court please
that him
let the record show your honour
the witness sergeant kellog
indicated the defendant ben fremont
seated to the left of defence counsel
did mr fremont make any
comment about the book
any reference to
its erotic explicitness
well the defendant mr fremont told me
it was the most
banned book in history
he said and i quote it was banned
in every country in the world
because it was considered obscene
those were mr fremonfs own words
your witness mr barrett
sergeant kellog on your visit
to the argus book store
did you impersonate
an ordinary customer
no sir that not quite true
but since you intended to buy the book
for the purposes of assembling
evidence against the defendant
didnt you feel dishonest about
representing yourself as a customef
objection the witness
feelings are immaterial
objection sustained
forgive me your honour
sergeant kellog why was it necessary
to use a concealed tape recordef
well that standard
operating procedure
if we were going to bust a hooker
widespread laughter
l mean arrest a prostitute wed do
the same thing that perfectly legal
well i wont bother to comment
on the ethics of those vice officers
who circulate among bars
trying to entrap hoo
mprostitutes but i do wonder
how you feel about entrapping
a respectable bookseller with leading
questions and concealed tape recorders
elmo my next witness
in a manner of speaking
will be the book itself
i now submit that the seven minutes be
read aloud to the members of the jury
so that they may become
acquainted with its entire contents
seated in the witness box
is a neutral impartial citizen
a mr charles wynter a substitute
high school teacher locally
who in his spare time tapes
recordings for the blind
and is accustomed to reading aloud
without over-dramatising
or unduly emphasising
specific passages
objection your honour
with all due deference to the blind
the prosecution remarks
are deliberately intended
to appeal to the sympathy of the jury
objection overruled the district
attorney description of mr wynter
leaves no doubt of his
ability to remain impartial
elmo thank you your honour
your honour while i already
have this person available
i would willingly agree to let
anyone of mr barrett choosing
read the book aloud to the jury
your honour what i care about
is the book being read aloud
a novel is not meant to be
presented in such a fashion
that is my only objection
your objection mr barrett
is overruled
mr wynter may begin reading the book
in manner so prescribed by the court
thank you your honour
mr wynter
judge you may begin but please
address the reading to the jury
slowly and pedantically
a touch ls that you
my other lips swell in joyous welcome
god i have missed you
there now move
slowly past my moist lips
darling let me kiss all of you
feel me close around you
in sweet embrace
your honour i would like
to record my concern
about one mannerism possessed
by the reader mr wynter
which may be prejudicial
to the defence
the reader is placing undue emphasis
by raising his eyes on certain passages
which might be termed
sexually realistic
mr barrett i have been
watching mr wynter closely
i am satisfied he is
performing in a manner
as mechanical and objective
as possible for a human being
i must deny your request
please resume mr wynter
you were so strong
and yet when we are together
we both grow weak with the delicious
perfection of our union
this is your home this is the reason
for our existence
as a noted british publisher
of quality books
and a highly recognised authority
on the continental trade
mr van fleet do you feel that jadway
the author of the seven minutes
tried to give the reader some
understanding or vision of love
mr jadway knew nothing of love
let me tell you a favourite
anecdote about jadway
the story comes first-hand from
a simply marvellous study
entitled outside the mainstream
the author is dr hiram eberhart
a highly respected professor
at columbia university
now im going to quote
from him directly
your honour i object
this supposed anecdote from that book
would represent the
rankest form of hearsay
i object to any reading from outside
the mainstream whatsoever
i am conversant with dr eberhart
and believe his book
to be very material counsel
dont antagonise them
the witness will continue
one night after listening
to a prizefight on the radio
a contest in which joe louis
wrested the heavyweight championship
from one james braddock jadway
told friends who had been listening to it
with him that love
between a man and a woman
was most often performed
like a prizefight
when jadway was asked
to give examples of books
that depicted the
more common hostile love
he cited henry miller
tropic of capricorn
which he had just read
as a book that reflected
the brutality of l0ve
one of your witnesses elmo has got
to be a thinking man faggot
those queens are so afraid
of anything straight
theyre bound to be on our side
mthroughout the seven minutes is
an act of hatred against womanhood
jadway has unconsciously
taken on the role of a pugilist
attempting to down and
humiliate the opposite sex
end quote lfind myself in total
agreement with dr eberhart
how much did we offer
to pay him to testify
transportation plus five big ones
please raise your right hand
do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
state your name for the record
my name is christian leroux
please be seated
i wonder how much
he got from the da
youd better believe
it wasnt chopped liver
mr leroux what is
your present occupation
im a publisher of books
when did you first become a publisher
in 933 my father died leaving me
a very modest inheritance
s0 i established my own
publishing house the etoile press
is this the same publisher that brought
out a work of fiction in 935 entitled
the seven minutes by jj jadway
the same
mr leroux i have seen
your original version of this book
which was printed in english
since it was published in paris
why was it not in the french language
the french government wouldnt permit
its publication in french
why not
the censorship bureau
declared it was obscene
obscene to your knowledge
has the seven minutes
ever been published in any other
country in any other language
oh no absolutely no
nation in the world
would pass on it or even accept it
literary critics in many countries
regarded it as the most
depraved book ever published
in the history of literature
your honour i object to mr leroux
self-serving answer
and i ask that it be stricken on the
grounds that it is incompetent
judge i think that the witness is
qualified to give that answer
motion to strike is denied
and objection overruled
proceed mr duncan
mr leroux what kind of
commercial success
did the seven minutes
have in france
well not as much as wed hoped
my initial printing was 5000 copies
this sold out in a year
then i ordered a press run
of another 5000 copies
but the sales slowed down
and eventually stopped
that is after the vatican
placed the book on the index
mike father sarsatti you testified that
the curia offices had been revamped
and streamlined since jj jadway
book was first published in 935
yes in 966 in keeping with
the new ecumenical council spirit
which pervaded the church
and all of christendom
pope paul vii abolished the title of the
supreme congregation of the holy office
because it had long been held
offensive by protestants
who associated it with
what they regarded as
persecution in early church history
is it not true father that at the
convening of the ecumenical council
there were numerous roman catholic
clerics who protested against
the old holy office the very
office that condemned jadway
because it did not hold
fair hearings for authors
the catholic church
is a democratic body
its bishops and cardinals
are given total freedom
in the formation of their opinion
there were those who chose to express
some measure of disagreement
with the rulings of the holy office
would it not follow then father
that in view of the new liberality
on the part of the church
that what the church condemned
and prohibited in 935
it might not condemn
and prohibit today
signore sir that is
a hypothetical question
which i have neither the qualifications
nor the authority to answer
let me say this however
that i am here before you
as a representative of the vatican
because the church is just as
concerned today as it was in 935
about the publication and circulation
of an immoral and sacrilegious work
of fiction entitled the seven minutes
you got it now harvey i want you to hit
them with as many numbers as possible
make it sound like this dame
is second cousin to every one
of those clowns in that jury box
our average woman
resides in an urban area
in a city of less than
00000 population
which qualifies oakwood
to supply this woman
she has a five-room home
worth $000
half the house is mortgaged
the house has a bathtub or shower
flush toilet electricity telephone
tv set and washing machine
no air conditioning
no clothes dryer no food freezer
the average woman spends
seven hours a day
in the kitchen
performing her household chores
very impressive mr underwood
youve covered everything
except her frequency of elimination
and the time of day
she prefers to fornicate
bangs gavel let us observe some of
the rules of taste counsellor
and would you please refrain
from turning your back to the court
forgive me your honour but i feel
the court should be a little more
enlightened about the average person
especially in relationship
to statistics
now as i understand it 5% of the
us population is female
while 49% is male
now according to what youve said
that means
the average american is only female
now is that true
of course not
one cant average two absolutes
i was referring to concepts that
can be converted into statistics
such as age or income
i appreciate your wanting to talk
about numbers mr undenlvood
but i want to talk about persons
specifically the average person
mentioned in the criminal code
let me ask the jury this
supposing 50% of the
american population was male
and 50% was female
wouldnt the average
american be a queer
widespread laughter
order order order
now that weve established
your qualifications
as an average housewife to the
court satisfaction mrs white
can you tell us whether
you read a novel
called the seven minutes
written by jj jadway
i have lforced myself to read it
from cover to cover
as an average person in your community
applying contemporary standards
what was your reaction to this book
i found it sickeningly obscene
did you feel it went beyond
the customary limits of candour
in its description of nudity or sef
the seven minutes belongs
in a garbage disposal
if i had one
that where the book would go
elmo did you find anything in the novel
inaudible whispering
that could be considered as having
social redeeming importance
it was sex and more sex
and nothing else
i never laid eyes on
reading matter more obscene
thank you mrs white
your witness counsellor
mrs white since you are the first
average woman ive ever met
im eager to know
a little more about your taste
im anxious to know if your
reading habits are also average
they are
oh how do you know they are
i read a lot all the popular things
that come into the library
and in paperback
have you ever read peyton place
by grace metalious
of course not
have you read god little acre
by erskine caldwell
no i havent
have you read lady chattefley lover
by dh lawrence
i have not
have you read in his steps
by charles sheldon
no i never even heard of it
that very interesting mrs white
then by mr undewvoods standards
your reading habits are far from average
you see the four novels
i have just mentioned
sold over thirty million copies
in this country alone
to which i object your honour
the counsel is badgering the witness
in front of thejury
and is asking questions
in argumentative form
i know twenty books that outsold
the novels barrett mentioned
those are four of the five leading
best-sellers in american history
judge gentlemen let proceed
in an orderly fashion
i expect both of you to abide
by the rules of evidence
now let get on with the trial
mrs white would the average american
read the seven minutes
absolutely not
but youre supposedly average
and you read it didnt you
i was requested to read it
for this trial
oh otherwise you
would not have read it
most certainly not i dont waste
my time with obscene reading
but mrs white how would
you know it was obscene
if you didnt read it
i dont have to drink poison
to know that it poison
do you believe that writers
should say what they mean
when writing about sex
yes but they can do that
without using indecent words
like the words in that book
can you be specific about the words in
the seven minutes that offended you
well im certainly not
going to use them
point them out
let me see what you object to
go ahead the book wont bite
very fine mrs white
i appreciate
your co-operation
now what we have here
is the word fucking
shocked murmuring
ls that correct
excuse me mrs white
that is the word you object to
disgusting
would you have been happier
if the writer had used
such euphemisms as
they slept togethef
they were intimate
or they made love
i would have understood just as well
what the author was trying to say
but you could have been wrong
if kathleen and her man
had slept together were intimate
or they made love
they might have been
doing many other things
other than the only exact word
for this particular act
it cannot be mistaken
mrs white im not advocating
that coarse or vulgar words
should be used by everyone everywhere
i am saying that writers from
chaucer to jadway should be allowed
the freedom to use specific precise
words when writing realistically
now wouldnt you agree mrs white
i am not interested in the past
mr barrett
im interested in protecting
our morality in the present
especially the morality of our young
people so that our civilisation
doesnt decay and decline
the way others have done
emphatic music
thank you
remember when van fleet
mentioned the anecdote
about the night jadway was listening
to joe louis win the heavyweight title
by knocking out braddock
yeah
when did jadway die
february 937
correct jadway killed himself and was
promptly cremated in february 937
but here we have
dr eberhart telling us
how jadway read and discussed
tropic of capricorn
capricorn wasnt
published until 939
well maybe dr eberhart confused
his source of information
we confuse tropic of capricorn
with tropic of cancer
which im sure was published while
jadway was still very much alive
no no listen to this
page 624 joe louis
knocked out jim braddock
in the eighth round
in chicago in june 937
get it june 937
that means that jadway
was listening to the fight
four months after he was
supposed to be dead
now how does that grab you
a lot better
the distinguished dr eberhart may
have been wrong a second time
but twice in one paragraph from a
renowned scholar highly unlikely
this gives us a new and revived jadway
who did not die in february 937
as leroux and the priest testified
it gives us jadway very much alive
four months later
for that matter is he even dead
emphatic music
clay were back in business
you handle the
cross-examination tomorrow
if i hustle i can catch
the late flight to new york
eberhart could save our ass
a mistake could have been made
only by my source
dr eberhart i was unaware that there
was any source involved besides you
you see i assumed that you were
present when jadway made the
no i was not
my confidential source
was one of jadway closest friends
in paris in the 930s
who was he
well considering how i was misled
l see no reason
not to reveal his name
i acquired the information from
a poet named sean oflanagan
my name michael barrett
may i sit down
depends
could i buy you a drink
grab a chair
guinness a flagon of your best brandy
with a water back
what can i do for you young man
well sir im the lawyer
defending the reputation
of your old friend jj jadway
oh yes the seven minutes
dr hiram eberhart led me to believe
that you were one of
jadway closest friends
correct young man that precisely
why i wont discuss this subject
keep the change
thank you
on the contrary mr oflanagan
the censors wont let him rest
if i could only find out when
jadway died and how
suicide jumped into the grand canal
the poor wretched soul and drowned
when was that
allow me
the year of our lord
937 anno domini amen
then there appears to be
a slight contradition
concerning the date
of jadway death
based on the material
that you supplied dr eberhart
eberhart put it down wrong
and didnt hear me right
he taped the interview with you
i guess i screwed up
my dates and times
but i remember jadway death
as if it were yesterday
it was in all the papers
hurled himself from a six-storey
apartment building in san francisco
a minute ago you had him
drowning in the grand canal
did i now
could you have been mistaken
about the date of jadway death
maybe he died in 939 or 40
instead of 937
that is not possible
jadway was alive long after that
he enlisted the day after pearl harbor
made mincemeat of the kaiser
the kaiser was world war i
a pity you cant ask
cassie mcgraw about that
whatever happened to her
only the shadow knows
good day to you mr battle
michael michael over here
maggie
somebody once told me
that happiness is
being met at the airport
i had to see you
you look great
i thought youd be interested
in what happened in court
i spent the day in the gallery
you must be psychic
things were so tight
trying to make the plane
i didnt have a chance
to call the office
duncan brought out
two more literary experts
a professor from colorado
and a syndicated book reviewer
both said the book was obscene and
put it down for its prurient appeal
he also dragged in the two cops
who found sheri moore
and the physician who
examined her after the rape
mike im sure clay didnt let duncan get
away with cheap courtroom theatrics
evidence of sperm
within the vagina
objection
the violation of miss moore
has nothing to do with
this alleged obscenity case
your honour the police witnesses are the
foundation for jerry griffith appearance
this is relevant and material
because i will show
that the obscene pages
from the jadway book
created the wish to commit rape
within jerry griffith
and then drove him
to act out this wish
mike
so w/i-lat else have i missed
maggie well for one thing you
have no idea of the conflict
going on at the house
over jerry testifying
mike
is he still resisting
i i want to ask you not to put
jerry on the witness stand
before you say anything
let me finish
and i wont say do it for me mike
but for jerry sake alone
please waive your cross-examination
im sorry maggie
but i cant betray
the people whove retained me
the da had his own way so far
and now he plans to prove the
dangerous influence of jadway writing
by hitting us with jeny griffith
now this is our first
opportunity to stop him
maggie but jeny is paralysed with fear
over the cross-examination
he might even try to take
his own life again
but if we dont defend ourselves here
then well go under
and the censors strike another
important blow against free speech
if i had leroux mrs vogler even
a star witness like cassie mcgraw
and you can have her mike
you promise not to cross-examine jerry
and i promise to get you
cassie mcgraw herself
please raise your right hand
you swear to tell the truth and
nothing but the truth
i do
state your name for the record
jerry erm jerome griffith
please be seated
jerry griffith may i ask
what is your present occupation
student
jerry would you mind speaking up
you said
im a student
how long have you been
at the university
almost two years
before this year well let say
during your last year of high school
your first two years of college
how frequently did you go on
dates with girls
it it hard to remember
i cant remember how frequently
well can you give an approximation
of how frequently
objection your honour the witness
has stated that he does not remember
im going to object
on the grounds that
the question has been asked and
answered also it speculative
objection sustained
jerry what is your major
english literature
do your courses demand
considerable reading
say at least three books a week
objection the district attorney
is leading the witness
overruled the witness may
answer the question
thank you your honour ls it a fact that
you read at least three books a week
yes sir
do you also read other books
on your own so to speak
that is books not on the required list
for your english courses
yes sir
have you ever read a book called
the seven minutes by jj jadway
yes sir i have
from cover to cover
every word of it
yes sir
what was your reaction to the book
objection the witness reaction
to the book is highly immaterial
no evidence has been
produced by the prosecution
showing this witness to be
a literary expert
mr griffith reaction is
highly irrelevant speculative
and having nothing whatsoever to do
with the merits of this trial
mr barrett i must warn you against
making speeches for the jury benefit
i find the prosecutor
line of questioning
to be highly probative
and material to the issue
of whether or not
the seven minutes is obscene
the jury is admonished to disregard
defence counsel argument before the court
you may proceed mr duncan
hopefully without any
interruptions from mr barrett
thank you your honour
jerry what was your reaction to
the reading of the seven minutes
i was upset
what do you mean upset
i was mixed up inside all mixed up
i couldnt sleep
did you go to school the next day
yes but i cut some of
my late afternoon classes
why
i had my mind on that book
i kept it in my car
and i drove around for a while
and i found a lonely road
up in the hills
and i re-read parts of the book
can you recall what
sections you re-read
i dont remember exactly
some of the first chapter
the first of the seven minutes
in the story
i read that several times
what was in those pages
i dont remember exactly
if i may refresh your memory
of that part jerry
she is lying naked and she
thinks of the statues of priapus
that stood on some of
the streets of ancient greece
statues consisting of
a bust of a bearded man
set on a stone basalt block
and out of the centre of this statue
there projected a giant phallus
i object to the prosecutor
leading and suggestive reading
pointedly out of context
mr duncan should be
conversant with the fact
that a work whether it be
writing or motion pictures
must be considered as a whole
particularly when the question of
obscenity hangs in the balance
mr barrett my patience is
stretched to the breaking point
the counsel for
the prosecution reading
is clearly and obviously foundational
and will be followed
by a proper question
you will continue reading mr duncan
thank you your honour
and out of the centre of this statue
there projected a giant phallus
and then kathleen thinks
how lucky she is
and she stared at the
unnamed hero of the book
and the first of
her seven minutes begins
now jerry do you recognise that
as the part you re-read several times
yes sir
did you feel at the time
it was artistic writing
i didnt think about the writing
face the court jerry
do you feel the author was trying
nothing more than excite the reader
your honour im sorry
but i must object
to the district attorney constant
leading and suggestive questioning
this examination is
highly inflammatory
and i ask to approach the bench
to discuss the relevance
of this one-sided interrogation
mr barrett i find the prosecutor
questioning to be quite pertinent
the bench will not tolerate
any more interference from you
if you persist youll be held
in contempt of court
now let us proceed with the trial
thank you your honour have the court
reporter repeat the last question
you are instructed to do so
question by mr duncan
loud shuffling of papers
did you feel that the author
was trying to do anything more
than excite the reader
n0
did this passage
and other passages excite you
yes sir
in what way did this
excitement manifest itself
suspenseful music
physically
i wanted to have a girl
you mean you wanted to have
sexual intercourse with a girl
yes sir
with some particular girl
°“s any girl
any girl
what did you do next
it was night time
i drove to the club
and i drank a couple of beers
there was this one chick she looked
just like what i imagined kathleen
elmo kathleen the heroine of
the seven minutes
right anyhow i offered her a ride
by her do you mean sheri moore
right s0 i drove her to her
apartment and walked upstairs
and when she opened the door
i pushed her inside
you did this how
i had a knife
i see did she undress
she was scared so she undressed
what happened next
i dont remember
it went kind of crazy like it wasnt
my own mind any more
like it was jadway mind
please continue jerry
i forced myself on her
did she resist
yes
but you violated her anyway
i didnt know what i was doing
did you think of
the seven minutes at all
when she was naked yes
then i dont remember after that
except that i did it
i couldnt help doing it
and during the course of the sex act
miss moore was injured
it was after
when i was trying to dress
she tried to hit me and get my knife
i dont remember which
and lthink
somehow she slipped and fell
it was an accident
did you know miss moore
was unconscious
i dont remember if i knew it or not
i only knew she had a roommate
who might be coming back soon
so ljust left i felt miserable
i lwanted to kill myself
because this wasnt me
what i had done
it wasnt my fault
i didnt know what i was doing
have you ever in your life
behaved this way before
n0 sir
do you definitely feel the obscene
pages in that book inflamed you
until you were impelled
to commit a criminal act
yes sir i cant explain
any other reason for it
jerry i want you to listen to me
and listen to me carefully
from your own experience do you
believe there a cause and effect
now understand me
cause and effect relationship
between pornographic books
and violent acts of crime
i i only know
only know what happened
it happened to me
choking sobs
no further questions your honour
the defence has no questions
your honour
incredulous hubbub
mr barrett you mean you wish
to reserve your
cross-examination for laten
i mean as far as
the defence is concerned
the witness may be
permanently excused
we will take a two-hour recess
for lunch bangs gavel
hey barrett why didnt you
cross-examine the kid
no comment
have you thrown in the towel
mr barrett
no comment
if you cant stand the heat
get out of the kitchen
was the heat too hot for you
fuck off
clay you still havent answered me
what the hell happened back there
mike i traded off the
cross-examination of jerry griffith
for the examination of
the legendary cassie mcgraw
clay you mean she alive
mike she very much alive
and what more
we have an opportunity to use her
whod she make a deal with
mike maggie russell cassie read
about the trial in the paper
wrote to frank griffith
in defence of jadway
maggie intercepted the postcard
and kept it hidden for two weeks
im gonna see it later today
clay you gotta be kidding
you mean you traded away jerry
for something scrawled on a postcard
something you havent even seen
and what if the whole trade
was a con job
engineered by maggie
on behalf of the griffith family
mike hey ive got faith in maggie
ok man you keep the faith
mike look at the other
side of it man
cassie mcgraw for the defence
would be a sensation
clay when is maggie supposed
to turn over this postcard
mike some time later today
s0 youd better call
the sequence from the start
and to the best of your recollection
you have not omitted any pertinent facts
surrounding your arrest
at the argus book store
by sergeant kellog of
the county sheriffs office
n0 sir
your witness
were you previously arrested
under the terms of the
california penal code section 32
the section stating that everyone who
knowingly distributes obscene material
is guilty of a misdemeanour
yes
did you plead not guilty
n0
did you plead guilty of
selling obscene material
yes but only on the advice
of my attorney
he said if i pleaded guilty
i would get a lighter sentence
but you admitted guilt
yes i did
did you pay a fine
yes
did you go tojail
n0 the sentence was suspended
are you aware
that a second offence
is not a misdemeanour but a felony
yes
are you cognisant of the fact
that you can go to jail for a year
and be fined up to $25000
yes i am
are you aware that the publisher
the sanford house
pandered the seven minutes
with this garish poster
prominently displayed in front
of the argus book store
but there were other quotes
on similar advertising
that described it as
a distinguished work of art
no further questions your honour
when sanford house contracted
for the seven minutes
were you worried about it violating
existing obscenity laws
not really because i considered
the book to be beautiful and touching
it too well done to appeal
to s0meone prurient interest alone
do you consider the book to be beyond
the customary limits of candour
by contemporary community standards
certainly not in fact it
relatively mild by today standards
when you consider that motion pictures
and stage plays offer nudity copulation
oral-genital love masturbation
homosexuality lesbianism
community standards
have radically changed
your witness mr duncan
mr sanford i have before me
news clippings
from the new york times
and the wall street journal
which note the
shaky financial position
of sanford house
in the last two years
are these news accounts
substantially true
yes
elmo in short since you took over
quietly excuse me mr barrett
miss maggie russell wants you
to meet her right away
elmo as it has in the past
did she say where
she said youd know
sanford that depends on what
you mean by doing well
uh it is true that the firm
book sales uh have gone dovlm
elmo perhaps you were
desperate enough
to ignore your fathefis
previous good taste
and tried to save your
position in the firm
by publishing an obscene book
tyres screech
what going on
ive made a real mess of everything
uncle frank heard from yerkes
that we were seeing each other
apparently he known of
our relationship for some time
but my rising to your defence over
jerry well-being flipped him out
he told me to pack up and leave
he took my key
and waited until i was outside on the
front drive before slamming the door
s0 i lugged my things over here
from across the street
and the postcard
from cassie mcgraw
is still in his desk
im sorry
now you had to give up
your key right
the key to the front door yes
but not the one to
the rear service porch
then were just going to
have to sweat him out
because i gotta get my hands
on that postcard
mike my bags
brakes squeal
maggie what time is it
maggie
wait the light went out
there uncle frank
coming out the door
car door shuts
engine starts
in we go
music becomes more dramatic
oh damn it
tyres squeal
get it fast
ill go out in the street
brakes squeal
what the hell are you
doing in my driveway
you could have got us both killed
look sir im sorry i came by
to see miss russell and
well miss russell
doesnt live here any more
now you get your
lousy crate out of my driveway
i oughta put guys like you away
you son of a bitch
what the hell are you doing here
spying on me and my son
come on get out of the car
and say something you bastard
youre not in court now
oh id really like to clobber you
but youre not suckering me into that
now you get your ass outta here
if youre still snooping around
after ive parked my car
im gonna kick
the living hell out of you
then ill turn you over
to the cops for prowling
how does that grab ya
both engines start
tyres squeal
maggie gasps
that was a close call
mike let get the hell out of here
before i get my ass kicked
tyres squeal
well
it beautiful
if cassie mcgraw backs up in court
what she says in this postcard
the defence finally
has a star witness
now where can i take you before
i catch the next plane to chicago
i was hoping youd take me home
home
with you
lush romantic music
if jadway were alive today
hed be in his late 50s or early 60s
this woman is at least
5 or 20 years older
like all the old people
in this sanitarium
i never think of katie
in terms of years
that reminds me of something
as long as ive been here
and that going on five years
katie been getting flowers
once a year always on her birthday
who sends cassie the flowers
i dont know
theyre wired from ryan flowers
in oakwood california
phone rings
hello
hi maggie
mike i was praying it would be you
have you heard
i mean about sheri moore
she died in her sleep
yeah ljust finished
reading the story
are things any better in chicago
it couldnt be worse
cassie mcgraw will never speak
on the witness stand
the poor woman senile
what a lousy break
she has moments when she lucid
like when she wrote the postcard
but today wasnt one of them
im awfully sorry mike
all that trouble for nothing
chicago may not be a total loss
how do you mean
she receives roses every year
on her birthday
a standing order from ryan flowers
i called clay he gonna check on it
first thing tomorrow
mike i might be able to help you
when i was working as
frank griffith secretary
we dealt exclusively with that florist
s0
why dont you let me get in touch
with them id love to help
miss cumberland ill bet youre
wondering why im here
yes as a matter of fact i am
well the griffiths have
a lot to do with it
im terribly concerned
about jerry griffith
you know the boy who involved
in the obscenity trial
yes i watched it on
the news last night
it might sound strange to you
but one of my good friends
and i trust him implicitly
is michael barrett
the defence attorney in the case
he a very attractive
young man indeed
he genuinely believes that jadway
the seven minutes is not obscene
anyway he been racing all over
the country trying to find witnesses
who knew jadway or who
had some insight into his motives
he just visited with
cassie mcgraw in chicago
oh really
youre familiar with ryan flowers
well yes
mike asked me to check their records
did he
i was surprised to learn that
for the past ten years
you have been paying for
cassie mcgraw birthday flowers
how enterprising of you
how well did you know cassie mcgraw
cassie mcg raw was my private secretary
when i lived and worked in paris
ooh 35 years ago at that time
she was my only friend
very few people know about cassie
or about any of my life
at the time for that matter
much of it was not terribly pleasant
through the years
ive managed to keep it concealed
but why
you know of my longstanding
friendship with the griffiths
especially frank late wife
it was difficult to hide my contempt
of his behaviour toward his son jerry
now it my turn
to stand up and be counted
raunchy va-va-voom music
thank you baby doll
it in the bag we dont even need
the chippie creaking
elmo cant buy that newspaper
and the tv exposure
it also opens up
a whole new can of peas
we now have a case
of murder one as well
were gonna anticipate
a probability factor
of at least 90% for conviction
whose jerry
i think the griffith name
has been muck-raked enough
oh relax frank
it not your boy that on trial
it that obscene book
together with that ben fremont
that purveyor of filth
the slut death is just
icing on the cake
frankly i am more than
a little bit concerned
at the turn of events
it a brand new ball game
with sheri moore death
well if it any consolation
there the closing argument
mike dictated about four this morning
let pick up on it
it might give us a shot in the arm
mike supreme court justice douglas
once said
the idea of using censors to bar
thoughts of sex is dangerous
a person without sex thoughts
is abnormal
sex thoughts may
induce sex practices that
make for better
marital relations
sex thoughts that
make love more atiractive
certainly should not be outlawed
lf the illicit is included
that should make
no constitutional difference
your honour i call
constance cumberland to the stand
gasps of astonishment
please raise your right hand
do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
state your name for the record
constance cumberland
please be seated
miss cumberland
what is your present occupation
im an actress i have been
an actress for some 35 years
in motion pictures
and most recently on television
how do you occupy yourself
away from camera
well if you mean
what organisations do i belong to
im a working member
of the league for women voters
the reiss-davis centre
for emotionally disturbed children
and occasionally
ive given my public support
to the
strength through decency league
because like anyone else
with concern about today society
im against pornography
mainly because of the way
it appeals to the young people
who arent mature enough
to understand its implications
did you ever write
and publish any books
i did
were they works of fiction
some sceptics probably
suggested as much
laughter
but i consider my autobiography
to be a work of complete truth
what i mean is everything
that i published was honest
that doesnt mean
i published everything
laughter
are you acquainted with
the classical and modern fiction
as a reader yes i am
classical and modern
and also as an actress
i wouldnt want to bore the court
with my credits but
have you ever read a novel
entitled the seven minutes
by jj jadway
i have sir
have you read it more than once
ive read it many many times
how recently have you read
the book in its entirety
as recently as last night
are you familiar with section 32
of the california penal code
iam
do you know that the seven minutes
is being charged as obscene matter
under that section of the code
i do know that
do you consider the seven minutes
to be an obscene book
just a moment miss cumberland
your honour i object
to defence counsel question
no foundation has been
laid to establish
miss cumberland qualifications
to render such an opinion
with all due respect
to the acting abilities
and other impressive credentials
possessed by miss cumberland
i cannot imagine what bearing
her opinion on the merits of this book
could possibly have
upon the proceedings
your honour i would like
to approach the bench
both attorneys shall
approach the bench
mr barrett im concerned with your
examination of miss cumberland
it appears you are seeking
to elicit from this witness
an opinion which
she is not entitled to give
mr duncan has properly interposed an
objection which i mean to sustain
your honour if i may interrupt
forjust a moment
i assure you that
miss cumberland testimony
is critical to the defence case
i can
your honour i feel defence counsel
is testing the court patience
let him who is without sin
cast the first stone
dont you come on strong with me
gentlemen will you restrain
yourselves from this bickering
now mr barrett
i have the greatest admiration
for miss cumberland as an actress
but i fail to see what credentials
she possesses which enables her
to render an opinion concerning
the seven minutes unless
she is a qualified literary expert
and apparently she is not because
you have not qualified her as such
therefore she cannot give
an expert opinion
your honour it is very
just a moment mr duncan
i want to hear from the defence
i represent to you
as an officer of the court
that you will find this testimony
to be extremely relevant
and material to the def
let him make an offer of proof as to
the nature of this so-called material
do you have an offer of proof to make
your honour if im forced to make
an offer of proof at this time
the court is requiring me to disclose
my defence to the prosecution
in violation of my client
constitutional rights
this i respectfully refuse to do
if the court will just bear with me
permit me a few more questions
youll readily see the relevance
all right all right
but im warning you mr barrett
if the testimony in fact
is inadmissible
or highly prejudicial
to the prosecution
i will take strong measures
to deal with this
your honour may l
not at this time mr duncan
if the evidence is not
relevant and material
you may move to strike the testimony
at the appropriate time
now let proceed
miss cumberland do you
consider the seven minutes
to be an obscene book
no i do not i consider it
to be a highly moral book
do you believe the author of this work
was pandering to prurient interest
to a shameful or morbid interest
in nudity and sex
in writing this book
as the state charges
to which i object on the grounds
that this witness
is not qualified
to answer the question
mr duncan i believe your objection to
be well taken but the court believes
that the defence is entitled to
some leeway in this area
objection overruled
mr barrett will you please
reframe the question
miss cumberland do you believe
the author was in fact pandering
to a shameful and morbid interest
in nudity and sex
i know for a fact that that author was
not pandering to prurient interest
your honour i move to
strike from the record
miss cumberland conclusion and
conjecture that the author
was not in fact pandering
to prurient interest
obviously this witness could
have no personal knowledge
of the authofis true intentions
mr barrett i indicated that
i would give you leeway
however if you dont immediately
get to your point
the court will sustain its own
objection to your questions
very well your honour i will proceed
directly to the point
miss cumberland you stated that
the book the seven minutes
was not in fact written
to appeal to prurient interest
may i enquire how do you know
because im intimatedly acquainted
with the circumstances surrounding
the creation and the publication
of the seven minutes
excited murmuring
gavel banging repeatedly
judge miss cumberland will you
explain to the jurors and the court
how you came by
this intimate knowledge
gladly
no person alive was closer or better
acquainted with jj jadway than i am
miss cumberland are you implying
that you were present in paris
when jj jadway wrote
the seven minutes
im saying that lwas in paris
when the book was written
do you know the author
motivations for writing it
to which i object the question
calls for conclusion and speculation
miss cumberland could not possibly
have any personal knowledge
of the authofis true motivations
for writing the seven minutes
mr duncan we are getting on with this
matter if it the last thing we do
you will recall the court asked miss
cumberland to explain to thejury
how she has intimate knowledge
of the circumstances
under which the seven minutes
was written
now the court will not tolerate
any more interference
of mr barrett questioning
along these lines
objection overruled
mr barrett will you proceed
and ask another question
thank you your honour
miss cumberland you are familiar
with the prosecution testimony
does this first-hand knowledge
which you possess
confirm or contradict the testimony
given here by the people witnesses
my information about the real jadway
and the real purpose in writing
and publishing this book
completely contradicts the evidence
so far presented in this court
you do understand that the
previous witnesses were sworn
gave their testimony under oath
and risked facing a charge of
perjury if they lied
they did not lie
they simply did not tell the truth
merely because they were ignorant
of the truth let me explain
everything heard in this courtroom
until now about jj jadway
and i am completely fluent
with all of the testimony
has been the purest fiction
and this fiction was deliberately
planned and perpetrated by the author
for reasons involving
the author private life
let me go directly
to the salient point at hand
you indicated in earlier testimony
that you had published
your own autobiography which
was a best-seller as i recall
have you ever written or published
any other books
yes i have
how many other books
one book
was this book published under the name
of constance cumberland
no it was not it was
published under a pseudonym
suspenseful music
can you tell the court
the title of that book
and the pseudonym
under which you wrote it
the book was the seven minutes
gasps of astonishment
by jj jadway
hubbub in court
i am jj jadway
pencil snaps loudly
dramatic music
gavel banging
order in court order order
miss cumberland the court has already
heard the seven minutes read aloud
s0 we might more clearly
determine the significance
of what we have already heard
would you mind telling us
the themes and symbols that you
tried to convey in writing the book
may i have a glass of water please
thank you
clock ticking loudly
the seven minutes is composed
of seven chapters
each chapter representing one minute
in the mind of
this young woman kathleen
who is lying on a bed
having sexual intercourse
with an unnamed unseen man
it begins with a description
of her thoughts and feelings
for her male bed partner
kathleen mind reacts
to the coupling on two levels
on the first she records
her immediate physical sensations
and on the second inspired
by her gradually mounting passion
she recollects fragments of sensual
experiences from her youthful past
with three actual men in her life
who had been her lovers
the thrust of the novel
is drawn out of the fact
that kathleen decides to accept one of
these men as her lifetime mate
the one she had taken
to her bed this night
the very one who shares
her seven minutes
not till the last page while
she is gasping her love for him
in the final throes of her passion
does she call out and reveal the name
of the one she has chosen
you see through her vast
sexual experience she has managed
to liberate a sensitive
but potentially impotent man
the man she honestly loved
in writing the seven minutes
i finally found freedom myself
just as i had hoped
i might liberate others
from fear and guilt and shame
do you know of any other readers for
which it has performed this service
the words in the seven minutes
freed a young man only today
and enabled him to confide to me
the truth about himself
a truth he has told no other person
until now
jerry griffith was not driven to
commit rape by reading this book
he did not try to violate
sheri moore against her will
he tried but at
sheri own invitation
but he failed then
as he had always failed before
and as he would fail today
because you see jerry griffith
was then was before and even today
is still sexually impotent
he is incapable of
attaining an erection
miss cumberland did the verdict
for acquittal surprise you
what surprised me more
was the very fact
that i was able to
reveal myself in court
there was testimony about
your supposed suicide
you look pretty good to me right now
so obviously youre alive and kicking
did you ever really try
to kill yourself
constance well that whole
incredible story
was arranged by
a poet friend of mine
a loyal and dear friend
named sean oflanagan
it was simple enough for him to write
and plant the obituary of jj jadway
cassie mcgraw arranged a private
memorial service for jadway
i found it wiser to be somewhere else
miss cumberland what made you decide
to renounce the jadway identity
well i had an offer
from a hollywood producer
someone i had met in paris
to appear in the go/d-diggers of 938
anyway i went to hollywood
made gold-diggers
and you know the rest
maggie laughing
be nice you won
ill be right back
oh mr barrett
i dont know if you heard me
with all the noise after the verdict
but i did congratulate you
i appreciate that sir
you won the preliminary
you got the seven minutes off the hook
but the main event
is still murder one
and i intend to prosecute perkins
to the full limit of the law
jerry griffith has a debt as well
as an accomplice he shares
the responsibility for the crime
he wont run from that
when he has his day in court
ill be standing right next to him
you proved that one of
my witnesses perjured himself
and that another one unwittingly lied
but you didnt prove
at least not to me
that this filthy book
belongs in a decent household
and jadway or cumberland
i still believe the seven minutes
is obscene and harmful
and should have been found guilty
and as for the author
of that perverted book
constance cumberland stands
as a black stain on our society
well youre entitled
to your opinion
barrett such books are dangerous
and should not be published
because they can hurt
immature and disturbed adults
even worse
they can over-stimulate a child
before he ready to accept
his sex thoughts as natural
and drive him into
damaging sexual fantasies
in other words mr duncan
all literature and all ideas
should be aimed at satisfying
the twelve-year-old reader
youre a pitiful hypocrite
and a political opportunist to boot
you spout your clever rhetoric
about god mother and country
and yet you connive and scheme
without regard to anyone but yourself
it amazes me that an intelligent man
cannot direct his energies
into what is good for the community
he supposed to protect
instead he spends his time
racing off to court
seeking a ban on those things
he arbitrarily feels is bad for us
youve got your goddamn nerve
you win one lousy case
you think youre f lee bailey
let me tell you one thing
as long as there are books
like the seven minutes
or anything else i feel jeopardises
the moral fibre of this community
ill keep fighting them
tyres squeal
fair warning
but as long as you keep
strong-arming yourself ahead
ill be fighting you
mike maggie if you knew all along
about jerry sexual problem
if you knew he was
incapable of rape
why the hell didnt you
say something
because i wasnt all that certain
that he was impotent
on the night of the sa-cal/ed rape
mike where did jerry and
miss cumberland finally get together
maggie in your house yesterday
while you were still in chicago
i took the chance
of pretending to him
that i knew the truth about
his night with sheri moore
at that point jerry broke down
and confessed everything
miss cumberland was really touched
she said if she could persuade jerry
to stand up and confess the truth
then she herself might find the
courage to do the same in court
maggie youre beautiful
just beautiful
listen if youre really so grateful
how about a little
victory celebration
you know i dont drink
anything stronger than coke
and i also know youve given up
cigarettes and cyclamates
because youre only thirty
and want to live to be a hundred
i was thinking of
something a lot healthier
car engine revs up
to michael barrett
i salute you on your deserved victory
and i recommend that you
enjoy this vintage wine
in the spirit that it is given
beware of greeks bearing gifts
l also recommend to you
the wisdom of charles lamb
to wit he is
no lawyer who cannot take two sides
when you have time
i would like to interest you in
my side of the coin
you could find it
extremely profitable
who knows you could be
senatorial material
best luther yerkes
luther yerkes
young lady
i feel it only fair to tell you
that what im thinking about doing
is against the law
and what are you thinking about doing
i cant tell you that
it against the law too
suddenly i got this overpowering urge
to break the damn law myself
well we could both get into
a lot of trouble
i know a very good lawyer
aside from notoriety what else
do you want out of my life
would you believe
the next seven minutes
clock ticking
soft rock ballad
seven minutes
filled with pleasure
moments made of love
will take you
on a sweet excursion
by wayof
your memory
suddenly you find
you cross the boundfies
that were once forbidden
aii at once you have
a better view
of the morning
you in the morning
you in the morning
