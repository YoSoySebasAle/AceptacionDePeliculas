be a hurricane that month
youre stuck with 00000
of these flower lace

well i am making a
point mr humphries
the point is schooner
tuna is one of the three
most expensive tunas on the market
now if we want to beat our competitors
the time for these gimmicks
and giveaways is over with
now i dont mean to be
disrespectful mr humphries
but housewives need your
help not your gimmicks
show them that you really
care about their problems
and youll win their loyalty
now this is what i propose
schooner tuna sympathizes
with those hit so hard
by this trying economy
to help you we are reducing
the price of our tuna by 50 cents a can
when this crisis is over
well go back to our regular prices
