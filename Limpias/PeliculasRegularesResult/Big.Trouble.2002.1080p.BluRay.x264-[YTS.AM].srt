
god said to noah i am going
to put an end to all people
for the earth is filled
with violence because of them
you are to bring into the ark
two of all living creatures
to keep them alive with you
in other words life is hard
so you better find someone
who will be your partner
eliot arnold story
is a lot like noah
except eliot story
takes place in miami
you just cant beat these
when theyre really fresh
anyway eliot should probably
tell you exactly what happened
because i was locked in the trunk
of a police car for part of it
my name puggy
and i live in a tree
i hope i didnt ruin anything
for you
i iook at this ad
and it doesnt say
fish hook ale to me
this sucks
bruce what
im trying to do --
do you know what
my business philosophy is
no bruce
what is it
my business philosophy
is that there a lot of people
in the world
that certainly
isnt --
and all these people
want something
do you know what they want
well i --
they want to feel good
you know what i mean
yeah well i --
no you dont know
what i mean
because i gave you
the perfect concept
which is not
this piece of shit here
what the hell is this
why are you saying ugly
i dont want to see ugly
that not the feeling
i want
bruce
w-what im doing here
is -is contrast
in a humorous fashion
get hooked on fish hook --
that the concept
you got a guy and a boat
and a girl
the giri in a bikini
she has big tits
theyre on a boat getting
shitfaced drinking fish hook ale
the girl
has really big tits
the feeling of this ad is
somebody going to get laid
it perfect
i gave you the perfect concept
and you give me ugly
all right all right
bruce ill try --
no no dont tell me try
i hate the word try
try is for losers
listen to me you are not the
only ad agency in this town
a year ago
i had a nice house
a beautiful wife
and a job i really loved
now i was being called a loser
by this guy
for 8 years i wrote a column
for the miami herald --
funny stories the higher-ups
referred to as offbeat
deeber wants
to see you
because id won two pulitzer
prizes for my offbeat stories
i was pretty much left alone
and treated with a great deal
of respect
until ken deeber came
eliot
john croton tells me you still
havent turned anything in
on the day-care crisis
yeah ken iisten
i figure with five peopie
already working
on the day-care crisis story
our readers pretty much know
there a crisis in day care
eliot you were given an
assignment -i know that
the pelican story
right
no one else has it
this old cuban guy
is training pelicans --
to drop bombs -the most
asinine thing i ever heard
come on he tried to
kill castro with a bird
eliot i gave you an
assignment and you will do it
or what ken
well if you want to continue
working at this newspaper
you will put something
in here before you go home
why dont i put something
in there right now
deeber picked
the wrong day to be a jerk
earlier that day
i had found out
my wife was having an affair
with her tennis instructor
in retrospect
i should have written
the day-care crisis piece
and never opened
eliot arnold advertising
and if you think im gonna pay
for this stupid shit
you can forget it
im not paying for ugiy
i can get ugiy for free
it goes without saying
bruce
eliot

the geo tonight

the undercoating
anything else
youd like to know

to matt the geo was
a 48-mile-per-gallon symbol
of my bad luck wrong choices
and missed opportunities
little did i know that my shot
at a second chance
had just arrived in miami
onboard flight 57
from new orleans
the suitcase
was sandwiched between
a quarter-ton of frozen crawfish
and a dalmatian that gave birth
to a litter of 7
over lake okeechobee
the dalmatian
made the evening news
the suitcase didnt
what is it
it looks like
a garbage disposal
so this is miami huh
they can keep it
you got that right
that a remington
30-aught-6 hunting rifle
with a bushnell scope
charlton heston takes his
to shoot bighorn elk
henry desalvo
and leonard ferroni
take theirs to shoot anyone
as long as theyre paid
25 grand apiece
we play with a guy
that cheats
actually henry and
leonard didnt play golf at all
will you come on
weve got an early tee time
they were in miami
to kill a man named arthur herk
who had stolen money
from his employer
puggy arrived in miami
the same day as the hit men
and the suitcase
but for a much different reason
a week earlier
at his place in boston
puggy read an article
in martha stewart living
that said miami had some
of the finest cuban restaurants
in the entire world
since fritos
were his favorite food
and corn chips
as close to cuban cuisine
as puggy had ever eaten
he decided to hop a fishing boat
and check it out
puggy could not have been
happier
after only 20 minutes in miami
puggy was already thinking
that this had to be the warmest
friendliest place on earth
you stink
beer and a bag of fritos
she ran track for 0 years
she definitely has the legs
out
i teii you once before
you two out
look man we got money
and well take however
this much here will get us
ass-wipe
snake dupree
and eddie leadbetter
had met two years earlier
at the state prison
just outside louisville
they hit it off immediately
having similar tastes in humor
ass-wipe
you know
i dont know how long she been
into strength conditioning
but she been into conditioning
for a long time
because she ran track for 0
listen to
the crowd they are so into it

so as not to fall
strong

for you
after only one day in miami
puggy had
a more satisfying career
and lived in a better
neighborhood than i did
sound system sucks

so he bought a loser car
besides he a dork
super soaker 600 holds

being in the universe
entered his life
under the influence of the
toad hallucinogenic chemicals
roger thought his furry butt
was a 24-ounce porterhouse
nice cut of meat
and notice how it is nice and
thick all along up till about here

what does a guy iike arthur
do for a iiving
he an executive
at penultra corporation
i did
an article on them once
they built the jail downtown
where the plumbing doesnt work
i called it
crapital punishment
eliot arnold
from the herald
i used to read your column
you were so funny
what happened
i lost my sense of humor
in the divorce
how does a guy like arthur
end up
with someone like you
i married him
when jenny was little
my first husband
left us kind of early
and we had to move to this
crappy little apartment
and i met arthur
he was different then
i keep looking up divorce
lawyers in the phone book
but then i think about
that horrible apartment
it unavailable
i live there
can i borrow this
im totally into
the seminal fluids
arthur threw mine out
at the carwash
he doesnt think it music
unless somebody
playing an accordion
ill drive
i say we blame
the whole evening
on rap music and too much
violence on television
you could yell at me if itd
make you feel more dad-like
i dont want
to yeii at you
why dont we talk
you and i --
let just talk
come on
okay mom wanted me
to remind you
that the alimony check
is due monday
see
that wasnt so hard
look matt --
dad i messed up tonight
everybody messes up
you know that
better than anybody
so all im saying is
i dont think i need
any fatheriy advice from you
about how to live my life
when youre not doing
such a hot job living yours
hey were talking
okay
now it my turn
up yours
you little shithead
your turn
puggy
i bring you some lunch
listen i love you
you see
you see the difference
you ask a guy
what he wants --
tits or an ugly fish --
see what he tells you
probably --
tits i gotta boogie
hey she should
be leaning over
for maximum exposure
maximum exposure
maximum exposure
that advertising
terminology
oh i see
to what do i owe
this pleasure
uh did you happen to lose
a pair of reading glasses
last night
i dont wear glasses
oh well then i guess i
made the trip for nothing
nonsense ill need them one
day -not right this minute
well things change
ill need them
um hey could i offer you
some coffee
that would be wonderful
it more of a dare
than an offer actuaiiy
did the police
find anything
well
after meeting arthur
they figure
im the primary suspect
so
how do you uh
like it
oh light and sweet
mmm
mmm
oh
mmm
mmm
uh mm oh

i hope
i didnt hurt you
no no that --
didnt know i was um --
well we should go
let -let uh

later that day
arthur herk stopped by to have
a friendly chat with his boss
morning douche bag
arthur
jesus what happened
to your hair
it a wig you moron
dont act stupid
i know you know
what going on
those dickwads upstairs
are trying to have me whacked
hey hey first of all those
decisions are made way over my head
and secondly you stole money
from them arthur
what do you expect them
to do
look bitch you take that express
elevator upstairs to the top floor
and you tell those sugar-cane-sucking
scumbags to lay off
or im gonna blow the lid
on this whole operation
youre putting me
in a very awkward position
no no no
no no no no no
an awkward position
is what youre going to be in
when the fbl is shining a
proctoscope up your big fat ass
i have evidence
and ill use it
he didnt have evidence
but he knew
where he could get some
and that made arthur herk
a very dangerous man
arthur may not have been
a genius
but he did know that the bullet
that went through x ena head
was meant for his
penultra construction had arranged
for the hit when they discovered
arthur had been skimming money
from the company
up until yesterday arthur herk
had been their bagman
gentlemen

can i get personal
oh now youre asking
your daughter

a pretty good relationship
the divorce arthur -she doesnt
throw any of that in your face
oh i told jenny a long time
ago that i wasnt perfect
she tried
to accept my mistakes
and i try to accept hers
sounds simple
well i mean
it wasnt that simple
when she came home with a
scorpion tattooed on her butt
matt hates me
he basically thinks
im a loser
he called me a loser
so i called him a shithead
if we had bad teeth we
could go on jerry springer

two strangers together
so that one soul
inhabits two bodies

sometimes it fritos

she wants my soul
