i dont believe it
whereve you come from
washington
good to see you
you too
do you want to tell me about it
about what
your stick fighting yesterday
in the warehouse in bangkok
you saw that
yes
and today youre working in a monastery
they let me live here
and i help them with repairs
and the stick fighting
some extra money
i saw you give it to those monks
you see a lot
and who are they
theyre the reason im here
this is robert griggs
from our embassy here
john rambo
pleased to meet you
youre hard to find
are you keeping track of me
what does the colonel say
good men are hard to find
take a look at these pictures
i dont know
what you know about afghanistan
most people dont even know where it is
but over two million civilians
mainly peasant families
have been killed by russian troops
many newly developed weapons
including chemical warfare
were used to wipe them out
with great success
i guess you dont know about
the current state of affairs
after nine years of fighting
afghanistan is getting stinger missiles
to defend against the air strikes
except for one region
80 km behind the border
the soviet commander there
seems to be really brutal
as the photos show
he prevents
any outside help getting in
and that why wed like to
check out the problem firsthand
and what have i got to do with it
im to go there
but youre not going to
sure with you john
i put in my time
what does that mean
my war is over
but you said he was a great soldier
alright
it long way down those stairs
dont hold it against him
he just obeying orders
it an important mission
and we can make a difference
that why were going
it didnt work before
those were different times
come with me john
i dont know what you think
but i like it here
i like living and working here
it good to belong somewhere
but you dont belong here
when are you coming full circle
what do you mean
you say your war is over
the war outside maybe
but not the one inside you
i know why youre here
but it doesnt work like that
youre trying to change yourself
but you stay who you are
and what am i
a full-blooded fighter
i dont want to be that any more
but that what you are
listen john
there was once a sculptor
who found a very special stone
he carried it home and worked on it
for months until it was finished
then he showed it to his friends
they said great statue
but the sculptor said
the statue had always been there
all he had done
was to knock away a few pieces
we didnt make you
into a fighting machine
we just knocked the rough edges off you
you have to finally
come to terms with yourself
until you come full circle
i guess im not ready yet
i have to go
come and see me
when youre next in the states
i promise
im sorry
but it has to end for me sometime
i understand
take cover
drop your weapons and stand still
you cant escape
drop your weapons
there no escape
drop your weapons
at once
something went wrong
what happened
the soviets intercepted the team
trautman and the others
were taken to the enemy camp
and now
i cant do anything
im sorry
i just thought you should know
you
can you get me in
youre not serious
of course i am
officially it not possible
then unofficially
you should know one thing
if you get taken prisoner
or something leaks out
well deny any knowledge of you
im used to it
youll hear from me
you want buy many guns
no im looking for mousa chanin
what your name
john rambo
r 7
they sell well here
because of the landmines
everywhere landmines
i am mousa chanin what do you want
griggs sent me
you dont look like the guys
he usually sends soldiers
im not a soldier
then what a mercenary
no
a tourist that lost his way
im not a tourist
sorry
do you know where the american is
in a soviet fort
near khost 30 miles from the border
mr griggs sent
the supplies you wanted
do you want to see
yes
did you order these
yes
ive never seen anything like it before
what are these
detonators
and this
a blue light
what does it do
turns blue
i see
how many men will come with us
im the rescue team
that crazy one isnt enough
we need more people
griggs said youd take me there
so do it
i have to take medicine with me;
if not many people will die
do you understand
i dont know you
but from the way you look
you have no experience of war
or do you
ive fired a gun before
fired a gun before
maybe you should go home again
and think things over
very long
ive done that
oh really
ok if that what you want
but you cant get
that american out alone
if it doesnt work dont blame me
im not taking the responsibility
sounds familiar
i am colonel zaysen
regional commander of this sector
youre the first american
to be captured in afghanistan
congratulations
i believe you plan
to supply the enemy rebels
with stinger missiles
to destroy soviet aircraft
ill only answer to your superiors
out here i have no superiors
i am in full command
youre on your own
abandoned by your government
what do you want
cooperation
this sector has been controlled by us
for five years
there not much left for me to do
there is so to speak
no challenge any more
if you give me information
about the planned stinger deliveries
we could both get out of here
after all that is what we all want
peace
in the kremlin
they really have a sense of humor
explain
to the world you talk about peace
and here you butcher a whole people
were not butchering anyone
youre too intelligent
to believe that propaganda
again where are the missiles
i dont know anything about missiles
of course
but you dont understand
that i can get us out of here
do you want sympathy
after all you started this war
it just a question of time
until we have total victory
there wont be any victory
youre losing ground every day
to badly equipped freedom-fighters
you simply underestimated
the competition
didnt you take history at school
this region was always independent
they prefer to die rather than
become slaves to occupying forces
you cant conquer a people like that
we tried it
we had our vietnam
now youve got yours
oh i see
you want to test me
good
this is afghanistan
alexander the great
tried to conquer it
then ghenghis khan
the english and now the russians
but the afghan people
cant be conquered
an old enemy wrote a prayer about us
do you want to hear it
very well it goes like this
“may god deliver us
from the cobra venom
from the tiger teeth
and the afghan vengeance“
do you understand that
that you dont take any shit
something like this
go on
in the north there are lots of caves
that we can use
itll be safer let go
this cave leads
to the “valley of the five lions
the afghan king was supposed
to send 500 warriors into battle
he only sent five
the five best and they won
he said
better five lions than 500 sheep
what dyou think of that
the king was lucky
how much longer till the village
about two hours
where in my sector
are the missiles being delivered
i dont know
youre lying
ok ill tell you
i knew you were lying
so where are the missiles
real close
how close
in your ass
youve tested
my patience long enough
up till now
ive behaved in a civilized way
the name john rambo
have you heard it before
he says a rescue attempt
is being planned with rebel help
he says he knows
where this man is heading
we will welcome him
it the last village in the valley
00 people live here
lots of kids
yes they are good fighters too
ill tell the leaders
we want to talk to them
theyve never seen
a man like you here before
theyre mujahedin horsemen
at the border there are 0000 more
they are waiting there for weapons
then theyll come and fight here
let go to the hospital
he is the only doctor
for 500 km
the first medication
for two months
more gifts from the soviets mines
they look like toys
some children learn too late
that theyre not
that uri he russian
a deserter
a defector
there are lots of them
he can help us best;
he knows the inside of the fort
wed better leave now
this is where the mines start
one meter here then two meters there
then round here
there are four watchtowers
with four guards
here here here and here
where are the prisoners
here
once were in
is there another way out
underground
where the dirty water is
i dont know the right word
he means the sewer
where is it
here it comes out here
there are guards patrolling
better not to go that way
then well go through the minefield
that impossible
it full of spetnaz commandos
were just a few
weve lost many men already
well lose more that way
i dont need many men
what your plan
two men for the minefield
two for the rescue
the soviets will come back again
and more people will die
i cant wait
you have to wait for help like us
then ill go alone
you will die
then ill die
wait
please dont go
my name is masoud
let me explain
why we cant help you
most afghans are very strong
and we dont want to be
driven out of our country
our children are dying
of disease mines poison gas
our women are being raped and killed
last year in the legman valley
the next valley
6000 afghans were killed
pregnant women were bayoneted
and their babies thrown in the fire
they do that so that there can be
no new generation of afghans
but nobody sees it and
the papers dont report it
the men you see here
are mujahedin
holy warriors
this war is a holy war for us
for a mujahedin there is no death
because we have already
made our peace with god
and consider ourselves dead
for us dying for our country
and for god is an honor
that my friend is why
we must stop the murder of our families
if we succeed in freeing the man
and he tells the free world
that our war here is necessary
then of course we will help
let us now discuss amongst ourselves
how we can best free the man
thank you
we thank you
dont worry
theyll soon make a decision
we have to leave this evening
what your name
this boy is very hard inside
his parents were killed last year
his brother died in the fort

the sheep has to be carried round once
and then thrown in the circle
why
because there is a circle there
and that all
very simple
like football
god must love crazy people
why
he made so many of them
