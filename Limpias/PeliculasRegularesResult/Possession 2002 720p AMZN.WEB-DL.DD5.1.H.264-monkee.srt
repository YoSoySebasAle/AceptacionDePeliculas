they say that women change
tis so
but you are ever constant
in your changefulness
like that still thread
of falling river
one from source to last embrace
in the still pool
ever-renewed and ever-moving on
from first to last
from first to last
a myriad of water drops
and you i love you for it
are the force that moves
and holds the form
ladies and gentlemen

necessity of continuing our talk

how many jars of gooseberry jam did

cooking 42
what about a small
informal party 859
my headache kept me from accompanying
randolph to crabb-robinson
for a dinner honoring the poetess
christabel lamotte
he was reluctant to attend without me
i was persistent and persuaded him
ash do you know professor spear
im delighted
mrs jameson
mrs jameson
charmed
miss glover
miss glover
and miss lamotte
miss lamotte
the highest pleasure
randolph reported the party went off
very well indeed
the discussion of poetry
was animated
with miss lamotte speaking more
forcibly than anyone expected
it surprises me that a lady
who lives as quietly as you
would be aware
of my modest success
i am very aware of it
the papers herald you weekly
it is you however who surprise me
why is that
judging from your work im surprised
you acknowledge my existence
or any woman since you show us
such small regard on the page
you cut me madam
then im sorry
i only meant to scratch
hey fergus
hello roland what is it you chaps
always say how it hanging
we usually just say hey
i mean unless youre gay
listen let me ask you
do you know a dr maud bailey
yes i know maud very well
she teaches gender studies at lincoln
would she be helpful im checking out
christabel lamotte a poet from 859
why are you interested
i had some requests about ellen ash
papers and lamotte name came up
the keeper of ellen flame
that bottom of the food chain
but i gotta stay on the food chain
that why i do it
right publish or perish as they say
or in your case perish or perish
so would she this maud bailey
yes but id be careful
why what she like
she thicks men blood with cold
great
if you prefer the american vernacular
she a regular ball-breaker
mr michell
what im sorry
roland michell
yes
youre maud
bailey dr bailey yes
there nothing in my index
no mention of ash at all
ash and lamotte definitely met
when
june 859 at a dinner party given
by crabb-robinson it in his diary
you jump from that to the idea
they corresponded
i found an unfinished letter
to lamotte
no dear madam
but of the three women at that party
lamotte is likeliest
lamotte letters may have something
there arent many from that period
im descended from christabel
im her niece thrice removed
three greats
that what thrice usually means
maybe i shouldnt have come
does seem rather pointless
you could have a look
through blanche diary
who blanche
blanche glover
christabel companion
her lover you look surprised
i didnt know
she was a lesbian
dont get me wrong i like lesbians
unfortunately they didnt have video then
i see why you think it so unlikely
no she could have been bisexual
there no evidence she was but
did you not read before you came
is this an oral exam
i suppose it is
you dont know about her
and yet you make these leaps
you called her a lesbian not me
letters letters letters not for me
letters i am not meant to know or see
thank you jane
you do not have to hide them from me
im not hiding them
you say they are not hidden
but they are
tucked away
as if they were from cupid himself
what does he want
to be my friend
friend
they give what they want a decent name
blanche no
no blanche listen
what we have is ours
no one can change that
it is already changed
find anything
maybe
so what are those bookmarks then
blanche writes about letters letters
that christabel wrote and received
and it nearly drove blanche crazy
where are they
lost destroyed who knows
there lots we havent got
not one of blanche paintings
has ever turned up
so who wrote the letters
weve never verified it but ash
certainly isnt one of the candidates
youve got nothing
i mean it just a thought
ive had many thoughts today
and youve shot them all down
it seems like a bit
of a wild-goose chase to me
id like to do some more reading
i suppose youll wish
to stay overnight
i cant afford to stay
unless i huddle in your doorway
i suppose i could put up with you
for one evening couldnt i
no doubt you know fergus wolfe then
sorry were in the same department
i imagine he told you that were
occasionally on together
no he didnt
what did he
did he say anything about me
no
ill use the bathroom
get out of your way
im just a brush and flush
kind of guy so
forget i said that
maud can i show you something
are these
the originals
how did you get
i stole them
where from
the london library
how could you do that
impulse
impulse ive seen that
take-what-you-want attitude
what in other americans
god what is it with you people
and americans
i know i shouldnt have taken them
i want to find out
if he sent the letter
you dont buy it but blanche
diary suggests that it possible
wouldnt someone have unearthed it
that why it big
potentially so big
well no one has
probably because those
were never sent
are you doing your homework
no i was just writing stuff
stuff for me it nothing
youre a closet poet
more like basement really
just fooling around
so is that what you want to be
no ill be safe and teach
like everybody else
besides there no such thing
as poets anymore
well poet
do you want to see christabel
family home before you go
michell late again
roland asked for another day off
fergus
really where he gone
i didnt ask and he didnt say
he an american
he probably trafficking drugs
did his new discovery
lead to anything
ash vico are you dreaming
vico
no it about christabel lamotte
he went to see dr bailey a woman
lamotte
no
it probably came to nothing
exactly
or he would have told you
wouldnt he
seal court over there
so how long did christabel live there
ages last 20 or so years of her life
excuse me
sorry
to a dusty shelf we aspire
you should drop by seal court
before your train
what do you do in london mr michell
are you a teacher
no not yet im doing a fellowship
which means what
on the dole
my field victorian poetry
we had a poet in this house once
terrible sentimental stuff about god
death the dew and fairies
show this young man
christabel room maud
and why dont you stay tonight
youre under no obligation to stay
just joan way misses our daughter
it quite a drive back
no were fine
hardly ever come up here
with the wheelchair of course
we bunk down on the ground floor
i havent been up here
since i was a child
maud
is this the photograph at your house
yes christabel niece may
my great-great grandmother
christabel wrote dozens of poems
about this place
what are they who haunt our dreams
and weaken our desires
and turn us from a solid face
and in the depth of wintry night
they slumber open-eyed and bright
dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
no rush of action
this is our doom
to live a long life out
in a dark room
maud
it pretty incredible
fergus it me
im out of town tonight on business
id like to ask you about a connection
between christabel and randolph ash
call me on 05-226-3246
roland
roland
no
roland it me it maud
what is it
listen
dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
god
i was so sure
sympathy sympathy sympathy
meaning what
mutual affection or understanding
favor pity or accord that not it
that not it at all
she uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context
like structure or support dolly
conceals it but not within beneath
there a door
i cant believe it
let me see
be careful theyre precious
i will be
we shouldnt be doing this
whyd you drag me up here then
what are you doing
im gonna read
weve got to ask the baileys
ask and youll see these under glass
stop stop all right
can we do it properly
let me get notecards and pencils
all right go go hurry
look at this we got ash
and christabel letters listen
dear miss lamotte
it was a great pleasure to talk to you
at dear crabb-robinson party
may i hope that you too
enjoyed our talk
and may i have the pleasure
of calling on you
she says no
but you may write
would you rather not have a letter
however imperfect
than a plate of cucumber sandwiches
however exquisitely fine cut
you know you would and so would i
i was entranced and moved
by your portrait of your father
i write nonsense
if you write again you shall
have an essay on what you will
yours to command in some things
i was born
christabel lamotte
in a small place too
not like this not bare
a brilliant dusty hutch of mysteries
a cabinet of curiosities
what did my eyes first light on
i am a creature of my pen
my pen is the best part of me
i send you now two more poems
i read your mythic tales of maia and
found them both charming and sad
your verse is rich
but the metaphor is richer
dear mr ash i live circumscribed
and self-communing
it is best so
not like a princess in a thicket
more like a spider in her web
inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers
not perceiving the distinction until
too late thus it is unwise to call
i know you live very quietly
but i could be very quiet
i only want to discuss dante
shakespeare
wordsworth coleridge goethe
not forgetting of course christabel
lamotte and the ambitious fairy project
sir things flicker and shift
all spangle and sparkle and flashes
i have sat all this long evening by my
fireside turning towards a caving in
the crumbling of the consumed coals
to where i am leading myself
to lifeless dust sir
my dear friend for i may
call myself a friend may i not
i speak to you as i would to any person
who possesses my true thoughts
my thoughts have spent more time in
your company than anyone else lately
where my thoughts are
there am i in truth
my dear friend
it has been borne in upon me
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation
the world would not approve
of letters between a woman living in
shared solitude as i do and a man
even if that man were a great poet
and if one is to live in this way
it imperative to appear respectable
in the eyes of that world and your wife
it is a sealed pact
it is a chosen life in which i
have been wondrously happy
and not alone in being so
i have chosen a way dear friend
i must hold to it
be patient be generous forgive
may i also request that you
return my correspondence
in this way at least our letters
shall remain together
i have known incandescence and must
decline to sample it any further
this goes to the post forgive its faults
and forgive me christabel
my dear christabel your letter came
as a shock to me i will confess
i was at first not only shocked
but angry that you should write so
as you have asked about my wife
however i will tell you
i love ellen
but not as i love you
there are good reasons i cannot discuss
why my love for you may not hurt her
i do not feel i have been
a proper wife to you
without children or any physical
nonsense ellen
nonsense
there are many types of love
all sorts
and ours
that good between us
has been most profound
i must say to you what is in my mind
ive called you my muse and so you are
i could call you
with even greater truth my love
whoa whoa
what
dont do that what
he sends her more letters and she
doesnt answer him she ignores him
typical
no she chose her life with blanche
it not typical it remarkable
i hope this note is the dove
which will return with
the wished-for olive branch
my letters are like noah ravens
they have sped out across the thames
and yet have not returned
i send this note by hand
in the hope you might receive it
where are the letters
theyre gone
i tore them up burned them
and the others from my desk
the same
i beg for us to be as we were
christabel
sweetheart please
this house
so happy once is full of weeping
and wailing and black headaches
i ask myself to whom i may turn
and think of you my friend
the unwitting cause
of all this grief
i shant forget the first glimpse
of your form
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight
i have dreamt nightly of your face
and walked the landscape of my life
with the rhythms of your writing
ringing in my ears
i shall never forget our shining
progress towards one another
never have i felt such a concentration
of my entire being
i cannot let you burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human can stand in a fire
and not be consumed
mind reading that last part out
one more time
i cannot let you burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human can stand in a fire
and not be consumed
that
yeah
thank you and
and i took your hand
mine rested in yours
with trust and belief
do you have regrets
i should regret venturing out
to crabb-robinson party that evening
i should regret it but i do not
not even in that most sensible
corner of my heart
what are we to do
i do not wish to damage your life
nonetheless i shall be in the church
at noon tomorrow
with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers
that you should join me
on a journey to yorkshire
a journey out of time
beyond our lives here on earth
this is unbelievable
that was the last one
youre kidding me
no
did she go with him or not
hands up
you two
what this then
there been no harm done george
how do we know
it was very clever of maud
to find your treasure
yes well
must take advice joanie
how long before he takes advice
hell dither around for a while
but not long
blanche diary has nothing
for that period
did ellen keep a journal
yeah in london
but it mostly housewife stuff
gold is in that stuff
we should check it
bailey here
bailey
is that dr heath
no im a friend of maud bailey
is she there
no she isnt
could you get off the line
im expecting the doctor
have you seen roland michell
not since this morning no
but his work went well
the fairy poet
i havent the foggiest idea
do you mean christabel lamotte
get off the line
i looked in ellen diary
and there nothing
but this should cheer you up
it in her correspondence
i wont ask if this is the original
i wouldnt
dear mrs ash i am at present
totally unknown to you
but i have something to impart
to which concerns both of us
and is in my case
a matter of life and death
may i trespass on your time
and come to see you
you would do wrong to keep this
evidence which i send to you now
it is not mine it is also not yours
what i say is true and urgent
as you will see
yours sincerely blanche glover
mrs ash
maybe blanche kept the letters
and showed them to ellen
it all fits beautifully
perhaps both of our departments
should work on this together
is that what you want
do you
no i want to find out what happened
i wanna follow their trail
i need to know
i thought you were mad when you came
to lincoln with your stolen letter
now i feel exactly the same
i havent really thanked you
i mean properly for all of this
i have difficulty with compliments
and such
giving or receiving
both actually
well i wont tell you
youre amazing-looking then
thank you
i wouldnt act on it anyway
with fergus and all
what does and all mean
nothing it just a little problem
that i have socially
do you take anything for it
it not that kind of a problem
it just relationships on the whole
theyre not really for me
anyway
yes
anyway thank you
youre welcome
thank you for agreeing to meet me
you made me rather curious
scotch with just a dash of soda
ill have the same
i wanted to learn of the connection
between ash and christabel lamotte
lamotte and ash
there isnt any
roland michell has made a discovery
with a colleague of mine maud bailey
who is roland michell
blackadder research assistant
american blondish
well he seems to know you
and he thinks it important
does blackadder agree
i dont believe he knows about it
do you wish to be lodged separately
respectably elsewhere from me
i want to be with you
i understood that was
what we had decided
these four weeks only are ours
but ours alone
i hope you will accept this ring
i brought a ring too
you see proof of my resolution
you take my breath away
not yet
no no not yet
shall we go out then to explore
here your bathroom
cupboards
your lovely view
and of course the bed
well look for another hotel
but this is where ash stayed
then well have to share
i can bring up a folding bed
if that your problem
we work together
we were expecting two rooms
im sure it more complicated
than i can imagine
that a lovely brooch
youre wearing miss
it could be one of
isaac greenburg designs
ill get the book
and see if i can tell
where did you get this
ive had it for ages
it was in the family dress-up box
dont you see
ash bought the brooch for ellen
the clasped hands here we know that
and this for christabel
right
so he bought this and said ill have
the eternal embrace for my wife
he wouldnt have said anything
he would have just bought it
it was accepted between them
are you writing fiction now
maybe
but im having fun are you
yes i suppose i am
dont grimace when you say it
it more convincing
i suppose i can be
a touch empirical at times
just a touch
you want to go for a walk
i mean after this
for sure it earlier than the death
of victoria albert probably late 50s
860s maybe
ish
i think were getting
near thomason foss
cropper mentions it
mortimer cropper
ash biographer
all-purpose asshole
he tracked ash entire life
he happy to tell you that
more than happy im sure
you know him
that is beautiful
maud
what
i think christabel did come here
listen
three elements combine
to make the fourth
but above the water and the light
together made
a halo in the darkened cave
that poem is dated 859 july
see if there a cave behind it
that might be all the proof we need
i know it an awfully repressed
english thing to say
but what the hell are you doing
there only one way to find out
of course we could have
just asked someone
i found it
your hands are shaking
are you afraid
no
a little
these are and were there
the garden and the tree
the serpent at its root
the fruit of gold
the woman in the shadow of the boughs
the running water and the grassy space
they are and were there
i dont mind that
see you could grow to like ash
yes he sort of
a soft-core misogynist
why do you always tie
your hair up like that
it to do with fergus wolfe mostly
fergus how to do with fergus
when we met he drove me mad
quoting yeats
who could love you for yourself alone
and not your yellow hair
then i was accused by feminists at a
conference of dyeing it to attract men
really
yes
so i shaved it off all of it
and did he
did who what
fergus love you
without your yellow hair
no
with or without
i dont even like him
but i cant seem to
it freud
on the other side of attraction
lies repulsion
or was that calvin klein
do you believe that
i wouldnt know
i dont allow myself to do that
ash-christabel grand passion thing
allow
no
jealousy obsession all that
not anymore
youre lucky then
it all gets so
just such a tangle
it a tangle most people want
not me though
my antics made
a lot of people unhappy
one horribly so
for me
whenever i feel anything
for anyone
i go cold all over
what makes you do that
fear i suppose
fear of being burned up by love
listen to us
yes
arent we just modern
maud you should let your hair out
you should let it breathe
dont do the icy thing you have
nothing to worry about from me
christabel said fear all men
yeah well christabel didnt know me
i dont want to take anything from you
so then were both
perfectly safe
right
how can we bear it
every day we will have less
would you rather have had nothing
oh no
i thank god that if there
had to be a dragon it was you
wait
wait
i was trying to get out from the covers
no
we shouldnt be doing this
it dangerous
i dont
because i like you i like you a lot
i just dont want to blow it here
it doesnt matter to me honestly
what do you mean
it all right were probably just
these cramped quarters
it was a mistake
i didnt mean that
let not beat the thing dead
it happened it over were adults
speak for yourself
i cant imagine what youre like after
you actually sleep with someone
maud i think that you are very
you know
no i dont know
so were friends now is that it
yeah but that a lot
i agree it fine
yeah
it perfect
anyway were getting off the track
we came to investigate them
not us
so whatever happened to blanche
blanche drowned
where was christabel
we dont know where she was
the year before is a bit blank too
that entire year
there speculation she went to france
but ive nothing to support that
okay so
christabel comes here with ash
then disappears on paper at least
yes
and blanche suicides
jesus
what are you doing
it a poem ive been writing
youre not pleased with it
on the contrary i think it perfectly
expresses the joy i have felt with you
then why that
these feelings
i want them to survive
i know i can never declare
all this
this love
there ive said it i know it cannot
be declared to the world
all i may do is scatter these words from
the train and hope that they take root
they will flourish i swear it
so what next i mean for you
ill check the archives to see where
christabel might have been that year
good
i guess ill just
i dont know
go look up shit on the microfiche
suffer over you
goodbye
see you
lost your way dont do tours here
sir george bailey
who wants to know
professor cropper
curator of the stant collection
robert owen university
in new mexico
and this is dr wolfe
im a busy man my wife ill
i can quite understand that sir
i believe you may be in possession
of some documents
by randolph henry ash
dont shoot
get off my land
do you have any idea
what were talking about
do you have any idea how much
such pieces if they existed
how much they would be worth
worth
mind if we swing past the university
bit of unfinished business
miss bailey i presume
the accomplice
the very same
god youre like bonnie and clyde
i needed a picture of her
ive never seen you like this
just go
take the porsche and go
fergus what
if fergus went out to get indian food
im gonna feel really stupid
no he didnt
india wouldnt be
far enough away actually
come inside ill explain
you sure i mean
about me coming in
yes very
i left fergus a message
from seal court
which put him on our trail
and he came here looking for answers
he and cropper from the sound of it
so that was cropper car outside
i think fergus found something
he been spooking around the museum
sending out a bunch of faxes
i wouldnt be so quick to do that
the british museum fax log sheet
to university of nantes from wolfe
subject christabel lamotte
information on lamotte genealogy
request journal of sabine de kercoz
unfortunately for fergus
we have to log our faxes
youre shameless
so what are we gonna do now
are we gonna try
to beat him to france or
or are we just gonna
stare at each other
that is the question isnt it
i have another one for you
what that
what are you really doing here
i needed to see your face
i just want to let you know
whatever happened in whitby
which unfortunately
was not much
it not because anything
that you did
not at all
i just didnt want
to jump into something
i mean i did and i do
want to
badly
i just didnt want to mess this up
and i just want to see
i want to see if there an us
in you and me
would you like that
ill take that as a yes
when will she be back
could you check for us
she will return on thursday
what about you and your shoplifting
i cant take you anywhere
dear professor wolfe
i have made another discovery
among sabine papers was her journal
she writes about lamotte visit
to brittany in 859
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor
i know how things are
i wish to help you
you know tell me cousin sabine
how do you think things are with me
i am a grown woman you are a girl
i do not desire any help from you
christabel condition became worse
after she received word from london
that her close friend had died
she left england
because she was pregnant
and blanche committed suicide
what happened to the baby
mustve been stillborn or died
maybe it was taken in by a local family
and brought up here
id like to think that
but i wonder
you wonder what
i dont know i just
she comes here alone
hears that blanche has killed herself
she pregnant distraught
i mean ive no evidence for it
can you imagine how she felt
yes i can
so when do we see christabel next
autumn 860 in the references
to the vestal lights
it was a group of women who
met with mediums regularly
really you know ash
hated spiritualists pretty openly
is it a connection worth tracking down
i dont know
please make a circle with your hands
close your eyes
white earth valley
waterfall
child laughing
two people
deception
letters
two people
words
death
what have you done
a field
where is the child
what have you done with the child
you have made a murderess of me
i understood that mr ash was inquiring
about the spirit of his departed child
but i am told that this could not be
the case as mr ash is childless
was there any mention
of hella lees in your research
i dont know
nor do i care
look ive got to get back
what going on
nothing im just tired i should
come on what wrong seriously
i dont actually want to discover
anything else about them
do you know
im finding things out
that are
it horrible when you think about it
really men and women together
she gave up her life didnt she
a perfectly decent life ive always
admired and for what for nothing
not nothing
really for what then
a child who died a lover drowned
and to what end
she and ash my own parents
and every relationship ive ever had
it all doomed we cant seem to help
but just tear each other apart
well what about us you didnt
include us what about that
look l
i cant think about anything right now
so okay so this is the icy
pull back part then
what
you get close you pull away you get
it the pattern right
what are you talking about
your fear men mantra from yorkshire
that what im talking about
if that the way you play it
that the way you play it
do you honestly believe that
is that what you think this is to me
a game
is it
all this talk of us
really comes to nothing doesnt it
yes i guess youre right
it nothing
dear professor blackadder
i did try to tell you
about my discovery before
but found that i couldnt
please read these two letters
and you will begin to understand
im sorry for deceiving you
sincerely
roland michell
it well-documented that ellen
set a box on ash coffin
a sealed container wed always
imagined it was just trinkets
but in light of michell discovery
who knows what may be in it
morally that box is mine
once you become lord ash
it absolutely yours
until then we keep it secret then you
discover it among old lord ash things
then i purchase it from you it all
aboveboard no one the wiser
cropper you absolutely sure of that
where is it
i place this letter in his hands
and if ghouls dig it up again
then perhaps justice will be done
when i am not here to see it
dear madam
we are older now
and my fires at last are out
i know that you are
more than aware of my name
but i find you must see it
in print one last time
it has been made known to me
that your husband is near to death
so i have writ down
for his eyes only some things
i find i cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter
if you wish to read it
it is in your hands
though i must hope
that he will see it first and decide
i have done great harm
though i meant none to you
ill see they get back
no questions asked
youre more enterprising
than i gave you credit for
was there a compliment
in there somewhere
yes probably
what i cant believe is fergus wolfe
conniving with cropper
i thought i was a better judge of men
that where you went wrong
you gave him credit for being one
thank you
thanks for coming
sure
i believe that may be her
im sorry i lost it totally
no im sorry honestly it wasnt you
so why dont we all talk
some strategy
let me introduce you to
professor blackadder paola
this is dr bailey
maud
how do you do
so do we really think that cropper
capable of robbing a grave
the idea of opening a grave creepy
let just keep going
jesus
moping owl doth to moon complain
are you ready
hold the light up
fergus fergus
that it
yes it gotta be
i found it fergus i found it
oh my god
i found it fergus
great
hey cropper
cropper
this has nothing to do
with you people
get off of me get off
no you dont
you traitor you bloody conniver
what are you doing
are you sure we should do this
i said wed take a look
before we handed it over
to the museum
can you hold that there
maud look at this
it her handwriting
my dear my dear
they tell me you are very ill
perhaps i am wrong to disturb you at
this time with unseasonable memories
but i find i have
after all a thing
which i must tell you
you will say it shouldve been told
20 years ago but i could or would not
you have a daughter
who is well and married
and the mother of a beautiful boy
i sent you her picture
you will see she resembles
both her parents
neither of whom she knows
to be her parent
when i said at that terrible sance
that you had made a murderess of me
i was speaking of poor blanche
whose end torments me daily
and i thought let him think so then
if he knows me so little
i had a secret fear you see
i was afraid you would take her
you and your wife for your own
but i could not let her go
and so i hid her from you
and you from her
she loves her adoptive parents
most deeply
me she does not love
so i am punished living at seal court
with them and watching her grow
i have been angry
for so long with all of us
and now near the end
i think of you again with clear love
did we not
did you not flame and i catch fire
was not the love that we found
worth the tempest that it brought
i feel it was i know it was
if you are able please send me a sign
that you have read this
i dare not ask if you forgive
christabel lamotte
ash never read this
he never knew he had a child
youre descended from
both christabel and ash
my god
all these clues
theyre for you
for us
youre so beautiful
there are things that happen
not spoken or written of
a poet walked out
one summer day
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost
he found something else instead
this is how it was
morning
good morning
what your name
may bailey but i have
another name i dont like
do you
what that
maia thomason bailey
well
maia was the
the mother of hermes
and i know a waterfall called thomason
a waterfall really
yes in yorkshire
with a lovely cave hidden behind it
where do you live
i live in the house there
and my mother lives there
and my father and my two brothers
and my aunt christabel too
yes i think i know your mother
you have the true look of her
no one else says that
i think i look like my father
you look like your father too
can you make daisy chains
yes
yes ill make you a crown
but
would you give me
a lock of your hair
like fairy story
just so
now
would you take this note
give it to your aunt
tell her that you saw a poet
who was coming to meet her
but met you instead
ill try to remember
thank you
