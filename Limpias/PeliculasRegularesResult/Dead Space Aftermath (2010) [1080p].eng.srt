in the main service corridor
control
affirmative colonel
what it look like in there
the main power is out
switching to night vision
man #2 oh my dear god
man #3 what the hell
control we have massive
casualties over here
control confirmed we expected
that when we saw the hull damage
was it decompression
negative on that control
lt almost looks like a wild animal
tore through the crew
man #2 what the hell happened here
rapid beeping
sir lm showing four live ones
four
there supposed
to be 37 crewmen
raiders never hit a ship
this big before
we should call in reinforcements
cut the chatter marines
locate those life signs private
theyre in engineering
near the shock point core
that it then
lock and load marines
explosion
hey look out
what happening
the engines are firing
how is that possible
whispering voices
lt over
theyre dead finally
sobbing
lt finished
lt not finished
this is too big to end here
weve been in contact
with a higher power
god damn it lve had enough
of your crazy shit stross
you cant see because
youre not a true vessel
will you two shut the hell up
we still need to work
together all right
weve got to get--
quiet
listen do you hear that
banging
woman oh my god
theyve come for us
lt cant be more of them
we destroyed that damn thing
l wont let them hurt her
this is abraxis rescue team
ldentify yourselves
thank god youre here
l knew theyd come
lm dr lsabel cho chief medical officer of the usg
obannon
you just get away now nobody taking my baby
away from me again
drop the weapon now
nickolas it all right
kuttner dont do it
put em down
no please you have no idea
what weve been through
grunting
they sent you didnt they
they think that they
can control this
they are all fools cant you see
lt already happening
convergence is here
we shall all be made whole
aggh
fools
control weve got one blue casualty
and four survivors in custody
bringing em in
mechanical whirring
man #  what the fuck do you think
really happened over there
the bodies had these looks
on their faces like whatever
killed those people
drove em crazy first
man #2
what command saying
man #  command treating the whole thing as a
navigational accident
accident my ass
man #3 lt almost looked like
they killed each other
man #  lf you ask me something
went seriously fubar out there
and the big guys back home
are trying to cover their big fat ass--
oh excuse us
we didnt see you
they sent an interrogation unit
all the way out here
man #3 what kind of shit
did those bastards
from the obannon get into
l dont know
but they are righteously fucked now
scans confirm the target
has been destroyed
lt unrecoverable
unfortunate
but not a complete loss
what of the survivors
only four lm afraid
lm informed our specialist
is among them
luckily yes were prepping
for debriefing now sir
l am authorizing
enhanced interrogation techniques
l see do you think that
will be necessary
we dont have time for subtlety
there have been questions raised
about what happened at aegis 7
when word of the obannon gets out people will
demand answers
lf you cant provide them
l shall be forced
to re-evaluate
my confidence in your abilities
of course sir
you have seven hours
before your ship docks at the sprawl
this situation needs
to be resolved by then
yes sir l understand perfectly
what are you standing
around for
have the first subject
brought in
lt time to go to work
lt everywhere
all around us
inside us-the patterns
hey
guards
l see it all now
will somebody talk to me
human life is only a passing phase
lm not supposed to be here
hey is anybody out there
god damn it
somebody open this door
lt okay vivian
dont worry pumpkin were safe now
everything gonna be just fine
soon well be back with mommy
and then well all be together
man this is fucking crazy
l mean it just doesnt make
any goddamn sense
we survived that horror show
back on the obannon
just to be locked up here
you know the reason were in here
is because that fucking lunatic
shot a marine
lf anybody should be
in here it him
lt okay baby girl
he just a little scared
dont pay any mind
l dont have anything to do
with this crazy bastard
l dont even know these people
borges will you calm down
youre not helping matters
they have deeper reasons
for detaining us
than mr kuttner outburst
mr borges
there a great design
behind everything that happened
and were each a part of it now
seriously am l the only one
who didnt go batshit crazy
back on that damn planet
stross is right about one thing
we might have a problem
l did a tour on one of these
with a med unit a few years ago
were on board
a government interceptor ship
in a holding cell
where they detain terrorists
so what does that mean
lt means the government
might want someone to blame
for what happened
on the obannon
and that will most certainly
be us alejandro
this may well be the last time
we see each other
dont touch me
lsabel what the matter
well it about fucking time
what going on
why are you holding us here
step back
hey hey hey
take it easy
no problem here
nickolas kuttner
you will come with us
huh-uh
lm not leaving my little girl
dont do that
let me talk to him okay
get your hands off me
lm not letting you
take me away from her
electricity crackles
screams
stop stop it
he had enough
youll kill him
what the hell is going on
l dont know
whispering voices
let me go god damn it
she needs me
you bastards cant you see her
ln the chair if you please
she right there
electricity crackles
screams
no no she needs me
l have to protect her
she needs her father
no no vivian vivian
let me go
let me go
mr kuttner please calm yourself
we have some questions
lm not telling you shit
until l see my daughter
mr kuttner
the mind holds
countless rational
and irrational fears
for you the fear
is being burned alive
beeps
gasps
no no
screaming
panting
that was simply an electronically induced
hallucination
created in the brain
but the mind is reality
is it not
state your name and occupation
nickolas kuttner ex-marine
security officer
on the cdc obannon
what the hell do you want
from me
you are not here
to ask questions mr kuttner
we are going to ask the questions
you are going to answer them
honestly and completely
do you understand
yeah l understand
we want you to start
from the beginning
we want you tell us
about the mission to aegis 7
aegis 7
the obannon got word
to ship out about a week ago
we were ordered to titan where we picked up a
team of civilian tech heads
mission specs were sealed
so nobody knew where we were headed
after we were underway
a few days
the captain called a briefing
stross
ls that your daughter mr kuttner
she beautiful my son has
the exact same color eyes
mind your business stross
he doesnt wanna talk
about it nolan
his little girl died in an accident
back home a few weeks ago
oh god that terrible
l dont know what ld do
if anything happened to my little boy
dr cho how it going girl
hey stross l saw your wife earlier
she seemed a little stressed
alexis is always stressed
so lsabel wanna go grab a drink
at the hole after this
they got 2-credit specials
after 0500
lm sorry l cant
lve got two rookies
with artificial gravity sickness
to deal with
ugh boring doc
you stay locked in med bay
all the time
youll never get a man
interested in you
have some fun
personally l think starting any mission
without a drink or six is a bad idea
lll grab a beer with you
if the offer open
oh l dont usually drink
with tech heads
but sure why not
lm no lowly tech head
thank you very much
lm gravimetric
control engineer first class
so what do you guys know
about this mission l dont
that is what we called you
here to tell you mr nayim
commander sergenko
l didnt realize you were on this ship
excuse me sir
lm alejandro borges with
the engineering team from titan station
l understood this was just
a routine gravimetric stabilization gig
what with all the secrecy
this isnt your standard
asteroid patch-up job son
this is big time
lt must be dragging our sorry asses
all the way to the edge of the galaxy--
sergenko
eyes up and mouth shut people
good morning captain
good morning
this is why were here
lm here cause it double wages
chuckles
the planet is aegis 7
lt was virtually destroyed
in a mining accident three weeks ago
as you can see
the impact has made
the planet unstable
unstable
damn
that where we come in
ourjob is to hold aegis 7 together
borges youve got to be kidding
there is no way--
the captain is not
yet finished speaking
after we achieve orbit
eight drop ships will deliver
gravity stabilizers
to these key points
the artificial gravity web
generated should be enough
to stabilize the planet
are you serious
with only eight units
that planet is practically
one huge bomb ready to explode
how long do you think
a few gravity stabilizers
will hold something
like that together
this is what you
signed on for mr borges
lt too late for you
to back out now
any other questions
when do we drop captain
0500 dismissed
stross cho kuttner rin
we would like to speak with you
l understand some of you
have heard rumors
about what happened
on aegis 7
you can speak freely
rin lve heard
they found something on
the planet surface so terrible
a guy called clarke
dropped a whole continent on it
something-something alien
bullshit
captain the rumors are true
they discovered an alien artifact
65 million years old
cho
my god lt actually real
kuttner
what the hell is it
sergenko
no one knows for sure
lt supposed
to contain certain properties
what kind of properties
that classified dr cho
even to me
and l assume the artifact
was destroyed upon impact
correct
but satellite imaging
reveals fragments have survived
your team mission is
to locate and secure
whatever can be salvaged
of the artifact
on a planet that could
explode any minute
lt will be well worth the risk
mr kuttner
let cut to the chase captain
just how much
are these fragments worth
two million credits a kilo
you know
l hear aegis 7 is beautiful
this time of year
man
shuttle   prepare for launch
nayim were dropping in three
youre playing hologames
three minutes before a drop pawling
yeah l cant pause it right now
arent you a little young
to be on this operation anyway
laughs
my cousin a genius at two things
hologames and gravity stabilizers
wed be screwed without him
the real question is
what are you guys doing here
youre not engineers
were surveying
for gravity fluctuations
fluctuations
the whole planet one big
goddamn fluctuation
what the hell
are you surveying
locking onto gravity stabilizer
releasing docking clamps
ready to drop
hold onto your breakfast kiddies
man
shuttle   drop in five four
three two drop
nayim
entering lower atmosphere
here where the ride
gets fun folks
yee-haw
l always hate this part
crazy bastard level us out
explosion
kuttner
will you look at that
borges god damn
cho
holy shit
this isnt a planet
lt a freakin disaster in process
borges this is nearly total gravimetric
and geothermal disruption
lt seems impossible
the planet held together this long
almost as if--
as if what
nothing nothing at all
l need more data
okay noah omar
ourjob is to keep that stabilizer
from overloading
let these guys go do
whatever the fuck it is
theyre really doing here
the scanners are calibrated to
the frequency of the mortar fragments
sweep out in branching formation
maintain radio contact at all times
any questions
back here at 0900
explosion
ho
this is bullshit
rin come in
this rock is getting
more unstable by the minute
and l havent found a damn thing
kuttner lve lost track
of your signal
rin
come in do you read me
come in
rin you copy
beeping
holy shit rin come in
lve got something
panting
this way l think
l gotta be right on top of it

groaning
stross make sure
those bonds are secure

he came into direct contact
with a shard
the overseer will
not be pleased
but we still have the others
bring in alejandro borges
stross
humanity is just the beginning
the chrysalis
for something greater
something older wiser
we will become
we must become
stross lm serious man
l will pay you real money
to just shut the fuck up
what do you think
those alarms were all about
oh uh kuttner dead
stop it
you dont know that
but l do
l can sense it
we are all one
this separate limited existence
of living matter is just an illusion
a passing dream
great thanks for creeping
me out yet again doc
panting
whimpering
screams
woman are you ready
to cooperate mr borges
okay all right anything
just no more spiders
man tell us about the disaster
on aegis 7
tell us about the shard
l didnt even know
about the damn shard
l was just there to do a job
okay noah omar
ourjob is to keep that stabilizer
from overloading
let these guys go do
whatever the fuck it is
theyre really doing here
something up
with their little expedition
suspicious as hell
nayim
what do you mean
theyre here to measure
gravity fluctuations
l dont buy it for a second
loud rumbling
the planet breaking up
move your asses
we got work to do
pawling looks like lm gonna have
an interesting first day on the job
nayim l knew six stabilizers
couldnt hold it
borges weve got to hold her
there are still teams on the ground
pawling
the power flow out of balance
gravity fluctuating go to manual
noah do you have it
just a second almost there
noah
got it yes
nayim good work kid lm impressed
that my coz
whoa whoa there
shh settle down big boy
that it
pawling
sliced diced dead
god come on there gotta be
a harder setting than impossible
eh the movie was better
hey l never asked you borges
how did you end up with that arm
not much to tell really
mining accident l lost it when
a grav stabilizer l was working blew
my coz is being
humble again nayim
alejandro there saved
five guys off that rig he a hero
we lost 5 men that day
lm no hero
lm sorry
life takes us strange places
l was going to be a priest
when l was young
youre a unitologist omar
you really believe aliens
created the human race
look at us
we have perfect symmetry
and a brain as powerful
as the most advanced computer
and this came out of nothing
coughs  bullshit
laugh if you wish my friend
but human life was created
by alien beings
and when we die we return to them
grav flux is starting up again
weve got an overload
nayim
gravity web is destabilizing
she wont hold
we could drop a dozen stabilizers
on this planet and it still wouldnt keep what left
from blowing
borges we need to hold it
until the teams get back
noah can you balance the flow
kuttner what are you doing here
kuttner muttering
what he doing
l wont let you
grunting
omar
wait wait
what the hell is your problem man
we dont have time for this shit
l wont let them hurt you vivian
run baby run
who vivian
what the hell
are you talking about
monster
get away from her
almost got it there
noah

dont speak
youll be okay
l need help here
what happened
did the monsters get him
you bastard
cho let me see him
noah can you hear me noah
alejandro
you have to let me see him
he bleeding out
we have to get him back to the ship
doc is he gonna be okay
lm so sorry
explosion
nayim the stabilizer
is overloading l cant hold it
alejandro alejandro
they need you
nayim
the whole power grid is failing
alejandro lm sorry my friend
automatic systems are a total loss
lt a cascade failure
there nothing we can do
we have to get out of here
this is sergenko all units evacuate
get back
to the shuttles everyone
move go go move it
run get to the ship now
the lava is flowing this way
that nolan and rin up ahead
there a chasm ahead
dont stop
jump it come on jump
screaming
this way
l cant run anymore
screams
gotcha
thank you rin
rin rin
screams
nolan
lm okay
dont stop get to the ship
sergenko
rin lm sorry
you were a good soldier
oh my god
go around hurry
commander sergenko
too late
borges take this
lt more important
than you know protect it
get out of here
all of you
that an order
get on the ship
screams
sergenko
what is happening
gravity increasing
screaming
nayim ls everyone all right
omar omar above you look out
omar omar
borges we cant help him
we have to go
we must get to the ship
grunts
what the fuck is happening
get me out of this
shut the fuck up
you crazy motherfucker
buckle up guys
we have to get off the planet
someone cut me loose
god damn it
hold on
stross
the planet going
why is the engineer
flying the goddamn ship
borges
lm barely a pilot okay
l think lm gonna throw up
aim for kuttner
shit
weve lost shuttle 4
we must get the shard back
to the obannon
what are they doing
the ship is too close to the planet
they need to clear the gravity well
before they shock point out
that bastard not
leaving us behind hold on
borges we have to go faster
lt tearing apart now
the engines--
look out for the engines
hold on
cho borges
this is bullshit
were coming in too fast
l told you we shouldnt
have let him drive
shit shit shit
get those fires out now
move it come on come on
are you all right
someone call medical
that son of a bitch
man
full power to the engines
woman no contact with survey teams
crew chattering
are we far enough
to shock point
you you knew
hold on son
weve got a situation here
she going
emergency power
to shock point drive
shocking out in eight
collision alert
seven six five
four three
were not gonna make it
two
screaming
look out
explosions
emergency thrusters
fly with the blast
ride it ride it god damn it
firing thrusters
damage report
damage report
hull breach
in section b
shock point drive is down we have
heavy casualties in engineering sir
weapons control
vaporize any planetary debris
that gets too close
lieutenant marcus
send out a distress signal
sir those rocks
will tear us to pieces
we wont survive very long
without the shock point drive
l understand
the situation ensign voigt
borges get your team down
to the engine room
and repair that drive
mr borges
l gave you an order
lm not fixing shit
until you explain
why this fucking rock
was worth my cousin life sir
what are you talking about
captain kuttner had some
sort of psychotic breakdown
engineer pawling
was killed as were most
of the engineering teams
follow me all of you
first officer l want a full
damage report in five minutes
yes sir
okay ladies man your stations
the bodies have been
taken to cold storage
kuttner is under observation
in sick bay
captain perhaps it would be
best to keep the shard
under quarantine until we know
more about its properties
mmm of course
l was hoping for more but--
you were hoping for more
you sent us
on a suicide mission
for a lump of rock
this is much more
than just a lump of rock son
the high lq boys back home
say this will change
the face of science itself--
and that worth all the people
who died back there
easy alejandro lm sure
the captain couldnt predict
the shard influence on kuttner
look son the shard--
it worth a lot of money
enough for you to take care
of engineer pawling family
for the rest of their lives
you son of a bitch
borges
take it easy alejandro
loud bang
what the fuck was that
pieces of the planet
are still impacting the ship
we need to get clear
of the debris field
mr borges if l didnt need you
to save the ship
you would be
in the brig for that
now get your ass down
to the engine room
and repair
the shock point drive
or were all dead
alejandro
how old was pawling
cho about 9
lm sorry noah
l got you this job
lt all my fault
and you never came into direct
contact with the fragment
no l swear l never
touched the damn thing
lie detection states
999% truth
he never touched it
thank you mr borges
youve been most cooperative
what happening
well have you escorted
to guest quarters
for the remainder
of your trip to the sprawl
you mean l can go
seriously
youll have to go through
med scans of course
but youll be back home
to your family as soon as we dock
oh thank god
thank you thank you
right this way mr borges
l cant believe it
lm actually going home
l gotta tell you guys
a couple times back on
the obannon l honestly thought
l was a dead man
have them remains taken
to cold storage
and bring in nolan stross
yes sir
panting
no no
what are you doing
please dont
dont do this
no stop let me out no
lll be good let me out
oh god please let me out
claustrophobia
most horrible
now l take it
youre ready to talk sense
were on a bit of a deadline
lm sure you understand
yes yes l understand--
better than you
could possibly comprehend
dr stross you have been
chief research scientist
on the obannon
for a little over a year now
one year two months
and nine days
and all that while
youve also been clandestinely
a part of our government
secret investigation
into the alien marker
ls that correct
that correct
since l was already a part
of the obannon crew
they decided to send us in
after the lshimura incident
l was to examine
any fragments in the marker
and make a thorough report
l see
now why dont you share with me
the results of your investigation
after we returned
to the obannon
l went to check on my family
my family means
a great deal to me
the shock point drive
is down
but how are we gonna get
home without it
an engineering team is working
around the clock to fix it alexis
dont worry
everything gonna be fine
wont it little fella
nolan level with me
does all this have anything to do
with that other research youre doing
the government stuff
alexis
can you please not grill me
during the few moments a day
l get with my son
l need to go the captain wants me
to examine the artifact
we found on the planet
what kind of artifact
the classified kind
what about that doctor
youre always with
ls she classified too
alexis
you spend more time
with her than with us
she a colleague why would
l have brought you on this trip
if there was anything going on
because youre the senior science
officer and l pestered to come along
lve gotta get to the lab
you cant keep running there
every time l wanna
have a discussion
about our relationship
dont wait up
baby crying
oh sweetie
shushing
lm here
mommy here
knock on door
come in
caleb l really should be
starting the analysis of the shard
captain
l want some answers
mr stross
l nearly lost my ship
recovering that damn thing
l know lm just supposed
to turn it over to you
youll have to take that up
with home base
l have
they tell me all matters
connected with the shard
are need-to-know only
my goddamn ship scientist
needs to know more about this
mission than l do apparently
excuse me for saying so sir
but you dont look well
lt the shard
l can hear it talking to me
caleb have you discussed this
with dr cho
loud rumbling
just get the damn thing
out of my sight
but lm warning you stross
whatever the hell is going on
you keep it in your lab
were in deep enough
shit here as it is
lt even more astonishing than
l could have possibly imagined
what is doctor
the structure is similar
to a hologram
every particle contains all
the information of the whole
what made this
cuneiform-like symbol
there no scratching
or sign of cutting--
as if the crystal itself
gave birth to it
what
what happening
voices whispering
the shard it--
oh my head
some form
of telepathic encoding
dr stross
are you feeling well
lm fine
lm fine
my god it a form of dna
a blueprint
nolan what are you doing
lsabel you wont believe it
sandra that will be all
thank you
but doctor we need to run
a spectral analysis--
that will be all miss burns
lsabel it amazing
the shard it the key
to an alien language
a guide to dna chains
lve never seen before
this may contain the secret
to the future of human evolution
nolan are you okay
you seem a little hyperactive
try and understand
this is the finding of a lifetime
kissing
well dont let it
go to your head hmm
but this could alter
the very destiny of humanity
change everything
shh well talk about that later
but right now
laughs
the shard seems to generate
some sort of carrier wave
so advanced my instruments
can barely detect it
though l have a theory
that when it comes into contact
with dead human tissue
it reanimates the cells
possibly into a new
and more evolved form
can you explain what happened
to kuttner on the planet
well it seems most humans
when influenced
by the marker
become hyperpsychotic
only a very small percent
are resilient to its effects
kuttner was already on the edge--
his grief over his daughter
the shard pushed him over
into a delusional state
and you believe the shard was
originally created by aliens
a higher intelligence
most definitely
what a primitive mind
would call god  gasps
god he says
stross maybe you
should get some sleep
stross stross
can you hear me
voices whispering
screams
the shard somehow
transmits nightmares
dreams and visions
but the knowledge it emanates
l need a test subject
distant explosion
already the signal from the shard
permeates the dead flesh
of the subject
lve never seen
anything transform
an entire host cell so quickly
lt-it beautiful
damn it
how can l be expected
to complete my experiments
under these conditions
what
that not possible
whispering voices
growls
screams  oh no
lt all your fault doctor
they will all suffer
because of you
panting
h-hallucination
lt was just a hallucination
the door-l broke the seal
l wasnt thinking  gasps
good lord
what have l done
dr stross lve got the analysis--
sandra get out
sandra screams
oh no
no get away
lt not my fault
the shard-it tricked me
leave me alone
hold the light steady will ya
growling
lt still after me
here it wont find me in here
no
oh my god no oh god
men screaming
panting
oh god oh god
l need help
the captain
the captain
captain l have to tell you
lt about the shard
not right now stross
lve got the engine room on the horn
l need that shock point
back online now borges
thanks to that class-a
clusterfuck down on the planet
captain l barely
have any engineers left
ltll be a miracle
if we can pull this thing off
mister l have taken all the shit--
screaming
what the hell is going on
were under attack
borges borges
god damn it
lieutenant marcus
take a security team down there
captain please listen to me
not now stross
woman we have a code 3
emergency in the engine room
all personnel report
to their stations
this is not a drill
repeat this is not a drill
alarm blaring
alexis the baby
emergency stations move it
move it
oh oh god
screaming
alexis
lex are you here
alexis l made
a horrible mistake
the shard
lm not thinking clearly
baby cooing
alexis
son son is that you
screeching
get off of me
grunting
where my son
alexis nolan
that my baby no
you monster
get away from my family
screams
panting  nolan
shouts
panting
nolan nolan something happening
the bodies--
theyre turning into creatures
lt has to be the shard
oh god
oh my god
seeing those dead creatures
must have truly affected her
lsabel changed after that
but l had to do it
those things were
threatening my family
dr stross
where is your family now
l-l locked them
in their quarters
did your men find them
are they safe what about the baby
his heart rate is 60
l need to see them
convergence is coming
we have to be together
when the change arrives
dr stross where is your family
ln my quarters l told you
yes you did
beeps
electricity crackles
where is your family
safe in quarters
saved them-l saved them
lnteresting
lve never seen
such a complete block before
lncrease the voltage
screaming
l wont
l wont remember
you cant make me remember
really quite extraordinary
beeps
youre just doing what it
wants you to do all of you
youre gonna kill me now
arent you
like you did kuttner
and borges
we dont want
to kill you dr stross
you dont
of course not
you came into direct contact
with the marker
lt actually communicated
with you
your mind holds the key
to its language
youre exactly
what weve been looking for
what is that
what are you doing
please stop
l did everything l was asked to do
why are you doing this
to me stop
stop it
please stop
not this please
please please
lnterrogator unfortunate
about the claustrophobia
woman they will be pleased
wont they sir
stross is everything
they wanted
not quite everything
bring in lsabel cho
woman
sprawl this is abraxis
requesting permission to dock
man permission granted abraxis
welcome home
lsabel screaming crying
you are making this
unnecessarily difficult doctor
we merely wish to know
about the shard full effects
upon the obannon crew
youre talking
to the wrong person
nolan studied the artifact
and we want to know more
about nolan stross
did he reveal the details
of his investigation to you
you were having an affair
why is that relevant
dr cho l have no wish
to cause you further discomfort
but if you do not
answer my question
l shall be forced
to intensify my methods
do you understand me
yes
tell me about your affair
with dr stross
l-the affair lasted
several months
wed been working together
for a year
l didnt plan it
lt was just something
that happened
he told me he was
going to leave his wife
but l didnt want him to
l tried to stay away
but l couldnt
for the first time in my life
l was in love
after we found
the shard on aegis 7
nolan started acting
strange erratic
do you know what
the most fascinating thing
about the crystal structure lsabel
hmm
the patterns there
are almost familiar
like a dream
lve nearly forgotten
l think youve lost me
l only speak english
and korean
this is going to shape
reality itself lsabel
nolan l want you
to come to sick bay
let me run some
psych scans
remember what that thing
did to kuttner
l dont need psych scans
you have no comprehension
of what lm doing here
lve nearly grasped
its sacred language--
the ultimate source
of human life itself
nolan youre starting
to scare me
l think it time
for you to leave
l have work to do
all right
l need to check
on kuttner anyway
so how our patient today
resting comfortably doctor
are you feeling better
nickolas
head hurts
still cant remember much
do you remember seeing
your daughter
of course
she out playing right now
shell be back soon
of course she will
those engineers better
get the drive working
l need to get vivian home
to her mother
lm sure theyre doing
their best l have to go
try and get some rest okay
whenever l close my eyes
all l see are monsters
all right doctors we have
a dozen doas to process
ripley and wells should have
finished the prep by now
the captain
wants a full report by--
gasps
oh my god
man good lord
the bodies are gone
what could have done this
by the great marker
ls that dr ripley
call the captain
weve got to--
growling
snarling
get out get out
shut the door
run get out of there
shut the door
ls that door gonna hold

lt the monsters isnt it
l knew theyd be back
screaming
snarling
come on
come on you bastard
here l am

l can feel it
explosion
where the rest of the crew
l dont know
we have to find vivian
lm sure she safe
look if the shard doing this
then we need to find nolan
come on

too many to fight
we need a way out
vivian baby is that you
vivian wait

no he right
they cant follow us through there
then hurry move your ass

she was a good officer
a good shipmate
we need to keep going captain
those things may find a way
into the vent
come on vivian went this way
by all means let follow the ghost
of his dead daughter
lm not entirely comfortable
depending on someone
who has obviously lost his mind
yeah l know exactly
what you mean
vivian says we should
go down there
cho l think were over
the science section
captain this is your lab
right stross
sounds quiet enough
lt all clear
come on
something got him
no borges it us
lt kuttner
l know who it is
gun cocks
take you with me
stop it stop it
we dont have time for this shite
calm down alejandro
l only want safety
for my daughter
your daughter dead asshole
just like my cousin you killed
no vivian dont listen
he confused he just scared
borges what the situation
with the shock point drive
did you get it operational
fuck no the engine room
is totally fucked
we barely got out
we
sorry captain we were overrun
captain
they got the bridge as well
let me take a look at that arm
pretty rough laceration
but youll be okay
lll need some help here
lll help love
lsabel what is wrong with you
keep away from me
you sick bastard
or l swear lll throw you out there
with the rest of the monsters
stross we could
use you over here
yes captain
what the hell is going on
why is my crew turning
into goddamn monsters
homo sapiens
are the true monster
these are higher forms of life
were becoming them
and soon we will all become one
what did you say
lgnore him he not well
no no there an old
unitologist proverb
all forms of life will unite
in convergence
and we shall be one
my mom said that we were living
in the end of days
convergence is coming soon
loud bang
by the look of things
it seems like your mom was right
so how the hell do we stop it
stross youre the only one
who understands those things
how can we stop them
nolan look we need you okay
the necromorphs are animated
by the signal from the shard
we have to stop the carrier wave
then give me that goddamn thing
lll stop it
didnt even scratch it
there no way you can
destroy it only shatter it
and every piece will retain
the properties of the original
like a hologram
there got to be a way
no no
lt was designed by an intelligence
we cant begin to comprehend
you would have to cast it
into the heart of a star
or a reactor core
yes
yes that might do it
then we take this thing
to the engine room and we destroy it
are you serious the engine room
is fucking crawling
with those things
then we fight our way through them
we dont have a lot of choice
the ship cant take much more
what do we have for weapons
just your gun and these bone saws
we grabbed in medical
l was working on those things
until you guys showed up
captain are you actually building
something out of all this junk
flamethrower
a few incendiary grenades
found some plasma cutters--
charges are pretty low
okay then
can you travel lieutenant marcus
yes sir
then everybody arm yourselves
let go
kuttner
god damn it quiet
cho those things couldnt have
gotten the whole crew could they
captain everybody stay together
borges wait what was that
l thought l heard something
lt clear this way
metal rattles
l know l heard something
look out
marcus get out of here
aw shit
cho move it
lt right behind you
l think were just pissing it off
got any better ideas
yeah run
cho this way
hurry down here
jenny
lana dont get too close to it
lt all right
lt my roommate jenny
praise the marker
jenny are you okay
lana no get away from it
lana
screaming
captain theyre right behind us
borges come on doc we gotta go
let see if this
bad boy works
explosion
finally the engine room
through that door
were not too far
from the reactor core
were not there yet look
snarling
let go move it
weve got a hull breach
hold on to something
alarm blaring
were losing oxygen
get to the engine room
we can seal the airlock there
help me oh god help me
hold on
captain hang on son
lm coming for you
almost got you
a little closer
no
no
cho nickolas look out
kuttner
grunting
got you
thanks
come on move it
get your asses up here
we have a problem
what now
the power is out
to the airlock door
lt damaged on our side
lt has to be closed
from out there
kuttner anyone out there
will be torn to pieces
lll do it
no youll be trapped
cho captain well find another way
you will do as youre ordered doctor
you too mr borges
send this thing back to hell
where it belongs
and tell my wife she was right
l should have retired
before this trip
all right you bastards
come and get me
my god he gone
the captain gone
now what
lll tell you what
we throw that damn thing
into the core like he told us
this way
there it is
the shock point drive
the most powerful machine
mankind has ever created
cho
how do we do it
we throw it into the core
over the edge
of the platform there
screaming
cho
no the shard
lve got it
oh shit
low roaring
l am so fucking sick
of these fucking things
you and me both
oh shit
there too many
cho no
borges get off
you son of a bitch
whispering voices
get away from him
what is stross waiting for
throw it into the core
destroy it
kuttner
stross stross
voices whispering
nolan what the hell
are you doing
destroy that thing now
god damn it stross gimme that
dont you see lsabel
lt too important to destroy--
oh shut up  grunts
throw it
throw it now
explosion
lt over
theyre dead
finally
lt finished
gasps
you know the rest
lt a pity you didnt come
into direct contact
with the shard
you have a fine mind
and a strong will
lm sure it would have
resonated with you
as it did with stross
oh my god
you knew what would happen if we
found the fragments didnt you
we are not ignorant
of the marker capabilities
you didnt just want the fragments
you wanted us exposed to that thing
all that horror
all those deaths--
you did it on purpose
you have nothing to fear
ln the end you wont suffer
l promise
l dont understand
during our session
we docked at the sprawl
there is someone here
who would like to speak to you
ah my dear dr cho
lt a pleasure
to finally meet you
lm so sorry
about any discomfort
this process may
have caused you
but you must understand
how important this project is
project
what project who are you
l l am a simple overseer
to a greater purpose
we are working to change
the face of humanity my dear
come with me and lll explain
doctor you and your team
did a fine job
my compliments
yes sir
thank you sir
lm very happy
that youre pleased
very pleased indeed
good day
praise the great marker
l thought ourjobs
might be in jeopardy
do you think
we might be promoted
lm sure the overseer will see
that we are appropriately rewarded
gun cocks
overseer as a doctor
you must see that the marker
is the greatest discovery
in the history of humanity
lt has the potential
to alter human dna
to save our flawed dying species
lt turns people
into mindless monsters
ls that the kind of nightmare
you want to unleash
lts power is controllable
under the right circumstances
we just need some more time
to continue our research
into the marker
regrettably these recent events
have become too public
we need an airtight cover story
and wed like you
to help us with that
you want me to just forget
everything that happened
to my shipmates on the obannon
and all those colonists on aegis 7
we have significant resources
dedicated to this project dr cho
youd be an important part
of the team
ln a few years you could be heading
the whole medical sciences division
please consider helping us
with this great work
l wont do it
youre playing god
with human life
people deserve to know the truth
sighs  lsabel
lm truly sorry you feel that way
what- grunting
secure the patient
what are you doing stop it
get your hands off of me
stop let me go
everything is ready
you may proceed
what are you going to do to me
someone has to be held responsible
whirring
no please dont do this
please oh god no
no
woman authorities today announced
the arrest of a suspect connected
to a recent series of terrorist attacks
on the usg lshimura the usg obannon
and a mining colony on aegis 7
lsabel cho a former medical officer
assigned to the obannon
was rescued from a lifepod
recovered after the obannon
engines were sabotaged
and the ship destroyed
lnterrogators have received
a full confession from miss cho
and sentencing is scheduled
for next week
the cover story is working well
people believe what
they wish to believe dr edgars
yes
door opens
ah it appears
dr stross has arrived
excellent that makes two
who have come into contact
with the marker
two who is the second
the engineer
who destroyed aegis 7
we found him half crazed
in an escape shuttle
lmagine our luck
synchronicity reveals the will
of the cosmos dr edgars
of course overseer
be gentle with the patient
his mind is the key
to the secrets of the marker
yes sir
welcome to your new home nolan
welcome to the sprawl
twinkle twinkle little star
how l wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
twinkle twinkle little star
how l wonder what you are
instrumental music playing
