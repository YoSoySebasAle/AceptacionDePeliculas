-okay ive been thinking about
this a lot since the last time
i saw you what i wanted
to tell you is um
i think that what you are doing
and what you are is really
brave
and the fact that youre acting on it
you know like it
revolutionary all these ideas
that people have about like
aging and beauty and what makes
somebody desirable youre
going against that
youre fighting against nature
and do you see how
radical that is
and what i also wanted
to tell you is that
if you were a girl
youd be on my list
-desiree
-but the fucked up part is
that what you are means
that we cant be together anymore
you know that right
i dont know what i am
my god i wish we were
the ones escaping
ill text you
-okay go
go
i love you
hey
did you have any more
roommates after that
-here and there
i was even married once
if you can believe that
married to a woman
at the time it was the only
option it was the 70
even in the theater world
if you werent married after
the age of 40 there was
something wrong with you
were you in love with her
it was a kind of love
miraculously we even conceived
one drunken winter night
two years after our son was born
she divorced me
and took him away to another city
from that point on
i was a confirmed bachelor
good afternoon young lady
i wonder if you could direct
me to the notions department
notions what that
-my apologies sowing kits
needles threads that sort
of thing im afraid ive
lost a button on my jacket
-yeah it down isle 4
at the end on the bottom

across the country together

-such a cute old man
my own grandpa mean as a snake
my parents put him into
some retirement home
sunny valley or something
i dont blame them though
in his case elder abuse
would be entirely justified
um i need a map of canada
sure thing
it cute that youre
traveling with your grandpa
where are you guys headed
we havent really decided
are you staying in ontario
-yeah
-maybe i can help you
when i was a kid my family and i
used to go rent a cottage
around here it really pretty
there are a lot of lakes

would you mind paying for this
dear boy i left my wallet
in the car and dont forget
ill have cigarettes
any brand
one of the few advantages
of being old invisibility
youre crazy
am i
-we have to start planning for the future
money isnt going
to hold out forever
sun block
who knows we might end up
in palm springs
-i already told you
i like your wrinkles
im going to keep this
if people only knew
how you treat me
what did he want
that boy
he saw the map and he wanted
to know if i needed directions
so were here and were
trying to get to here
to be honest im not sure
im up for such a long trip
so soon after coup de coeur
that place really took
the vinegar out of me
what are you saying
-what im saying is perhaps
we should rest for a few days
before pressing on
you havent been telling
anyone about us have you
-dont be silly
they would never understand
-what about your son
-i wouldnt worry about my son
he paid for the home
but he hasnt been
in touch for many years
he hasnt introduced me
to my own grandchildren
he never really got used to
the idea of having an old queen
like me for a father
it always embarrassed him
what were you talking
to that guy about
what guy
at the dinner
you seemed to be talking a lot
i already told you directions
and why were you laughing
-i suppose i made a joke
you know how i am
-it must have been pretty
funny then i guess
-what are you harping on this
dont tell me youre jealous
jealous of an old
sack of bones like me
-because i asked you to be careful
about what you say
to people learn to keep your mouth
shut in public and i dont
have to be this way
id never thought id live
to see the day
-im going for a walk

happy birthday melvin
that time of year thou
mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none
or few do hang upon those
boughs which shake against
the cold bare ruined
choirs where late
the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the
twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in
the west which by and by
black night doth take
away death second self
that seals up all in rest
you know i have been thinking
about you said before and
it not just about the sex
i really think im in love
with you
i know it sounds crazy but
that how i feel
