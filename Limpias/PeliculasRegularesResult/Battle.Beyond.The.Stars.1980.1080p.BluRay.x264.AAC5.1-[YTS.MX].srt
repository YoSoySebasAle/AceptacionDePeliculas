i mean youre still in one piece arent you
sure you did there but at the contest for running
away youll be champion of the universe

dr hephaestus

ill have to go in anyway
manual controls nell
give me the docking thrusters please

what have you come for
oh audio malfunction huh

no except my father
what
there are only the androids
i take care of them
i see well
if you would like to let me out of this
ill tell you why im here please
unless i can bring back a fighting force
and offer some resistance were finished
do you think your father will help
your father isnt the way he was when
your friend zed knew him youll see
as long as he gives us the weapons
were here
you go on alone it father wish
you are welcome shad of the akira
thank you doctor
this is quite a surprise
i heard your story in the cargo
when youre in my station
youre in my presence
great and we wont waste time
will you help us doctor
i am an old man older even than zed
i have seen many wars large
and small throughout the galaxies
forms must pray on other forms to survive
that not what the varda teach us
we pray on no one
your planet is doomed
and i have other plans for you
other plans
this station was built for many
it remains a hollow and lonely place
youve met my daughter
yes
wait a minute
you dont mean that you want me
to breed with your daughter
it seems a better fate than that
offered by the malmori does it not
you would stay here in peace forever
what about your daughter
have you asked what she wants
leprus skew escort the
gentleman to nanelia room
he got a lot to think about
hi
father wanted me to talk to you he means
to keep you here for me im sorry
i do not have time for this
dont you have enough toys
he said youre sure to be killed
i wouldnt want that
saunders prepare the conjugal suite
fresh bedding everything
the gentleman will be staying then sir
he will
nanelia will convince him
im sure she will sir
the defence of his planet is hopeless
he will understand that
im sure he will sir
we will have children here saunders
noise excitement life
it will be quite a change sir
in the colder season even the grasses
in the meadows changes colour
chlorophyll content
whatever
they turn bright red yellow orange
they change shade and
wave when the wind blows
wind
yes wind
it it rather like your
ventilation system in here
you know rapid ventilation but it
different bigger than this but it wind
ive scanned all these things in our data
banks but ive never experienced them
do you know there a form in the black galaxy whose
children have no immune system till the age of five cycles
that means that at the slightest trace of
infection they would just rot like fallen fruit
i have heard of them the huddite
who asked you
when they reach the age of five cycles
all the relatives gather
together in a special room
and they watch while the child tears and bites
at his plastoid with its teeth and nails
till it breaks out in the
arms of his parents
feels their skin for the first time
feels the wetness on their
cheeks for the first time
it horrible out there forms
preying on other forms death
most of them never do develop immunities
they die shortly afterwards
but the huddite still feel that the
breaking out ceremony is very beautiful
you really want to go
back there dont you
even if it certain youll end
oh yes im going back
step into the captor grid
i must warn you miss nanelia that would
cause the captor grid to short circuit
so
come with me you know about computers
you can help us
i cant i cant leave my father
i wish i had time to stay and
convince you but it your life
such as it is
dummy
what took you so long
he wanted me to stay for dinner
and how is old doc hephaestus
well he not the man he used to be
let get out of here
come with me you can help us
no weapons at all
no but i brought an analyser we can predict
their attack modes and plan a defence
id like to exchange data with that thing
might be some new wrinkles i should catch up on
who that
it just nell
nell
ill introduce you later back on akir
wait for me in the lambda zone
our emissary has returned from umateal
they have replied to our ultimatum
and
what this
it is our emissary sir
they have powdered him
they are a proud form
in an hour theyll be an extinct one
not a trace of them left
not even their dust
think the girl will be all right
crossing through the lambda zone
well in my day that was a pretty wild area but
it probably tamed down like everything else
i suppose she a very
interesting form nell
starboard side kid weve got some action
what is it
the little ones are jackers
theyre breaking down his force shield
then what
they incinerate him and steal his load
sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin
six purty maidens to sing
and lay the sod on me
for im a poor cowboy
know i done wrong
this is space cowboy sos
mayday
help
can we help him nell
not without a fight
well
youre just lucky i havent
got any ammunition left
ive never taken life before nell
the varda says we can
take life to save life
okay nell let do it
manual controls
locking on target
fire fire
not from behind
step in it kid youve
got to follow through
no no not from behind no
hooray for our side
you fired without me
it had to be done
youre placed under my direct command
you fired without me
that which is not organic must not
harm that which is i know i know
it a damn stupid rule
jacker to port sector three
i did it
i
didnt think i just did it
you had to kid you done fine
fighting
listen ive done more fighting
than ive seen old movies
which is saying a lot seeing
that all i do on long hauls
well
i have the greatest
collection of old westerns
well need experienced soldiers
would you care to fight with us
yeah you see youre fighting sador
sador never lost a war he never quits
you fight sador youve got a
snowball chance in hell
snowball
transmission from the planet umateal
the malmori force has arrived
put it up on the screen nell
stellar converter
see what i mean
umateal
that was my customer
how would you like 0000 mach laser 4
and 40000 charge snides
theyre paid for and i havent
got the fuel to get them home
youre carrying weapons
theyre hand weapons the best we make
were going to need weapons
but we wont know how to use them
yeah
and well probably need someone
to teach us how to use them
yes i can see that
and we did save your life
okay my rig a hauler not a fighter but
ill set up your ground defences
agreed put it there
im not the cavalry
cavalry
ill show you youve got
a treat in store for you
as a matter of fact ill show
you custer last stand
yes indeed
a pretty tasty looking morsel
who are you
your saviours you were about
to be digested by a zime
a zime
a creature who consumes living organisms
were zimeirs
we cook them down for their protein
i am cayman of the lambda zone
and these are my crew
theyre burning me
theyre kelvin urim and thunim
the kelvin are a thermal creature
they communicate in degrees of heat
and this is quopeg
my kunar
well id like to thank you all very much
now just get me down
now now now dont be too grateful
i know a market where a female form like
yours would bring in some heavy dust
youd do that youd sell me
well of course live or for protein
i do whatever pays the most
im hiring mercenaries for a
great battle on the planet akir
is that so
what could this planet akir offer me
they have the richest molybdenum
deposits in the system
nice try hot blood but
ive already seen akir
and there is absolutely nothing
on that planet that i want
youre heartless youre just like sador
sador
sador sador of the malmori
it who were fighting against
quopeg
so sador lives does he
your ship will need some repair
quopeg cut the zime loose
we cruise for akir
were being pulled in by something
feels like a magnetic net look sector 2
damn it prepare full thrust
well break loose
im not strong
remember the varda
what about the varda
think what would the varda say
nell
to use greater strength against itself
it our only hope kid
all right big mouth change
course right into their laps
okay what the big idea
dont everybody talk at once
listen if i dont get some answers fast
im going to have to use this thing
let me rephrase that
you are not of a violent form
we sensed that you did not intend to shoot
you read my mind
among other things we have
monitored your travels
you are seeking mercenaries
for an adventure
we would like to participate
well we cant offer much in payment
no need we are self-sufficient
we are nestor
all of you
this is but a facet
these are but facets
there are hundreds of thousands like us at home
and scattered throughout the universe
we are nestor
youre clones
in a manner of speaking
we share identical consciousness
what one sees all see
what one knows all know
and all of you want to help us
these five facets yes
four of us are required
to operate this ship
what about the fifth
we always carry a spare
thank you
you see there is only one
nestor one consciousness
as you might imagine
this is proving very lonely
very dull we must avoid becoming
we believe you have a phrase for it
becoming bored to death
look kalo females
a bonding approved for procreation
a bonding conceived in the
face of our present crisis
were supposed to guard the planet
where is it gonna go
come on let do it
it would make you happy wouldnt it
what the hell theyre only akira
everybody scatter
beam her up kalo beam her up
in the old days nascosto was one of the
wildest cities in the smilax system
freebooters outlaws adventurers if youre
looking for mercenaries that the place
doesnt look like much of a city to me
it all under the surface
the weather is a bit touchy up on top
there are tornadoes and radiation storms every
couple of days keeps the tourists away
who sent you
im on a mission for the people of akir
im hiring mercenaries
i was told that there would
be many on nascosto
youre a little late there nothing
left but me and the lower forms
what happened here
the other planets in the galaxy
formed a protective association
they raised an army and cleaned us out
we made them nervous
but you stayed
i came back for a rest
there not a planet in the galaxy
where there isnt a bounty on my head
what makes you so popular
i settle disputes very quickly
im very good at it
i dont care who i work with
ive collected a lot of
enemies along the way
you kill for a pay
i have no home
no family no principles
what else would i kill for
pleasure
no
it strictly business with me
now what your pitch
im hiring mercenaries to
protect against an invasion
but food and shelter is all
we can offer in payment
all of our wealth is in our culture
i could buy your planet ten times over
with what ive gathered in this room
plutonium cadmium qualine crystals
ive been very well paid for my work
im sorry to have wasted your time
no wait
listen to the rest of it
i sleep with my back to the wall
when i can sleep
i eat serpent seven times a week
there not a major city in this galaxy where
i can show my face or spend my wealth
right now your offer looks
very attractive to me
a meal a place to hide
so what do you think of him
hell fight all right
but hell fight alone
i dont care just so long as hell fight
dont worry hell be pointed
in the right direction
wait a minute
what is it
i dont know but it right in my flight path
it could be a mercenary answering your call
a mercenary in that pea shooter
listen kid in some galaxies
that would be a big ship
thalians arent much bigger than your
hand but theyre some bad customers
well whoever he is i dont
have time to play with him
put up the force field
what
put up the force field hurry
what the hell is it
a challenge
what
it seems he dont think this galaxy
is big enough for the both of you
he completely outmatched
he must know that
dont lower the force field
it too fast for you to hit
but he keeps coming at me
ignore it
it cant hurt to forget about it
that what the varda says
i want a shot at him nell
you shoot down a couple of jackers and all of
a sudden youre the scourge of outer space
will you just shut up
and help me fight him
help yourself youre being sucked in
cant you see he just playing with you
what is it what happening
a blank
a what
soft light no heat im not damaged
i have a transmission
i am saint exmin of the valkiri
i have come to coo upon you
it was a very enjoyable fight
enjoyable fight
but then all fighting is enjoyable
i have heard of your battle with
the malmori i wish to join you
oh yes what are you going to do
shoot blanks at sador
the valkiri are great warriors
in our youth we must leave home and fight in
many battles until we have proven ourselves
well youve proven yourself to be a pain in
the neck so why dont you just fly off
but i wish to fight
my planet is in danger and
youre playing tag with me
your ship is like a toy
you have no firepower
it one of the fastest in the universe
well the varda teach us that
swift rain is little rain
but i want to join
but we dont want you we dont
need you and we wont have you
so go count your coo somewhere else
you were a little harsh werent you
you saw her she was playing with me
yes and she won
would you like me to short
circuit your audio

i love to see a pro at work
he had a lot of practice
nell i think we may have bought ourselves
a chance let head for the surface
hail the conquering heroes
im sorry
i think they must be afraid
afraid of what
of you theyre not accustomed
to violence or violent forms
that a hell of a note
welcome to akir
why have you been hiding
why are you all afraid i brought these beings to
save your lives this is not the way to greet them
the varda teach us to trust
first and judge later
im sorry for the reception you got
welcome to our city
defenders of akir
the warning system is operational
the malmori should reach us within a
rotation and a half of this planet
we have only five fighting
ships against 25 of theirs
our only hope is to try and knock
out the stellar converter
is that possible
watch the screen
like the rest of us the malmori ship has to
lower part of its force field in order to fire
when the stellar converter is about to be
activated the ship is extremely vulnerable
maximum spread capacity with an
open shield delivery system
exactly they never bring out the converter until
all opposition has been crushed by the fighters
our job in the first contact will be to
strip the big ship of its protection
a vibration from the
sensor to dig the ditches
another three degrees
trenches honey were gonna have a war
that it right there
were gonna create the galaxy
biggest malmori cemetery
pretty impressive
ive got some more surprises
for any visitors
what drink is that
scotch and soda
i could do wonders with that boy
i would recharge his capacitators
stimulate his solenoid
tingle dingle dangle
prangle his transistors
you know sex
i cant imagine what it must be like
stick with me youll get an education
guess so
flagship to rear guard  do you read me
flagship to rear guard  do you read me
kalo tembo come in
could we possibly be out of range
not at all sir something must be wrong
what wrong is that i have an
army full of genetic mistakes
why cant my mutants be
intelligent like eli
you cant expect us to
measure up to you sir
dont flatter me those two probably
slammed their ship into an asteroid
or they may have been shot down
shot down how akir has
nothing to put in the air
somebody came to help them
help akir against me
nobody could be that stupid
not even kalo and tembo or you
do you think you could show me the ropes
ropes
well st exmin said
well she explained how on her planet
what do you do here
i dont understand
for procreation i mean
oh
well it
it very simple really
males and females
only two sexes
in balandic it takes three
and kitsel they
oh no just two just males
and females that all
that a relief
well maybe i maybe i
could show you the ropes
ive scanned information about mating
does your species have kissing
oh yes we have that
i think it your torque bar
my what
your torque bar it slipped its groove
youre going to need a new one
yes
yes i think probably youre right

niacin dextrose and
sodium nitrate flavouring

the akira believe that no form ends until all
the lives that it has touched are ended
until all the good that
it has done is gone
they are now a part of akir
and theyll always be with us
