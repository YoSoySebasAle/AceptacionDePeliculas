i never had a dog before i didnt know
what you were supposed to do
i should have got a book and read
about it is what i should have done
but i do know now that i shouldnt
have yelled at you i yelled at you a lot
even though you took the mirror
off my mustang you know
65 classic mustang
which i love i love that car
but it ok it ok because i know
i shouldnt have yelled at you
you know and and i know
it wasnt all your fault
i mean it could have been
partially my fault and
ok it was probably more my fault
than yours and i feei bad about that
and im sorry
you know i mean i locked you up
in closets all night and yelled at you
i put you through a car wash
what else i kicked you outta bed while
i was trying to make love with tracy
that was very insensitive of me
i know that now
and we should have went to vegas
is what we should have done
if you were around right now
that what wed do wed go to vegas
for the weekend you know
wed pick up a couple of broads
id take tracy and we could pick up
that little poodle with the shaved beak
she was hot ooh she was sexy
id even let you sleep with us
i mean down at the bottom of the bed
you know not in between us again
that was a little rough
there you are been lookin for ya
youre not allowed in the recovery room
yeah i know i was just uh
recovery room
yeah this is the recovery room
you mean this is where patients uh
come to recover
so the dog is
gonna be just fine
oh
can i have just a couple of minutes
no problem
you asshole
were you listening to everything i said
well you can just forget all of it because
i thought i was talkin to a dead dog
i wouldnt take a sneaky manipulative
lying flea circus like you anywhere
let alone vegas vegas forget it
the dog the poodle with
the shaved beak that you love so much
eat your heart out
oh god
