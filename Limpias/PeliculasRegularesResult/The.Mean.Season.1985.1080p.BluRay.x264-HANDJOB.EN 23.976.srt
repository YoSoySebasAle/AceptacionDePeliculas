about the murder of the young girl
well written
they seem very accurate
i appreciate the call
and i am kind of busy right now
i have a special interest in your stories
why is that
because it was me
i killed her
who is this
you dont expect me to answer that
do you
it depends on why you called
i get 30 calls every day
people claiming responsibility for anything
what makes you so different
i called because i want to help you
how could you help me
her right rear pocket
was there something in it
i hope youre as bright
as i assumed you were
listen
can you be at your phone
at 300
hello
hey ray
so you guys
decided to hold out on me
what do you want mal
weve got a court appearance make it fast
did you look through her clothes
what did you find
none of your fucking business
i thought youd find something
in her right rear pocket
we did lint
take it easy
wait a second
malcolm hold on
how do you know
he called me
who called you
the killer
shit come here
he says the killer called him
bullshit
what did he say what did he sound like
he said he left something in her pocket
he didnt sound like anything
couldve been the red cross
was he white black oriental
white probably over 30
did he say
he was gonna call again
what did you find
no
take it easy
hold on
weve gotta tell him what weve got
no
what do you mean no
hell just stir it up
he got no reason to lie to us
well be okay
this is not for publication
you know me better than that
i just want to know
what were talking about
it was a note
what did it say
raymond
number one
dont go crazy on this
if this is the same guy
youre gonna want to talk to me
now wait a second
what do you got for us
i havent got anything
what do you mean
give me a call when you get outta here
just dont jump to any conclusions mal
come on guys
doesnt anybody have anything better to do
anderson
afraid i wouldnt call
i wasnt certain
certainty i have learned
is something the world
is in very short supply of
did you call and talk to the police
yes
what did they say
there was something in her pocket
suppose you tell me what it was
a true skeptic
notepaper folded once
two words
number one
there going to be a number two
and a three a four and a five
why
it too early for that
youre doing this
on some kind of schedule
something along those lines
and you already know who they are
i know what they are
three women and two men
i just might not print this
then youll miss a wonderful opportunity
ill call someone else
look youre going to be
my conduit to the public
tell me about it
look that all for now
well talk again
after number two
this is the one youve been waiting for mal
fabulous
im not sure this story
will do us or anybody else any good
unfortunately there no way
of seeing where this thing could go
it could take some kind of twist
and we could look negligent
the chance of liability
he didnt call the paper he called me
we have a chance here
let alone the obligation
to do a piece on a sociopath
who still out there he still a threat
that our responsibility
isnt it
this story is gonna sell
a hell of a lot of newspapers for somebody
legally how far
could our asses be hanging out
did you tell him youd protect his identity
no
did you imply that it was off the record
no
make them comfortable
we have three impatient cops outside
lovely
can we go talk to them
i think wed better
thank you
how many times has he called
twice
we want a statement from anderson
and to look at his notes
you know better than that
no notes
weve got a guy who gonna kill someone
wed like your cooperation
but if we have to
well get a subpoena
what happened to freedom of the press
youre abusing the privilege
that your opinion
that a fact
if we dont write about these guys
you never get them
well take care of our end
you know we cant be required
to turn over the notes
no ill tell you what i know
if this son of a bitch kills somebody else
ill tell the post
that you held back information
that couldve prevented it
we didnt say
we werent going to cooperate
we want an arrangement
we can all live with
how about a tap on anderson phone
you wont need it
well give you the tapes
okay
so what the deal here
you give us whatever you get 24 hours
before the other newspapers and tv stations
no weve got relationships to maintain
six hours
sold
i just might not print this
then you will be missing a wonderful
opportunity ill call someone else
look youre going to be
my conduit to the public
there must be some kind of profile here doc
we need something to narrow this guy down
im not a mind-reader
im a shrink
i cant tell anything from one short
taped conversation
but isnt there something anderson could do
to keep him talking longer draw him out
i think youre doing
the right things intuitively
listen to him
when he unclear ask questions
i wouldnt be judgmental and i wouldnt
push him into giving more than he wants to give
be patient
be a friend
what are you guys doing here
give us a break
the man you talked to the killer
did he say when hed call next
he didnt say anything
that would narrow it down guys
how long did you talk to him
0 minutes how long was it
how long was the conversation
neither one was more than a few minutes
come on guys
everything i know is in the paper
are you gonna be able
to live with yourself
did he say
when hed call next
malcolm anderson a journalist
with the miami journal
is the only one to have
been contacted by the killer of sarah hooks
the young girl found murdered
on bill baggs beach
anderson has been contacted twice
and each of the two conversations were brief
lasting only a minute or two
it is known for sure that he has established
a definite contact with anderson
for reasons that no one
has been able to determine
malcolm anderson seemed reticent
to talk to reporters
apparently confused by
all the media attention
according to
mr anderson story
neither he nor the public
has heard the last of this individual
although news center 7 went to
great lengths to get him to elaborate
id like to see what you guys would have said
he refused to say more
im jill beach news center 7
im sorry honey were you awake
we stopped by for a beer
im sorry honey
i saw you on the television
did you
what did you think
i looked like a jerk didnt i
i just looked like such a frump
let talk about obnoxious
did you believe those guys
i mean these are my friends
when youre on 60 minutes

i cant keep this line tied up
who christine
your wife or your girlfriend
i tested your faith

you were beginning to worry
that i wasnt going to call you again
was that the idea
it would be nice
if you wanted to talk to me
but still your words are the important thing
and i do like them
thank you
ever tried to describe a smell
why
youre gonna smell something
that gonna test your writing abilities
it has a sweetness to it
and at the same time it reaches into
your body and twists your insides
but the odd thing is
that once you smell it
you know what it is without having to look
65 nautilus got that
if youre gonna get sick
get sick out here got it
id be careful with this guy
he knows as much about you as you do him
malcolm

what did you call about
i have two needs malcolm
the need to talk

what plant was that
an auto plant in detroit
a machine took his hand
it took three fingers clean off
that really awful

youre trying to make a connection
to someone who can lead the cops to me
were friends
but were not really friends
i want to talk about
the old people now

whyd you pick them
they were a match
a reasonable duplication
was it something youve heard or read about
it was just like before
i caught them on their porch
i just stared
and you know
they couldnt move
then when the gun came out
they couldnt even speak
fascinating isnt it malcolm
i got them into the dining room
i put a pillow
in front of the gun
even so it was much louder
than i expected
i dont know how long i was in there
five minutes an hour
when i left
i was covered with blood
i walked right down the street
i was invisible
nobody seemed to notice me
nobody cared
hello

take a walk
were about to talk to malcolm anderson
a reporter for the miami journal
recently the series of brutal murders
in his city has changed his objectivity
because the killer chose to use him
as a liaison
between the community
the police and himself
a situation has developed where a reporter is
materially involved in the story he covering
he with us at wsvn
our nbc affiliate in miami
good morning thanks for being with us
my pleasure john
tell us when and where
you received that first call
it was at the journal
a few days after they found the first body
how did you react
when he told you who he was
of course
i didnt believe him at first
in my years of reporting
ive had my share ofpeculiar calls
but he convinced you
he did have knowledge of the murder
and the victim no one else couldve had
how many times have you and he talked
five times john
can we assume that he hasnt said anything
that been of much help to the police
it wouldnt be helpful for me to comment
on the progress of the investigation
after talking to him
as often as you have
what your sense
of the relationship that developed
relationship suggests that
there something in it for both parties
im certainly doing what i can to help
but this wasnt my idea he called me
has he ever said why he called you
yes he said he liked the way i write
i saw you on tv this morning
i didnt like it
why
youre becoming more important than me
im doing the work
you get put on tv
youre getting
too much attention
i really wish i could come forward
and speak for myself
of course i cant
ive only been arrested once
what year
come on
im already being too generous
on phones that are tapped
my phone isnt tapped
is there any chance
well ever meet in person
so you can bring the cops
and be a real hero
you anger me you know that
cuban coffee phil
i really wish
i could come forward
this is interesting
of course i cant
ive only been arrested once
what year
come on
im already being too generous
on phones that are tapped
my phone isnt tapped
is there any chance well ever meet in person
dumb
so you can bring the cops
and be a real hero
him you arrest dead
youve gotta catch him first
you get a feel for him
you figure out what hell go after next
and then you blow his diseased brains out
im gonna get
some american coffee
we sent a guy to michigan
there no record of the industrial accident
that he described
not at any
of the major assembly plants
ive got a 50
says he making all this up
youre not tapping my phone
right ray
no
good night ray
yeah
perfect wide open
por favor
i deliver for you the paper
what happened
ive been with the cops all night
and the place is wide open
is it too much trouble
to lock the goddamn door
i didnt even know
you were gone
im sorry
i dont want to be around this any more
im sorry i mean it im sorry
dont be
dont be
youre living alone and im living
with somebody i dont even know
it doesnt work
what does that mean
im putting a lot of time in the story
and you feel left alone
that all there is to it
right
you have no idea what it is
you cant
youre not paying enough attention
chris ive busted my ass for eight years
what weve wanted is right here
dont you understand that
ever since they started the body count
youve let everything slide
ive gotten so far away
that leaving just a formality
this is the last thing we need right now
i said i was sorry okay
i heard you
you want a drag
drag your ass
you gotta be closer
than youre saying
id like everyone to think so
you got a voiceprint his mo
and you know he duplicating
you know the part of the country he from
youve gotta be getting somewhere
this guy is killing people he had no
personal contact with nobody he mad at
it tough
what do you do all day
we run down 25 or 30 phone calls from people
who think they live in the same room with him
so do i
when you write enough about somebody
he starts sounding like everybody
i didnt expect it to last this long
as long as he out there
he definitely news
yes so are you
what are you saying to me
i never understand what the fuck youre saying
what the hell the matter with you
im tired of him
youre getting in places you dont belong
damnit
hey walk away
go get him wilson
catch him so we can all go home
youre coming apart on me mal
if you come apart you crash
right now we got nothing
get this guy before he kills somebody else
im tired of being your contact man
son of a bitch
if youd like a nice home-cooked meal
and some quiet conversation
i hope to see you soon
after the last killing i read that
the killer worked on an auto assembly line
i remember a guy from
kenosha wisconsin or somewhere
who was connected
to something like this
you wrote the killer was duplicating
other murders
he sounds like the one
i heard about
there some kind
of a list there
ill talk to you alone
no police either
i live at the paradise trailer park
if anybody or any cops come with you
ill deny i wrote this
here the address
what do you think
give it a shot
why not
excuse me
you mr anderson
yeah
all alone
i think im glad youve come
ive gotta get this thing refitted
down at the va hospital
they treat you pretty good
down there
im just gonna take a couple of notes
you dont mind do you
i guess go ahead
but i dont want my name in the paper
this guy wont think twice
about wasting me
ive been wasted enough already
gotta hang on to what i got left
i can give you anonymity
but the police are gonna want to talk to you
let me think about that
im a little short on time
im working on a deadline
so why dont we start with your name
listen ive been led to believe that
you people pay for this kind of information
i dont
oh come on it wont be much 20 0
do you have any information for me
or not
this guy name was ohaughnessy
i met him downtown
down at the salvation army
kind of a juicer
he was depressed all the time
but then he had good reason to be
about a year ago
he lost his parents
his wife sister-in-law
and teenage daughter
what happened
his brother
went out of his head
got his gun in the middle of the day
and killed them all
put the muzzle right here at the base
of their skulls and blew their heads off
sound familiar to you
you said his last name was ohaughnessy
do you remember his first name
albert i do believe
where was this
kenosha wisconsin
he worked on a pacer line
he used to call them kenosha cadillacs
this guy from detroit
kenosha
i got that right here
in my notes
excuse me a minute

this guy is all flash
she okay
you think so ray
yes
if he duplicating those five killings
he already accounted for all the women
she okay
have you ever noticed that the older you get
the smaller you become
when i was a little kid
the block we lived on
was the whole world to me
i knew everybody
i was significant even important
are you gonna kill me
let try to keep these things
as abstract as possible okay
apple
i want you to understand something
what
youre killing people
because you want to be noticed
you want to feel significant
hey as a teacher
your range of comprehension
could be improved

good behavior goes unnoticed

i do care
just tell me what you want understood
just tell me what you want
it not important
nothing is
all youre concerned
about is dying
im not responsible
it not my fault none of it is
just give it a couple
of full rings
it nolan
okay
some guy who been following my stories
just walked into the journal
he thinks he knows the killer
he says he knows him well
tell him were on our way
what if the call comes here
he knows where to reach you mal
ten minutes
look maybe this isnt
the right person
it seemed weird to me
when i read my name in that story
you got from the guy at the trailer
those five murders he told you about sound like
a series of murders in chicago a few years ago
i was working at a state-funded
halfway house at the time
for dopers alcoholics
mental hospital discharges
some character stumbles into my office and
says he the guy who killed those five people
he says he went to the cops
and turned himself in
but they chased him out when some
psychiatrist decided that he was somebody
who got off
making confessions
he needed the headlines
is that what you thought
i went down to the precinct with him
and listened to his story
it sounded straight to me
it turned out though that he did have
a history of false confessions
he was pissed though
i mean he was pissed
he figured he finally did something
and somebody else got the credit
after the visit to the police
he kept coming around
he calls one more time
after things quiet down
he wants to thank me
for being so unselfish
he said if i tried to get
any attention from what hed done
hed have me killed
you got a name on this guy
yeah
