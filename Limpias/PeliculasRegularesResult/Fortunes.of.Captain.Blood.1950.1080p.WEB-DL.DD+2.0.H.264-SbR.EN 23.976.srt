of this captain blood
this pirate who captures our treasure
and our ships
you my dear marquis de riconete
you why havent you
hanged the scoundrel
your majesty the hanging of one
pirate is hardly the answer to our problem
as long as these outlaws are protected
in the west indies by the english
oh the english the english the
be careful you fool
you see marquis it isnt enough that
the ruler of spain be bled by his physician
these buccaneers must bleed
our kingdom too
my lord marquis
youre the governor of la hacha
our most important island possession
in the west indies
you have a galleon of 40 guns
therefore we charge you
with the personal responsibility
of capturing this captain blood
i shall do everything in my power sire
but of course your majesty realizes
this is no common criminal
you send me after
blood is a learned intelligent man
a doctor
a doctor are the english so healthy
that their physicians must turn to piracy
for a living
blood is not english your majesty
he irish
i have prepared a dossier on the man
which i should be pleased to read
read read
peter blood born in ireland 658
bachelor of medicine
dublin university 680
arrested by the english
for saving the life of a wounded rebel
during the monmouth rebellion
rebellion yes yes count harrach
sentenced to death
sentence later changed
to a life of slavery at barbados
there he and a group of fellow slaves
managed a somewhat incredible escape
that enough count harrach
well we offer a reward
of 50000 pieces of eight
for the head of this buccaneer
even an englishman may find that tempting
if not im sure you my lord marquis will
unless this captain blood is captured
your wealth and position will be forfeit
oh but sire you mustnt
captain alvarado

to the indies
and will assume the post
of military position

and you will act as our representative
and we will charge you
with the direct responsibility
of seeing that our orders are carried out
no sign yet peter

what time do you make it tom
not an hour left before dawn
well have to work fast
faith yes
therell be the devil to pay
if the marquis finds us
lying off his island in broad daylight
you still think the signal will come
of course
pacheco is a man of his word
besides we cant leave
we must get supplies and ammunition
there very little left
we can get what we need in tortuga

we were ambushed
pacheco wasnt there
all the other men were taken prisoner
if it fighting they want
well give them a taste of it
but weve little enough powder and ball left
as it is
no matter our men are there
but the marquis ship within sound
of our guns

look lively now
your excellency
so my new slaves
are captain blood men eh
ive been anxious to meet your captain
for a long time
where was he headed for

where was your captain bound for
where
where
perhaps youll be more talkative
after a short while in the pearl fisheries
take them away
well excellency
didnt i make you a good price
for such interesting slaves
señor fairfax your greediness
for the sale of a few slaves
has cost me a chance to capture
your countryman captain blood
but your excellency i didnt know
it was the avenger in time to warn you
by now blood is 20 leagues away
in a fast ship
-impossible to capture
you will have other chances
not like this one
platt
hokenby
peter why dont we go ashore
im staying aboard
but peter there nothing we can do
to help those men now
why must you keep thinking about it
what would you have me do then
try and forget them
forget our own men
slaves of spain
rotting away in the marquis dungeons
do you remember what it was like
before we escaped from slavery
the stench of those filthy holes the swill
the chains rotting away
the flesh from your bones
the whips and the branding irons
yes i remember
dont ask me to forget then
captain blood
captain blood
scotty if youre in trouble
-with the father of another señorita

what are you talking about
a french ship just arrived from la hacha
her mate tells me that
that hurricane that been blowing about
hit the marquis ship
and just about ruined her
the santa paula
aye
she no fit to go to sea again
until she been repaired
hear that tom
we could sail right to the island
and the marquis couldnt give us a chase
but he still got a fort
and 50 cannon mounted on the beach
there no cannon in the cove
at the back of the island
all the men aboard
aye sir
but peter you cant take the avenger
right into the marquis grasp
wed surely be caught
youre right tom
we wouldnt stand a chance weigh anchor
this is the most foolhardy thing
youve ever done
beyond a doubt stand by to make sail
well end up slaves ourselves
hell probably hang all of us
set our course for la hacha mr mannering
aye aye sir
hands aloft
take out the topsail
im still dead set against it peter
it too dangerous
this cove right
on the marquis back doorstep
where would he be less likely
to look for us
and what if somebody recognizes you
what if pacheco see you
he betrayed us once already
pacheco wont betray anybody else
ill make sure of that while im here
well how do you propose
to get into the town
you cant just walk in and have yourself
announced to the marquis
ill leave that to lady chance
she obliged me more than once
perhaps shell oblige me again

youll need it

pepita maria rosados
the woman is even more lovely
than the name
miguel knew i would be helpless
before such beauty
that why he kept you a secret from me
the señor is very kind
but it is true that miguel is very fond of me
oh pepita fond of you
it is only because im his closest friend
that he is so helpless that
helpless
si completely
it is only because of that
that he trusts me alone in the city with you
but i am only human
and you must help me to resist
dont worry about that señor
i will help you
but remember im only human too
pepita
si señor
i was seeking early today an old friend
of mine but his shop was deserted

he is the thin one
but he left the island yesterday

i was told he had gone to portobelo
oh who told you this
the overseer carmilio
but señor why worry about old friends
when it is so easy to find new ones
in la hacha
what is that
oh just the slaves
theyre on their way back
from the marquis pearl fisheries
the ones that are left
the ones that are left
there are fewer every day
last week 34 yesterday 32
today who knows
what happens to them

for pearls in water filled with sharks
oh please excuse me
i forgot the overseer wine
papá

the sun is very hot
i should be most happy to escort
the señorita back to the residencia
you dont seem too anxious
to inspect the dungeons captain
well i hardly find them attractive
excellency
im afraid the captain still judges us
by spanish standards lsabelita
he forgets we are in a new world
where men live by new laws
or die by them
come now captain
these slaves dive for pearls
and pearls are one of the few things
that make this dull little colony bearable
your excellency
everything is ready for the inspection
splendid splendid and the day catch
three pearls excellency
two of fine quality
uncle
dont you think i deserve some reward
for waiting in this heat
of course my dear
a small pearl like this for a marquis niece
it fit only for a
for a peddler
excuse me my dear
how clumsy of you peddler
forgive my hands señorita
they are not accustomed to pearls
perhaps you would appreciate them more
if you were to dive for one yourself
perhaps
darling
i thought id never get away
from your uncle
dont tell me business bores you
by contrast yes
look im over half finished
how do you like it
it very charming my sweet
oh george
why dont you take me away from here
back to spain to the court
and the life i was meant for
you know i will lsabelita as soon as i can
im sick to death of my life here
sewing and embroidering
supervising the kitchen maids
waiting on my uncle
and those dull dull official parties
ah sf señora second assistant clerk
your new gown is quite quite ravishing
it only three years behind the fashion
oh and señor plantation foreman
your little ramon is so so unspoiled
he thinks nothing of wiping his filthy hands
all over the draperies
oh george dont let wait any longer
oh but darling
even if we could get off the island
it would take gold
but i have my jewels
the pearls alone are worth a fortune
but i cant take your money
dont you see that it means my happiness
our happiness
you must take them querido
that what you really want
oh yes it is
more than anything in the world
lsabelita
go to your room
but uncle i
-lsabelita
you
you must understand your excellency i
it is bad enough that i should
have business dealings with vermin
i dont wish them to infest my family
señor fairfax
if you attempt to see my niece again
i shall have the distinct pleasure
of watching you
being torn apart by the sharks
pepita

you will make me break the wine bottles
sol must be careful
the bottles must not be broken huh

of buying you a glass of wine

pepita

is not taken in by this little trick of pepita
you must see what she trying to do

she using me as she would any stranger
to make you jealous

the slaves they are nothing but trouble
they are lazy they get sick they die

deep underground

i should like to see them
without a pass with the marquis seal
not even the king of spain

without the seal of the marquis
not even the king of spain huh
if it bad like you say

i know
you might say he bequeathed it to me
it was in his hand when i found him
i dont know this pacheco
i made a mistake about this medallion
it looks like something else
does it
thanks for your hospitality
juan
juan
si señor
find señor fairfax bring him here hurry
si señor
but a man like you
a man like you does not come to la hacha
only to sell fruit
why you dont tell pepita your real reason
for being here
i have told you
lies lies nothing but lies
if you were really a fruit peddler
people would not be
asking questions about you
about me
who has been asking about me pepita
you dont answer my questions señor
why should i answer yours
well you are my friend little one
you must trust me have faith
let go señor or ill awaken papá
please señor stop it señor
papá
oh papá
oh señor
oh señor
stop it
it is too late to stop señorita
from the first moment we met
it was too late
you are lying to me again i know
does this seem like a lie señorita
lie to me some more señor
first you must tell me
who was asking questions
it was only the overseer
but let us not talk about him now let us
what did the overseer want pepita
just to know who you are
and what you are doing in la hacha
was that all
si
now i have told you my secrets
you must tell me yours
of course but not tonight it is too late
if you do not trust me señor
oh i trust you pepita
but as i told you before
i do not trust myself
pedro youre not going to go
si
but i thought
adiós little one
have you lost something señores
no señor we have found what we lost
that is good
whoever your master is
he could have taught you to be
a little more polite
nothing like a long nap
after a strenuous exercise
but it was quite unnecessary
for your associates
to go to so much trouble to bring me here
after all i am just as anxious to make
your acquaintance as you are to make mine
señor señor
my name is george fairfax
in my line of work one cant be too careful
and what exactly is
your line of work señor
what are you doing in la hacha
señor morales
i sell fruit
persimmons mangoes pomegranates
and is that all you have for sale
everything
im afraid we cant do business after all
then if the señor will excuse me i will
sit down morales
you are a stranger in la hacha my friend
and perhaps youre not aware
that the laws here are very strict
for instance
the penalty for robbery is death
for example suppose you were
to have stolen something of mine
a ring say or a timepiece or a medallion
and were you to be caught with it
in your possession
i could have you hanged
it a very harsh law
but sometimes a useful one
and what is the penalty for murder
in la hacha
well that depends on whether or not
the murderer is caught
for example there was a regrettable death
of a local shopkeeper
a ship chandler just yesterday
poor fellow he became too talkative
and yet there have been
almost no questions about his death
and i do not think there will be any
incidentally if i should
shoot a robber in my quarters
and he happened to be armed
thered be even less trouble
with the authorities
but how would i be expected to know
that he was holding an unloaded pistol
this one however is loaded
who is it
it me lsabelita let me in
lsabelita what are you doing here
george we must leave
la hacha now tonight
we cant
the santa paula is ready to sail
she wasnt as badly damaged
as they thought
and the marquis
doesnt trust his niece alone in the city
tomorrow morning
im being sent to a convent
im sorry lsabelita
but i dont see how we can possibly
but we must we must
look these will buy us a boat
and whatever else we need
please george please
all right all right well leave
the guards followed you here
señor fairfax our orders are to return
the señorita to the residencia
and to place you under arrest
and my sword
si señor
very well
come and take it
ill be all right
george
it not too bad
sit down sit down
there are three more guards
coming up the stairs
now go and go fast
he badly hurt
we must get out of here
before those four guards are replaced by 40
i know a place near the quay
where well be safe
you are very lucky señor
if the lead had hit you six inches
nearer to your right
youd have been lying
in a different kind of bed
as it is youll be well enough
to fight another duel tomorrow
open up
ope up i say
open in the name of the marquis
it the guard
i know that
ive got to let them in or theyll break in
im aware of that too señor bragg
ope up i say
just a minute just a minute im coming
all right
open i say
im coming
what may i do for you gentlemen
me tavern closed for the night
we do not want your rotten liquor
innkeeper
were hunting for the marquis niece
and two men who attacked our guards
the marquis niece in billy bragg place
that a rich one
were searching everywhere
the marquis orders
please
upstairs go
gentlemen please walk quietly
customers are asleep
oh no no lieutenant not in there please
stand to one side innkeeper
what do you mean
bursting into my private room
waking up my husband
get out get out you filthy pig
get out you pigpig
any more rooms
youd like to see lieutenant
oh no no no no
no fine ladies at billy bragg you know
this being a soldier is a risky business
aint it
si you speak the truth come along men
come along
buenas noches
same to you sir
all clear mr fairfax
señor bragg the world lost an honest actor
when you turned rogue
youre a man of many talents
that i am sir
this is a night for genius señor morales
an innkeeper turned actor
and a fruit peddler
who is both doctor and fencing master
you seem to forget señor fairfax
that you owe me your life
a debt i may later wish to collect
at your service
george
señor morales were deeply grateful to you
both of us
yes how can we ever repay you
well l
what did you do with my jewels
i do with them i never had them
i must have left them on the quay
i remember now
i put them down when you were wounded
it doesnt matter
doesnt matter
you spill jewels worth 30000 doubloons
in the dirt and say it doesnt matter
yes george youre right
my jewels do matter
they matter a great deal
you see querido
i wanted to go to spain with you
but without my jewels
wed be paupers wouldnt we
and that would be frightful wouldnt it
-lsabelita stop it i didnt mean
i know exactly what you meant
but lsabelita
you should rest señor
perhaps you would like a glass of wine
no no
pardon me if i get one for myself
bragg stay with the señor
perhaps he might need something
aye aye sir
is this by any chance
what you were missing señorita
i found it on the quay
gracias señor
now everything is all right huh
you and señor fairfax can elope
you deliberately hid my jewels
you wanted me to quarrel with george
of course i did
why
are you in love with him
i i dont know im not sure
i suppose i thought hed take me away
from this horrible place
it unfortunate you picked the wrong man
i couldve told you that
you
what would a fruit peddler know about
or are you a peddler señor
you no longer talk like one who are you
at the moment
i find it convenient to be a peddler
my uncle would have ways
of discovering your true identity
i dont doubt it for a minute
but if he were to take up my time
how could i be of service to you
service
yes
ive had business dealings with mr fairfax
and i began to suspect his true nature
so i left my ship in the cove
on the other side of the island
and came here in disguise to
to shall we say investigate
and what has all this got to do with me
well youre anxious to leave la hacha
and i have a boat so
you could take me away from the island
to maracaibo
or port of spain
why not
oh señor
how can i ever thank you enough
well you might try
throwing me another pearl
i suppose i do deserve that
youll not let this one slip
through your fingers
have no fear
i didnt know you then
or id have been more careful
youre gallant whoever you are
in my fashion
now ill send you back to the residencia
as it is if we were to set foot
on the waterfront
the guards would send you back
to the marquis
and me to the pearl fisheries
you must go back to your uncle at once
what can i say to him
hell send me to the convent
not if you were to tell him that
youve discovered mr fairfax true colors
and beg him to forgive you
and pardon the poor fruit peddler
yes yes of course
ill come to the residencia tomorrow
for the pardon and if it safe we can go
very well i trust you
i know nothing about you
and yet i do trust you
perhaps because you have no choice
oh i dont know you are different
you save a man life or take it like that
perhaps im not so different
you said yourself
you know nothing about me
how much do i need to know
doctor swordsman
i got it
port royal tortuga
that who he is captain blood
blood
aye
billy bragg still got his two eyes
hasnt he
how come youre traveling with him
mr fairfax and dont know
a reward of 50000 pieces of eight
billy bragg
weve turned some good deals in our time
but this is the biggest one of all
get to the marquis as fast as you can
bragg i have something for you to do
you will take the señorita to the residencia
but i cant leave sir i
go along billy
go to the residencia ill be all right
youll stay here with me wont you
señor morales
you may be sure of that señor
señor bragg huh
aye
the señorita she is safe at home
aye sir
but ive got something more important
to tell you captain blood
i met you in tortuga captain
the red lion tavern
you remember billy bragg
bragg
aye i know ive put on a bit of weight
but you remember billy bragg
oh yes
billy bragg-
i finally stole enough money
to get a place of me own
well if youre charging
for these accommodations
youre still engaged in piracy
leastwise captain im too much
of a buccaneer to ever turn informer
ive not accused you of it
aye but your friend mr fairfax
put me up to it
that why he wanted me to go with the girl
so id turn you in and wed split the reward
that adds another count against him
another
yes
he murdered a man who used to supply us
and sold six of my crew into slavery
would you like me
to dispose of this fairfax captain
not yet i may have use for him
the avenger is on the far side of the island
i may be back for friend fairfax
before we sail
hell be here
now i must surrender myself to the marquis
what
oh not as peter blood
but as a fruit peddler
who served the marquis niece
and who earned her confidence
why take such a risk captain
billy if im to get my men out of prison
i must first get myself into the residencia
pedro morales
morales
excellency
so
my niece tells me
that youve proved an invaluable friend
the señorita is most generous excellency
perhaps
and yet i cant help wondering
if she might not have been returned
to the residencia
without your invaluable assistance
and without costing me the lives
of my guards
i apologize for my enthusiasm excellency
however you have been of some assistance
you are free to go
gracias excellency
and morales
in the future try to curb your enthusiasms
at another time
you may not find me so lenient
excellency
if your excellency
will seal the order
for the prisoner release
this is the wrong seal
the square one is the order for release
pardon excellency
are you a murderer as well as a thief señor
it hardly murder
i was watching you from the corridor
what did you steal from the courtroom
well i
i took a pass to help us escape
us im not as stupid as that
you were planning to leave without me
well this is hardly the place to explain
come with me and ill
im not going anywhere
and neither are you
there are guards to prevent that
señorita wait
youre right
i wasnt going to take you with me
i told you i was
so id have a chance to steal this pass
you must believe me
i only came here to help some friends
escape from la hacha
ive listened to enough of your stories
you can tell this one to my uncle
he may be more interested than i
wait please
lsabelita you want to leave this island
then think of my friends in the dungeons
compare your reasons for escape
with those of men living in slavery
you came here to help criminals escape
theyre not criminals
theyre men who were trapped
and sold into slavery by your friend fairfax
i know what it like to be an innocent man
and live as a prisoner
i was a slave once myself
and there was no reason for that
no reason except as a doctor
i treated a dying patient
for that i was sentenced to a life of slavery
i felt the whips and knew the weights
of those chains and asked no favors
youre asking one now
not for myself
you may have many reasons for hating me
i dont blame you
but you cant hate the men i want to help
did you really think
id be moved by all this
yes i did
lsabelita
why are you out here
it was stifling inside i wanted some air
youd better go to your room
you might catch a chill
yes all right ill come in
so youre going to go away
youre going to leave la hacha
perhaps i am perhaps i may never leave
that is true you may never leave
if you do not let me help you
what do you mean
carmilio the overseer
has told me he would like to kill you
carmilio huh
possibly i do need your help pepita
si perhaps i need your help very much
we will be partners huh you and i
oh no no señor i will not be a fool again
i will make you rich
no i tell you i wont
how rich
here
the rest is for you for one little favor
there is something i want you to do for me
of course
from now on we live only for each other
now your friend carmilio
oh carmilio i forgot about carmilio
pepita tonight i dont want you
to forget about him
so i wont forget about him partner
you know carmilio

i think you have the most beautiful hair
in all of la hacha

oh sf very much carmilio
if you love me
why you always making fun of me
oh my silly little blockhead
how else would pepita fool them
if papá knew how much i loved you
he would lock me in the cellar nights
i would much rather be here with you
dont you like that carmilio
yes very much
but it against the regulations
regulations
what do we care about regulations
official business orders from the marquis
oh carmilio

but i coming back

so my guards have begun
to smoke the rats out of their holes
theyre to be hanged captain alvarado
yes excellency
one moment your excellency
i should like a sporting chance
i have no time to waste señor
the stakes are good
my neck against an opportunity
to capture peter blood
if you find the fruit peddler
who released the slaves
youll have no reason to set sail tomorrow
because he is captain blood
why should i believe you
the only slaves who were freed
were men from his ship the avenger
very well fairfax you win
you may keep your neck
provided of course
you can tell me where blood is now
im afraid i cant tell you
but im sure there someone here who can
you have only to say where blood is
stop it
youre wasting your time uncle
if you want to know where blood is
release him and ill tell you
you
yes
well please forgive the oversight
his ship was anchored in the cove
on the other side of the island
are you sure
he told me himself
find captain valdez
the santa paula will sail at once
yes excellency
it already too late uncle
by now blood ship will be far out to sea
one moment excellency
blood can hardly change the tides
if his ship was in the cove it is still there
waiting to get over the shallows
and it will be three hours
before the tide will permit him to sail
señor fairfax
apparently you are still of value
we will reach the cove in two hours
get a guard have him taken to the prison
lsabelita whether you intended it or not
you too have been of service
oh thank you milady
but you shouldnt have told him
i told him where blood was
because i wanted them to catch him
because you thought the captain
had already sailed
youre in love with him arent you
in love with a pirate
a cutthroat a liar and a cheat
youre wrong milady youre wrong
he may not have told you all about himself
but what he told you was true
