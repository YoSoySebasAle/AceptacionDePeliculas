it can be anything from chest pain

how do you handie that
with ambulances and hospitals
most ambulances you see
are fire department
i didnt know that
yeah
and most firefighters

no turning back

yeah mike check one--
you can just pretend it not there
just taik free
can you say something
more compelling
i dont know what to say--
i mean am l gonna have
this thing on all the time
yeah just watch what you say
well hear everything
shit
youre probably not allowed
to swear on your station
no we can cut most of it out
but it helps
if youre not dropping f-bombs
point noted filed right here
so if i was to call this guy
an ass-monkey
that wouid be considered
a swear too right
it gonna be a long night
so this thing
yeah
is this some sort of torture device
when you dont get in your turnouts
that what it is
can you get it
yes this is cailed a hook ladder
we use this in the--
the firemen would use this--
we should bring it down
yes
okay
all right
can you grab the hook
so this was used
in the 20s and the 30s
oh my god
yeah
and as you can see
these are the rungs
and the hook at the end
they would grasp onto one window
and then pull themselves up
and then when they got to that
windowsill they would hook it again
and then puil themseives up
okay
did you get the hook scott
you see this
used in the 20s and 30s
they stopped using it around--
hoid it up higher
replaced it--
that good right
good
replaced it
with a regular ladder that extends
yeah and rope
they must have tiny feet
those are little rungs
yeah firemen
were a iot smaller back then
the fires were bigger
and they were smaller
dont tell captain we took this down
im not gonna teil him l touched it
i wanna introduce you to somebody
this is wilshire mark
good boy
hey wilshire
say hi
dog right out of the cartoons
well there a reason
why the daimatians were in cartoons
the fire department
has a great sense of tradition
yeah we do
dalmatians
got along well with horses
important when the fire trucks
were horse-drawn
now theyre used as mascots
but what theyre trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic
kind of like fletch
yeah
that what l do i run out there
sort of like what a siren does today
okay weli wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire
stop drop and roll
yeah
so let just pretend
youre 5 years old and on fire
im on fire
wilshire gonna teach you
tell me what to do
okay wilshire
wiishire mark stay
wiishire drop
drop drop
wiishire roll

when trying to finish a game
not if youre losing
every time you know
we go respond to a call
the points reset
depending on which side youre on
it sort of nice

apparentiy mrs espinoza attacked

martini

okay i have to show you something
what
have to show you something
just a sec
i think i know what this is
come come look look look
oh jesus
her tear ducts and saiivary glands
are constantly flowing
she seems
to be unable to swallow or speak
she has a fever she confused
she has some degree
of paralysis and delirium
these are all rabies symptoms
are you sure
im a vet
never seen it in humans
but i know what rabies look like
are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies
tears saliva fever
tears saliva fever
they have what she has
but here the thing rabies
takes months for symptoms to show
this is taking minutes
i mean rabies never acts this fast
how does rabies spread
through bites
no it passed through anything wet
blood saliva any mucous membrane
so if you get their blood on you
youre okay
but if you get their blood on you
and it gets into a cut
into your mouth eyes
then youre not okay
how it cured
no there no cure
people get shots in their stomach
before symptoms starts showing
once symptoms show
rabies is 00 percent fatal
