uh
maggie
maggie maggie
maggie
hey
-jonathon  -are you still afraid
i am afraid im afraid of all of them
theyre hard and theyre cruel and one day well be found out and-
well well just wait for that day
i love you maggie
i am going to take you away
there must be some place outside this island where we can find happiness
maggie gasps
do you believe me now standing
your son
and my wife
i would never have believed it but for the evidence of my own eyes
-i can explain let me talk to you -you have sinned in the eyes of god
-you will not go unpunished -by god
i am the representative of god here
my punishment is his
amen
arrest them
get after her
come back girl
piranha
maggie no maggie come back
maggie come back
maggie yelping
no
maggie groans
a judgment
thy will be done
thou shalt not commit adultery
that is the lord commandment
this unhappy woman took no heed of it
and she was punished by god
but this man was not punished
so it becomes our duty to judge him here
do you deny the charge laid against you
yes and i claim the right to defend the virtue of a woman
who cannot answer for herself
spectators aye
godfrey mason i deny you the right to sit upon that bench
i am an elect-man of this community
jonathon you are also my accuser
what kind of law permits the plaintiff to sit in judgment at the accused
spectators aye
jehovah an eye for an eye
grunting
-trial over yet -no not yet henry
-theyve been in there long -what about you
it devil work and tom and i dont care to witness it
with that lot on the bench i pity poor jonathon
-god save him -and all of us
he not on trial because he immoral
no it because he stands for everything that theyre against
the elders are afraid of him
theyll see this opportunity of using the father to condemn his own son
then theyll have it all their own way
chattering
were waiting for the verdict henry
im afraid it a foregone conclusion
your father will have no choice
it hard for me to believe that a father could be so harsh
as to convict his own flesh and blood
jason standing is a sick man bess
but he not beyond all human feeling
gavel pounding
were waiting for you jason
jonathon standing
you are charged with having broken one of the most sacred laws of god
through that sin you have caused the death
of the unhappy woman who was your partner in it
you have been found guilty
and as god deputy here in this community
it is my duty to pronounce the sentence of this court upon you
before i do have you anything to say
yes
i am not guilty
the cause of maggie death was fear
fear of her brutal husband
yes fear is your weapon it a dangerous weapon
one day it will recoil on your own heads
spectators aye
weve heard enough
proceed
the ten commandments
are the prime laws by which our settlement is governed
and the penalty for breaking any major one of them can
as you know be death
but because our god is merciful so we will be merciful
spectators aye
therefore we have decided that you shall be taken from here
and tomorrow transported to the penal colony
where you will remain for 5 years
-spectators no -no
no
woman no mercy no
murmuring
take charge of your prisoner
-shame -shame
have courage
spectators exclaiming
do you know what youve done father
youve sent him to die no one can live in that place
youve sent jonathon to die your own son
cant you see that these men are using you
dont bess it no good youre only hurting yourself
your grandfather would be very proud of you jason standing

im in love too jonathon
yes i know
take care of her henry
try to see that my father comes to no harm
whatever he done whatever he become it isnt for himself
ill do what i can when the time comes
there got to be some change in this persecuted tyranny-ridden place
it will come
perhaps not your way jonathon but it will come
man giddap there
whip cracking
get on
mr jonathon standing
we are honored with such illustrious company mr standing
and what a fine figure we have
no wonder the ladies like you

thank yours

bird squawking

run run
dogs whimpering
whimpering continues
dogs barking
barking continues
barking continues
-straight for the swamp -yeah
dogs barking
birds squawking chirping
gasps

well hello matey what do we got here
-what vessel are you from huh -im not off a ship
-maybe an eagle dropped you eh -who fired that shot at you
-come on -who put these on you
-who put them on you eh -answer my questions
-come on -the settlement
inland
i was a prisoner i escaped
oh well youd better come and see our captain
aye he an expert on punishment
thank you mr hench
my name is laroche
i understand that you live on this island
that you have been in a penal settlement
where you have been undergoing punishments
where is the main settlement
about 50 miles
inland to the north
we were not aware the island was inhabited
when was this settlement founded
oh a hundred years ago
by whom
my great-grandfather
-a refugee -yes
-a huguenot -yes
the king must be displeased to have that wealth slip through his fingers
i said nothing about wealth
no of course you didnt no
sounds like quite a paradise this island doesnt it
just the sort of place weve always dreamed of captain
must have been a wrench for you leaving the settlement
well im going back
youre going back
-for revenge -no
to help my friends
as they would help you it seems
“do unto others as you would be done by” our motto really
our motto without a doubt
well go with you
with me what for there nothing there for you
on the contrary i think there is a great deal for both of us
im prepared to help you well shall we say
get rid of some of the undesirable elements in your settlement
im talking to a pirate what could be your purpose in wanting to help me
you underestimate us mr standing
pirates sometimes have other interests besides money
i will admit that there is another reason
for my wanting to establish friendly relations with your people
you have apparently existed on this island for many years
undetected
now for me in my profession
there a great advantage in having somewhere that is safe and secure
where we can rest between voyages and replenish our stores
ours is a very hard life mr standing
and you can well understand how very often we long
for a quiet haven of rest like this
for this
you would help me to bring a just rule to the settlement
you have my word
you need me i need you
strike off this gentleman chains
get him some food and some fresh clothes
we leave at daybreak
come on matey well look after you
oh you havent half got something to answer for matey
sputters
-mr hench -yes captain
i intend to reach the settlement by tomorrow nightfall
tell the men they must make better time
captain the men havent rested in six hours
this isnt a sunday afternoon picnic mr hench
get a move on there you lubbers
the captain wants you to make more speed
you can tell the captain to go-
tell the captain what brocaire
spits
all right you men let move huh
alle alle
it all right for the captain he doesnt need sleep
you gotta have sleep
the captain doesnt need food nor water nor sleep nor nothing
when he hears you moaning he wont need you
i dont need you to tell me
shouting
shouting continues
diamonds rubies sapphires
youre dreaming man
this time it may come true
what are you gonna do with your share mr hench
i do not count my chickens before i see them
and then i wait until the eggs are hatched out
if the captain is right about this egg i will have my own ship
-brocaire -for me no more sea
just an island somewhere like this
very peaceful
full of beautiful golden women and no men
man peaceful oh matey
youve got a mighty quaint idea of what peaceful
mr standing have you ever wondered what youd do if you found a fortune
ive never been near one i havent had occasion to think about it
-you sure about that -yes quite sure
that not what the captain thinks
you seem to set a lot of store by what the captain thinks
im very close to the captain mr standing
i understand his mind i can read him like a book
he a great man the captain
as strong as a lion as cunning as a mongoose
and as vicious as a snake
a very great man indeed mr standing
and he knows every trick of the trade
he not like other men he dont even sweat
what he thinking mack
youre so close to him you must know what he thinking
i was daydreaming mr standing
you were talking about a fortune
you shouldnt never take no notice of what a man says in his sleep
happy dreams mr standing
-captain laroche -yes
we struck a bargain before we started out here
that quite correct the bargain still stands
i hope you dont share the same illusion as one of your men
and what is that
apart from the natural advantages the settlement has to offer you
there nothing else
there no fortune no money and no treasure
i believe you have made this point before
the more you stress it the more convinced i am
you see my men are always dreaming about treasure
i encourage this
men who are faced with death almost every day of their lives
must have an incentive
i suggest you get some rest mr standing
good night
good night
-bye dad -bye son
giddyap
women what are we waiting for
screaming
come on come on
come on come on
come on come on here
no
oh no no
laughing
mr hench aint exactly enjoying himself matey
matey
up to your usual tricks again i see mr hench
he attacked me when i wasnt looking captain
a very strategic maneuver if i may say so
it doesnt seem to have done him very much good
-are these people friends of yours -they are friends of mine
this was going to be a peaceful mission
it was unfortunately human nature is apt to determine
where peace ends and strife begins
mr hench you will consider yourself severely reprimanded
laughs
reprimanded eh
just like the blooming royal navy aint we captain
we are ready to leave mr standing
-not with me -very well
i think we can probably find our own way to the settlement from here
-your purpose in going there -we made a bargain
we made a bargain when i didnt know you and now i do
as you observed earlier mr standing we are pirates
and sometimes we are inclined to harshness
however there is one thing i will not tolerate and that is mutiny tie him up
matey
with your permission mr standing we will now leave
dad
daddad
no timothy no
you cant help him
dad they killed him
go and find uncle henry and tell him what happened
go quickly go
uncle henry
-uncle henry -what the matter timothy
some men killed my father
-they killed him some men-wait now what men
i dont know ive never seen them before
-jonathon was with them -jonathon
-are you sure it was jonathon -yes
-where are they now -they went towards the settlement
-are your mother and sister all right -yes
take my horse and go to the settlement
warn them they may be attacked ill go to your mother
get out of here
ringing
god has seen fit to warn us of catastrophe
let us like noah take heed
-our island has been invaded -what happened father
blackthorne has been murdered take the children to the great hall
get to the stockade get your guns arm yourselves
the gates close the gates
come and get the guns
-what    -all right dont push
armed with the gun
all right take it calm
you take up positions muskets arrange up on either side of me
take the powder
right away you 90-
load your muskets
hold your fire until i give the order
if youre trying to assess their chances of fighting us off
youd do well to look at the men around you
how many firearms do you suppose your friends have
mr standing
if you want to save them from annihilation go and talk to them
tell them that if they resist me they can expect no mercy
tell them to let us in
so you can rob them of their possessions and slaughter them all
if i kill it is to achieve a purpose not for the sake of killing
-you have my word on that -your word
well mr standing
as you say if they resist the result will be the same
a wise deduction
i wish you every success
get moving
there must be 30 at least
all armed i imagine
weve got about 5 muskets between us
god is on our side
they come in peace
god has answered our prayers
why it jonathon
father i have a message for you from the leader of these men
-who are they -they are pirates i am their prisoner
ive been forced to give you an ultimatum
proceed
they are looking for plunder
they believe there are riches in the settlement
theyre obsessed with the idea that there treasure
-you have told them this is true -no how could i when there is none
they will be convinced only if you allow them to search
-and if i refuse -they will attack
father i beg of you surrender
it the only chance of saving the lives of our people
this is a trick he in league with them himself
whatever i have done im no traitor my father knows this
allow him to think and speak for himself
-what is your answer -this is our answer
gunshot
jason hold your fire
take aim
open fire
the captain wants you
-mack -right mate
take six men and work around to the back of the stockade
round up the women and children
tom
the horses
jonathon
the gates
come on
those men at the back there come here and fill these positions
mason mason
jason stop firing
cease fire stop
stop cease fire
-cease fire -hold

-hold -hold it
-cease fire come on -hold
forby look after the horses brocaire deal with the settlers
the rest of you stay with me
get them inside
-jonathon jonat-get back
get them all back
laughs
fortunately for you i have a reason for keeping you alive
which of these men is your father
i am jason standing leading elect-man of this settlement
if your reason for coming here is to find loot or treasure
you will search in vain
i am of a different opinion
wealthy refugees seldom leave their treasures behind
tell us where it is and we will leave
what is that building
that is our place of justice and of worship
look after our friend and bring the others inside there
our terms for leaving you unmolested are very simple
there is no treasure
we shall remain here until one of you speaks
and we shall use whatever means are necessary
each day that you remain silent two of you will hang
oh no oh no
starting from now
our friends shall draw for the honor of being the first to die
come now me hearties
join in old mack game of chance come sir draw one
and you my friend dont be shy there only two of you to go
you grandpa youve had a good life you dont mind going im sure
hold them up
jason i-
captain
take them outside
no
-and clear this place -no
-no -oh no
no
youre a lucky man mr standing next time it may be your turn
the answer will be the same
we do not yield to the devil
a very noble and praiseworthy sentiment
you may change your mind when you find how persuasive the devil can be
he fair gives you the creeps dont he captain
i dont think he likes us
well maybe he likes you better than he likes me
laughing
hello me old matey

-treasure a non-existent treasure -treasure
-youre wrong jonathon it does exist -what do you mean

when our people first came to the island they were very rich
and they brought their possessions with them mainly gold
there one man who knows where it hidden your father
man im going inside to get some water
mr hench
start
you must stop them
it barbaric
they are fighting over you you should be honored
mate kill him
men laughing
-three left -bide your time
-how many horses in the corral -about 2
then well release ten of the boys
with us thatll make one man for each horse
im staying here
-youre what -if were going to save our people
somebody got to persuade my father to give up that treasure
-do you think you can do that -i can only try
if we do release the men dont attack the pirates until theyre in the open
theyre bound to leave sooner or later with or without the treasure
tapping

but it mutiny sir mutiny must be punished
i said that enough
mr hench

you will learn that no one is indispensable
come on hurry up pick up some arms get the horses
gunshot

look to the other prisoners
no doubt you are responsible for this
why didnt you join your friends
i hoped to serve my people better by staying behind
hench
-mr hench -he is here captain
where are the men who are supposed to be on guard
you will find two of them over there with their necks broken
deal with those with necks intact
double the watch around the stockade now get out
aye captain
there is one way in which you can help your people
and save their lives
find the treasure
then let me talk to my father
your father does he know where it is
-let me talk to him -very well
you have the whole night in which to talk
make the most of it
you wish to speak to me
yes father
laroche has told me to give you his final warning
he says that if you dont tell him where the treasure is by tomorrow morning
he will slaughter every man woman and child in the settlement
oh father have you no conscience
conscience
you dare to speak to me of conscience
you who have already bartered your soul to the devil
what value is life on earth at the cost of your soul
people have a right to look into their own conscience
they have a right to live
father i beg of you to show them mercy
talk to your friend the devil
ask him to show mercy
if you beg me now till the end of time the answer will be the same
you also will die father
do i fear death when i can face my maker with clean hands
and purity of thought
what would be his answer
the answer of a god-fearing man
you jonathon standing are a disgrace to our name
disciple of the devil
you would understand none of this
i curse the very day you were born
my grandfather secret will die with me
from above he will rejoice in my decision
his spirit has already entered mine to give me strength
yesterday i ordered the execution of two of your elect-men
you all know why
since then however ive made a discovery for myself
if im right about this we shall leave immediately
harming no one else
if i am wrong
remove the statue
no no
you mustnt you cant
all right get to work
weve reached bottom captain
there is nothing but rock
doesnt seem as if the treasure wants to be found does it captain
mr hench
you will see to it that no one remains alive
get up
guard the doors
no one is to escape
make haste there make haste
for the last time tell them where it is before it too late
-no no dont touch it -laroche
laroche
captain
halt
-there your gold -gold
solid gold
get back
now leave us in peace
peace
your friends who have escaped do they want peace
get this thing onto the strongest wagon and prepare to leave
yes we shall be taking two hostages with us
and who will they be
father and son
very well release these people and start to move out
all right release them
get them outside quickly
get on the rope pull
pull
theyve left the settlement henry
theyve taken jonathon and the old man
-which way are they heading -east
making for the mouth of the river back to their ship
-what about the treasure -well they had something on a cart
looked like the statue of old simeon standing the founder
that could be the treasure
if it is it mighty heavy
theyre gonna bypass the swamp and take the main track through the bush
theyll be in pine valley about an hour after sunup
that where we make our first strike
all right boys go get some sleep
what will happen to jonathon and my father
well get them out bess
im afraid im flying false colors for the moment bess
im no man of action
perhaps i think too much to be brave
that my excuse anyway
but i dont like fighting and killing and i dont like what i have to do
but now the pirates have found the treasure
why dont you let them take it away
it isnt as simple as all that bess
the treasure stands for more than just gold
to us i mean
it a
a kind of symbol of freedom
it what jonathon great-grandfather stood for
when he organized a flight from persecution
and someone thought it fit to commemorate him with a statue
somewhere along the line
greedy ambitious men have betrayed old simeon
but i think he still watching over us
and the pirates arent gonna take him from this island
not if i can help it
now youd better get some sleep yourself
snoring
laroche mr hench
get the men moving
all right get stirring
come on were moving out now
get up
and you
you too
stammering
dont push us too hard today mr hench
if you know what is good for you
the captain knows what good for him all right
yeah
dont do none of the work just gives the orders
“come here do this go there”
then takes 0 times our share when he divvying out the gold
yeah
gunshot
take cover
-here we go -charge
all of them
jonathon on the back come on
-father come on -leave him
jonathon leave him
get away
-get away from me -jonathon
i think youre losing one of your hostages captain
stop mr hench get them back here
get back here
the captain wants you all back
go on on the cart
you too
come on
one two three four five six
there are about seven or eight of them left
they know this island better than we do
-how many have we lost -six
six that leaves 5
fifteen against eight
they know this island better than we do
by my calculations we shall reach the river by tomorrow nightfall
-and then -im not a prophet
all right
get moving
-where father -look after henry
get some water and fix some bandages for the boys
dont take it so hard jonathon
i should have stayed to look after him
theyll kill him henry
perhaps that why he stayed if the statue goes
i dont believe your father would wish to live
why not
in his mind he protecting the statue not because it gold
he sees the religion and ideals of your great-grandfather
in the process of being destroyed
yes but-
well maybe all this has opened his eyes to the truth
back in the settlement he was too weak to fight the men
who have long since forgotten why we came here
jonathon a few months ago you said to me
“try and see that no harm comes to my father
whatever he done he hasnt done it for himself”
well you were right
yes i understand
i only hope it isnt too late
theyre following the same trail henry
-were all ready with the first trap -good
it too late matey
therell be more of this
unleash the statue well carry it the rest of the way
well have to carry it
isnt it time we made use of our hostage
laroche yes he can lead the way
standing
all right ill need six of you the rest of you look to your guns
look out the tree
mr hench
mr hench
what are you waiting for
the men are going to give trouble captain
at least some of them will
trouble to whom
they are scared they dont want to go on
the only other way to go is back
perhaps they would prefer that
what are your plans when you get to the river
you tell them captain
we are only a few miles from the river
when we get there we are going to build a raft
and float the statue downstream until we reach the ship
and who going with the statue captain
whoever wishes to go
itll have to be a big raft to take the statue and all of us
there wont be as many as there are now
the islanders will see to that captain
what are they gonna be doing while were building the raft
i doubt theyll neglect us but we still outnumber them
we outnumbered them when the trees fell
yes captain we outnumbered them
when baily and shaw spiked their guts on the bamboo stakes
-yeah -yeah
well move on mr hench
it all right for him he has the lion share
-im all for getting back to the ship -yeah well me too
what chance do we have on a raft
with luck we shall reach the ship in an hour start building the raft
captain this is as far as we go
that right as far as we go
we are leaving the statue here
leave it where it is
leave it where it is back to the ship
and who will be next
oh not me captain
im with you
drop the gun
captain
well build the raft and well take the risks
just like we always do
but youll not be coming with us
take his gun mr hench
i like my wine in my belly captain not to drown in
all right start felling the trees to make the raft
come on make haste there
if he gives any trouble kill him
if i have a mind i might do that anyway
