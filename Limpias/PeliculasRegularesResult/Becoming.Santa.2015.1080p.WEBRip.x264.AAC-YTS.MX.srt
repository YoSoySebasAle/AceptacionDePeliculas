the task at hand
it has been our job
as the women in this family
to prepare the men

i know
i do
i will

a couple of extra days
to get used to the idea
of all of this first
fine
but it doesnt mean
we cant start working
though
time is ticking
absolutely
tick-tock
so what are we doing
i think we should see

i mean after all
on christmas eve
he going to be eating
about five billion of them
and a santa on christmas eve
with an upset tummy
ooh is a cranky santa
so over here
is our test area
it kind of our
quality control
and here
our newest creations
every year we like to create
about a dozen new toys
i mean
you know how it is
kids
they get tired of their toys
so we like
to change it up
what is this
actually
that not a toy
it a contraption
im working on
that warps time and space
so when the elves
have to go back
and do damage control
they can leave the north pole
at warp speed
so how does it work
well you just
write your address here
and then but
actually it really
hasnt been tested
no dont break it

looks like youve got
your work cut out for you
always nice
to see you jack
just remember holly
christmas is the
most special day
of the year
you dont want to ruin it

that i might skip dinner
tonight

marshmallows

for the smores
okay
so where
this connor fellow
i think he down
in the factory
he seems very interested
in what the elves are doing
sounds like he might
be better served
making toys
than being santa
what
come on
jessica
dont tell me you dont
have your doubts
i mean he from the south
for goodness sakes
it never gets colder
than 30 degrees down there
now jack we have to
give the boy a chance
and i think holly
is going to do
a really good job
at training him
yeah but what if he fails
so i guess
congratulations are in order
yes thank you
must be lots to do
before the big day
geez
speaking of which
connor you ever
slide down a chimney before
excuse me
hol and i used to do it
when we were kids
all the time
we had so much fun
remember hol
yeah ive slid down
a few banisters in my day
well then
you shouldnt have
any problem at all
with a chimney
what do you say
we give it a go
is it always
this windy
yeah it
the north pole
ho how are you my girl
i thought id have myself
a quick read
what
nothing
dont tell me nothing
i know you
tell me
what what
it all good
youll see
good news though
it really hot
in the chimney
think you can
handle the heat
yeah i can
handle the heat
well see about that
here goes nothin
ooh
jack
just doing a little
chimney sliding nick
jack
such fun
all right buddy
youre up
yeah yeah
ill be right down
wow
connor you dont
have to do this
dont worry
i got this babe
what are you kids
up to
yeah yeah
whoa aah
connor
hello
are you
all right
yeah yeah
just a little stuck i think
well
pull your shoulders together
and suck it in
yeah still not working
i got you buddy
use the ol poker trick
-jack jack
-what
not helping
relax everyone
ill
ill melt the butter
my
are you sure
youre okay
yeah yeah
yeah im fine
i just you know
came down on a wrong angle
or something
okay
it was a solid
effort connor
youre a good sport
yeah
how it going
hey
it okay
um listen
about today
yeah
yeah that went well
yeah
listen that
was my own stupidity
like thinking i could
actually slide down a chimney
it not like im your dad
or anything
what i should
be able to do
is make a toy
that kids actually
want to play with
but for whatever reason
i dont know what to do
to make it better
or more fun
or whatever it is
ive got to do to this thing
to make it
more interesting to kids
i guess
i could make an app
or add some lights
or something
but that kind of
like plffft
you know once my dad
gave me a doll
and it was kind of
an ugly doll
to be honest
it was one of
the elves prototypes
and it didnt
quite work out
and i didnt want
to play with it
and so it just sat
on my bedroom shelf
for months and months
and then one day
i spilled hot cocoa
and i got the
doll dress dirty
and so i picked her up
and i started cleaning her
and the moment that doll
was in my hands
it was like magic
i cleaned her
i dressed her
and for the first time
i played with her
and from that moment on
she was my
most favorite doll
so you see
sometimes you just
have to get the toy
into the child hands
for them to realize
how wonderful it is
youll get it
thanks
my mr claus
smells something yummy
from mrs claus kitchen
ho-ho good morning dumpling
where are the children
holly is out
feeding the animals
and i have connor
chopping firewood
ooh
nicholas
do you have any
you know concerns
about connor
abilities
i mean when i first met you
you at least could polish off
a couple dozen of my cookies
well i always had
a good appetite
but we still had our doubts
about me
like when you forgot
to harness the reindeer
and they took off
without you
you sure whipped me
into shape
and holly will do
the same for him
besides the boy has
plenty of christmas spirit
that will get him through
i dont know
look
i tell you what
ill think of a task
im sure he can do
okay
dont touch that
boy
connor my boy
just stacking some wood
dont worry
about that
ive got another job
for you
job what kind of job
well the elves are having
their siesta
but i need some toys
i was going to get connor
to go down to the factory
and fill this up
while i get
some work done
in the office
i could do that
um actually
i need your help
in the office
you know what i mean
just get
what on the list
and make sure
to be very very quiet
so you dont wake up
the elves
or else theyll get
real cranky
got it
dont wake up the elves
good man
there we go
yeah
i think he got this
in the bag
hey
aw
heave ho-ho-ho
heave ho-ho-ho
heave good
pull santa pull
you sure these
are the right size
yes
whoo whoo
robin
youre the best
i know
youre looking very sharp
for the big day snowball
what no
i havent told him yet
but i will
i mean there no rush
we havent even set
a date yet
rush what
um
i was i was just
telling snowball
that now that were engaged
that we dont have to
rush getting married
we can take our time
and set a date
and plan and
you know actually
i was thinking
maybe we could
we could do that sooner
rather than later
sooner
okay well
the summer is always nice
and the the fall
would be beautiful
with all the leaves
i was actually thinking
this christmas
this christmas
yeah why not
were already here
your family here
mario the elves
plus your dad
will be done
delivering all
the presents
he can kick back
have an extra egg nog
or two
but what about
your parents
well first of all
my parents are in
florida vacationing
like they do
every christmas
second of all
they eloped themselves
i already talked
to them on the phone
and theyre great with it
is that
your holiday stew
yes it is
a couple bowls of this
has kept your father going
all christmas
for almost 30 years
i thought a bowl or two
might help connor along
yeah
yeah
um speaking of connor
we have set a wedding date
you did when
christmas day
honey that
gives us plenty of time
christmas day this year
good golly gumdrops
holly claus
that in less
than a week
i know but he was
just so excited
about being here
and us being here and
so he already knows
actually i wanted to give him a
little bit more time to
holly really
mom please
i just think
that if can complete one task
he going to feel
a lot better about this
well let see
if he could handle
the sleigh
perfect
except for now
let keep the reindeer
out of it
right
all right
these new hydraulics
should take some of the load
off the reindeer
so you can get
to where you need to go
faster
ooh
you guys needed me
yeah
um sweetie
mario just added
hydraulics
to the sleigh
to ease the load
and we were hoping
that you might
test-drive it for us
considering
you probably know
a little more about this
than dad
yeah
im used to
using reindeer dust
absolutely
yeah i used to build
go-karts when i was a kid
i got this
climb aboard captain
okay so what have we got
these ones start it up
this one gives it the lift
but right now
you just want to ease it
out of the barn
in a hover
you got it
got it
all right
good man good man
here we go
that was festive good tune
yeah
attaboy attaboy
sounds good
-yeah
-yeah
it sounds
like it warmed up
so now
just go up into a hover
-here i go
-here you go here you go
nice and easy
i i dont know
what happened
everything was good
mario
duct tape
here you go donner
that enough thistle
good night now
hey
can mario fix the sleigh
hell set it right
dad do you think
connor can do it
now now now
let have none of that talk
but he hasnt been able
to finish a single task
holly
i flunked
rooftop parallel parking
seven times
my first chimney slide
i landed
smack in the fire
singed my south pole
couldnt sit down
for a week
darlin if i can do this
have faith he can
hey holly
i think i might need
some aspirin
what about you
you know
where the aspirin is
hey there partner
looking for these
nice catch
yeah thanks
so from what i hear
the big day
is right around the corner
yup
bet you never thought
youd be in the shoes youre in
no some pretty big shoes
wow that an understatement
i mean how many
people can say
theyre marrying
santa daughter
just me
that right
just you youre the one
that right
and it just you
taking on that big red
jolly responsibility too
that right
gee im sorry
i dont really know
what youre talking about
just the whole
santa legacy thing
i mean you
cant tell me
youre not just
a little bit freaked out
about the idea
of becoming santa right
wow
she hasnt told you has she
what
well this is awkward
for me
okay so
what youre saying
is that
because im marrying holly
im actually
next in line
to be santa
that about right
hit the nail
on the head
why wouldnt
she tell you
you know
yeah of course
i guess
she could have her reasons
like maybe in her heart
she knows
youre not cut out for the job
look im
im sorry
forget i said anything
all right
youre a good man
connor okay
and im sure
you understand
that christmas
is the most magical day
of the year
which is why i know
you wouldnt want to spoil it
for generations to come
right buddy
feel better bud
ooh
hey snowball
okay ill take care
of that
we need some aspirin
actually i already
took care of it
you did
i think i should just
go check on him anyway
it okay
he was almost asleep
poor guy
really
that arctic air
is really knocking him out
yeah
so why dont you
just let him rest
let say we have
a cup of cider
i really should
id love
some cider
after a day like this
ill take two cups
all right
then well all
raise a glass
i
i really should um
-come on yeah
-okay
all right
so we snuck out
around midnight
without waking
any of the elves
and then
we pushed the sleigh
out of the barn
holly bribed the reindeer
so theyd help us out
and keep quiet
with candy apples
that right
with candy apples
so we pushed the sleigh
far enough away
that when we took off
you guys wouldnt hear us
youre such rascals
well it didnt hurt
that we gave you hot cocoa
that right
where did you two fly to
we went all the way
to the top of snowy ridge
it was beautiful
you always could
handle the sleigh jack
well i had
a great co-pilot
-ooh
-aw
im about ready for a top-off
how about we do
some christmas caroling
you guys used to do
some caroling
what was one of the songs
you used to sing
you mean this one
it came upon
the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
that the one
come on holly
join me up here
no
join in
-no i dont want to
-come on
honey we havent heard
you sing in so long
this is true
come on
all right
from angels
bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold
this
is wonderful
it came upon
the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
from angels
bending near the earth
to touch their harps
of gold
this is nice
yeah
peace on the earth
goodwill to men
from heaven
all-gracious king
it came upon
the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
and all the world
give back the song
which now the angels sing
what a lovely
evening

good night jack
thanks for the memories
old friend
thank you guys
safe home
holy night
all is calm
all is bright
connor sweetie
are you okay
dear holly
the first day
i laid eyes on you
i knew id be a lucky man
if you ever gave me
a second glance
because not only
were you the most beautiful girl
in the room
but you were the most radiant
but i took a chance
and when i did
not only did you give me
a second glance
but one
of the most magical nights
of my life
i know ive told you before
holly
but i fell in love with you
that night
and nothing has come close
to that moment
until the day you said yes
i love you holly
and id do anything
for you
which is why
im saying goodbye
because you deserve someone
who will take the reins
and fill your father boots
in a way
that ill never be able to
and i cherish christmas too much
for that
and i love you even more
merry christmas holly
love always connor
craftsmanship nowadays
you think
this is real funny do you
what is it
jingles
i was
i was going to tell him
you know
prepare him
but i guess he found out
and panicked
but that not
the worst of it
the worst of it
is that i doubted him
i doubted if
he was up for the job
of being santa
which is terrible
because i love him
i guess if i had
kept the faith
and not fallen
into doubt
he would still be here
chestnut there was
nothing you did
this is on him
and destiny
and if it was meant to be
the stars will align
and believe me
hell be back
what if that
doesnt happen
well
youll still
be all right
i just got a huge order
for hunky santa dolls
yes
merry christmas
hey
yeah
i heard
what happened
and that lousy
i mean
a dear john letter
i mean at least
be man enough
to tell you
to your face right
i guess that why
he not cut out
for the job
what do you want jack
what ive always wanted
you
really jack now
now is a better time
than never
i cant lose you
again holly

i mean
think about how much fun
we all had together
the other night
right
and there no doubt that
im the man for the job
i
just think about it
that all im asking
wow
that quite the piece of ice
you got there
jack gave it to me
he asked me to marry him
in so many words
well cant say
im surprised
i guess you think
that a good idea
he would make
a great santa
i dont think
anything other than
wanting my little girl
to be happy
and does he
does jack make you happy
i dont think
it matters does it
you know what i love best
about being santa
the look on
those kids faces
when they open up
a present
theyve been wishing for
all year
the twinkle
they get in their eyes
the flush of pink
to their cheeks
the feeling of pure joy
now you tell me
does it matter
if he makes you happy
connor
surprised to
see you here buddy
i thought you would have
taken off for the holidays
yeah i decided to come back

cause that what
couples do right
they talk it out

done that
then maybe
i would have realized
that the reason
i wasnt succeeding
was because of my confidence
my lack of it
connor
