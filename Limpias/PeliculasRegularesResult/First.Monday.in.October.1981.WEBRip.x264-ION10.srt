and ive gotta find him
he surprised the hell out of me in brussels
he sent me a postcard
the only part i can make out is dear christine
at least i think that dear you know what his handwriting is like
then there something here about climbing a mountain
did he happen to mention which mountain
see that peak straight ahead
that where well be tomorrow at this time
grab a couple of lungs full of this
pity the poor bastards in the cities who
dont get to taste real air anymore

hello
hello hello jeff

no that okay well be getting downhill
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
thou anointest my head with oil
my cup runneth over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life
and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever
i dont really know
when stanley left instructions that he wanted me to uh
what do you call it say a few words
i was surprised
mr justice morehead and i disagreed on a lot of things in our lifetimes
and i guess it only natural that we keep right on disagreeing
i know seven other men who could do this better
but im not about to file a dissenting opinion
stanley morehead was a gentleman of honest mind
you cant say that about many men in this city
in this century
stanley and i were like a pair of flying buttresses
leaning against opposite sides of a gothic cathedral
we helped keep the roof from caving in
if wed both been on the same side all the time
we might have pushed the building over
you dont have to agree with a man in order to respect him
stanley and i had one argument over and over again
i never won i never could win
he used to ask me
what in god name is the practical use of mountain climbing
one time i said to him
well on a mountaintop maybe youre a little bit closer to god
he laughed and said dan what the hell do you know about god
i do know this
mr justice stanley morehead is not in any box
about to be covered by earth
he at the top of a mountain higher than i have ever climbed
fire
ready aim
fire
ready
aim fire
ready present arms
band playing america the beautiful
christine i think we should have hired a limousine like the others
dan nonsense the fresh air will do you good
alice looked awful you know what burns me
toda y s starbrushed off stanley whole life with two inches
and printed two full pages of smart-ass
speculation about his replacement
dan ill bet it a surprise somebody nobody thought of
christine she doesnt have many close friends
d a n it always a surprise especially for the guy who gets capped
christine maybe ill plan a small
dinner party for her after we get settled
dan when the president gave me the nod i was so surprised
i couldnt talk for a week
christine i dont think i could stand
one of those terrible teas with all those wives
could be anybody
a lot of good men around
a lot of lousy ones too
if i were alice id go to europe
the warm part
how was europe
wet
how was your mountain
high
you have any idea who going to be appointed
to what
the court
i never try to second-guess a president
man moves into the white house
you have no idea what happens to his mind
i just hope he has an active membership card in the human race
brass band playing
wa l do hi ted
always feels like the first day of school doesnt it
hope i never graduate
i dont know what wed do without you dan
morning radabaugh anything happens
everything that happened is on your desk mr justice snow
still got the same cold
sinus
dan who there
mason woods sir
may i come in sir
of course you can come in what the hell do you think youre here for
thank you sir
and you dont have to knock
it highly unlikely youll ever catch me on the couch with ms radabaugh
yes sir
ive only got one complaint about you
youre too goddamn polite
stop being scared of me mason you got the job
yes sir
uh would you care for some tea mr justice or a scotch
maybe id better have both
no i dont wanna overdo it forget the tea
um now this supports your position
on abbot vs omnitech
forget omnitech
but that at the top of the order list
it gonna get struck
why
because my brave brethren on the court
are too chicken-hearted to hear it that why
when im getting ripped off mason
i want to know who doing the ripping
how much can these multinational monsters get away with
i dont know and neither do you
because they keep hiding behind all those tv commercials
saying how goddamn holy they are
even the cj is scared to hear omnitech
he says it like telling god
you want to examine the books
peace up to a point
i tell you mason
the most dangerous thing in the world is to be cautious
people are always falling down the ones
who are afraid theyll trip over something
take a chance and it is sir
and dont always agree with me
if you think im wrong and dont say so
then what the hell good are ya
i like law clerks who argue with me yes sir
no sir
i mean ill try to do that sir
not to do that sir what this
this is collins vs california
it a kinky one that came up from the ninth circuit
the berkeley student who wore a t-shirt that said
fuck the white house
did he have his pants off
it doesnt say
well then i dont see any clear and present danger
that he intended to implement the opinion of his t-shirt
well the ninth circuit held it was offensive to the public sensibility
just being offensive is not an offense
one man pornography may be another man poetry yes sir
yes yes yes yes yes yes
lady purity speaking from the cloisters of california
free speech is not ipso facto filthy speech
dirt is a splendid environment for earthworms
but it is a grave for the human mind
i wish to hell she didnt write so goddamn well
you see mason that what this court is for
t o restrain the ruth loomises of the world
sir i found this opinion on surveillance
but you wont have to read it
wont he
you wrote it
well read it to me
i might have forgotten it or changed my mind
when god created the world
he did it alone in private all by himself
no monitors no hidden microphones
he made it the way he wanted it
but what if someone had invaded god privacy
would he have put the world together the same way
i doubt it he wouldve made it a popular world
both and the garden of eden would have turned out
like las vegas or 42nd street
telephone ringing
would you like to take any calls sir
uh ms radabaugh will get that
phone ringing
no she wont
chambers of mr justice snow
oh
yes mrs snow
it your wife but she doesnt want to bother you
you re not bothering me youre interrupting me
but youre not bothering me
how should i seat them this evening
i dont care how you seat em try chairs
phone clicking
hello hello
what happened to radabaugh
she left early
sinus
she looked terrible
radabaugh been with me for 23 years
and she always looks terrible
how do you do that sir do what
well you reach in there and find exactly what youre looking for
in the middle of all that all that m ess
to you it a mess to me it a wilderness of free association
dont ever straighten up my desk mason
id never be able to find anything
always been suspicious of neatness
if there nothing on top of a man desk
he probably shoved all the clutter into the drawers
and if his drawers are empty what the hell does he need a desk for
may i come in dan sure cj
how are you mr chief justice
uh im not sure
mind if i lie down on your couch
mason see if those t-shirts are available on the open market
id like to wear one under my robe
what t-shirts
none of your goddamn business
do i ask you about your underwear
how come your couches are much more comfortable than mine
you know something cj
maybe ill give you that couch
as a going-away present
who going away
think of how many people would bust a gut with joy if i retired
nah you wouldnt do that to me dan
oh i wont quit when youre short-handed
ill wait until youve got nine men on the bench again
yeah hmm
who the president going to pick
he already been appointed
who is he
mr justice snow im gonna have to ask you to rephrase that question
a woman
he picked a woman
great
good for him itll be fun
who is it who is she who who
the president has just sent up to the senate judiciary committee
the name of judge ruth hagador loomis
of the ninth circuit court of appeals
get off my couch i have to lie down
now now dan
youre joking it a joke it a joke isnt it
the president i am told thinks he has made
a great progressive step in the history of mankind
ruth loomis the mother superior of orange county
what goes through a man head when
he makes an appointment like that
guess he was trying to be evenhanded
president of all the people
the senatell never go for it will they will they
forget it
phone ringing
continued ringing
where ms radabaugh
continued ringing
chambers of mr justice snow
it a reporter any comment for the washington post
no comment from mr justice snow at this time
youre better than ms radabaugh
the president wants a woman on the court
why not pick ms radabaugh
shed be perfect shed never show up
jeff why in god name do i get a sinking feeling in my gut every time
i think about that woman sitting on this court
it not because she a woman
i like women my wife a woman
the bench will smell better with a little perfume on it
but ruth loomis
phone ringing
how can you just let it ring
telephone has no constitutional right to be answered
don t pay any attention to it itll go away
see
i hear she plays tennis
hitler played the harmonica
oh she may not be so bad
she young

and she isnt stupid
fix yourself a drink
i just might do that
knocking
here she is now come in
is it true
jack anderson on the phone
would either of you care to say anything to him
yes ask him where im spending my vacation next summer
i dont know but he probably does
ill just tell him neither of you is available for comment
how does a newspaperman like jack anderson
find out what happens in the oval office so fast
simple he got a friend in the soviet embassy
and im 0 minutes late
only one thing dan before you consider resigning
resigning who the hell gonna resign
you think id leave you here alone and get sprayed down
by the lysol lady of orange county
and if that holy junta at the white house
picked her to replace stanley morehead
who in god name do you suppose theyd send up to take my seat
shirley temple
5-2
bill change sides ill let you take the sun for a while
not bad for a beginner am i
when are you gonna let me take you some place where i can win
don t you think a year is long enough to be a practicing widow
seven months dont rush me
am i on the list
youre at the top
public announcer judge loomis telephone
long distance call for judge loomis
sorry bill
senator im sorry these proceedings are taking so much time
but were breaking ground here
and i trust the committee questions
arent embarrassing you judge loomis
i dont embarrass easily senator
audience laughing
judge loomis
judge loomis about your interests and equities
would they influence your decisions on the high court
the financial statement in front of you is complete senator
when i was appointed to the ninth circuit
i disposed of anything that might possibly raise
a question of conflict of interest
thank you
but you were still married to a very active
and successful corporation lawyer
was i expected to dispose of him
audience laughing
according to this fbi report
you and your husband were partners
in the law firm of loomis and loomis
excuse me senator why do you keep bringing up my husband
when i was appointed to the federal bench
he took over the entire practice
it was a tremendous burden on him
it probably what killed him
did you ever represent omnitech international or its chairman
donald richards
no senator
youre quite sure about that
ruth quite sure
senator after you left is it possible that the firm represented him
id have no knowledge of that
and since your husband death
youve had no contact with any member of that firm
ruth none oh that not quite true
i do play tennis once in a while with bill russell
w illiam russell
h e joined the firm after i went to the bench
senator do you ever discuss legal business with him
no senator
do you think perhaps
youre a little too young judge loomis
to take these responsibilities on yourself
as i recall
mr justice snow was a year younger than i am
when he was appointed to the court
audience laughing
clapping
do you feel your decisions on the high court
might be influenced by the fact that
well youre a woman
i hope so
uh arent a man decisions influenced by the fact that he a man
for two centuries this court has expressed men opinions
and perhaps it time for the majority of the population
to have one voice in nine in the rulings of the supreme court
senator is the lady implying
that male justice is perverted
ruth havent we outgrown those fears about the periodic instability
of the female of the species
eggs are not the seeds of insanity
a woman can ovulate and think at the same time
laughing and clapping
senator were striving to be objective
yes but really what does sex have to do
with being a judge
somebody with the capacity to bear children
is gifted not crippled
a uterus is like absolute pitch
some people have it some dont
well according to this fact sheet
judge loomis has never had any children
yes but does the constitution say that a
supreme court justice has to be a mother
laughing faintly
judge loomis we dont mean to probe into your personal life
why not my entire life is public
the fbi is wrong in reporting to you that i have no children
i have hundreds
we are the parents of our ideas
and uh so my children
in other words my opinions my decisions
are the result of conception
and the delivery is sometimes painful
you may not like my children
you may find them ugly
but by god your ideas and mine
have equal rights to live together
to grow to change even to die
if there are no further questions
the committee will consider an executive session
where well recommend to the full body of the senate
thank you judge loomis
thank you mr chairman
thank you gentlemen
now let check it just once more
mr justice carey is now on this end
that correct then mr justice webb
webb mr justice quincy
that him mr justice snow
that right the cj stays in the center of course
then mr justice halperin o kay
mr justice clewes
that him mr justice thompson
that right and the new chair for justice loomis
on this end that correct
does a lady need this
well tell her it a wastebasket
good afternoon
welcome to washington justice loomis
thank you everything ready
great oh is the phone in
ah yes the man left an hour ago
phone ringing
hello
ready for your coronation
bill and it is
how did you get this number i dont even know it
well i do if it ever slips your mind just give me a ring
in the bedroom please
in the bedroom
im talking to the bellman you idiot
it sweet of you to call
i just wanted to be the first man in recorded history
to ask a supreme court justice for a date
so noted the clerk will put it on the docket
thatll take two years
not now that im in charge
mr agronsky
whenever youre ready
tape is rolling
this is an historic day for the nation
and for the supreme court of the united states
the court has been in session
since the first monday in october
which according to the judiciary act of 789
marks the start of a new term each year
no camera has ever photographed
the traditional robing ceremony
in the sanctum sanctorum of the court
and none is there today
since the death of justice stanley morehead
this has been an eight-man court
which as justice daniel snow has pointed out
resembles a four-man basketball team
today the vacancy has been filled
but this still remains an eight-man court
well where is she
may be we ought to sound the warning buzzer a little sooner
i suppose she has things to do that we dont
after all i dont have anything to do with my hair
agronsky this is an historic occasion
like the jesuits going coed
suppose shell wanna hang chintz curtains everywhere
i hate chintz
why am i nervous she the one who should be nervous
now gentlemen things are not going to be any different
from the way theyve been every two
minutes to 0 in the history of the court
now weve got to think of her exactly as one of the brothers
good morning
justice loomis welcome
w elcome to the court thank you
good morning good morning maam
thank you for the lovely roses
uh
you dont send me roses anymore cj
it 958 gentlemen and madam justice
we shake hands like this every day
every morning just before we take the bench
like nine boxers coming in to a ring
we shake hands before we knock each other out
clock chiming
gavel knocking
the honorable the chief justice and associate justices
of the supreme court of the united states
oh yep whoz thatz
all persons having business
before the honorable the supreme court of the united states
are admonished to draw near and give their attention
for the court is now sitting
god save the united states and this honorable court
cj today orders o f the court
have been certified by the chief justice filed with the clerk
and will not be announced orally
probably the peak of every lawyer career
is that moment when he is presented and accredited to plead
before the highest court in the land
only lawyers ever plead in that hallowed chamber
but today all eyes are focused on the court newest newcomer
who has just received confirmation from the senate of the united states
court watchers will be fascinated in the weeks and months ahead
by the figure in the leather chair farthest to the left
of the chief justice
how will this feminine presence
affect what for two centuries
has been an all-male preserve
because so many states
have accepted pornography as a way of life
does not mean that we are willing
to compromise our values
in the sovereign state of nebraska
ergo i beseech this distinguished body
in its infinite and scholarly wisdom
to uphold exalted standards of morality
which this lofty court so fervently advocates
and how rare it is to find judicial minds
so attuned to the higher reaches of the spirit
so understanding of the basic values
we so dearly cherish
so incredibly sensitive to the deep strains of decency
which constitute the lapping tidewaters
of our heritage
the state of nebraska
contends that herbert g maloney
knowing and willfully
perpetrated an obscene and foul
your time is up
may i be permitted c j no
any questions gentlemen
madam justice
i get the impression that the state of nebraska
would like to see this film confiscated burned
and the ashes sent into space is that the idea
if the court so recommended
is it your contention that the constitution
gives this court any such power
this court is the judge of its own power
until we actually examine the film in question i think that
may it please the court
i respectfully submit that my client rights under the first amendment
thee first amendment doesnt give anybody the right
to commit acts which are harmful to the public good
but this is an educational film
a major documentary a work of art
how can we judge that until weve seen it
do any of the justices object
besides justice snow
i think it essential that we see the film
all right then the clerk will schedule a showing of the film
at some future date which is not in conflict
with the schedule already on the calendar
upbeat music playing
loud moaning
intensified moaning
narrator if you saw lois walking along
in the sunshine of beverly hills
you might think she was just a healthy ordinary girl
but lois has a problem
like the alcoholic who cannot stop with one drink
like the compulsive eater
who must consume one dessert after another
lois can never be satisfied
can never get enough of what she craves
music playing
why isnt mr justice snow here
he never comes to these showings
narrator the average young woman wants one man
but lois is insatiable
actors moaning
have we missed much
the lady just getting started
you guys get over there
and shut the door
loud music playing
narrator we asked a distinguished physician
to give his opinion of lois condition
h e has asked that his name be withheld
because of his high standing in the medical profession
dr x from the point of view of a man of science
what can be done for lois
this sort of affliction is difficult to treat
let look at the other sex as lois sees them
oh let not
narrator can lois ever be cured
or is she doomed to a life
of ever-increasing frustration
i dont know about lois but im cured
havent we seen enough
narrator during the next hour
well try to show you
no i dont think so
projectionist stop the film please
please
thank you does anyone object
no not me
mr chief justice are you stopping the film
because there a woman in the room
no no that not why im uncomfortable
you think im offended of course im offended
but that no reason to stop the film is it
cj just a moment please
madam justice loomis as a man
i am somewhat embarrassed that you
have to sit here and watch this thing
i certainly can understand how harold feels
i wouldnt want to sit through it with my wife
or arrange a special showing for mother day
but your wife and your mother havent been appointed to this court
time is the point gentlemen and madam justice
and we have a responsibility not to waste it
i have seen enough to make my decision
judges me too yes
i do apologize justice loomis
why
something is very wrong here
youre all so polite to me
im not being too outspoken am i
no no
no we want you to speak up speak right out
raise hell if you want to
you may be sorry you said that snickers
actually i do have one question oh
how can mr justice snow pass judgment on something
without even seeing it
hasnt he virtually disqualified himself on maloney
would you like to suggest that to justice snow
i dont think that one of my privileges isnt it yours
well yes i suppose it is
and mr chief justice id like to examine the rest of the film
if you dont mind
just to see if there a shred of redeeming social or artistic value
project ionist would you continue the film please
thank you
loud music playing
530 will be fine
howdy ben
good afternoon mr justice
how are you felling
just fine thank you just fine
how esther
better and better
good
the usual mr justice

you better get it from cj
well do this later ben
yes sir
hi dan missed you at lunch
what she up to what who up to
how many she do we have on the court
oh that well it just that a question came up
or more accurately a suggestion was made y eah
well what it amounts to is uh
should uh
should attendance be obligatory
at these obscenity screenings
who wasnt there besides me
oh house was packed
what your beef
well the lady wonders
whether a justice who hasnt seen any part of the film
hasnt in effect
she wants me to disqualify myself
because i wont go down there
and sit through that pile of crap uh well
so it crap what if it is crap that not the point
crap got the right to be crap
drop the legal language dan
are you as chief justice
suggesting that i disqualify myself from voting on maloney
no im merely suggesting that uh
it been suggested
where are you going
ive got a present for madam justice
not roses
and have a look at us v albertson 954
it in volume 348 us maybe 349
is she in
oh yes sir mr justice snow
intercom buzzing
uh just hold on a second yes
robinson madam justice mr justice snow would like to see you
he would when
he here
just check those references ill get back to you thank you
tell mr justice snow ill be happy to see him in a minute
shell be happy to see you in a moment mr justice
thank you
ask mr justice snow to come in mr robinson
you may go in mr justice
thank you
no no please please dont get up dont get up
you d stand mr justice if i came to call on you in chambers
oh i wouldnt be too sure about that chuckles
i cant tell you how grateful i am to you for seeing me like this
on no notice whatsoever
it my honor is it
well i suppose it is
say
that quite a desk
and so neat
do aircraft land here frequently
what is it that you wanted to see me about
nothing earthshaking
by george i was a little startled to see
that youve got a male law clerk out there
mr robinson he not my law clerk he my secretary
well well well well
what a generous gesture
letting men into a field
previously dominated by the other sex
im glad youre in favor of men lib
say let relax
do you feel like relaxing
madam justice
i hope you arent finding our national capital too dull
after the grandeur of disneyland
you dont think much of california do you
i try not to think of it at all
why dont you try climbing some our mountains
oh i have i have i admire your mountains
it  your valleys that make me nervous
now madam justice
i would like your opinion on a point of law
concerning that great american art form the motion picture
help yourself
oh thank you
now i was wondering if by any chance
youd seen a film called um
the naked nymphomaniac
that the one
now you probably didnt even notice i wasnt there
i noticed
oh you did mmm
well
well
i wonder if you found anything
uh unpleasant in the picture
first of all
i see no reason to overturn the lower court
anyone whod seen that film would
realize that the naked nymphomaniac
is a total offense against the public sensibility
it sickening degrading disgusting
my my my my my my
as bad as all that
now i wonder if you can put your finger
on exactly what it was that offended you
was it the title some particular word in the title
naked is that it
what if they called it
the fully-clothed nymphomaniac
or maybe it was the other word that bothered you
nym-pho-maniac
supposing they called it the naked methodist
or naked daughter of the american revolution
are you finished
madam justice i am a long way from being finished
but i ll pause briefly in case there something youd like to say
thank you
let me ask you something
would you call a female governor a governess
is a woman composer a composeress
no and her sex is entirely beside the point
and a justice of the supreme court
is a justice not madam justess
now mr justice i submit that we are failing in our duty on this court
if we dont try to stop the avalanche of prurient slop
madam if youll im not finished
which is about to bury us
are we doing our job if we permit anything
what are we permitting
violence in the streets
kids on drugs
filth pornography
who slaps the labels on you me
somebody better no thank you maam
i think it unconstitutional to set myself up as a censor
refusing to look at something is censorship
hell i dont look at television that doesnt make it illegal
that not the point
seeing that film is material to making a judgment
if you d spent 0 minutes in that screening room five minutes
you would see how obscene how outrageous
censorship is an outrage
what about a training film for terrorists
a free lecture how to make a nuclear bomb in your basement
do you condone inciting to violence
no maam
what about inciting to decadence
define decay
that what were here for
not me
wed better try
the people of this country have only
one absolute protection against chaos
the law
and you and i were appointed to this court for only one reason
to uphold and sustain that law
watch out you cant turn the law into a straitjacket
the law gotta be a suit of clothes a man can wear
it gotta fit easy be comfortable
law shouldnt strap a man in at the throat or the brain or the crotch
that vivid
do you know what youre doing
youre making maloney more important than the law
he is more important than the law
this court doesnt try men we put their trials on trial
that it were constantly examining the witness who isnt there
all we ever get to see are lawyers cold records cold briefs
where the human being where the pain weve gotta touch flesh
ill tell you where the pain is
it  in the people who get hurt
the innocent little kid who sits in the dark theater while maloney filth
pours over him
that where the pain is
youre on the right track
youre beginning to look at people
and when you let a little more humanity into your thinking
you might make a damn good justice
but i wont bet on it
youre just being sweet to me because im a woman
do i have any appointments this afternoon
35 miller securi
cancel it
mrs stowe just called
call her back tell her i cant talk to her
and blow your nose please
i dont wanna talk to anybody i gotta work i gotta concentrate
yes sir
he says he doesnt want to
i wouldnt dream of disturbing justice snow
im looking for herbert g maloney
film producer oh
there you are mr maloney
what
a respected colleague of mine
mr justice snow feels that this court
is doing you a great injustice
by not meeting you face-to-face
we ought to hear your voice
bask in your personality
what was the expression he used
oh yes we should touch flesh
mason call the guard
dont go mason
this might be quite educational for all of us
would you care to take the witness stand
mr maloney
going to swear me in
going to lie to me
maybe you better swear me in
i herbert g
maloney do solemnly swear the testimony i am about to give
to be the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help me loomis
let get right to the point mr maloney
are you aware that you broke a law
no maam
you didnt realize that the state of nebraska
has statutes prohibiting pornography
doesnt the first amendment apply to guys like me
isnt it an umbrella that supposed to keep all of us from getting wet
or is there a hole in it over nebraska
but the people of nebraska have the freedom
to protect themselves against your abuse of their freedom
that what this case is all about
look lady im a businessman
a n d i dont see where the government got any business
telling me how to run my business
oh im relieved
for a while i thought you might be thinking of yourself as an artist
i do recall the word art
plastered across your film
tell me mr maloney
do you honestly believe
the naked nymphomaniac is art
sure why not who to say it isnt what art anyway
artists dont even know let alone lawyers
exactly what was your motivation
in filming the naked nymphomaniac
money
you cant have much pursuit of happiness in this country
unless you pursue a little money
anything unconstitutional about that
does the constitution give you the right to do anything for money
does it give you the right to shove me into bankruptcy
the lawmakers of nebraska want to stop the pollution
of the minds and morals of the public
by films like yours
my colleague on this bench mr justice snow
fine man know him very well
he feels very strongly about profit-pursuing
conglomerates which pollute the air
air is different youve got to breathe
you dont have to go to the movies
state and local governments have a right to set community standards
people can say i dont want this kind of thing in my neighborhood
is it okay for people to say
we dont want any baptists in our neighborhood damn it
your film it called an exploitation film is that correct
right and youre keeping me from exploiting it
arent you exploiting women
the act of love
giving a distorted picture of sex to young people
who am i hurting
im not talking about bodily harm
has anyone died from seeing the naked nymphomaniac
what about injury to the spirit
doesnt your celluloid poison
attack all human dignity and decency and beauty
i dont think you like my picture
i think somebody had better set some standards
some voice had better say this far and no farther
youre talking like a woman not a justice
you re talking like a justice not a witness sit down maloney
have you been to new york lately
times square 44th 45th street
it used to be a decent place to visit
unforgettable music powerful plays
today right around the corner on 8th avenue
your picture probably playing
alongside a lot of other pornography and filth
watch out lady
scratch me put me out of business and who else gets scratched
the same end of the eraser can wipe out
your unforgettable music and your powerful plays
youre sharp maloney
you pull every sleeve inside out
you want the liberty to dirty up my liberty
my security against
the profiteering two-legged cockroaches of this world
my right to live in a sweet and decent
society and not some kind of sewer
even in new york you have to clean up
after your dog shits on the sidewalk
and it a perversion of the constitution
to shove our faces into excrement
masquerading as art
im glad i met you mr maloney
i feel i have a much better understanding of you
and justice snow
he may want the absolute freedom to go straight to hell
that his right
but he has no right to force the rest of
the country to take the trip with him
you may step down
yeah you make a pretty good trial lawyer
too bad you had to gave it up
you make a very good actor
i may always have the feeling there a
pornographic producer under your robes
it makes me sick to my stomach
to h ave to defend a principle as noble as the first amendment
on the basis of that can of film you found so offensive
but by god as long as i have tongue and tonsils
and the ability to talk ill defend everybody right to speak
and every man right to be wrong
i yield to you as the authority on that mr justice
she dangerous
that woman is positively dangerous
the men on this court have got to stick together mason
after all there are only eight of us left
against all of her
should we smile a little
good god no who would trust a happy justice
should the lady be standing while the five of us are sitting
this is where the newest member of the court is supposed to be i think
ready everybody
now please dont look directly into the camera
and i think if you seem to be looking out into space
into the future
i cant see that far i didnt bring my glasses
youll need more than glasses
my wife always hates these pictures she says we all look stuffed
why dont we take a snapshot of our convictions
it would have to be a moving picture if convictions mean anything
my convictions dont move
neither did the dinosaurs
come on tear that one up
yes mr chief justice
would somebody suggest to our great dissenter
that he curb his celebrated sense of humor
he ll need all his wits to keep on
writing minority opinions
well a man got to decide whether to
be on the right side or the winning side
once in a while they are the same
this court isnt going to reverse the seventh circuit on omnitech
dan we sure as hell wont if we dont even hear it
come on gentlemen hold that for the conference room
you can wreck the whole business establishment
mr justice snow
with your damn socialist ideas
im about as much of a socialist as donald duck and you know it
you brainwashed brahman
come on come on harold sit down
come on now dan behave yourself
here we go
destroy that negative
yes sir
harold try to remember what you did with your face last year
you looked pretty good
i did
just look trustworthy
somebody in washington better look that way
is justice snow implying
that no body in this city or this country is honest except him
oh to hell with the picture
cj dan where are you going weve got to finish this
paste me in from last year
cj all right richard well try again tomorrow
richard yes sir
it been a pleasure
good afternoon sir
where are you going not to europe again
much farther than that
the virgin
yes you can take those two ill bring these myself
i thought id be gone before you came home
usually that not very difficult
i left a note for you on the dining room table
i dont want to read any notes
then you can talk it over with my lawyers
they thought that would avoid any unnecessary unpleasantness
what so pleasant about talking to lawyers
what the hell is happening around here
maybe the court can stand your bad temper but i cant
what do you mean bad temper
god damn it
im the sweetesttempered son of a bitch in the district of columbia
sit down
why should i sit down
what the hell are you doing
describe the wallpaper what wallpaper
in this room
wallpaper
what color is it
what design who memorizes wallpaper
you cant memorize what you dont ever see
good-bye dan
door slamming shut
pink roses and butterflies for christ sake
ruth how does the great dissenter
feel about our playing tennis together every week
im not sure i havent told him yet
well i must say dan snow has done a lot for my game
every time i get a high one i can really kill
that not you on the other side of the net
that why they go by me so fast laughs
go change ill give you a lift to mount olympus
how do you stand his moods mason
every time i see him he ready to explode
does he ever just relax
yeah he does have strong feelings
same as you do
i hope youre not implying that he and i are alike
no no no i just mean that you have similar differences
you both care about things
nothing unimportant
whether youre making a point on the bench
or on the tennis court
does justice snow ever talk about me
oh all the time
anything quotable
well
both laughing
i withdraw the question
hearsay evidence
inadmissible
morning
youre not a double agent are you mason
no sir
we just get in a set of tennis about once a week before breakfast
she plays very well for a justice of the supreme court
she got a hell of a backhand sir
yeah i know ive seen it work
when we found out we were both tennis players
well i hope you dont mind sir
hell no
go ahead
wear her out
yes sir
door slamming shut
justices chattering why are you trying to persuade me
you know i wont vote to hear it
all right all right
well table this one
why not table everything
dan oh no abbot vs omnitech
all groaning
i think putting omnitechon the calendar
is an exercise in futility
right oh is it
perhaps if we stopped recruiting judges
from the jungles of orange county
maybe we can get a 4-5 court turned into a 5-4 court
im so sick and tired of being on the short end of the vote all the time
that what were trying to save you from dan
well i dont want to be saved
i want to keep right on going straight to hell
what omnitechdone
that what these little stockholders are trying to find out
but dan the momentum engine doesnt work
that what omnitech says
what about these experts who say otherwise
but well never know will we
because donald richards chairman of omnitech
has bought up all the patents and buried them
this action is against omnitech not donald richards
donald richards is omnitech for christ sake
where the hell is he and why has he disappeared
immaterial
i dont see any new constitutional grounds
for us to review omnitech
if we dont hear it who in the hell will
this is the last goddamn stop lady
why does brother snow insist on wasting the court valuable time
because i smell plenty of unrefrigerated fish here
muckraking that all it is dan
do you like being screwed
because that what donald richards is doing you know
screwing you and me and the whole country
you re a troublemaker you know that
yes i know that but somebody has to be cj
move up omnitech
good morning mr justice snow
morning
what makes you think it going to rain
the newspaper said there an 80 % chance of rain or snow
what do they know
theyre wrong 80 % of the time
that was our floor
yes why didnt you get out
i thought youd go first
how would you like to take a little trip with me
that what we seem to be doing
ever been to the smithsonian
not lately
understand i wouldnt dream of trying to change your mind for the world
but there something at the smithsonian i think you ought to look at
some early american pornography
good morning mr justice
good morning morning
what have you got in the briefcase harold
dirty books
what i want you to see at the smithsonian
isnt even vaguely offensive to the public sensibility
what time
make it 35
well take my car
what time does the smithsonian close
this wont take long
why dont we take my car
it has a top
well i guess the paper was right about the rain
first time theyve been right in 20 years
l ady what you are about to see is a revolution
nonviolent i hope
this is it
spin it go ahead
go ahead give it a spin it wont hurt you
that is a momentum engine
it a model of course a prototype
imagine a flywheel 20 times heavier
revolving 000 times faster in a sealed vacuum
this could revolutionize the entire auto industry
w e could have cars without gas tanks
because they wouldnt need gas to run
this is what omnitech bought and buried
if you want to change my vote on omnitech no thank you
im trying to change dead words on a page
into a visual image to clarify in your mind
dont treat me like a first-year law student
im just trying to youre trying to change my mind
im trying to help you change your mind all by yourself
that machine is a dandy idea and it just doesnt work
it never been given a chance to work
it been squashed
would you go to all this trouble if i were a man
one of the brothers
sex has nothing to do with it
becaus e im a woman
your resplendent male ego wants to win me over
jefferson said an educated electorate is the basis
youre an arrogant self-centered male chauvinist pig
youre just being sweet to me because im a man
i only wanted you to see with your own eyes
that gasoline isnt the only way to store energy
engine wheezing
w e ll dont expect me to believe
that alice in wonderland whirligig could run a car
engine wheezing
having trouble are you
excuse me
finally got the auto club
may be a while
we could take a cab if we could get a cab
have you eaten anything
no i just got in here same as you
i meant today
oh today well i um
im not sure i dont keep track
do you know what that do es to your blood sugar what do you care
a person cant make valid judgments with low blood sugar
is that any place in the constitution
well good evening
im not hungry just bring me a cup of coffee
i think you are hungry and you just dont know it
im not hungry and i know it
ill order something for you
speaking cantonese
youre not telling her to put poison in my food are you
i dont know how to say poison
continues in cantonese
i appreciate your concern about my insides
do me a favor will you put your hand over your eyes
why
a test
what on the wall wallpaper
uh what color
gold any pattern
yes what is it
cherry blossoms with bluebirds
how the hell did you know that
i saw it when we came in
you go around looking at wallpaper everyplace
my god that what wrong with you
your brains are full of wallpaper
w e ll your brain is full of
watch that watch
people people here
i was going to say momentum engines and omnitech
omnitechmay be the most importance case of this decade
when one tiny group of stockholders tries to
undermine a great corporation
big huge not necessarily great
how come the president of omnitech didnt show up at his own trial
don richards doesnt want the courts to put him out of business
rule against omnitech and down goes the whole corporate system
only the abuses
in your isolated opinion
not so isolated w e have statutes that define the abuses
if we try to extend our jurisdiction all im asking is what fair
into legislative area
dont you see omnitech must win
oh you think that do you y es
well it seems to me anything can happen no matter how great the odds
that what makes this country so wonderful
i absolutely agree with you
but do you know what i believe more than anything else
you said it on the bench
you said the noblest purpose of this high court
is to keep the government off the backs of the people
people yes not the large
arent corporations people
owned by people run by people not the large
not the large for the benefit of people
not the large
and they may be destroyed by people
on the high court who seem to have
forgotten some of their earlier and wiser opinions
ah the hell with this
you havent eaten your dim sum
to hell with my dim sum
what about your blood sugar
to hell with my blood sugar
all i wanted anyhow was a cup of coffee and a fork
is something wrong sir yes everything
give me a check
i ll take the check
yes you do that youll feel much better about it
and dont worry about me ill be just fine ill take a cab
good
it nothing personal
he just very upset
he been working too hard
i dont have any money for a cab
good night madam justice
would you see that these are delivered to justice snow in the morning
justice snow still here
i dont think so
he  in the court maam
this late
and it is maam
okay thank you
how long have you been here
since october
im not sure the lady has enough seniority
to haunt these chambers at uh
20 in the morning
what the hell are you doing here so late
studying for finals
what about you
well i used to think i lived in georgetown
but i guess this is more my permanent residence
i brought you these a few opinions of mine from the lower court
ill read them thank you
youre welcome
may i ask you a question
sure
other than my blood sugar
and my bad table manners
exactly how repulsive do you think i am
do you want my opinion as a justice of the supreme court
no no no
as a woman
you want to take the fifth
maybe one of us had better
my car runs now
would you like a lift home
no
pretty cool around the snow household these days
i heard that
im sorry
it your fault you know
my fault
i think my wife thinks that i spend so
much time being furious at you that i dont
have enough energy left to be furious with her
and i have a hunch
she thinks i consider you attractive
there certainly no evidence to support that contention
oh i wouldnt be too sure about that
i hope you assured mrs snow that the mere fact one of your
colleagues happens to be a woman
that no mere fact
that an overwhelming fact
but ive never been prejudiced by sex
entertained yes prejudiced never
yes yes yes
this is a dandy i remember it well
i dont agree with a word of it but it well-written
how can you be so goddamned logical
and so goddamned wrong
what so wrong about encouraging the economy
ive heard you talk over and over again
about improving the quality of life on this planet
and i agree with you dan
justice snow
dan is fine
look what these great companies have done for us
large companies
large large
are we going to throw those benefits away
should i take my weekly wash down
to the banks of the potomac river and
and beat it with rocks
wont get it very clean
if we reverse the seventh circuit on omnitech
if it so damn important
why doesnt donald richards stand trial
what do you want to know
youre not donald richards
and he the one with the answers
swear me in
oh you want to play that game again
all right youre sworn
i am delighted mr donald richards
to have you here at last
in the flesh so to speak
would you state your occupation please
im president and chairman of the board of omnitech international
why did you refuse to testify in the suit against your company
i never received a subpoena
they have to know where you are to serve it
but you deliberately made yourself unavailable remained in hiding
doesnt an american citizen
have a right to privacy
tell me something sir
ill bet you have a share or two of stock in omnitech
im the majority stockholder
yes i kind of thought you were
now what about all those little stockholders
who got wind of the appalling notion
that you mr richards grabbed up an earthshaking idea and strangled it
you know what i find appalling
that you have the arrogance to pass
judgment on something you dont know anything about
bu t you do mr richards
when we test something like the momentum engine
and we find out it doesnt work
we drop it and spend our time and money on something that will work
what about the experts who say it does work
you think i would deliberately dump an idea
that could make millions for my stockholders
but youve got billions committed
to the internal combustion engine
omnitech makes spark plugs you wanna go on making spark plugs
there money in carburetors you wanna go on making carburetors
youve got vested interests in 6 oil companies
you wanna go on selling gas
you have one noble purpose mr
richards to keep things the way they are
an idea doesnt just turn into a reality
something gotta make it happen
it takes money to build factories
grind out a product advertise it sell it
did you ever hear of a box of cereal
or a tube of toothpaste going out and giving birth to itself
do you know what it takes
capital capital youre damn right
and im not going to commit my corporation
to the expenditure of millions of dollars on an idea
that just doesnt work
that you say doesnt work
look
thomas edison dreamed up the electric light bulb
the government gave him a patent
so that he could profit from his invention
fine but the light itself belongs to everybody
and nobody nobody has a right
to turn on the darkness
you dare accuse me my company my companies of practices
that belong in the dark ages
then let there be light
come out of the dark donald richards
who are you
what do you look like where have you been
holy christ
you know what i think i think youre dead donald richards
i think youve been dead for a long time 8 maybe 0 years
it  been that long since anyone has seen you
and if you are dead who is running omnitech
who actually holds all that power
some cabal of faceless men
without names without fingerprints
without social security numbers
who are compounding your suppression of the momentum engine
by hiding behind a dead man
why would anybody want to do that
hell of a lot of reasons dodge inheritance taxes
avoid a power struggle
hang on to government contracts
omnitech is a phantom government hiding behind a dead man
we cant see it we didnt elect it
it doesnt exist it never dies
why dont we hoist up a new flag
the star-spangled omnitech
omnitech rules the waves
omnitech about everything
voice echoing
ugh
ugh
oh
dan are you all right
yeah sure it was a lot of fun
i enjoyed it
siren wailing
attendant one
two

the other night
you made an outrageous statement
you said you didnt think donald richards was still alive
i got this out of a sealed loomis and loomis file in santa ana
it donald richards death certificate
holy god

this makes omnitecha whole new ballgame
god are we going to shake up the brothers
get your clothes on
w e can still make that morning conference

i told you
im resigning from the court
that idiotic it doesnt make any sense
my husband knew
jack knew that donald richards died in costa rica in 973
and he was part of the conspiracy to cover it up
did you know
did your husband ever tell you anything about it
no of course not
then there no reason to resign
get some clothes on let get down there
if there the slightest doubt in anybody mind that i belong there
i dont want to be there
lady that is extremely noble
but goddamned wrong
what do you think i should do dan what protocol
should i write the president
you dont write anybody keep your robes on
let the mud fly it wont stick to you
quitting the court without good reason
is spitting in the face of the government that put you there
without good reason ive got good reason
because of something your husband did that you know nothing about
when youre married to somebody you become
youre a member of the high court
you dont dissociate yourself from somebody that youre married to
by god something happens
in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
this corrupt ion shall put on incorruption
st paul vs the corinthians
etal
interesting case
but what if an incorrupt person finds out that she corrupt
that applesauce and you know it
i thought youd be happy to have me off the court
that was before you were on the court
i never thought id ever kiss a supreme court justice
you didnt kiss me i kissed you
make you a deal
you dont resign i dont die
let me think about that
dont we want the working entrance
not this morning right up the front steps
cant wait to get into that conference room
you really think we can go in there and i can pick up where i left off
hell no every day is different
