off the roofs at me
im even shot at on two separate
occasions by my own men

as my own goddamn wife and her
goddamn road maps and her wrong turns
and her goddamn
hysterical screaming and her
watch your language
you watch your heart too
you know what dr springer said
dr springer can take his stethoscope
and shove it
into his little black bag sideways

like when sailors spot a bird at sea
and know theyre near land

what do we do now
we walk baby
you know marlon perkins says that
rattlesnakes can reach lengths of 20 feet
and can kill you in eight minutes
then you better not shoot
until you see the whites of their fangs son
or was it eight feet and 20 minutes
oh ma
thank goodness
the boys at the precinct
presented me with this howitzer
when i retired
sure wouldnt want to go looking
for those pythons without it
if it all the same to you bob carter
ill put my faith in the good lord
and a little gunpowder
rather than coyotes and rattlesnakes
this place must be crawling with them
well katy taking this all calmly
you ok
i hate it out here
it just uncomfortable that all
it more than uncomfortable
lynne honey
would you get rne my jacket please

these hills are full of iron
and if that the case youre not
going to get a radio signal past them
would you hold this please
im going to head north
something on the map that looks like
a military installation here

we only have two guns and i think
one of them ought to stay with you guys
all right doug you walk out
six or seven miles and get back

service station and
you cant get there
and back before dark

back in 29
this place was spanking new
and me and my wife martha
had a little baby girl
so pretty and good
we couldnt believe
and another kid on the way
but when martha had this one
something went wrong
this thing she give me
something happened
he was so big
he came out sideways
and almost tore poor martha apart
he weighed 20 pounds
and was hairy as a monkey
when he was 0 years old
he was big as i was
accidents were happening all the time
dogs falling in the well
i even found chickens
with their heads bit off
then in august of 39
i was in town getting supplies
and the whole damn house
burned to the ground
my little baby girl was a cinder
when i found her
but this monster kid
wasnt even singed
i knew hed done it
i hit him with a tyre iron
and i split his face wide open
how bad was it
i thought id killed him
i was afraid theyd come
and take me away
so i took him out in the desert
and i left him there
i figured if he wasnt dead
he couldnt live more than two hours
out there in that heat
then it would all be over with
and you think his ghost
is still trying to track you
that was a long time ago
long enough for him to steal
a whore that nobody would miss
long enough to raise a passel
of wild kids
long enough for a devil kid
to grow up to be a devil man
what the hell is this
that just some stuff that i
you want some cheese on this
there plenty left
i dont want anything
what the matter
dont you feel well
