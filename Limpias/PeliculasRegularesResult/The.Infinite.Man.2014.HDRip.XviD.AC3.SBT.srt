voice  i know youre
here with someone else
but does he make you happy
does he know
about your interests
i mean does he
really know about them
does he spend weeks raising
a boat from the ocean floor
just for your viewing pleasure
thought it might
make a good photo
does he pay someone
to release a watch of
nightingales
at just the right moment
what wrong
nothing
rusty
release the birds
does he know neurochemically
how to make you happy
you have modulation of
sensory
activation of limbic
system
increased oxytocin
moaning
orgasm is achieved
moaning
i know how to make you happy
if we were here together
i would do all these
things and we would be happy
am i crazy to think
we would be happy
the infinite man
watch beeping
what
didnt you call ahead
there was no answer
well this would be why
i dont believe it
at this time last year we were
playing musical
instruments over there
fine dining in there
adult activities upstairs
i didnt know they closed down
i am so sorry i am stupid
look it doesnt matter
let go to the beach instead
the beach i had a dream
about the beach last night
great maybe it a sign
no we cant ive drawn up ths
schedule based on last year
you see this was perfect
it was it was also
a year ago and things change
motels shut down
and people move on
i hold in my hands the
blueprint to a perfect weekend
and if we stayif we
follow this very precisely
then
that why were dressed
in the same clothes as last
year
i love you in that dress
i guess it a controllable
variable
i am taking this stuff to the
i am taking these clothes off
i am driving to the beach
and i am going for a swim
lana please i mean surely
a
a deep tissue massage
is preferable to fighting
oh were not fighting
are we not massaging
no no because i didnt
come all the way out here
just to do exactly what
we did on our last anniversary
no of course not
it nuts
it is youre absolutely
right
im sorry
it okay
you feel tense
yeah it just

upstairs with these babies and
some fractionated coconut oil
massaging not masturbating
lana welcome
glad you came back
i think it scrubs up ok
ive bypassed the
main switch board
i found the mattress next door
those sheets arent washed
dont touch those sheets
andthe beach
so
now i had planned
a musical celebration
of your dutch ancestry
forabout now but
tears paper
you do not have to do that
dont worry i have copies
it a symbolic gesture
the point is we can do
whatever you like
i dont knowsurprise me
playing accordion
my love dutch klompens
should the bass line seize you
bottle popping
eat eat
the menu might be a year old
but the food certainly isnt
laughter
except for the dolmades
but they last forever
sprays mouth
lana
yea
sexual congress in five
for our last
anniversary i spent months
studying the blue arts
at least in erotica
tantric techniques
the viennese oyster
oh depressed elephant
i couldnt wait to try it
on someone other than myself
but when the
moment finally arrived i
well i achieved
cosmic consciousness
faster than i would have liked
your cosmic
consciousness was just fine
it could have been
more tantric that all
yes
what this
thisthis is more
stimulating than tantra
well happy anniversary
indeed
something ive been
developing at the lab
it is an external limbic system
so this moment in
time will be encoded in here
and stored
in here
and this is stimulating
intellectually yes
the hope is
that we can retrieve this moment
with complete accuracy
every detail every sensation
we can return to this moment
in time over and over
and over
this is your anniversary
present
wow
i got you a bunsen burner
car pulling up
horn honking
terry
terry
no
you really need to tell him
it over youve broken up
what are you doing here
terry
i thought you should know
that you left some
washing on your line
you drove
three hours to tell me that
i submit these
somebody could
have stolen them
hey
did she tell you that i threw
javelin at the olympics
yea i upset the establishment
with my politics
and my drug taking
when they came to
take my medals from me
i threw them like a
javelinoff the balcony
the officials got the medals
this has to stop terry
we broke up four years ago
yeah well now i am back
inaudible chatter

every time every time he ruins
it
it a long drive maybe he jt
needs to stretch his legs
then hell leave
what is he getting from the
car
his javelin
this is too much
and a pack of condoms
and some kind of cattle prod
what kind of stretch is this
hey lana

bifurcated dildo
or should i grab one from the
car
that was for him not for
okay that it
terry terry no

holiday
zapping sound
silence

old room thinking about stuff
trying to keep busy
i dont believe i am a jealous
manbut i have been thinking
about you and him
and yourposition
i know i drove you away
but ive been building
something
i had some things
setup from the lab
and ive been working on
something that i think
might take us back
to how things were
i think we should give
it one more go please
things will be different this
time
look no need to say anything
just give me a sign
dial tone
identifying instability
in a closed loop circuit
short the voltage source
open the loop in the fourth
pass
then apply a test signal
and observe the gain
and phase around the loop
make sure the voltage source

then you called me a whore
sounds better in french
and all dutch folk
dancing in the world

i did nothing but watch us
you watched us for a year
but we wontwe wont stay
here for a year i mean
we cant
we did it
we were heretogether
we were happy
why would you
want to change that
i dont i justi just think
we would be happier
somewhere else
look one year from now
hell finish building the
device
everyone will travel back
and it will be just the two of
us
then we can go
where ever we want
and not have to
worry about these
people
i know you like the beach
just
please trust me to get us
through this i know what to do
ive all ready seen
us do it and it works
and i know in the meantime
we can behappy here
not now
it only one year and
and summer always flies
by so it likenine months
nine to twelve months
twelve months
then we can leave
and what did we do exactly
for the nexttwelve months
do you remember
our first actual date
i do
i was nervous as hell
you were relaxed talkative
then i found your notes
famous quotes current affairs
topics of conversation
art music science
do you remember
everything about that night
everything
in fact i recorded it on tape
i wanted to review it
after the date
and make sure
that i sounded natural
obviously it relies on the
presumption of male
hetrosexual spectatorship
does that make
it a bad painting no
andof course
of course
dean are you okay
fast forwards tape
and of course there george
brock
later i edited the tape
i spliced in a few gags
thing i didnt think of at
the time
getting brock the
basics you might say
laughter
that not my laugh
no it the closest i could
find
you know what this is
what
justone big revision
it an improvement it
not
is this an improvement
i would say so yes
because sometimes it
feelsa little unorthodox
no
this is the modern world
it a modern relationship
what are you doing
going to the bathroom
to see if i can lure
a dean into a cubical
see i would say
that a little unorthodox
unorthodox
i am a man
responding to his environment
have you got lipstick
i dont want to say
that youre living in the past
well obviously
i am living in the past
but i mean
you say you fell disconnected
shhh
maybe that why
you feel disconnected
maybe if you just stop
listening and watching
what about you
well what about me
i see the way you look at him
it the same way i look at
you
exactly
so i do not want
me to look at you
no him
who
dean
are you jealous
should i be
i do not even know
how to answer that
i used to watch us up here
i used to think we were happy
we are happy
we could be happier
why do you
hate yourself so much
are you kidding look at him
sorry just forget about it
tomorrow everything
returns to normal
everyone travels back
and were alone together
we can
go where ever we want
this is the plan
we do not touch a thing
everyone travels back
just like they always have
and then we are alone okay
okay
good okay
happy anniversary
dont worry i am here to help
okay i was in the
bedroom testing the amp

identifying instability
in a closed loop circuit
