it was sort of a
last minute thing

martha car and
you know
hi im gil
andie
nice to meet you
finally
finally right
hello
this is
my friend vicky
vicky this is
my son seth
hi and angie
andie
im sorry
and andie
nice to meet younice to meet you
i was just
saying to vicky
that
your sister
wouldve called
so i was confused
about the car
right martha
offered us the car and
we werent really
expecting to see you
and there was that
email about you
being away on work
all month
we had a
i had a change of plans
well well just get
our stuff together
and get out
of your hair then
youre leaving
yeah we really just
came up for the day
anyway
you sure
yeah we were
just about to
get going
well
we dont wanna
keep you
what youve got some
gig to get back to
in brooklyn
yeah
some something
like that
okay
fucking mess
in the bathroom
you see that
wet towels
all over the floor
you see outside
he doesnt even clean up
he just throws shit
in the general direction
of the trash can
and leaves it there
he didnt even
know my name
he never been
good with names
you dont think
it weird that
my boyfriend who
claims he loves me
hasnt even told
his dad that i exist
that has nothing
to do with you
it just like him to
do something like this
all the time
i dont understand
why cant he be
more like his sister
shed never do this
you think we should
ask him to stay
what
i dont want him to feel
like he being kicked out
because of me
what kicked out
he said he wanted
to go back to the city
you really think
they drove two
and a half hours
just for the day
baby
i know you had
this weekend
all planned
okay and it
really sweet
but your dad here
and ive never met him
and i think
it just weird
to run away
itd be weirder to stay
and hang out with him
and that random woman
how do you know that
did you see
a hint of regret
on his face
when i said
we were leaving
no he wants us to go
so
hope im not
interrupting anything
no not at all
well i was just
thinking that
if you really wanted to
maybe you could
stay for dinner
i mean you probably
want to beat the traffic
and it you know
not a bad idea
but
if you really wanted to
vicky is probably
gonna start cooking
pretty soon
she not
exactly a
well let just say
the kitchen
not her forte
but
um
i think it sounds great
we havent eaten
yeah it sounds great

really happy
to hear that
so in about
an hour or so

i have all these photos
on my computer
i cant get them off
im at my wit end
you think you
could help me maybe
hey
no it a fine time
yeah
why is he doing that
because it will
all be resolved
in arbitration
ive already
told him that
that is
really embarrassing
when it happens in public
it a no brainer
was that um an opera
yeah it that song
from pagliacci
yeah
it his favorite show
we used to go
whenever there was
a production
you never told me that
yup no forget
the depositions
whatre you gonna do
youd have to
so youre
a tech genius
no i i
ive just been
helping a friend
build a studio
so a lot of plugging wires
into the wrong sockets
yeah yeah okay
bye
apparently ben threatened
to bring this before a judge
do you believe that
this is really good
thank you so much
for cooking it all
really greatno it nothing
you guys
you wanna be certain
people like your food
add a lot of butter
there butter in here
seth it not
it not a big deal
what
youre a vegan
it okay
what the problem
i put butter in it
so what
it an animal
product gil
it not an animal
i thought
he said vegetarian
what the hell
is the difference
well it not
a problem though
what are
you gonna eat
just pass me
the salad
yeah
seth i thought you
said you ate fish
no actually
i turned veganthanks
what do you mean
you turned vegan
that means
i dont eat this
all right
seth i would offer
you some wine
but there are
little bacteria in here
that ferment the grapes
so you probably
dont wanna kill them
gilwell i dont know

thanks honeythank you
im sorryit okay
yeah
okay
here you go thanks
seth maybe

im getting someone
in to fix it
that is a 7th
century restoration
anyone up for
a game of scrabble
any takers
im pretty good
im actually
pretty tired
i think im just
going to sleep
im sorry he
pulled that shit
what shit
there is no reason
for him to act that way
he not a teenager
sometimes
people get stuck
in patterns
i mean who
behaves like that
youre right babe
why did you have
to put butter in
their food anyway
are you kidding meno im not kidding
we could have avoided
the whole thing with them
how was i supposed
to know they
didnt eat butter
because i told youyou said vegetarian
what the hell
is the difference
and you could have
consulted me
before you invited
them to stay
in the first place
it one night baby
well ive had
a wonderful evening
but this wasnt it
yeah exactly
i dont know
i mean

i totally understand
i gotta i gotta go

talk to him
this afternoon
he called when
you were in the bathroom

we were going to leave

no it fine
there is no sense
in all of us leaving
you stay
enjoy the weekend
it supposed
to be beautiful
i dont want to have
this discussion right now
it easier for
everybody if you dont
you never even tried
avoidance isnt trying

if you guys really
have to leave so soon
yeah
well
we actually managed
to get tickets to um
don giovanni tonight
city opera
and it supposed
to be great so
i just found
the canoes
the kayaks

you are like
the kayak master

he loves it
he talks about it
all the time
that youre the only one
that knows how to do
an alaskan roll
alaska roll is sushi
an eskimo roll
yeah yeah yeah
it been a while
maybe you can stick around
and just give a hand
ive never done it before
and since youre the master

of prospect park
this landscape
architect
it the same guy
that works for prospect park
he the same guy
the clintons use
on their property
in chappaqua
he costs a fortune
doesnt listen to
a word you say
you dont like use some
like local high school
kids to help you
take care
of the place
i dont know
i thought
yeah
wow i dont remember
getting high like this
what it like
a lot of things
going on
a lot of things
happening
i just used to remember
it being so mellow
you seem
pretty mellow
yeah but everything
is so intense
it like you can
see every leaf
on every one
of those trees
moving individually
i mean look at that
how many leaves do you
think are on that tree
i i dont know
00000 leaves
is that your is that
your final answer well it just a guess
well youre
it very precise
a real man of science
i just cant
believe that you
you own all of this
yeah
right
like all of this
it likeyou ever been
up here before
no
no way
this is like
a really big deal
for him
you know
bringing me up
here you know
i think he thinks of it
like it the place
he got to be
with you you know
yeah i doubt that
he spent most
of the time we
were here hiding
from me in that
tree fort of his
i was just beginning to
feel like i got all the
grime off from the lake
okay you think it okay

through all that brush
to get up here
i dont understand
what youre afraid of

bed bugs
so are you
supposed to lie
if i ask you about those
people who showed up

is the house already sold

you were gonna act
with such neglect
neglectyeah
i see i see
he is the little boy
and im the
neglectful father
i get it
you know what
come to think of it
im not surprised that
you took his side
really and what
side is that gil
and what side is that gil
enough with the questions
you know what
you are right
im just gonna sit here
and enable you
to transfer responsibility
onto everybody else
but yourself
all right
with the analysis
it ridiculous
he not 2 years old
he is an adult
we are both adultsno you are the father
gil act like it
i made an appointment
what
when why would
you do that
without talking to me
im talking to you now

and made that decision
somebody had to
can we not
talk about this
right now
here in the middle
of all this
there is
no more time gil
time up
honestly i dont know
if i can
take care of
any more people
baby we will take care
of everyone together

like how you
took care of me
in the kayak
or how you took
care of seth
when he was a kid
up in the tree house
sethhe almost got pneumonia
he gave you the
tree fort story
with the flu and the
yeah that a classic
and you fell for it
im sure
i wanna do this with you
and i know you
wanna do it with me
so why are you
so worried
cause i dont wanna
end up like this
like whatlike you and seth
it not one of
those decisions
you can just make and
change your mind later
im not changing my mind
no one changing
his mind
you sureim sure
you know
he used to sit there
on that rock
when he was a kid
for hours practicing
and if he even thought
you might be listening
he would stop immediately
and wait for me to walk away
i dont need another
screwed up family

so what on the menu
um a few things actually
this is a lentil dal
indian kind of thing
and then
so
what on the menu
there a lentil
tomato thing there
then there
some greens
your work now is gonna be
this ratatouille inspired
vegetable thing
that what im making
youre just grilling
the vegetables
ill add them later but
it better when you grill
the vegetables first
did you learn all this
at those restaurants
you worked at
yeah
did you like it
i hated it it was awful
i can imagine
well it a good thing
you dont have to
do that anymore
i do
every now and then
i just pick up a shift
when im a little short
seth i must say
im impressed
and gil and gil
i hope you realize
that organic quinoa
sauted tofu corn cilantro
no animals no additives
it one of seth
signature dishes
i know
i helped him make it
we didnt tell you
we put extra butter in yours
just for you
im sorry all right
im sorry
im sorry
ill get that
i have
a question
um what derby
you guys kept saying derby
we were on the
housatonic was it
class four water
class two at most
it was big
wherever it was
seth did a roll
and he came out of it
and then i did a roll
then he did a roll
then i did a roll
and then at some point
seth said it like
a roller derby
and now that
what you say when you
come out of a roll
derby
drove my sister nutsshe was just jealous
of the boys
here we gono you know
it interesting
i was reading
an article
and this evolutionary
biologist had this theory
about why men
are generally
drawn to sports more
the biology articles
that he reads
are in maxim
no but it
interestingwhat did it say
the article was saying that
there a difference
in the evolution of the
male and the female brain
basically dating
back to like hunter
and gatherer times
and men were drawn
more to activities
that allowed them to
exercise their judgment
of spatial dynamics
like throwing a spear at
a buffalo or whatever
throwing a pass
to a wide receiver
they had to judge
all these different
spaces and times
and hit a moving
target just right
and so women
are really good at
finding the tomato
in the refrigerator
because were gatherers
makes perfect sense
there might be some
basis to the fact
that our brains
are different
just because all men
seem to think that way
no seth is this true
seth claims women
dont know how to
step out of the wind
what did you claimi didnt
claim anything
honey
yeah maybe you should put
that in one of your songs
you know i saw you
down there today
you should play them
your new song
it it really good
i havent performed
that one yet
yeah but itll be
the perfect opportunity
yeah well after dinner
if youre up for it
maybe we can get
a private concert
i dont know i mean
i only have a guitar
and it isnt
it not
i read that review
of yours in the voice
you didyeah your dad
showed it to me
it was a well
written review
he was like a little boy
showing off his report card
okay now when
i get back tomorrow
i will take you over
there and you can
pick out a new one
any one you want
all right
all right it getting
past your bedtime now
so here your mom

wide open spaces
sort of
make me nervous
the city just tricks
you into feeling like
youre not alone
i dont think
youre alone
what do you want
what do you mean
is this some sort
of exchange
where you let him
fuck you and he helps
provide for your kid
fuck

smells like wine
i can have a glass
of wine if i want gil

ill take my chances
you know what works
really well
standing next
to a womanwhat
i dont

but their blood is
different or something
but women are like fly paper
did you ever notice that
i dont know
every time im with andie
she complains
about getting bitten

im by myself
pretty soon thatll
be the only advantage to
a heterosexual relationship
i like andie by the way
a lot
me too
you like vicky
yeah
but
nothing
were thinking
of getting married
really
it a 97 barolo
by the way
how old is the kid

who is the father
not me some doctor
i dont know who
you wouldnt know him
you like himthe kid
he a nice kid
congratulations
so where is
he this weekend
jake is with his dad
that crazy
i mean it not
crazy but it just
you know i i never
would have guessed
well
i had him when i
was younger than you
would it be okay
is it is it weird if
i asked you what happened
with your marriage or
no
what happened
what didnt happen
you want my professional
or my personal opinion
i want professional
okay um
where do i start
michael and i
we were
madly in love
we thought that that
meant we were strong
and we decided
to have a child
and it the most
amazing thing
starting a family
but you have to create space
like literally
create space
so all of a sudden there
this little person and he
sleeping in bed with you
it like adding
another lover
sounds like seth dream
hey there
it can be
there just so much
that changes that you
could not predict
before you have kids
you know like
you cant give each other
the same amount of love
it weird like your
love gets divided
we werent
prepared for that
and i think we just
couldnt accept that
there was some part
of our relationship
that died
and then resentment
sets in and
you get the picture
wow
that your
professional opinion
that my
professional opinion
what your
personal opinionhe was an asshole
no im serious
it was like one morning
he just rolls over
and says i dont think
i am ready for this
for whatexactly like
we already have a son
you know what there
to be ready for
sorry
i didnt mean tono
youre not the
jerk that left
is that why you went
for like an older guy
because hed already
been through his
mid-life crisis
i guess i am his
mid-life crisis
what comes after
the crisisno i i
i hadnt thought
of it that way
see this is
youre selling the house
so you can take care
of vicky and the kid
not that simple
long vacations
pay for tennis lessons
you never cash
the checks i send you
i dont need
your money
you didnt seem to
mind taking it to
pay for college
so this is how you
try to make up for it
make up for what
how things went with
your first family
why would you say
something like that to me
what do you
want me to say
you sound just like
your mother
god i am so sick
and tired of being
criticized judged
i just want to enjoy
the rest of my life
did it ever occur to you
you might be happy for me
there wasnt room for
everyone in that family
im different with vicky
i can
relax
actually feel good
she listens to me
there isnt a whole
life of mistakes
and guilt between us
why do we have
to talk about this
we were having
such a nice time
do you realize
this is the most
weve ever talked
well maybe there is
a reason for that
when you have kids
you will understand
understand what
you cant talk
about everything
no
you know
if i ever i had kids
i was going to turn
this into a hockey rink
in the winters
that would have been
a good idea
you said this would
always be here
i know that was
a long time ago
things change
i have other people
to think about now
do you ever think there
a difference between
not saying something
because there
nothing to say
and not saying
something because
well there
just too much
god god what what what
what happened what are we
going to do
she saw
somethingwhat did you see

the bear in the
house in the first place

the trash can was
a mess when we got here

the tooth fairy that
left the wet towels
on the bathroom floor
