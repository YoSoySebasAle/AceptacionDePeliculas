of the necessity
of continuing our talk
dear madame

informal party
because he had been of assistance to your illustrious father

to be off women
why do we always
sit in your hall
cause it the best room in the house really

some sort
of celebration going

seven minutes
of attorney/client privilege

ash wrote those
theyre not the originals

oh my god

ive got to think of
a defense for you
theyre practically
love letters
rather racy actually
see ash
supposedly never even looked
at another woman
i mean not even glanced at one
his entire marriage
can you imagine what would happen if i could prove
that mr perfect husband
had this like
shakespearean-type
dark lady thing going
darling the duck done
would you be a sweetheart
and do the sauce
yes yes
duck huh
yeah peking
it from around the corner

would be extraordinary
it would be rewriting
history old chap
yeah it would be
morning
morning
ro-land

discovered 20 times already
i dont think so
surprise me
ash copy of vico
in the london library
it full of his own notes on loose bits of paper all the way through
useful

better have a look

he made a mockery over at sotheby yesterday
£900 for a toothpick
fergus where is fergus
he supposed to be teaching
ill come with you
no need
the novice blunders on the discovery

how many jars
of gooseberry jam
did ash wife ellen
make in 850
hmm this is not
a job for a grown-up
gooseberry
cooking
gooseberry jam
cooking 42
what about a small
informal party
my headache
last night prevented me
from accompanying randolph
to dear crabb-robinson
for a dinner honoring
the poetess christabel lamotte
he was reluctant
to attend without me
but i was persistent
and finally persuaded him
ash do you know
professor spear
im delighted
mrs jameson
mrs jameson
charmed
miss glover
oh miss glover
and miss lamotte
miss lamotte
the highest pleasure
randolph reported the party
went off very well indeed
the discussion of poetry
was animated
with miss lamotte speaking more forcibly than anyone expected
surprises me madame
that a lady who lives as quietly as you do
wouldnt be aware
of my modest success
oh im very aware that the papers herald you weekly
it is you however
who surprise me
and why is that
judging from your work
im surprised youd even
acknowledge my existence
or any woman
for that matter
since you show us such
small regard on the page
you cut me madame
im sorry
i only meant to scratch
hey fergus
ah hello roland
what is it you chaps always say
how it hanging
well we usually just say hey
unless youre gay
oh
listen
let me ask you
something
do you know
a dr maud bailey
maud oh yes
i know maud very well
she teaches gender studies
at lincoln
oh would she
be helpful
im checking out
christabel lamotte
she a poet writing
around about 859
yes yes why would you
be interested in her
oh nothing
it just i had some requests about ellen ash papers
but lamotte name
came up so--
god the keeper
of ellen flame
i mean that the bottom
of the food chain old sport
yeah but i got to stay on the food chain
old sport that why i do it
right well publish or perish
as they say
or in your case
perish or perish
so would she--
this maud bailey person
oh yes but id be careful
if i were you
why what she like
well she thicks
men blood with cold
oh great
or if you prefer the american vernacular
she a regular
ball-breaker
mr michell
what im sorry
roland michell
yes
youre maud
bailey dr bailey yes
there nothing in my index
no mention of ash at all
well ash and lamotte
definitely met
really when
june 859
at a dinner party
given by crabb-robinson
it in his diary
and you jumped from that to the idea that they corresponded
i found an unfinished draft
of a letter in a book--
addressed to lamotte
no just dear madame
but there were three women at crabb-robinson dinner party
and out of the three
it likeliest to be lamotte
so maybe there something
in lamotte letters
there arent many from
the richmond period--
the time youre
interested in
im descended from
christabel actually
im her niece
thrice removed
three grades
that what thrice usually means
oh maybe
i shouldnt have come
it does seem
rather pointless
well i suppose
since youre here
you could have a look
through blanche diary
who blanche
blanche glover
christabel companion
her lover
oh you look surprised
i didnt know she was-didnt know she was a lesbian
no i mean dont get me wrong
i like lesbians
yes well unfortunately
they didnt have
video cameras in those days
so youre out of luck
now i see why you think
it so unlikely
not from that point of view
i mean god she could
have been bisexual
there no evidence she was
but in theory--
did you not do any reading
before you came
is this like an oral exam
yes i suppose it is
i mean you dont know
the first thing about her
and yet you make
these leaps
hey youre the one who called her a lesbian
not me
letters letters letters
not for me
letters i am not meant
to know or see
thank you jane
you do not have to hide them from me
im not hiding them
you say they are not hidden
but they are
tucked away
as if they were from cupid himself
what does he want
to be my friend
friend
they always try and give
what they want a decent name
blanche no
no blanche listen
what we have
is ours
no one can change that
tis already changed
find anything
maybe
so what are
those bookmarks then
blanche writes about letters
letters letters that christabel
wrote and received
and it nearly
drove blanche crazy
where are they
lost destroyed who knows
there lots we havent got
not one of blanche paintings has ever turned up
for instance
so who do you think
wrote the letters
weve never been able
to verify who he was
but ash certainly isnt
one of the candidates
youve got nothing
i mean
it just a thought
of course ive thrown out
a lot of thoughts today
and youve pretty much
shot them all down so--
yes well
it seems like a bit of a wild-goose chase to me
id like to do
some more reading
i suppose youll wish to
stay here overnight then
well i cant really afford
to stay overnight
unless you want me huddled
downstairs in your doorway
i suppose i could put up with you for one evening
couldnt i
no doubt you know
fergus wolfe then
im sorry uh yeah
were in the same department
i imagine that
he told you that were
occasionally
on together
no he didnt
what did he--
did he say anything
about me
uh--
no
right ill use the bathroom first
get out of your way
please
im just sort of a brush and flush kind of guy so--
forget i said that
maud
can i show you something
are these-how did you get-those are the originals
i took them
i sort of stole them took them
where from
the london library
how could you do that
it was on impulse
impulse
right
ive seen that take-what-you-want attitude in other--
what in other americans
god what is it with
you people and americans
look i know that i shouldnt have taken them
i know that
but maud i want to
find out what happened
did he or didnt he
send the letter
you might not buy into
my theory but to me
blanche diary suggests
that it possible
wouldnt someone have unearthed a thing like this
that what makes it so big
potentially so big
well no one has
probably because those were never sent
are you doing your homework
no im just
writing stuff
stuff for me
it nothing
youre a closet poet
uh
more like basement
really
im just uh
just fooling around
is that what you want to be when you grow up
no im gonna be safe and teach like everybody else
besides there no such thing as poets anymore
well poet
do you want to see christabel family home before you go
michell late again
roland asked for
another day off fergus
oh really
where he gone
i didnt ask
and he didnt say
he an american
for god sake
he probably off
trafficking drugs
did his new discovery
lead to anything
ash vico--
are you dreaming
vico no no
this had something to do
with christabel lamotte
he went to see dr bailey
in lincoln-a woman
lamotte hmm no
well it probably came to nothing then
exactly
or he would
have told you
wouldnt he
seal court
over there
so how long did christabel live at this seal court place
ages the last 20
or so years of her life
excuse me
sorry
to a dusty shelf
we aspire
you should drop by seal court
before the train
and what do you do
in london mr michell
are you a teacher as well
no not yet im doing a fellowship
which means what exactly
on the dole
um my field
victorian poetry
we had a sort of poet
in this house once
terrible sentimental stuff
about god and death
and the dew and fairies
why dont you show this young man christabel room maud
and why dont you
stay tonight
youre under no obligation
to stay of course
it just joan way
misses our daughter
quite a drive back actually
no were fine
oh well
hardly ever come up here
with the wheelchair of course
we bunk down on the ground floor
i havent been up here
since i was a child
maud is this the photograph
at your house
yes that
christabel niece may
that my
great-great-grandmother
christabel wrote dozens
of poems about this place
what are
they who haunt our dreams
and weaken our desires
and turn us
from a solid face
and in the depth
of wintery night
they slumber
in the night and bright
dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
no rush of action
this is our doom
to live a long life out
in a dark room
maud
it pretty
incredible huh
fergus it me
i-im out of town tonight

dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
god
i was so sure
sympathy
sympathy
sympathy meaning what
mutual affection
or understanding
favor pity or even accord
but that not it is it
that not it at all
she uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context
like structural support
dolly conceals it
yes but not within
beneath
there a door
there a door
i cant believe it
let me see
be-be careful theyre very precious
ill be very careful
oh god we shouldnt
be doing this
what do you mean
we shouldnt be doing this
whyd you drag me
up here then

let me run downstairs and get some note cards and some pencils
all right
go go hurry
look at this
weve got ash and christabel letters here
look come here
listen what
dear miss lamotte
it was a great pleasure
to talk to you
at dear
crabb-robinson party
may i hope that you too
enjoyed our talk
and may i have the pleasure
of calling on you
she says no
but you may write
would you rather not have a letter
however imperfect
than a plate
of cucumber sandwiches
however exquisitely
fine cut
know you would
and so would i
i was entranced and moved by your brief portrait of your father
i write nonsense
but if you cant write again
you shall have a sober essay
on what you will
yours to command
in some things
where i was born
christabel lamotte
was a small place too
not like this
not bare
a brilliant dusty hutch
of mysteries
a cabinet of curiosities
what did my eyes
first light on
i am a creature of my pen
my pen is
the best part of me
i send you now
two more poems
i eagerly read
your mythic tales of mire
and found them
both charming and sad
your verse is rich
but perhaps the metaphor is richer
dear mr ash
i live circumscribed
and self-communing
it is best so
not like a princess
in the thicket
more like a spider
in her web
inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers
not perceiving the distinction
until too late
thus it is unwise to call
i know you live very quietly
but i could be
very quiet
i only want to discuss
dante and shakespeare
wordsworth and coleridge
and goethe
not forgetting of course
christabel lamotte
and the ambitious
fairy project
oh sir things flicker
and shift
all spangle and sparkle
and flashes
i have sat all this long evening
by my fireside
turning towards
a caving in
the crumbling
of the consumed coals
to where i am leading myself--
to lifeless dust sir
my dear friend--
for i may call myself
a friend may i not
i speak to you as i would
speak to any person
who possesses
my true thoughts
for my true thoughts have spent more time in your company
than in anyone else
these last few weeks
where my thoughts are
there am i in truth
my dear friend
it has been borne in upon me
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation
the world would not look well
upon letters
between a woman living
in shared solitude as i do
and a man
even if that man
were a great poet
and if one is to live
in this way
it is imperative to appear respectable in the eyes of that world
and your wife
it is a sealed pact
it is a chosen way of life in which i have been wondrously happy
and not alone in being so
i have chosen a way
dear friend
i must hold to it
be patient
be generous forgive
may i also request that you return my correspondence to me
in this way
at least our letters will remain together
i have known incandescence
and must decline
to sample it any further
this now goes to the post
forgive its faults
and forgive me christabel
my dear christabel
your letter came as a shock
to me i will confess
i was at first
not only shocked
but angry that
you should write so
as youve asked
about my wife
however i will tell you
i love ellen
but not as i love you
there are good reasons
which i cannot discuss
why my love for you
may not hurt her
i do not feel
i have been
a proper wife
to you randolph
without children
without ever
any kind of physical--
nonsense ellen
nonsense
there are many
types of love
all sorts
and ours
are good between us
it has been
most profound
i must say to you
what is in my mind
i have called you my muse
and so you are
i could call you
with even greater truth
my love
whoa whoa whoa what
what dont do that what
so he sends his response
he sends her more letters
she doesnt answer them
she ignores them
typical
no she-she chose her life
with blanche
it not typical
it remarkable
i shall hope against hope
that this note is the dove
which will return with
the wished-for olive branch
my letters are like noah ravens-they
have sped out across the thames
they have sped out across the thames and yet have not returned
i send this note by hand in the hope that you might receive it
where are the letters
theyre gone
i tore them up
i burned them
and the others
from my desk
the same
i beg for us to be as we were christabel
sweetheart please
this house so happy once
is full of weeping and wailing
and black headaches
i ask myself
to whom i may turn
and think of you
my friend--
the unwitting cause
of all this grief
i shant forget the first
glimpse of your form
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight
i have dreamt nightly
of your face
and walked the landscape
of my life with the rhythms
of your writing
ringing in my ears
i shall never forget
our shining progress
towards one another
never have i felt such a concentration of my entire being
i cannot let you
burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed
you mind reading that last part out one more time
i cannot let you
burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human
can stand in a fire
and not be consumed
that
yeah
thank you and--
and i took your hand
mine rested in yours
with trust and relief
do you have regrets
i should regret venturing out to crabb-robinson party that evening
i should regret it
but i do not
not even in that most sensible corner of my heart
what are we to do
i do not wish to
damage your life
nonetheless i shall be in the church at noon tomorrow
with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers
that you should join me
on a journey to yorkshire
and journey out of time beyond our lives here on earth
this is unbelievable
that was the last one
youre kidding me
no
well did she go with him or not
hands up
you two
what this then
there been no harm done george
how do we know
if harm been done
i think it was very clever
of maud to find your treasure
yes well must
take advice joanie
how long before sir george
takes advice
hell dither around for
a while but not long
blanche diary has nothing
for that period
what about ellen ash
did she keep a journal
yeah in london
but it mostly just boring housewife stuff
god is in the boring housewife stuff
we should check it
bailey here
bailey
is that dr heath
no um im a friend
of maud bailey
i was wondering
is she there
no she isnt could you get off the line
im expecting the doctor
oh um have you seen
roland michell
not since
this morning no
but his work
went well did it
the fairy poem
i havent the foggiest idea
do you mean
christabel lamotte
get off the line
i looked in ellen diary
there nothing
but uh this should
cheer you up
it in her correspondence
im not going to ask
if this is the original
i wouldnt
dear mrs ash
im at present
totally unknown to you
but i have something
to impart to which
closely concerns both of us and is in my case a matter of life and death
may i trespass on your time
and come to see you
you would do wrong to keep this evidence which i send to you now
it is not mine;
it is also not yours
what i say is true and urgent
as you will come to see
yours sincerely
blanche glover
mrs ash
maybe blanche didnt tear the letters but
kept them and showed them to ellen
it all fits beautifully
well perhaps um
both of our departments should work on this together
is that what you want
i dont know do you
no i wanna go after them
i wanna find out what happened
i wanna go to yorkshire and follow their trail
i need to know
i thought you were mad when you
came to lincoln with your stolen letter
now i feel
exactly the same
i havent really thanked you
i mean properly
for all of this
i have difficulty
with compliments and such
giving or receiving
both actually
well i wont tell you
youre amazing-looking then
youre probably sick of hearing it
thank you it--
im the last guy whod act on it
with fergus and all
what does and all mean
nothing
just a little problem
that i have socially
do you take anything for it
it not that kind
of a problem
it just relationships on the whole
theyre not really for me
anyway--
yes
anyway thank you
youre welcome
thank you for agreeing
to meet me professor
well you made me rather curious
drink sir
scotch with
just a dash of soda
sir thank you
uh ill have the same thank you
um i wanted to learn
of the connection
between ash
and christabel lamotte
lamotte and ash
there isnt any
well roland michell
has made a discovery
with a colleague of mine
maud bailey
im sorry
who the hell is roland michell
oh blackadder research assistant
american
blondish well anyway
he seems to know you
and he thinks
it important
and does blackadder agree
i dont believe
he knows anything about it
do you wish to be
lunched separately
respectably
elsewhere from me
i want to be with you
i understood that was
what we had decided
these four weeks
only are ours
but ours alone
oh i uh--
i hope you will
accept this ring
i have brought a ring too
you see
proof of my resolution
you take my breath away
not yet
no not yet
shall we go out
then to explore
there your bathroom
cupboard
your lovely view
and of course the bed
well look
for another hotel
but this is
where ash stayed
then well have
to share a room
i can bring up
a folding bed
for one of you
if that your problem
we work together actually
it not--
we were expecting two rooms
right
im sure it more complicated
than i can imagine
that a lovely brooch
youre wearing miss
i reckon it could be one of
issac greenberg designs
ill uh get the book
and see if i can tell
where did you get this
ive had it for ages
it was in the family dress-up box
dont you see
ash bought the brooch for ellen
the clasped hands
here in whitby we know that
and this for christabel
oh right
so while he was buying this
he said um
yes ill have the eternal embrace for my wife
no he wouldnt have
said anything
he would have just
bought the brooch
christabel
would have seen
it was accepted
between them
are you writing
fiction now
maybe
im having fun
are you
yes i suppose i am
dont grimace when you say it
it more convincing
i suppose
i can be a touch
empirical at times
just a touch
hey you wanna go for a walk or something
i mean
out in the hills
for sure it earlier than the death of victoria albert
probably late 50s
860s maybe
ish
i think were getting
near thomason falls
cropper mentions it--
mortimer cropper
yeah ash biographer
all-purpose asshole
he literally trekked
every step of ash life
he happy to tell you that too
more than happy im sure
you know him huh
that is beautiful
maud what
i think christabel
did come here
listen
three elements combined
to make the fourth
but above the water and the light
together made
a halo
in the darkened cave
that poem dated
859 july
see if there
a cave behind it
that might be all
the proof we need
ah--
i know this is an awfully repressed sort of english thing to say
but what the hell
are you doing
there only one way
to find out
of course we could
have just asked someone
whoo maud maud
i found it
your hands are shaking
are you afraid
no
a little
these are and were there
the garden and the tree
the serpent at its root
the fruit of gold the woman
in the shadow of the boughs
the running water
and the grassy space
they are and were there
i dont mind that
see you could grow
to like ash
yes
he sort of a soft-core
misogynist
why do you always
tie your hair up like that
it has to do
with fergus wolfe mostly
fergus
how to do with fergus
when we met
he drove me mad quoting yeats
who could love you for yourself alone and not your yellow hair
yes
and then i was accused once by my sister feminists at a conference
of dyeing it
to attract men
really
yes
so i shaved it off
all of it
and did he
did who what
fergus love you without your yellow hair
no
we fought about it
we drive each other mad
i dont even like him
but i cant seem to--
freud
on the other side of attraction
lies repulsion
or was that calvin klein
do you believe that
uh i wouldnt know
i dont really
allow myself to do
that ash/christabel
grand passion kind of thing
allow
yeah
jealousy obsession
all that not anymore
youre lucky then
it all gets so--
just such a tangle
it a tangle
most people want
not me though
my antics made a lot
of people unhappy
one horribly so
for me
whenever i feel
anything for anyone i--
i go cold all over
what makes you do that
fear i suppose
fear of being burned up
by love
listen to us
yes arent we just maudlin
maud you should
let your hair out
you should let it breathe
and dont do the ice thing
cause you have nothing
to worry about from me
christabel said
fear all men
well christabel
didnt know me
i dont want to take
anything from you
so then were both
perfectly safe
right
how can we bear it
every day
we will have less
would you rather
have had nothing
no
i thank god that if there had to be a dragon it was you
wait wait
no i was just trying to get out from under the covers
no no
this is-we shouldnt be doing this
it dangerous
well i really-no because i like you
i like you a lot
i just dont want
to blow it here and--
well it doesnt matter
to me honestly
what do you mean
it doesnt matter
sorry i think
were probably just--
in these cramped quarters
it was a mistake
maud maud
i didnt mean that
let not beat
the thing dead
it happened it over
and were adults
speak for yourself
i cant imagine what youre like after you actually sleep with someone
maud i think
that you are very--
you know
no i dont know
so what were friends
now is that it
yeah that a lot
no i agree
it fine
yeah it perfect
anyway were getting
off the track here
we came to investigate
them not us
so what ever happened to blanche
blanche drowned
oh
where was christabel
we dont know where she was
the year before
a bit blank too
you dont know where she was
that entire year
there some speculation
that she went to france
but i have nothing
to support that
okay so
christabel
comes here with ash
and then disappears
on paper at least
yes
and blanche suicides
jesus
what are you doing
it a poem
ive been writing it as ive watched you
youre not pleased with it
on the contrary
i think it perfectly expresses the joy i have felt with you
then why that
these feelings--
i want them to survive
i know i can never
declare all this--
this love
there ive said it
i know it cannot be declared to the world
what i may do is scatter
these words from the train
and hope that
they somehow take root
they will flourish
i swear it
so what next
i mean for you
i suppose ill check
through the archives
and see if there any clue at all where
christabel might have been that year
good
i guess ill just uh--
hell i dont know--
go look up shit
on the microfiche
suffer over you
good-bye
see ya
lost your way
dont do tours here
sir george bailey
who wants to know
professor mortimer cropper
curator of the stan collection
robert de leon university
harmony city new mexico
and this is dr wolfe
good morning
im a busy man
my wife ill
i can quite understand
that sir
sources have led me to believe
that you may be in possession
of some documentation
by randolph henry ash
whoa
dont shoot please
get off my land
do you have any idea
what were talking about here
do you do you have
any idea how much
such pieces
if they existed
how much
they would be worth
worth
do you mind if we swing
past the university
bit of unfinished
business
miss bailey i presume
the accomplice
the very same
good god youre
like bonnie and clyde
come on
i need a picture of her
ive never seen you
like this just go
take the porsche
and go
fergus what
uh if fergus went out
to get indian food
im gonna--
im gonna feel really stupid
no he didnt
india wouldnt be
far enough away actually
come inside ill explain
you sure i mean
about me coming in
yes very
so i left fergus a message
from seal court
which apparently
put him on our trail
and he came here looking
for answers--
he and cropper
from the sound of it
so that was cropper
car outside
i think fergus
has found something
he been spooking
around the museum
sending out
a bunch of faxes
ah--
i wouldnt be
so quick to do that
yeah
the british museum
fax log sheet
to university of nantes
from fergus wolfe
subject christabel lamotte
information on lamotte genealogy
request loan of journal
of sabine de concasse
unfortunately for fergus
we have to log our faxes
youre shameless
so what are we
gonna do now
we gonna try to beat em
to france or--
or are we just
gonna stare at each other
that is the question
isnt it
mm-hmm
i have another one for you
what that
what are you really
doing here
well i uh--
i needed to see your face
i just want to let you know that whatever happened in whitby
which unfortunately
was not much
it not because
anything that you did
not at all
i just didnt want
to jump into something
i mean i did
and i do want to
badly
i just didnt
want to mess this up
and i just want to see--
i want to see if there
an us in you and me
would-would you like that
ill take that
as a yes
ah oui excusez-moi
nous sommes confrères
when will she be back
could you check for us
she will return on thursday
okay
au revoir
merci
you and your shoplifting huh
i cant take you anywhere
dear professor wolfe since i wrote to you last
ive made another discovery
amongst sabine papers
was her journal
in which she writes about lamotte visit to brittany in 859
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor
i know how things are
i wish to help you
you know how things are do you
tell me cousin sabine
how do you think
things are with me
im a grown woman
you are a girl
i do not desire
any help from you
christabel condition
became worse
after she received word
from london
that her close friend
had died
she left england
because she was pregnant
and blanche
committed suicide
what happened to the baby
it must have been stillborn
or died
maybe it was taken in
by nuns or a local family
and brought up here
id like to think that
but i wonder
you wonder what
i dont know i just--
she comes here alone hears
that blanche has killed herself
she pregnant distraught
geez
i mean ive no
evidence for it
can you imagine
how she must have felt
yes i can
so when do we see
christabel next
autumn 860
in her references to the vestal lights
it was a group of women who used to
meet with mediums on a regular basis
really you know
ash hated spiritualists pretty openly
you think that a connection worth tracking down
i dont know
please make a circle
with your hands
close your eyes
white earth valley
a waterfall
a child love
two people deception
letters two people
words death
what have you done
a field
where is the child
what have you done
with the child
you have made
a murderess of me
i understood at the time
that mr ash was inquiring
after the spirit of
a departed child of his own
but i am told that
this could not be the case
as mr ash is childless
was there any mention
of heloise in your research
i dont know
nor do i care
look ive got to get back
what going on nothing
im just tired that all so i should--
come on
what wrong seriously
i dont actually want to discover anything else about them
you know
im finding things out
that are just--
it horrible when you think about it really-men and women together
she gave up her life
didnt she
a perfectly decent life that ive always admired
and for what for nothing
no not nothing
oh really for what then a child who died
a lover drowned and to what end
she and ash
my own parents
and every relationship
ive ever had--
it all doomed
we cant seem to help
but just tear
each other apart
well what about us
you didnt include us what about that
look i--
i cant think about
anything right now
so okay
so this is the
uh-this is the icy pull-back part then huh
what
you know you get close you pull away you get--
i mean this is part
of the pattern right
what are you talking about
your fear of men mantra from yorkshire
that what
im talking about
no i get it
it cool
that the way
you play it
do you honestly
believe that
is that what you think
this is to me a game is it
well finally then
all this talk of us
really comes to nothing
doesnt it
yes i guess youre right
it nothing
dear professor blackadder
i did try to tell you
about my discovery before
but found that i couldnt
please read these two letters
and you will begin
to understand
im sorry for deceiving you
sincerely roland michell
and it well documented that ellen ash set a box on ash coffin--
a kind of sealed container
wed always imagined
it was just trinkets
but in the light
of michell discovery
who knows what treasures
might be buried there
that box is mine isnt it
it my property
once you get it from lord ash
it absolutely yours
until then
we keep it a secret
any discovery amongst
lord ash things
and uh--
and i purchase it from you
it all above board
no one the wiser
cropper are you
absolutely sure of that
listen
uh where is it
yeah i place this
letter in his hands
and if ghouls
dig it up again
then perhaps justice will be done when i am not here to see it
we are older now
and my fires at last are out
i know that you are
more than aware of my name
but i find you must see it
in print one last time
it has been made known to me that your husband is near to death
so i have writ down
for his eyes only some things
i find i cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter
if you wish to read it
it is in your hands
though i must hope that he
will see it first and decide
i have done great harm
though i meant none to you
ill see they get back
no questions asked
youre more enterprising
than i gave you credit for
was there a compliment
in there somewhere
hmm yes probably
what i cant believe is fergus wolfe conniving with cropper
i thought i was
a better judge of men
well see that
where you went wrong
you gave him credit
for being one
thank you
hi
hi
thank you for coming
sure
i believe
that may be her
i uh-im sorry
no im sorry
no listen i lost it totally
it wasnt you
so why dont we all
talk some strategy
let me introduce you to
uh-all right
professor blackadder paola
this is dr bailey
maud
maud
how do you do
so do we really think that cropper capable of something like this
of robbing a grave
it creepy the idea
of opening a grave
let just keep going
jesus
the moping owl does to the moon complain
complain
are you ready
yeah
hold the light up
fergus fergus
is that it
yes it gotta be
i found it fergus
i found it
oh my god
i found it fergus
great
hey cropper
cropper
this has nothing
to do with you people
wait get off of me
get off of me
no you dont
traitor
bloody conniver please
wait
what are you doin
oh shit
are you sure
we should be doing this
i told blackadder
wed just take a look
before we handed it over
to the museum
can you hold that there
maud look at this
it her handwriting
my dear my dear
they tell me
you are very ill
perhaps i am wrong
to disturb you at this time
with unseasonable memories
but i find i have after all
a thing which i must tell you
you will say it should have
been told 20 years ago
but i could or would not
you have a daughter
who is well and married
and the mother
of a beautiful boy
ive sent you a picture
you will see she resembles
both her parents
neither of whom she knows
to be her parent
when i said at that terrible séance
that you had made a murderess of me
i was speaking of poor blanche
who then torments me daily
and i thought
let him think so then
if he knows me so little
i had a secret fear you see
i was afraid that
you would wish to take her--
you and your wife--
for your own
but i could not let her go
over here
and so i hid her from you
and you from her
she loves her adoptive
parents most deeply
me she does not love
so i am punished now
living at seal court with them and watching her grow
i have been angry
for so long
with all of us
and now near the end
i think of you again
with clear love
did we not--
did you not flame
and i catch fire
was not the love
that we found
worth the tempest
that it brewed
i feel it was
i know it was
if you are able or willing
please send me a sign that you have read this
i dare not ask
if you forgive
christabel lamotte
ash had never read this
he never knew
he had a child
youre descended from both
christabel and ash
my god
all these clues
theyre for you
for us
youre so beautiful
there are things that happen
not spoken or written of
a poet walked out
one summer day
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost
he found
something else instead
this is how it was
morning
good morning
what your name
may bailey but i have
another name i dont like
do you what that
maya thomason bailey
well
maya was the uh--
the mother of hermes
and i know a waterfall
called thomason
a waterfall really
yes
in yorkshire
with a lovely cave hidden behind it
where do you live
i live in that house
down there
and my mother lives there
and my father
and my two brothers
oh and my aunt christabel too
yes i think
i know your mother
you have
the true look of her
no one else says that
i think i look like my father
you look like
your father too
can you make daisy chains
yes
yes ill make you a crown
but um will you
give me a lock of your hair
like fairy story
just so
now would you
take this note
to your aunt
tell her that
you saw a poet
who was coming
to meet her
but met you instead
ill try to remember
thank you
