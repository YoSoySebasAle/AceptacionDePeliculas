hi my name caveh
and im about to be married
um this isnt my first time
ive actually been married twice before
um but im pretty sure
it going to be the last time
um
how can i know that for sure
i cant obviously
my last two marriages fell apart because
i used to have this sex addiction problem
and i dont really have that anymore
well at least not in the way i used to
um
you see about ten years ago i started going
to these sex addicts anonymous meetings
hi my name caveh
im a sex addict
all hi caveh
for me it all started in paris
about seven years ago
actually i wasnt able
to raise enough money to go to paris
so im just going to shoot it here
in san francisco
which is where i live now
so if you could just pretend this is paris
and that im 23 years old
so anyway i was walking
down the street one day
when i saw this prostitute
the first thing that struck me
was what she was wearing
but then i noticed her
uncanny resemblance to my wife
i thought it was strange that i should be
so turned on by this woman
and yet no longer the least bit
attracted to my wife
you fucking shut the fuck up
this is caroline my wife
how i ended up marrying her
instead of the person i was
really in love with is a long story
but i should probably start by explaining
that i never would have married caroline
if it hadnt been for the fact
that she was french
and that her visa was about to expire
actually let me back up a second
this is anna
she was my first real girlfriend
and the love of my life
we had met in college
and had been together for two years
now i should probably explain
that ever since i was a kid
i was obsessed
with finding my soul mate
every time i would meet a girl
i would think
is she the one
is she the one
or is she the one
i was constantly falling in love
at the drop of a hat
but the girls i was attracted to
never seemed to be attracted to me
things went on like this for years
and i was starting to despair
of ever finding a soul mate
and then i met anna
she had the most beautiful soul
of anyone i had ever met
and the two years we spent together
were the happiest of my life
it seemed that nothing
could ever come between us
and that we would always be together
the only problem was
that i was a philosophy major
and believed in free love
to me monogamy was a form
of private property
and i was against private property
let me try one more a different way
our role models at the time were
jean paul satre and simone de beauvoir
because they were said to have had
a polygamous relationship
which had lasted their entire lives
birds chirping
anna had had affairs
and so had i
of course we both got jealous at times
but we believed that jealousy
was something to be transcended
and that it was possible to love
more than one person at a time
beach music playing
which is how i ended up
becoming involved with caroline
we had met in paris
a few months earlier
and had spent three
idyllic days together
i know i said that we couldnt afford
to shoot in paris and we really cant
but the actress playing caroline
her visa expired and she actually
had to go back to france
before we could finish the film
actually let me back up a little
you see i had a really hard time
finding a french actress to play my wife
and then one day
i saw this woman on the street
who looked a lot like the real caroline
so i started talking to her
and found out that she was french
so i asked her to audition
caveh so what do you do for money
what your business
i have a make-up company
caveh oh really
are you a make-up artist
well actually
i teach people to do make-up
caveh really so youre
a make-up artist teacher
yes i am
now i should probably explain
that the real caroline
was also a make-up artist
which i took as a sign that i had found
the perfect person to play the role
but then a few months later
when we were about to do re-shoots
something really weird happened
okay something really weird
just happened
i was looking for a french prostitute
to act in the movie
for the prostitute scene
where is it
there it is
i found this face that says rebecca lord
so i open it
and im like
porn star rebecca lord french
and im like wow she looks
so much like caroline
i go down
im like she looks
so much like caroline
and then it says here
working first as a make-up artist
that what caroline was
and then it says that shell be visiting
san francisco august 7th through th
that when were shooting
our re-shoots
and im like wait a minute
caroline is a prostitute
and then there all these movies
here her list of credits
sluts of france
so i had inadvertently cast a porn star
to play my french wife
but anyway getting back to the story
we had met in paris a few months earlier
and had spent three idyllic days together
i had been totally honest with caroline
about my relationship with anna
and had even asked her
do you ever get jealous
to which she had answered
life is too short for that
i was blown away by her answer
and i found myself starting
to fall in love with caroline
but i still believed that anna
was the true love of my life
but then a month later
caroline flew to the states to see me
and it was then that the trouble started
you see
anna became jealous of caroline
and insisted that i choose between them
i didnt want to choose between them
i wanted to be able to see them both
but then anna got
a summer internship in new york
and caroline and i ended up
spending the summer together
which is why when her visa expired
i offered to marry her
so that she could stay in the states
now i should probably explain
that i wasnt exactly the marrying type
in fact i was totally against marriage
you see i had grown up
during the vietnam war
and i saw marriage as pat
of the same capitalist system
that had produced
the genocide in vietnam
explosions
screaming
but i was also influenced
by performance at
screaming
and by the idea of life itself
as a kind of performance piece
and to me the institution of marriage
was so inherently absurd
that i tried to subvert it
by treating it as performance art
i do
except that the joke
as it turned out was on me
because when anna found out
that i had gotten married to caroline
she didnt take it so well
phone slams
and then i did something
incredibly dumb
you see caroline and i were
about to run out of money
and the idea of having to get a job was
in my mind a fate worse than death
the only occupation i was interested in
was that of famous filmmaker
but the few experimental films
that i had made
hadnt exactly been greeted
with enthusiasm by the film world
indistinct
to remedy this situation
i had recently written a script
about the french poet arthur rimbaud
which i was convinced
would revolutionize cinema
and which caroline insisted it would
be easy to raise money for in france
it will be easy to raise money
for this in france
but moving to france
turned out to be a disaster
most of the film producers i approached
wouldnt even talk to me
the few that did
just told me that i was nobody
meanwhile my relationship
with caroline had started to unravel
crying
caroline was insanely jealous of anna
and would cry hysterically
whenever i would write her a letter
or talk to her on the phone
hi how are you doing
i was starting to feel trapped
and it was hard not to blame caroline
for having gotten in the way
of my relationship with anna
and then one day
i got a letter from anna
saying that she was going
to be in amsterdam
and asking
if i would like to meet her there
crying
i was ecstatic
i felt that i was finally being given a chance
to get back together with anna
but caroline knew that if i left
i would never come back
so she decided to jump out a window
the thought of being responsible
for her death
was way more guilt than i could handle
siren wails
caroline caroline
no no
grunting
so i agreed never to see anna again
it was by far the most
painful decision i ever made
but i did it because years
of going to sunday school
had taught me to equate virtue
with sacrifice
can i come down
man one more time
i should probably also explain
that when i was in college
i had once asked my friend arnold
coughs
what your like ultimate goal in life
and he had said
to be a saint
id been blown away by his answer
and i decided that i too
would try to become a saint
which is why
when caroline asked me
to cut all ties with the only person
i had ever truly loved
i agreed
ting
when i found out much later
that anna had gotten married
to someone else
i was devastated
i had still been secretly hoping that caroline
and i would eventually break up
and that anna and i
would one day get back together
but now i realized that it was really over
i tried my best to transcend my feelings
and to resign myself
to a life of quiet desperation
but the truth is i was incredibly angry
i was angry at god
i was angry at caroline
and i was angry at myself
but mostly i was angry at caroline
and then one day
i was walking down the street
when i saw this prostitute
there was something about her
that turned me on in a way
that i had never been turned on before
it was as if i had been hypnotized
and then i suddenly found myself saying
something that i had never said before
i said the words
now i should probably explain that i had
always considered myself a feminist
and had even marched
in an anti-pornography rally once
which is why
when i suddenly found
myself saying the words
i half expected the prostitute
to run screaming
gasps
or to slap me in the face
the fact that she didnt
but smiled instead and said
made my head spin
afterwards i was a nervous wreck
i couldnt get her out of my mind
caroline hi
hi
i thought that if i masturbated
i would get her out of my system
but it didnt work
so after several days
of compulsive masturbation
i decided that i needed a new strategy
you see i knew that she was
just a regular person
but in my mind i had somehow made her
into an image of erotic salvation
harp music plays
and it seemed that the only way to get her
off the erotic pedestal that i had put her on
was to have a real conversation with her
unfortunately she wasnt there
i was mad at myself for having wasted
so many hours of my day
but i didnt want to leave empty-handed
i asked that same question to every
prostitute that was there that day
i might even have asked
some of them twice
afterwards i felt strangely euphoric
and i returned home feeling that i had
finally gotten this thing out of my system
moaning
but i was wrong
instead of fantasizing
about just the one prostitute
i was now fantasizing about all of them
i went back the next day
and the next day
and the next
at first it was enough just to talk to them
and to fantasize
about them afterwards
moaning
but after a while just talking to them
was no longer enough
now i know that a lot of guys
in my situation
would have just gone ahead
and had sex with the prostitute
and not told their wife about it
but i had this thing about honesty
you see when i was a kid
my mother found out that my father
had been cheating on her
and made him drive my sister and me
to this other woman apartment
in order to humiliate him in front of us
i was too young to know what sex was
but i knew that it was a very bad thing
and that it was responsible
for my parents divorce
i was only eight years old at the time
but i began to hate my father
and i vowed to myself
that i would never be like him
crying
you know if you really need
to see a prostitute you can
i dont want to see a prostitute
i want to try to resist
but i think i need your help
what do you want me to do
i just need to be able to talk to you
i think if i can talk to you about it
ill be less tempted
and itll be easier for me to resist
you can talk to me about it
i can
of course
ohh
god i feel so much better
are you tempted to have
intercourse with a prostitute
or just to get a blow job
oh no just get a blow job
i would never want to have intercourse
with one that would gross me out
really
oh yeah
youre the only person id ever want
to have intercourse with
you promise
yeah i promise
is there anything i can do
to make you less tempted
maybe if you could give me
blow jobs more often
i dont mind
i can even give you a blow job
right now if you like
okay
i felt guilty accepting her offer
but i thought it might be a good idea
moans
i was still fantasizing
that she was a prostitute
but the fact that she knew
and accepted this part of me
made it different than before
it made it something we were sharing
something that we were doing together
and i felt that i was seeing caroline
for the first time
moaning
after i came i was still hard
this was something that had
never happened to me before
it was as if my no longer
having to repress my sexuality
had suddenly unleashed a backlog
of repressed sexual energy
so caroline offered to give me
another blow job
moaning loudly
to my astonishment i was still hard
so caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job
moaning loudly
afterwards i was still hard
i had never seen anything like it
and i actually started to get scared
i was afraid that my erection had become
permanent and would never go away
caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job
but i had recently
gotten a job as a film critic
and i didnt want to be late
to my first screening
on the way there
my erection finally subsided
at that moment i was filled
with boundless love for caroline
and i felt closer to her than ever before
as part of our newfound intimacy
i started pointing out to caroline
the women i was attracted to
i like that one
that one
she gross
not to me
i like that one too
youre kidding right
no im serious
she exactly my type
but she so vulgar
i know that what i like
about her it true
did you see that woman
i would love to have sex with her
it was great to be able
to be totally honest with caroline
and i felt that i was finally having
the kind of open and honest relationship
that id always dreamed of
whoa look at those lips
i would love a blow job from her
did you see that
but after a while
caroline couldnt take it anymore
what the matter
what do you think
im sick and tired of you
staring at other women all the time
it humiliating
what do you want me to do
you want me to hide the fact
that im attracted to somebody
how would you like it if you saw me drooling
over every guy i was attracted to huh
well id probably feel a little jealous
but id try to transcend it
i would
didnt you say you wanted me
to be totally honest
caroline
well ive changed my mind
but my not being able
to be totally honest with her
made me feel alienated once again
and i started obsessing about the various
women i would see on the street
i remember this one time
i saw a woman on the subway
that i was particularly attracted to
i dont know what i was thinking
but i suddenly started following her
for some reason i was dying
to reach out and touch her butt
and i was trying to get up
the courage to do this
when her boyfriend suddenly appeared
but i had been so turned on by her
that all i wanted to do was masturbate
the only place i could find
was a confessional
there was something
about masturbating in a confessional
that appealed to my sense
of transgression
and it wasnt long before i had masturbated
in every cathedral in paris
meanwhile caroline and i had
started fighting more and more
and i had started threatening
to have sex with a prostitute
in order to get her
to stop fighting with me
im going to go have sex with a prostitute
fine go get your dick sucked
by a prostitute see if i care
pssh
and then one day i somehow
managed to convince myself
that i was hurting her more by constantly
threatening to have sex with a prostitute
than i would by just doing it
and getting it out of my system
once and for all
i wanted to reach out and touch her butt
but i felt shy
i didnt know if that was allowed
water running
turns water off
moaning
uh
um
opens wrapper
i was certainly tempted
but i had every intention of resisting having
intercourse until she said the words
for some reason those words triggered
a chemical reaction in my brain
and it was suddenly as if i had no choice
im not sure why
but the fact that her delivery
was so unconvincing
just turned me on even more
moaning
there something i have to tell you
i know
you had sex with a prostitute
howd you know
i can tell
youre not mad at me
no im not mad at you
i think it was the right thing to do
because now ive finally
gotten it out of my system
i love you
i know just please
go take a shower
so tell me what happened
i told her the whole story
but when i got to the part about
the intercourse she got pretty upset
you had intercourse
yeah
but i used a condom
you promised you werent going to
i know im sorry
i tried not to but i couldnt help myself
she said the words rape me
and i just got really turned on after that
now i think i should explain that this was
especially difficult for caroline to hear
because she herself had been raped
i had hoped that being completely honest
would bring us closer together
but i had seriously miscalculated
i dont want to have sex tonight
i wasnt suggesting it
it not to punish you you know
i know
it just i need more time to get over it
i understand
take all the time you need
thanks
i was surprised at how little time
it took for her to get over it
moaning
it only took three days
after that everything seemed
pretty much back to normal
except for one thing
caroline started having fainting spells
caroline caroline
what the matter
i dont know
i dont feel well
we went to see several doctors to try
to figure out what was wrong with her
but none of them
could ever find anything
she perfectly fine
you know it been over two months
since weve had sex
if you want me to suck you
ill suck you
that not why im saying it
im saying it because i think
maybe youre mad at me
im not mad at you
i just havent been feeling well
okay
are you sure you dont want me
to give you oral sex
caveh i really dont feel well
okay
this went on for a whole year
during which my desire to have sex
with a prostitute gradually returned
i tried to escape my marital unhappiness
by throwing myself into my work
higher
i said higher
but i was unable to raise money
for any of my film projects
higher
what the matter with you
cant you jump higher than that
out of desperation i had applied
to film school back in the states
soon after we moved to los angeles
caroline confessed to me that she
had fallen in love with my friend gary
and then she fell in love
with my friend keith
and then she fell in love
with my friend teddy
a week later
she and teddy moved in together
and a year later they were married
this is the real caroline
i asked her to play herself in the movie
but she declined
i tried to stay in touch over the years
but after a while caroline
stopped returning my calls
i realize i havent made it seem
like i was in love with caroline
but the truth is i really was
as much as i was capable
of loving anyone
i mean i was only 26 at the time
after the break-up all i could think about
was finding someone to have sex with
hi can i get in
how much
how much do you want to spend
thirty
okay can i get in
okay
hi my name candy
hi im bob
nice to meet you
nice to meet you too
where are we going
pull over right here
can i have the money now
oh sure
um
do you have any change
no but if you give me 40
ill make it extra good
um
okay
look out for cops okay
moaning
bye
afterwards i felt euphoric
but by the time i got home
i felt empty and depressed
and i vowed never to have sex
with a prostitute again
but then a few days later
i found myself unable to stop obsessing
about that same prostitute
wanna date
it was becoming a pattern
every time i would have sex
with a prostitute
i would feel empty
and depressed afterwards
and i would vow never to do it again
and yet i honestly believed
that if i just did it enough times
my desire to have sex with a prostitute
would eventually go away
moaning
and then i met christa
i was walking down the hallway
at film school
when i saw her for the first time
hi
it was unusual for a woman
i had never met to say hi to me
because she did i assumed
she wanted to have sex
and then a few days later
i saw her again
excuse me
do you know
how to open these
i cant figure it out
i can try
here you go
it just twists off huh
you like capra
i love capra
hi my name caveh
hi im christa
nice to meet you
nice to meet you
so anyway she invited me to a party
she was giving that friday night
and i went
hoping to have sex with her
is christa here
yeah come on in
music playing
i failed to get her to have sex with me
but i did get her to lend me
a copy of her screenplay
it was one of the best screenplays
id ever read
and i felt that i had finally found
someone that i could relate to
i called her immediately
and asked her out
it was then that it happened
i looked into her eyes
and i saw her soul
until then she had just been someone
that i wanted something from
but at that moment i suddenly
saw that she was a real human being
with needs and feelings of her own
it scared the shit out of me
and then one night we were watching
vivre sa vie by jean-luc godard
about a woman who becomes a prostitute
you know what i heard
what
i heard that godard has
a prostitute fetish in real life
can you believe that
yeah
i cant
he seems so sensitive to women
well that doesnt mean anything
i mean im sensitive to women
and i have a prostitute fetish
youre kidding right
no im serious
i cant believe that
well it true
caveh how is that possible
i mean how can you justify that to yourself
well i agree it not
super spiritual or anything
but i dont think it so terrible either
caveh it like rape
those women have no choice
everybody has a choice
or else nobody does
i cant believe youre saying this
well it true
what are you doing
im sorry i have to leave
i feel like im going to be sick
why because ive had sex
with prostitutes
caveh you dont understand
i literally feel like
im going to throw up i have to go
christa
door slams
a few days later i saw her again
hi
hi
still feeling nauseous
no
sure you dont mind
being seen with me
stop it
im sorry i just felt like
you thought i was disgusting
i dont think that
it not like im still doing it
i know im sorry
i dont want to have to
hide anything from you
dont you want me to be honest
i do
caveh let make up
a few weeks later
it was my birthday
and i convinced christa to take
ecstasy with me to celebrate
okay
thank you
that night we felt closer
to each other than ever before
but ecstasy isnt just a love drug
it also a truth serum
i love you so much
i love you too
you do
i do
i dont want there to be
any secrets between us
caveh i dont
i dont either
can i ask you something
yeah
youll tell me the truth
yeah
there isnt anything that youve never
told me before is there
i can take it
yeah there one thing
what
ive been wanting to tell you
but ive been scared
caveh you can tell me anything
okay okay
sometimes when were having sex
yeah
i fantasize about other women
christa was devastated by my confession
and became hyper-sensitive
about other women
she would notice them
even before i would
and immediately scrutinize my face
for any sign of interest
it was unnerving after a while
so i tried to be upfront about it
she pretty sexy
she more your type
than i am isnt she
what are you talking about
and then one day i was on my way
to meet christa for lunch
when i decided to stop and get some gas
there was something about the way
the woman was bending over
that turned me on
hi im really sorry im late
caveh ive been waiting
i know im sorry
i had a little masturbatory episode
what
i had to stop for gas and
did you just say
a little masturbatory episode
yeah i had to stop for gas
and there was this woman who was
kind of bending over to put gas in her car
and she was really sexy
and i just got really turned on
at the way she was bending over
and i stopped at my apartment
so i could you know masturbate
but it was really no big deal
i just thought i should tell you
i just
i just dont want to talk about it
what about truth
i dont want you to tell me every single day
dont you want to know the truth
i already know these things
are happening caveh
i know you i know you
i understand you
and believe me
it will be much better with us
dont tell me
i dont want to know
okay fine
dont tell me
and then one night i happened to watch
a news program on massage parlors
vice investigators say
theyve recently found seven brothels
masquerading as massage parlors
police say these busts
are just the tip of the iceberg
and that many massage parlors
are actually fronts for prostitution
this is maya ellington
reporting for channel 3 news
want a massage
um
yeah um
how much
forty dollars for half-hour
um
does that include everything
that includes a half-hour
um
who gives the massages
different girls
are you one of them
no
um
can i see what they look like
no you have to pay first
get out of here
get out of here
im sorry
get out of here
im sorry
you get out of here
get out of here
i visited every massage parlor in la
at first it turned me on
just to grab the receptionists breasts
and get thrown out
but after a while even this
was no longer exciting enough
and then one day i had an idea
i think maybe the reason i havent
been able to get over my prostitute fetish
is because ive never really
gone all the way with one
what do you mean
greg was my best friend at the time
we had met at ucla and had made
a few student films together
i mean ive never really treated one
the way i do in my fantasies
which is how
which is pretty violent
like in my fantasies
ill grab whoever it is by the hair
and ill make her say things like
i wanna suck your dick and stuff
and maybe call her a bitch or a slut
and then start fucking her really hard
in the mouth and make her gag and stuff
interesting
but in real life ive never done that
why not
because i want them to like me
i see
so what im thinking is that maybe
if i went to a prostitute one last time
and just did everything
i always fantasize about doing
then i think maybe i could get it
out of my system once and for all
will they let you do those things
um
i assume
sounds like it worth a try
it is right
yeah give it a try
but i couldnt do it behind christa back
i mean i had to tell her right
are you serious
christa i cant keep repressing my lust
it not healthy
what do you want me to do
say okay
yeah
well it not okay
if you have sex with a prostitute
it over between us
christa please try to understand
it just something that i have to do
i cant believe youd be willing
to sacrifice our relationship
just in order to fulfill some sick fantasy
i have no intention
of sacrificing our relationship
id be doing this
to strengthen our relationship
christa how is this constructive
the last thing i wanted was to lose christa
so i decided to get professional help
caveh my mother had like
a phobia about changing my diapers
so she had like this aversion
to you know diapers
any recent dreams you can remember
um
i had this dream
where i was sitting on the toilet
and then i was getting
smaller and smaller
and then i fell in
i need you mommy
louder
i need you mommy
harder
i need you mommy
that it
i need you mommy
that it
i need you mommy
louder
i need you mommy
but none of it seemed to help
finally after weeks
of struggling to resist
i decided to do what i had been
struggling for weeks not to do
even if it meant losing christa
take off clothes
suck me
you give me money
oh yeah
um twenty now
and twenty later
if you do everything i say
no standing up
yeah
moaning
yeah
oh wait
first say i wanna suck your dick
no wait
first say i wanna suck your dick
no understand very good english
say i want to suck your dick
no understand
say i
no wait say ii
say i
ii
i say i
i say i
the fact that she had no idea what i was
saying took a lot of the thrill out of it
okay fine just suck it
moaning
oh yeah yeah
suck it yeah suck it you bitch
yeah suck it slut
yeah
moaning
oh yeah you love it dont you
you little slut
moaning
hold on hold on
um
stand over here
get over here yeah
moaning
afterwards the most
amazing thing happened
she patted me affectionately
on the butt and said
come again
i had gone there to express that pat
of myself which i was most ashamed of
and yet she had smiled at me afterwards
with acceptance and compassion
i felt that i had just had
a mystical experience
and that something inside me
had finally changed
that night i went over to christa
to tell her that i was ready to be
in a committed relationship
what do you want
i want to get back together
lock bolts
christa was understandably skeptical
about my transformation
but i eventually managed
to convince her that i was finally cured
now at this point in the film
there supposed to be a scene
in which christa is giving me a blow job
not a real blow job a fake blow job
but the actress playing christa
has refused to do the scene
do you feel like it domineering
or something to women
no it just something that im
not comfortable with doing on screen
could you please do it anyway
no
so if you could just imagine
that she giving me a blow job
and if you could also imagine
the following voice-over
and sex suddenly became very different
instead of fantasizing
that christa was a stranger
i tried to just be present
to what was happening
and it was overwhelming
i felt almost too loved
i couldnt believe that another
human being could love me enough
to actually want to take my penis
which i had always
considered ugly and dirty
into her mouth
or would be willing
to swallow my semen
hey sweetie
christa hi
i missed you
how it going
all right
why what the matter
there something i have to tell you
what
remember i told you i was going
to see a movie with robby tonight
yeah
well
afterwards
i couldnt help myself
and we started making out
what do you mean
you couldnt help yourself
i dont know it just happened
i wasnt planning it or anything
what do you mean by making out
we just like kissed and stuff
what do you mean and stuff
we just fooled around a little
and then what happened
im supposed to see him
tomorrow night for dinner
but im going to tell him i made a mistake
and i cant keep seeing him in that way
caveh im sorry
i felt incredibly jealous but i tried
my best to transcend my feelings
i cant do this
i feel like im kissing robby
i feel i can taste
his saliva in your mouth
well how do you think i feel
when you have sex with a prostitute
i could see her point
and i knew that i had no right to be jealous
after everything that i had put her through
but i just couldnt help myself
that night i called robby
at 300 in the morning
and i asked him as a personal favor to me
to please stop making out with christa
and he agreed
thanks robby
i really appreciate it
but he lied
they made out again the next night
you promised you wouldnt
i know im sorry
what were you thinking christa
i dont know
i just couldnt help myself
she was starting to sound like me
christa continued
to spend time with robby
and i just got more and more jealous
more and more needy
and more and more insecure
arguing
so we started going to couples therapy
so caveh
what are you thinking right now
i was thinking that im attracted to you
meanwhile our fighting
started to escalate out of control
yelling
and before i knew it my desire to have sex
with a prostitute had returned
how much
what do you want
how much for a blow job
50 bucks
let me think about it
after that night
i started cruising regularly
sometimes until dawn
and then i met devin
austin texas
fuck
i had been invited
by the austin film society
to show a film that
greg and i had co-directed
devin was one of the organizers
hey
that night we ended up
getting stoned together
and i found myself suddenly
feeling very attracted to her
coughs
and then on my last day in austin
we decided to take mushrooms together
tripping with devin was one of the most
mystical experiences of my life
i felt like we
understood each other in a way
that i had never thought possible
between two people
after we came down i told her the whole
story of my relationship with christa
you know i bet she
probably fucking robby right now
caveh youre crazy
why am i crazy
because you should be happy for her
you should hope she having a good fuck
you know youre right i should
you know i dont even
believe in monogamy
fuck man neither do i
it seemed to me that i had
finally found the soul mate
that i had been searching for all my life
ow what are you doing
you see there this person here
his name is caveh
he real he exists
you mean me
yeah i mean you
look as noble as it is to try to sacrifice
yourself and your needs for her
you have to be true to yourself
because youre real too
but the problem is i cant stand to hurt her
youre hurting her more by prolonging
a relationship that isnt working
than by ending it right now
yeah but im also scared
im afraid of being lonely and horny
and desperate and always on the prowl
i hate that
those dont sound like very good
reasons for staying together
youre right
sighs
i agreed with everything she said
but i wondered whether devin would
be able to accept my prostitute fetish
any better than christa
but christa really been trying
i mean im fucked up too
like for example
i have this prostitute fetish
big fucking deal
everybody got stuff like that
when devin said those words
it suddenly struck me that it wasnt
my prostitute fetish that was the problem
it was christa that was the problem
on the way back to la
i made up my mind
to break up with christa
we had been together for 3 years
this is the real christa
for the first few years after our break-up
we werent on the best of terms
but now things are better between us
she since gotten married
and recently had a baby
after the break-up
i couldnt stop thinking about devin
for the next month
i wrote to her every day
and when i received an invitation
from two european film festivals
i invited devin to come along
moaning
our first few days together were idyllic
but then things got more complicated
i think she likes you
caveh you think
devin definitely
i dont know she not really my type
not slutty enough
yeah right
you know if you want to see prostitutes
while were in europe feel free
you can just go
hey devin catch you later
and go and do your thing
you know i was thinking
about what you said earlier
and i just wanted to say that i really do
want to get over my prostitute fetish
you know i do
but it did occur to me
that maybe if i could get you to watch
while i had sex with one
that might be really healing for me
caveh that would be so intense for me
really
yeah it would
it just that like a lot of it
has to do with shame
and i think that if you were watching
then it would be something
that we were doing together
and then i think that might help me
to not feel so much shame about it
and then hopefully like i wouldnt feel
the need to do it as much
the next day we rented a car
and drove to milan to see
leonardo da vinci the last supper
hey a prostitute
do you want to stop
and check her out
i dont know
well if you dont mind
nah go for it
so what do you think
do you wanna watch
if it really important to you i will
thanks devin
i really appreciate it
she doesnt want you to watch
so what do you want to do
i dont know
let just go
okay
on our last day in italy
i saw the girl from the boardwalk again
her name was paola and it turned out
that she was an aspiring actress
she had seen my movie and liked it
devin hey
hey
howd it go
great she gave me her shoes
no way cool
yeah she saw my movie we kissed
you kissed lucky you
it was an okay kiss
not like yours
ohh
mm did you even notice
how i kept on riding
when you decided to go
and check her out
no i guess i didnt
yeah i just wanted to point it out
cause i dont think most girlfriends
would have done that
just take off and let you do your thing
yeah i guess youre right
id just like a little appreciation
cause most girlfriends wouldnt stand for it
let alone make it easier for you
yeah that true
thanks devin
yeah right
no i really appreciate it
yeah
but just do me one favor okay
what
just one
okay
just dont fuck her in our bed okay
okay
i was surprised that she would care
but i chose to be touched
rather than alarmed
paola had invited me to have a drink
with her and her friends that night
i had asked devin
if she wanted to come along
secretly hoping she would decline
but she didnt decline
i couldnt decide where to sit
i wanted to sit next to paola
but i felt i should sit next to devin
i decided to compromise
by sitting next to neither
thereby remaining equidistant from both
like christ in da vinci
the last supper
im going to head back to the hotel
ill see you later
dont you want to go swimming
no why dont you go
with your italian friend
id rather go with you
nah go with her
see ya
are you sure
you dont want to swim naked
yes im sure
no itll be fun
no
really
are you sure you dont want
to sleep together
yes im sure
but maybe when you come to torino
great ill probably be old by then
ill write to you
sighs
okay
and if ever you need someone
to act in one of your movies
just give me a call
that was the line
that made me hate myself
okay
i felt like a sleazy
hollywood film director
on the way home i had
a nightmarish vision of my future
i saw myself 20 years later
aging and still alone
by the time i got back to the hotel
i was feeling empty and depressed
all i wanted was to get into bed
and snuggle up next to devin
devin
devin
so did you fuck her
no i didnt
why not she wanted you
not enough apparently
well i almost fucked somebody
who
some dude that i met in a bar
here
sorry
i felt jealous and insecure
but i wanted to believe
that devin and i were engaged
in a high-minded experiment
in self-transcendence
the next day we flew to munich
groaning
fuck ive got such a fucking hangover
excuse me miss
can i have a scotch please
stewardess one scotch
yeah
i thought you had a hangover
i do that why i need a drink
is that a good idea
it the only way
it true
i know what im doing
okay
but this is my last drink
i promise
you promised you werent
going to drink anymore
well the guy kept buying me beers
i couldnt really turn him down
why not
free beers man
it was starting to dawn on me
that devin had a drinking problem
now i should probably explain
that the actress playing devin
had a drinking problem in real life
humming
laughs
the cause of and answer to
all of life problems
but getting back to the story
tv playing
devin stop it you said that was
going to be your last one
why dont you go fuck a prostitute
and leave me alone
devin what are you talking about
you said you were going to stop drinking
i guess i changed my mind
devin i think youve had enough
well that funny caveh
because i dont think i have
fuck
you fucking prick
that shit expensive
i was starting to miss christa
that night i spoke
to every prostitute in munich
um
blasen
blasen
blasen ja blasen
after conversing with the street prostitutes
i made the rounds of the brothels
there was one prostitute
i found especially tempting
i was dying to have sex with her
but i managed to resist
and i returned to the hotel
excited to tell devin
that i had successfully resisted
the next day the film festival organizers
insisted that we pay a $300 fine
for damages to the room
and that we leave town
immediately after my screening
i am not having another drink
for a long time i can tell you that
well good im glad
devin had a bad hangover
and slept all afternoon
it was our last day in munich
so i decided to go sightseeing
music playing
cheers

okay ill come with you
i dont want you to

and ill make you feel better
did she mean sexually
it all you can think about isnt it
well is that what she meant
im getting out
devin no wait
stop it close it
when we got back to the hotel
devin insisted on giving me a blow job
i told her i didnt want one
but she held me down and forced me
i was scared the whole time that
she was going to bite my penis off
moaning
the next morning we flew to new york
how much
let me pull it out for you
get down on your knees
im not getting down on my fucking knees
there broken glass
oh sorry
the next day
we went our separate ways
i wanted to say i love you
but i couldnt
but as i headed towards the gate
i felt able to say it and wanted to
but it was too late
this is the real devin
we remained friends over the years
and she later appeared in a film i made
called i dont hate las vegas anymore
by then she had already
been diagnosed with cancer
and had just undergone chemotherapy
she died three years later
on the way home
i felt an overwhelming sense of loss
ever since i had met devin
i had believed that i had
finally found the one person
who could accept me the way i was
but now i realized that i had been wrong
i had once read somewhere that
everyone who comes into our lives
is a mirror for something inside us
that were not seeing
so i asked myself
how devin might be a mirror for something
inside me that i wasnt seeing
at first i couldnt see it
devin was an alcoholic
i wasnt an alcoholic
but then it suddenly occurred to me
that even though i wasnt an alcoholic
i was kind of like an alcoholic about sex
caveh
yeah hi
hi
back in la i went to see a therapist
who suggested i attend
a sex addicts anonymous meeting
i scanned the faces of the other men
in the room for signs of perversion
but they looked just like anybody else
good evening my name is ken
im a recovering sex addict
all hi ken
welcome to the monday night male-only
meeting of sex addicts anonymous
this is a closed meeting
only those desiring
their own sexual abstinence please
in saa we define abstinence
not as the complete elimination
of all sexuality from the addict life
but only of those
compulsive sexual behaviors
that lead to pitiful
and incomprehensible demoralization
we leave it up to the individual to decide
which compulsive behaviors
he wishes to abstain from
i said that im a sex addict
are there any other sex addicts present
hi everybody my name sasha
and im a sex addict
all hi sasha
last week i finally took all my porn
and i just put it in a garbage bag
and i just hauled it out
cause i was just so sick of it
and i think of all the hundreds
and thousands of hours
im wasting in my car cruising
staying in sex clubs all night
when there absolutely nobody
that i want to have sex with at all
and it really started to affect
my work my marriage
everyone had a different addiction
ken was into gay bath houses
ron was a compulsive masturbator
and tom was a voyeur
but their stories
all had one thing in common
that the more they had
indulged their addictions
the stronger their addictions had become
im in my hallway and im bleeding
and i just realized that that it
im at fucking rock bottom
and i really need some support tonight
cause it been a really hard week
clapping
it 95 this is the time
we usually set aside for newcomers
would any of the newcomers like to share
yes
as you can see im not
very good at crying on camera
but i did actually break down and cry
at that first sex addicts anonymous
meeting that i went to
and i actually happened
to tape record the meeting
and this is actually the tape
that i made at that first meeting
this was in 99
and im just going to play it for you
so you can hear what it sounded like
caveh i feel really moved
by what everybody is saying
man what your name
my name robert
all hi robert
i didnt use my real name
blows nose
im blowing my nose
i used to be married and
it hard to talk
i started seeing prostitutes and
it destroyed my marriage and
then i got
involved with somebody else and
that just ended recently
crying
for the same reason
ooh i hit the record button
anyway that was uh
that was that
i mean there more but
let go back to the movie
i started going to meetings
regularly after that
and was eventually able to stop
having sex with prostitutes long enough
to get married again
unfortunately that marriage
didnt work out so well
two years later as our marriage
was falling apart
i had sex with a prostitute
and told my wife
she filed for divorce soon after
hi my name caveh
im a sex addict
all hi caveh
it wasnt easy
but after several more years of going
to meetings at least once a week
i was eventually able to stop having sex
with prostitutes altogether
it hard to explain
how i was eventually able to stop
it wasnt just one thing
but the way i think about it is in terms
of the story of orpheus and the sirens
the sirens were these mythical creatures
whose singing was so seductive
that anyone hearing them
would go insane with desire
sailors would fling themselves
overboard to try to reach them
only to die upon the rocks below
but when jason and the argonauts
had to sail past the sirens
orpheus the greatest singer
in ancient greece
came up with an ingenious idea
ting
he simply started singing
and because his song was so beautiful
the oarsmen had ears only for his song
and didnt even hear the sirens
and i feel like
that what happened to me
i heard a more beautiful song
and then i met mandy
hi
this is mandy
we just went swimming
we met in a dance class
and fell in love soon afterwards
weve been together for seven years now
which is by far the longest
ive ever been with anyone
caveh i love you sweetie
i love you too
now im not saying we never fight
mandy i was willing to talk about it
you werent
we fight a lot
now he in here and he filming me
but fighting no longer makes me
want to go have sex with a prostitute
or look for a new girlfriend
instead i just hang in there
and really try to work it out
exhales
i could go on and on
about how great she is
but the wedding about to begin
greg let do the boutonniere
are you ready
here we go
