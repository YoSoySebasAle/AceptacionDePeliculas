in october

that says
im not supposed to tumble

over your new
cheerleading coach

off the squad
for something

ill take you and this school
to court if i have to

coach carr made you co-captain
well i feel like
we could do a really good job
if we work together

for a second i thought
she was gonna run her over
you know she wants to
you knew coach carr was planning
to make megan co-captain
and you said okay
when ive always been
the only captain
brooke i cant tell coach carr
that a girl
who perfectly qualified
did it occur to you that
im the best one for the job
or that megan has never
choreographed a single routine
because she sucks at it
you are like everyone else
you think everything i get
is because im your daughter
i hate you being principal
i dont even have a mom anymore
brooke i wish
you wouldnt say that
well the truth hurts
doesnt it principal tippit
so is megan still gonna be
our captain
megan not our problem
our problem is a coach
who thinks she can do whatever
she wants with our squad

not unless mr spretnik says so
and he wont
how could you do that
write me up without even
asking me what happened
okay first of all
i didnt write you up
mrs durant did
second of all
it doesnt matter what happened
you girls did what you did
and you have to face
the consequences
so if youre not
gonna sign this
im gonna be talking
to mr spretnik
at the end of the day
what is your malfunction emma
well at the moment
it your tone
so please
watch how you talk to me
brooke
brooke
brooke
do you really think
i want to give you demerits
after all the hard work
youve done
i was crushed
when miss durant told me
you called lisa
in the middle of class
i thought
you were better than that
yeah that what i thought
about you too
and believe me i wont ever
make that mistake again
and by the way um
my mom wants to see you
in her office
now
o0 c so youre saying we
cant for phone use in class ts
no jeri had just found out
that her boyfriend
was cheating on her
with ashley of all people
apparently
jeri said she felt suicidal
and lisa was worried about her
which is why
she picked up the phone
if that was why
she answered the phone
you know these girls
how they play with the truth
to avoid consequences
look whether it true or not
i think it wrong
to let this slide
i really want to instill
a sense of accountability
in those girls
it not your job
to hold them accountable
it my job
and it mr spretnik job
i would appreciate it
if youd do your job
and get the squad ready
for the game tonight
i know it seems
im being argumentative
i just
i want to do a good job here
i want to do a good job for you
youre new at this
and you havent learned yet
that the people above you
with years of experience
have good reasons
for their decisions
i need you to start
figuring that out
you should be warming up
for tonight game
well we just wanted to know
if we had to sign
the demerit book

please
you guys really dont care
about what you do
or how it affects other people
do you
look all we did
was make a stupid video
it was supposed to be funny
the jocks around here
make sex jokes
and act obscene all the time
no one throws a fit about that
i guarantee you if they were
in their uniform and off campus
theyd be in big trouble
so then it okay
as long as were on campus
jeri when youre
in your uniform
you represent this whole school
you represent everyone else
on your squad
do you realize that anyone
who watches this video
is going to think jackson
cheerleaders are a bunch of
trashy sluts
i am so disappointed in you
coach carr disappointed in us
well i guess i shouldnt be
i mean you did warn me
that all you care about
is getting noticed
so congratulations brooke
youre finally getting noticed
you four are gonna sit out
until the district decides
what your punishment will be
well see what my mom says
about that
you do realize that in college
you wont be able
to run to your mother every time
you dont like something

o0 c pamela the video
showed the girls drinking alcohold
according to the cheerleading
constitution
they should actually be removed
from the squad please
i just read that 80%
of all high-school students
drink on occasion
it ridiculous
to expect our girls
to behave like it 950
look i dont
want lisa drinking
but i should be the one
to handle it
not our little
cheerleading coach
we pay what 500 bucks so our
girls can be cheerleaders try $800
$800 okay
we paid our money
let let em cheer
you know im not gonna appeal
im trying to keep myself
out of this
lorene come on
you could at least back us up
or get your
little miss sunshine coach here
to back off
if coach carr thinks
were trashy sluts
she gonna get trashy sluts
lord
the sun just came out
whoo
almighty that is sexy
unh-unh no way
ive let a lot slide
with you girls
but this
the way youre dressed unh-unh
what wrong with the way
were dressed
you know exactly
what im talking about brooke
are you looking at her boobs
you perv
i want you
i want all of you right now
to get down to the office
get permission to go home
and change
go
i dont think so
excuse me
you get out of my classroom
right now brooke
you know what
you might as well get
your panties out of a wad
because were not
going anywhere
so what should we talk about
today class
miss brooke
yes jeri
um let talk about
how trevor called me last night
and said that ashley
is so crap in bed
and that she makes sounds
like a monkey
really
aw poor little baby
i got a banana for you
run slut run
what are you looking at
nothing
it just
doesnt feel so good
to be on the other side
of it all does it
i was never as mean as brooke
and jeri are being to me
i was never that cruel
yes you were
you were exactly like them
so i went
to mr spretnik yesterday
about brooke
already having nine absences
in my class this year
and this morning i see this
wait that says
she been absent three times
exactly
it been changed
yesterday it says nine
this morning it says three
and i didnt change it
could one of the girls
have accessed the server
yeah it possible
but it also possible
they didnt have to
because someone in that office
did it for them
you know i tried to avoid
doing what everybody else here
does
and that just hunker down
watch the calendar
and wait for those little
monsters to graduate
but if it gonna be like this
screw it
im done fighting
i dont care anymore
jeri mom appealed
tabitha mom lisa dad
brooke do you have any idea
how hard this is for me
look this isnt fair
no one would care
about that video
if you werent my mom
youre probably right
which is why i dont know
whether to ground you
or feel sorry for you
why dont you just bite me
okay you know what brooke
youre grounded
go ahead
try it lorene
im gonna call daddy
ill tell him
if i cant live with him
then ill disappear
and this time
neither of you will ever
see me again
and that a promise
it central office
that was unnecessary
lorene tippit
hello mr tompkins
yeah fine thank you
i could not agree with you more
yes
thank you so much for calling
i will
that was vern tompkins
and he has decided
to reduce the suspension
to 5 days plus probation
yeah well no thanks to you
the parents dont want the girls
to have consequences
the school doesnt want em
to have consequences
and now even the district
is backing off
so if no one else cares
why should i be the one
beating my head
against the wall
because it not like you
to back down
from fighting
for what you think is right
well maybe i should start doing
what people with more experience
are doing
and all theyre doing
is watching the calendar
until the fab five are gone
so fine i can do that too
what do you want me to say
that it okay
not to rock the boat
cause it is i mean ive been
in the corporate world
i know how futile it is
why do you think i went back
to get my degree
hon i know you think
cheerleading is
some high holy mission
but it not like
there are lives at stake here
maybe youre right
im just not feeling that good
im gonna make some tea
do you want some

come on
some adventure
getting frisky
im fricking hungry
tab kill this
go go go
um
um
he hot
you pulled this car out
way too fast young lady
you have an off-campus pass
no but we have permission
to leave
if you dont have a pass
then you need to park your car
do you know who i am
yes i do
now park the car
look okay
you can go call mr spretnik
on your little radio
and hell tell you
were allowed to leave
hey joe
what going on
hey there blt
you girls need to get
out of this car right now
o0 c
could we be any more fascinating
to these losers
the curmudgeons are on time
you know
it really funny to me
this is actually a prop
for a health-class project
you know i found it
in the trash can
by the science lab
why dont why dont you girls
just tell me what happened
well now
we just took a huge test
and we were all tired
and we needed some fresh air
i was running and it was really
stupid of me but i fell
go figure
she scraped her knee
em
you got to hear this
everyone is saying
you were the one
that caught them
in the parking lot
you didnt write them up
no i didnt
but they were drinking
on school grounds
there was no alcohol
in the bottle
no proof they were drinking
and as for this skipping thing
i think there a lot
of gray area there
i mean the other squad captain
gave them permission to go home
who megan
since when can a student
give another student
permission to leave school
lorene
you have to write them up
keep pushing me
and i will dissolve this program
altogether
there will be
no more cheerleaders
and i will let everyone know
that youre responsible
now i have an appointment
lorene before you go
those girls have violated
their probation
they need to be removed
from the squad
i am not about to deliver
permanent consequences
for an offense
im not sure they committed
this isnt
about embarrassing stuff
on the internet anymore
they are becoming a danger
to themselves and others
this conversation is over
why do you help these girls
get away
with whatever they want
i know why lorene does it
she thinks
itll convince her daughter
that she loves her
but what in it for you
all right
you are becoming irrational
maybe you need
to take another day off
until youre feeling
wasnt it you that altered
brooke tippit attendance
record in coach reeve class
all right
youre completely out of line
this whole school
is out of line
and if youre not gonna
hold these girls accountable
for their actions
i will hold them accountable
as a squad
i will cancel all activities
outside the classroom
i will see them at practices
and that it
if youre refusing
to perform your duties
as cheerleading coach
then ill just accept that
as your resignation
no i am not resigning
you are gonna be dealing with me
until you handle this
the right way
why are you making us pay
for what they did
i know this is hard
to understand
but if rules are broken
there have to be consequences
and these are
the only consequences
i have in my power to deliver
you said you would never quit
on us
im not quitting
im trying to force a change
in discipline policy
can you understand that
yeah but im tired of them
getting away with everything
and making us all look bad
youre not hurting us
you know
youre just gonna make everyone
else hate you as much as we do
leave
make me
practice is canceled today
you can all go home early
ill let the office know
what are you still doing here
waiting for mr studdard
he said hed be here at 35
you went to central office
with your cheerleader problems
well i think he should know
what going on here dont you
do you know
what lorene gonna do to you
when she finds out
you went over her head
she left me no choice
she wont even talk to me
about it
now obviously
mr studdard wont either
what is wrong
with this district
everyone is just burying
their heads in the sand
hi
the girls were just telling me
about what happened today
and theyre pretty upset
about it
janice i need your help
come on in
wait
what going on here
after meeting with coach carr
and a number
of the booster parents
mr spretnik and i
have decided
that you girls
will be written up
for skipping class on tuesday
and this is because
of what she wants
most of the girls will receive
0 to 2 demerits total
but jeri already has 0
so 20 is now her total
and 20 means removal
from the squad
that it jeri
youre off the squad
really
i mean really
because my mom is gonna be very
interested to hear about this
this is twice now that youve
gotten me kicked off the squad
for what
what did i ever do to you
jeri this isnt about
what youve done to me
she is totally manipulating you
and youre letting her
arent you
arent you
answer me
answer me
so if youre wondering
why im giving you erasers
well weve had
a pretty rough time
and i know this is cheesy
but this is what
my high-school coach used to do
when she wanted us
to start fresh
and that what
this squad needs
a fresh start
would you like me to tell you
where you can put that eraser
disrespect to a teacher
is 0 demerits
so go ahead tell me
sorry coach
but im respectfully declining
your eraser
hey
did she say anything about me
no
she just gave us these you took it
why didnt you tell her
to stick it up her ass
why didnt you
you know what
this is our squad our school
we were here before that bitch
and you know what
were gonna be here
after she gone
someone should know about it and
you say this um this affair has been going on
since before last semester
yes sir
i definitely
heard coach carr say to him
what if your wife
finds out
all right well just keep this
to yourselves all right
ill take care of it
i need you to come with me
and sit through the first round
of pamela blackburn appeal
over jeri being removed
from your squad
at camp this summer
did you or did you not
encourage the girls
to break curfew
and go with you to buy tape
for the purpose of playing
pranks on the other girls
yes but i didnt
consider it breaking curfew
because they were with me
and did you let them get away
with sending
a sexually explicit message
to coach reeve
from your cellphone
no i didnt let them
get away with it
but you didnt give them
any formal punishment
so if you let them
break some rules and not others
how are they supposed to know
where you draw the line
the line at school
is very clear
drinking is not allowed
neither is skipping class
did you frequently flirt
with coach reeve a married man
in front of the girls
lorene why am i the one
on trial here
were supposed to be discussing
jeri behavior issues
emma you cant kick a girl
off the squad
and not have questions raised
about how that came about
im curious
to hear your answers
wait
come on you guys
you havent hit this
once yet today
let try it again
come on

youre gonna be benched
for another two weeks
youre just trying to keep me
out of the crosstown showdown

you guys need to start thinking
of consequences
before you break the rules
let do it again
cindy okay remember

hi daddy
im so sorry
to bother you at work
but remember
you said to call you
if coach carr starts
picking on me again
look 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
2 3 4 5 6 7 8
2 3 4 5 6
my dad wants to talk to you
he spoke
to mr resinbrink
and mr resinbrink says
that you cant stop me
from performing
at the crosstown showdown
that if you give me demerits
you have to let me
work them off
go ahead
talk to him
how can i coach
with no authority whatsoever
you either need to make sure
i have some control
over this squad
or you tell supervisor tompkins
ill resign
as cheerleading coach
hi miss tippit
hi
i need to see that in writing
okay
thank you
you think i quit
that usually
what i resign means yeah
lorene not gonna accept
that resignation
she knows im a good coach
she just wanted me
to write it down
so she can take it to district
and show them
look
we have a problem
did she tell you that
god these girls
are gonna think i quit on them
i need to write them an e-mail
this has been the most
meaningful time in my life
you girls mean more to me
than you will ever know
blah
mom
you know what to say right
im not an idiot
mom come in here
mom coach carr
sent us an e-mail
you should read it
ive been trying to tell you
she psycho
my mom says coach carr
an embarrassment
she said she mostly
embarrassed for you
superintendent tompkins
told my mother
he doesnt know
why you ever hired her
so i read your e-mail
to the girls several times
and i do have one question
you wrote whether or not i
continue this journey with you
you do realize that your journey
here at jackson is over right
may i tell the girls
before i go
no you may not
youre to leave campus
immediately
what do you want
we just heard
youre not our coach anymore
i guess someone
didnt want you here
you girls always get
what you want dont you
yeah you could say that
you know for a while there
i thought you girls
were actually on your way
to becoming
shut up
get out of our school
i feel the most sorry
for you brooke
you have so much potential
and you just drove away the one
person willing to help you
the meeting was a joke
22 parents signed a letter
demanding your reinstatement
and mr studdard tried
to stop us from reading it
why did they bother
to hold the meeting
if they had no intention
of listening to us
how are the girls doing
they feel abandoned
lorene told them
you quit on them
i know
it only going to get worse
tv reporter called me
she doing a story
about the video on the internet
and the questions she asked
it gonna be
a cheerleaders gone wild
what is this reporter name
youre not thinking
of talking to her
maybe i can talk her
out of doing the story
i doubt that
it airing tonight
well then i better go
what the station name
what if she asks you
for an interview
then ill do an interview
coach emma carr said she tried
to bring order to the team
leveling punishments
for offenses
ranging from skipping classes
to posting a sexually
suggestive video
on the internet
the jackson high school
administration
declined our request
for an interview
carr said that her attempts
to why theyd blur our faces
shh shh shh
by the high-school principal
lorene tippit
who has a daughter on the squad
yes i mean some of the girls
behaved badly
but the real problem
were the adults
the school administration
enabled them
the school district
refused to take interest
and the girls parents
did everything they could
to help them avoid consequences
you know
we are totally famous
feeling paris hilton
more of a lindsay lohan vibe
with a touch of britney
and her sister
girls it good to be bad
the school board is very unhappy
about the publicity
very unhappy
once i realized
how unstable coach carr was
i asked for her resignation
well the board has asked me
to hire
an independent investigator
to look into discipline issues
at jackson
but there are no discipline
issues at jackson
the problem here
was an immature teacher
who wasnt up to the job
and is now using the media
to spread lies
yeah i know
and were releasing a statement
to that effect
now we expect the investigator
to tell us the same thing
can you assure me
his investigation
will tell us the same thing
i promise you vern
i will make sure
that everyone at jackson
cooperates
with your investigator
okay
it not true that i get
special treatment here
if anything
people are even harder on me
because my mom the principal
i would agree
it not easy being
the principal daughter
people watch her
they hold her
to a different standard
i work 40 hours a week
so i cant watch tabitha
every moment
yet she motivates herself
to get good grades
do volunteer work
and work her ass off
as a cheerleader
she was so hot for coach reeve
shed ignore us
to flirt with him
here i took this picture
of them on my phone
i know a few parents
are asking
for her reinstatement
and i hope
they do bring her back
then i can sue this school
for my daughter
emotional suffering
mom mom if you would just
let me please stop
mother just let me explain
im trying to mom
ill take cindy in first
she the most nervous
so was it weird
if youre wondering whether
i told the truth or not i did
even though certain people
are gonna hate me
the rest of my life
yeah but other people
are gonna respect you
for telling the truth
yeah like who
i mean if you havent noticed
i dont have friends anymore
well you could
you could have
a whole squad full of them
if you wanted them
hello
emma it helen and adam
god it so good
to hear from you guys
lorene forbid everybody on staff
to speak to you
youre kidding me
well then why are you calling
so i could tell you
how pissed i am
that youre dragging us
into this investigation thing
stop it
he not mad at you
it just the investigator
was grilling him
about the two of you
asking if there was
a sexual relationship
if you had every acted
inappropriately with him
yeah my wife wants to know
why theyre asking
that question
god i am so sorry
i dont see the point
of all this emma
it not like youre gonna
be able to take lorene down
im not trying to take her down
im just trying
to change things for the girls
you should be trying
to get your job back
i just hope this investigator
gonna find out the truth
they didnt hire him
to find the truth em
you look
a little uncomfortable
that because
i am uncomfortable
with the process or with me
i welcome the process
i just dont trust you
from what i hear
youve been paid
to hang me out to dry
this isnt
a very auspicious start
well you did say
you wanted me to be honest
yes i did
what are you doing here
talking to the investigator
he not gonna believe
a word you said
do you know what
all this means for you
my life is exactly the way
i want it to be
is that right
with this video of you
on the internet
and the stories in the media
do you really think
that usc gonna accept you
as a student
let alone a song girl
after conducting
over 70 interviews
i believe ive identified
the source of the problems
with the cheerleading program
as you know the most recent
coach emma carr quit
in an untimely fashion
then unwisely took her accounts
to the media
however
i find her actions
understandable
given the problems
she encountered at jackson
problems centered on a popular
group of cheerleaders
who were highly resistant
to authority
these girls were literally given
carte blanche
to behave as they pleased
by their parents
and by the school
administration
regrettably i found
that jackson principal
lorene tippit failed to juggle
two of the most important
responsibilities in her life
principal and mother
and it is she who is accountable
for this situation
we find ourselves in today
entertain me
why arent the four of you
in class
were just waiting for my mom
to get out of her meeting
and of course
this takes all four of you
that the fab four
to you reeve
i have been placed
on suspension
and so has mr spretnik
the report faulted me
when all ive ever tried to do
is keep you out of this mess
okay you know what
dont blame us
because your investigator
turned out to be a stupid moron
you know what brooke
you will never talk to me
like that again
now go clean out your locker
for what cause im
pulling you out of this school
like hell you are
this is my school
and my senior year
not anymore it not
go clean out your locker
or what
or your mother is gonna drag you
to it by your hair
excuse me miss tippit
what about us
i dont know what your parents
are gonna do with you
youre definitely gonna be
removed from the squad
your cheerleading days
in this district are over
let me get that for you
there you go watch the
miss tippit
brooke
miss tippet
id like to have a word
do you have any comment
please give us a comment
any comment brooke

that youd like to say
anything you would like to say

in the school
coach carr
coach carr

coach carr
please can we get a comment
anything please
of course im disappointed
superintendent tompkins decided
not to let me have my job back
i loved being a coach
i loved being a teacher
but this whole thing
it not about me
and i know you guys
are gonna continue
to call this a real life
mean girls story
but it not even
about what the girls did
it about
how they felt entitled
to the way
they were being treated
by the lack of boundaries
and i think all of us
we have an obligation
to set boundaries
and stick by them
thought youd be happier
the report vindicated you
yeah but jobs were lost
reputations were ruined
and for what
what difference
did i really make
maybe i shouldnt be here
you were invited
yeah by janice
but what if the girls
dont want me to be here
well if you dont want
to say hi to the girls
because you think it gonna
make them uncomfortable
we can just watch them perform
and then go
okay
