you should let those cats out
once in a while
outside they couldnt survive
they were bred for degeneracy
like a whore
there harder work
when
in a week
here is a film
of colonel saran zim president of eritrea
as he steps from the plane bringing him
to paris from the middle east
on the first leg of his tour
of the nato countries
zim was met by french foreign minister
pierre croyez
and minister of state jacques cassente
russian advisers attached to zim
accompanied him
even on this mission to the west
a strong security force
surrounded the dapper colonel
as he made his way toward the podium
this is the moment
an assassins gun fires
causing panic on the tarmac
as one of the special police falls
ministers and officials run for cover
another shot kills zim bodyguard
emilio rocca
lights used to floodlight the area
were spun round to illuminate
a nearby hangar
from the roof bursts of fire
from an automatic rifle
police returning fire
run to surround the hangar
leaving zim and his entourage
mooing for coven
two more police died in the ensuing battle
while police
were distracted by the rooftop assassin
another shot from the darkness
of the airport
and salan zim fails dead
here is an action replay of the moment
as colonel satan zim of eritrea
meets death from an unknown assassin
meantime french police
shot and mortally wounded
the young arab whose fire from the roof
had killed four men
he carried papers identifying him
as yusef belabar a student from eritrea
a member of the extreme
left-wing soldiers of revolution group
already in eritrea
government forces have raided
the of fices of 7 left-wing
do you ever count the dead cross
youre beautiful jean
but sometimes you have
the bad breath of priests
did you see the opposition
i saw him
what zharkov doing on the plane
how many times
you been out with me
six maybe seven
youre good jean
better than good
youre smart you understand
but that still leaves you
a contract button man
necessary only because the cia
doesnt hold with doing its own killing
washington
does the boy go into your report
he the headliner
why did he want to kill zim
nosy arent you
good evening madame
bonsoir monsieur
monsieur
boy saw zim as a fascist a brutal pig
a tool of american imperialism
he wanted a crack at him
i bought him a ticket
if he had got him
mademoiselle sil vous plait
youd have picked up
your money with no sweat
merci
if zim was america man why kill him
for your education
zim dead at the hands of the left
serves his government and mine
better than zim alive
but it not his death that important
it who appeared to have
killed him that counts
one more thing for your education
the more a man tells you
the more dangerous you become to him
and the more dangerous you become
the shorter the options on your future
your sister still work at air france

and cross would have walked
right into this office to file his report
and what dyou do
you crawl halfway up his ass
who did you think you were following
some second-hand car dealer
from oshkosh wisconsin
cross is the best
now he running free
and all ive got
is one operative with a cut head
another being held by the local police
as a drug-addict homosexual
and one beat-up car
mr mcleod you said to check him
in and keep an eye on him and
oh get out
how is harris

cross forced a harmless hay fever pill
into his mouth told him it was cyanide
from an sd kit
beautiful
shall i bail the dummy out
no let him sweat
i cant let this get upstairs fil
if we throw this one
the chiefll come down hard

ive got every man on it
but without fbi or locals

the bureau would love
to get their hands on this mmm-mmm
no no one outside the agency
blanket everything
every exit operate every contact
ill put it nationwide well box him in

youll be there at 530 in the morning
30 in the afternoon their time
put it in your shoe jack

too much
i made the connections
as fast as i could like you said

nothing traceable
in pittsburgh your tickets will be
waiting for you at the national desk
under the name father henderson
at chicago go to the united desk

at toronto it air canada
under the name father wieland
and your english is not so good

and ill hold you to it
okay father
goodbye my son bless you
goodbye goodbye goodbye
hello
what are we buying for each other
ill pay my dues
how much did my sister tell you
she said thered be pain
did she talk about algeria
she said that you were
a lieutenant in the paratroopers
when i think of it im afraid arent you
i picked you up remember
i only talked anne into
sharing an apartment with me
so id have an excuse to be around
we cant all miss mister okay
let give it a search
make a move jockey
and ill splash you across the sheets
it heroin
you son of a bitch get out of bed
pull it in
jean
youve two ways to walk scorpio
down that corridor that 30 years long
or with me
this is washington national airport
the picture shows passengers
boarding this afternoons 55 flight
pittsburgh pennsylvania
would you say that was cross
without an element of doubt
some airports have a television eye service
they keep a video tape running
which they erase the next day
i had a hunch
and it paid
it should have been fairly easy
to trace the destination of a priest
normally washington airport
wouldnt have too many priests
departing around 500 or so
but today was the last day
of a conference of teaching brothers
more than 300 priests departed
in all directions
between 300 and 600 pm
cross amongst them
brilliant
oh i agree
he had to have help
no messenger boys
the plan was cross
would you agree to that scorpio
mm-hmm
well our first piece of common ground
you boys can pack it in for the night
you were supposed
to kill cross at the paris job
no contract
you took the money
you left the money
why
cross had his contract in first
i dont play games when the rules are bent
no one bends them faster than cross
never with me
i want cross and i want him burned
you know him best
find him
you make too many mistakes
like
you confuse what you want
with what i want
mister you dont have
too much ground to dance on
i could drop you for the heroin
or tag you for the paris killing
now your government
would like more names
your second mistake mcleod
cross gave me enough information
on each operation we did together
not conclusive but enough
to make a strange reading
you cant let me go into a public court
what do you want
i want inside
where
beirut
you want cross job
if you get cross you get his posting
more
more
$25000
where cross
more
you run it right to the edge dont you
what
i want to know the reason
executive order
you dont question a directive
in the agency scorpio
im not in the agency until i get cross
the reason
he a face a double agent
he sold to the opposition
and he has a lot more to sell
do you know where cross is or dont you
i dont but a man named zharkov will
serge zharkov
he soviet intelligence
in cairo cross opposite
you think hell go to zharkov
zharkov will go to him
but not in the middle east in europe
europe is a big place
i want internal replay on serge zharkov
who else have you got to send
against him but me
where do i send you
where zharkov and cross have met before
a place they both know
a place where zharkov
could have a safe house
ready on zharkov
sergei zharkov
born kiev 94 educated in leningrad
doctor of philosophy
and political history and economics
fought in spain with the thalmann brigade
arrested in moscow 939
and sentenced to six years ham labor
rehabilitated in 943 assignment balkans
little information
until his posting to iraq in 952
speaks fluent german arabic
french english hebrew
associated operatives karim
ludmann
zemetkin
replay operatives
associated operatives karim
ludmann
zemetkin
hold on zemetkin
listen when i came over
you promised me asylum
we also promised you questions
yes
and i answered all your questions
why am i in the airport
youre going back to moscow zemetkin
you gave us no more than we already knew
you were cute and well-conditioned
and all that stuff
about freedom had brass edges
you ran because you were
playing pat-a-cake with state funds
okay we let it ride
but now we want
a little interest on our investment
zharkov
when zharkov isnt in the middle east
and he isnt at home where is he
maybe a former picnic ground
not too east and not too west
somewhere the barriers are down
i dont know such a place
i would tell you if i knew
your plane
aeroflot flight 379 direct to moscow
al the other end
youll be well and truly met
648 to ilyushin 009 over
youre murdering me
federal protective
service officer 7463 over
man t ready to board
passenger andrew zemetkim oven
standing by over
man t dropping lounge
boarding platform in five seconds oven
how about vienna huh
jean girlfriend; vienna
im sorry
what about the police
a mistake
the man who had the room
before me forgot to pack everything
some mistake
how long will you be away can i come
impossible anyway you have to teach
is it going to be dangerous jean
no why should it be
weve already contacted
our people in vienna
youll be given
every facility total cooperation
and you can draw expenses
mcleod depending on you scorpio
spain was a long time ago
the best died there
there a house on the kurrentgasse
on the corner go there
where are we going
get in
you dont talk very much
i have nothing to say
i see you still have
a flair for the theater zharkov
it adds color
these drivers your people
not official old comrades
i hear you are running cross
what else do you hear
mcleod ordered the wet stuff
there a gun out for you
when did you know
a week before you did
who have you got in your pocket
actually i buy from a bulgarian
who works for the chinese
your place
yours if you need it
no one knows about it
not my company not your company
just friends a few and trustworthy
and the rent
take it on trust
thank you
there will come a time cross
when those who sit above me
will want you delivered
theyll give me so much play
in the rope and then theyll pull it in
and then
moscow is nice in the spring
there a long winter i hear
how are you going to get your wife out
ill get her out
come over theyll get her out for you
no sergei no moscow
i want out not just a change of sides
sit down cross
the offer of the hide still goes
and when the rope begins to wind in
ill tell you
and youll know where to find me
in vienna i could find you anywhere
have you noticed cross
that we are being replaced
by young men with bright stupid faces
a sense of fashion
and a dedication to
nothing more than efficiency
keepers of machines pushers of buttons
hardware men with highly complex toys
and except for language
not an iota of difference
between the american model
and the soviet model
to dinosaurs
maybe you can kill cross alone though i
wouldnt put my little yellow basket on it
but youre not gonna find him alone
not out there
am i wasting my breath
no i was listening
and so far youve said
nothing that lit any candles in the dark
you have no proof
that cross and zharkov are in vienna
you have no one on your staff
that knows zharkov
but you did get around
to checking customs
and eight priests arrived by air
in the last three days
two from north america mitchell
it is mitchell isnt it
well mitchell
which of the two was cross
the one on twa from new york
or the one on air canada from toronto
no way of telling
father wieland was cross
air canada from toronto
yes i know horse players that
play hunches and hot flushes
horse players die broke
if cross had flown
from washington to new york
he would have caught the pan am flight
but there was no priest on that flight
he wouldnt have waited
seven hours for a twa flight
never stand still when you run
and never run in a straight line
that the first thing cross taught me
cross is an organizer
he plans down to the finest margin of error
you cant follow his mistakes
so you follow his skill
washington to pittsburgh or cleveland
two possibles
cleveland or pittsburgh to chicago
chicago to toronto
toronto to vienna
not more than 20 minutes in any one place
and less than 2 hours in all
wieland fits
all the majesty of europe
have you ever been to the hermitage
paintings there that seize your breath
stop being a guide sergei
what have you got for me
arrivals
then they know you are here i guessed
you never guess
a defector zemetkin a petty thief
mcleod had his thumbs on him
he knew about vienna
and the hide
only those i trust know that
i could have this one killed
no
i would offer you coffee cross
but the sugar would attract too many flies
everyone cross used to know in vienna
everyone cross used to know
that you know
were monitoring
telephone calls to america
telegrams and radio telegrams
i want the tapes brought here
weve got a watch on all the embassies
but if cross doesnt move
hell be damn near invisible
hell move hell try to get his wife out
hell need funds and help
not if he goes over
he wont
mcleod thinks he might
if he was going over
hed be in moscow not vienna
the trouble with mcleod
is that he thinks like mcleod
you know what a dybbuk is mitchell
some son of jewish sprite or ghost
a spirit that invades another human form
im the dybbuk of cross labyrinth mind
i live inside him
hell move
he in here
ive assigned novins and dor to assist you
theyre both viennese both very good men
of course as far
as the embassy is concerned
you dont exist so dont call for help
cross
you have some time max
until 300 but longer if you want
you hungry
i can hold out if we hurry
come on
it june
strauss and strauss and strauss
a little mozart a little brahms
then strauss and strauss and strauss
vienna is the only city that puts
on yesterday clothes for visitors
cross it been months
since i played any webern or berg
and three years since i saw you cross
im in trouble max
can i help
maybe you should first ask what
it would only depress me
or maybe frighten me cross
i need a messenger boy max
waiter
yes
between rehearsals or should i go sick
youll have plenty of time between
i see
could you do the bank today

how did you get this
a man asked for it to be given to you
man about 50 big american
yes but he was german
oh yeah
you should have
done it in paris jean
the price wasnt right
and now it is
yes now it is
i could kill you jean
take it then cross
it wont come around again
can we talk
sure
mcleod name my sin
he said you sold and had more to sell
and you believe that
is it true i want to know
for your education no it isnt true
zharkov
what about zharkov
he is the opposition
ive known zharkov for almost 30 years
as an ally as an enemy
and always as a friend
were both premature antifascists
as they used to say in washington
but zharkov hasnt sold out
and neither have i
then why does mcleod want you dead
why dont you ask him that
im asking you
youre looking for god shining face
arent you jean
something to believe in
like a young girl
in a white communion dress
but youve got the soul of a torturer
so your need is greater
you lied to me cross and you used me
for that im going to kill you
i never lied to you jean
i used you but i never lied to you
not my doing cross i swear
dont trust mcleod
he ordered you dropped twice
damascus and marseilles
that why i gave you so much
information on each job
something to bargain with
you owe me jean
where
he up there
you had him last night and you let him go
that how it looks in my report
to washington
unless youve got something to change it
dor says you didnt even try
to get a shot off
where the hell do you think youre going
never put your hands on me
cross im off until tuesday
i want you to call washington for me
the number and the message
is in that envelope
okay -
repeat the message exactly as it written
yes
call from a phone box
you still dont have any questions
what answers could you have
that would make any difference
i love you cross
and i you max that why i must
tell you there could be pain in this
i have been inoculated
you know cross
i used to think
that the only music i would ever hear
no matter what i was really playing
was the music we played each morning
when the others went out to work
or the music for the selection
when the lucky ones went into the showers
now i can hear brahms
and not crying
but one image has never blurred
cross you coming through
that gate and taking me home
oh for
theyre pulling in the net both sides
they want you delivered cross
i cant go back you know that
not after this kind of a move
not even if the soviets took the leash off
but your wife
ill have her out in two days
do you know why mcleod hates you cross
because you are
one of donovan adventurers
the last of the knights templar
you dont stand up straight
you have your hands in your pockets
show no respect
and tonight you are going
to get drunk with a russian
and we are going to get drunk cross
what was it you used to say
falling down drunk
falling down drunk
and then well get maudlin
we will sing i will cry
and then i will tell you
some very funny stories
tell mother
to take the books back to the library
they are overdue
give her my love
and tell her not to carry things
just a man calling his mother mitchell
only two things dont wash mitchell
he called a public phone in washington
and he doesnt have a mother
his whole family died in the camps
you didnt crosscheck each one mitchell
and you cost me a day
you are so damn quick
to write notes to mcleod
put that in mitchell
i traced it back to a max lang
he used a phone booth
in a cafe near the state opera house
you knew that mitchell
but you didnt go there
dead end
it could have been a dead end
but lang needed more change
he asked one of the waiters
the waiter knows him
he is a cellist mitchell
and even more important
he was in the resistance
when cross was liaison
the whole goddamn things redundant
there are no more secrets
at least none worth stealing
it a lower form of life
its reason of existence is
its reason to exist
what the hell are you doing
jesus sergei
you even hide things from yourself
tell me what keeps you from burning out
hmm
you see before you
the last of a race of giants
no no no i mean seriously
seriously
i still believe im still a communist
communist for christ sakes
after what youve seen
youve seen it turn brutal inhuman
no cross ive seen men use it badly
what about the trials the purges
trials purges they are words
you have read somewhere cross
my trial was so grotesque
my hours of interrogation
so terrible that i was numb
it was a kind of
frontal lobotomy without anesthetic
and the labor camps
where men good communists old fighters
men who believed
in the dignity of man above all else
were used as drought animals
to pull logs on frozen feet
that this could be the result
of all i had committed my life to
but baby at that moment
didnt you realize what was happening
at that moment i tried to
understand what had happened to me
most of us there were communists
not stalinists that is why we were there
nothing had happened
to make me renounce myself
i was still a communist
stalin couldnt take it away from me
and now the dull gray stupidity
that sends the tanks into prague
because ii has no imagination
it cant take it from me either
i am still a communist
youre still an idiot
you still serve that dull gray stupidity
and when they pull the wire on me
ill deliver you to them cross
yesterday at 620
sarah cross received a local phone call
the same message as the one monitored
in vienna to someone here in washington
we have no trace on that someone
she left the house at 705
notice the handbag
it big enough to carry a package
say the size of a book without it showing
she went to this storage house
cross kept some middle eastern
furniture and artifacts there
from the time he sent
his wife home from cairo
she signed in got the keys
and went upstairs
she was inside six minutes
she told the inventory clerk
she had to measure a cabinet
she signed nothing out
she left and drove to
the library of congress building
we got no film inside that building
but one of our operatives followed her
the place was crowded with tourists
and it was nearly closing time
now she spoke to no one
deposited nothing
simply wandered through the exhibit halls
however on her way out she had to pass
through a group on a conducted tour
no way to check persons on tour
she exited the building at 749
could be a drop
but did she make her connection
probably someone in that tour group
or she could have picked something up
just as easily
passport ticket escape details
she due to run
i want her place searched
get heck thomas he lives behind her
to invite her for drinks dinner anything
then get a contract thief
to get one of our men in there
brief him on what
he might be expected to find
make it look like a routine housebreaking
the thief s gotta leave prints
well give him shelter
where is cross
nothing he had this in his pocket though
the phone message
cross handwriting ill talk to lang
he dead he wouldnt talk
the car box him in
you stay up here
cross
im tired helen
and ive been very bad company
so thank you and say good night
to heck for me all right

no dont get involved call him warn him
im going over there
jesus christ what happened in there
now
more of your litter mr mitchell
always with access to my superiors
i dont like your type in my streets
ive lost another man
and that bastard thinks it funny
youve lost more
than another man mitchell
youve lost zharkov
that means weve lost cross
it might just be that cross
would be more valuable more cooperative
if we helped him without conditions
we dont think so
alex you dont think you take orders
and so do you zharkov
your orders are the same as mine
put cross on tomorrow flight to moscow
your apparent intimacy with this man
could be interpreted
you know alex you remind me
of someone i used to know
who
funny he never told me his name
like you he was building his career
on a passionate belief in obedience
he took his revolution from books
his marxism from easy-to-swallow
predigested pap
he was building socialism in one country
with the bones from a charnel house
there were a lot of them around in 939
i cant give you any more time cross
two days
my head on a tray
malkin
another keen son of a bitch
better get dressed
you know sergei
i might be better than you in a closed room
dont even think about it
for you
do me one favor cross
run as fast and as far as you can
youve nothing but enemies now
both sides
dont catalog
the excuses through the alphabet
you got it cleaned up
morrison in the hospital
with our own medical people in attendance
it a bad wound
the thief
he ran untraceable so far
no one untraceable
damp down the police search
we dont have the means
over their heads we do
if milne found dead
thatll make for more questions
more questions make for deeper probes
all right
all right but get morrison
out of washington fly him to panama
it is a bad wound
i wont cry if the goof dies
change your mind my friend
ive bad news cross
our sister sarah has gone to her rest
in the peace of christ
with faith and hope of eternal life
let us commend sarah
to the loving mercy of our father
the hunter home from the hill
id buy a plot here soon mr mcleod
it a nice cemetery
you think im responsible for this
cross will
and you think hell come back
dont you
we have evidence that he in moscow
then burn incense in front of it mcleod
and pray
from our end the contract is still open
why the bahnhof
all faces are anonymous in railway stations
youre sure there will be no trouble
he there packed and ready
to make the trip
the negatives and prints
are on their way to moscow
there is a limited interpretation possible
but an accompanying report
clarifies the more shadowed areas
and you are seeing cross off
you might try denial but ii is a weak plea
and at best would leave you
open to charges of incompetence
i suggest you defect
cross zharkov getting off
a soviet ilyushin aircraft
this photo reported to have been taken
from the observation roof
of the moscow airport
lab says could be but no hard evidence
cross here shaking hands with three vips
zharkov in the background
that indicates the three are high-ranking
no telling who these two are
but this one in profile could be stolypin
head of the arab section in moscow
notice this maintenance vehicle
the lab blew it up
and it definitely has the markings
and plate numbers of moscow
now that the first hard evidence
all the rest are blow-ups
to examine everything in detail
weve combed it out tight
the results say it probably is moscow
but could be prague or budapest
okay torn
where zharkov now
cairo
flew directly there from moscow
the opposition is chortling
about some coup
cross has gone over
scorpio still expects him
the frenchman a loser
you could have had that beautiful
abyssinian in the pet shop he was lovely
i like street cats
im going to call you sun tzu
who on earth is sun tzu
a great scholar of war wasnt he cat
i bet he has fleas
it a sign of his independence
i wanted to buy you
something lovely and exotic
you wanted
to buy me something i wanted
all right ill take this one
okay but there no charge lady
if you want 0 give something there
a donation box in front of the office
okay -
should we give him anything special to eat
oh no no you can use anything
any scraps from the kitchen
if he hungry hell eat anything
just a word mr laurier
a few minutes please
mcleod has closed the cross file
is that a polite warning
no im here on my own
id like your opinion
you know my opinion
that airport could be moscow
could be
we think it is
but could be prague or budapest
that careless geography
you uh
you still think cross will come back
if that was moscow theyd hardly let him
pose for few photographs and then leave
would they
i dont know where ii is
and i dont know
what the russians might or might not do
but i know what cross will do
what do you think i should do
sit in mcleod chair and see if it fits
it will be vacant soon
weve got a fix on the thief
his name paul milne he running scared
id hit him tonight cross
he might be gone by tomorrow
he a third-term man
so he down for life
without a killing on his sheets
with that bonus the law should
be breathing hard down his back
but there no heat
the story is around that the man downtown
has been told to cool it
and doesnt like it
the grumble goes high up
you think they could put a fix in
they might if they had a good reason
what this milne form like
housebreaker jimmy and soft-shoe stuff
he never been caught
with a gun or a blade
ive asked around
but nobody says he shot your wife
but you know where to find him
what the hell is this
who are you guys
no jesus that gas
who are you
match
holy mother of god
the job where the woman was killed
i didnt kill her i dont carry a gun
who
i was hired this guy
i dont even know his name
did he tell you what to look for
notebook a small package
paper letters anything with writing on it
did he shoot her
yes
the lady comes in sudden
and she got this gun
she opened up on him and he blasted her
cross
give up smoking thief
it bad for your health
so now you know
now i know
how are you gonna get that guy
if he as big as you say he is
he aint gonna be no lady godiva
miff wilson
cross man it gonna cost you
i can afford it
ive saved enough to buy a mountain
i wont need any more
i know youre out there cross
i can feel it
miff
cross
how are you
great
got a minute let step outside
sure
sure
miff remember the job
you did for me in michigan
i want you to take care of someone for me
hell be coming clown the street
in a black cadillac car
hey nut
what are you doing
theyre beautiful
were going to paris
when
tomorrow well get an apartment
youve got an apartment
a new one
youre crazy you know that
crazy out of your skull
no
i love you
if anything happens to me
if im stopped at the airport
or anything like that
take this to the french embassy
to a gil mousseau
gil mousseau
and give it to him
hell know what to do
no dont ask now
ill tell you soon in paris
are you in trouble jean
no that my insurance policy
you know im old-fashioned enough
to buy you a ring
and i know a place
that makes a good breakfast
see you on monday fil
have a good lunch
bloody martini circuit
damn town runs on olives and small talk
this is it
is this the place
thisll be okay
right on
you drive on
stay here mr mcleod ill see to it
dont move me
call an ambulance
dont move me
mr mcleod sir
quick quick get an ambulance
your flight leaves dulles airport at 750
good luck
thanks
i will see you over there
yeah
mr laurier
you were right scorpio
we should have listened to you
are you going to fulfill your contract now
im out
we still want cross
hell make contact now
with the opposition one last big delivery
youve shown me no proof
that cross was a traitor
youve got a handful of maybes
you cant buy 0 minutes
of my time with that
proof you want proof
what do you think mcleod was
a psychopath
some sick mind that
went about ordering killings
to make his days interesting
no he was a professional
like cross but with a difference
he was honest
he had only two gods efficiency and duty
cross is a double agent
in intelligence all evidence is
of necessity circumstantial
but cross had bank accounts
with considerable assets in zurich
under the number 30-98-7
you can see it written down there
in his handwriting
checked out against a signature
on his american express credit card
in that account alone he had $238000
down this year to $24000
by the way scorpio
you can hold the picture on screen
or close in on it
by using that panel in front of you
his next account turned up in panama
this time under the name
robert crosthwaite
credit $9500
he also has a dallas bank account
under the name gerald cross
assets as of january 73 $60000
i grant you field work demands
trading with the opposition
cross knew men like zharkov but
here he is with raymond hussein in paris
a man who he told us he had never met
here with robert simmonds in beirut
another name that never
appears in his field reports
cross again in an arab guerrilla camp
with salem demoum
all these men were responsible
for receiving substantial information leaks
from unidentified sources
leaks that could have come from cross
so when cross wife
returned to washington
we put her under surveillance
now we have reason to believe
that she was being used as a delivery
now this was filmed by
one of our agents when she left the house
shortly after the message
you monitored in vienna
was called through to washington
she went to this storage house
cross kept some belongings there
then she left went directly
to the library of congress building
we believe to pass a message
it was very crowded there with
tourists she may have made a drop
our agent couldnt be sure
because he wasnt allowed
to photograph in the building
she left there at 549
just before closing time
a picked you up remember
i only talked anne into
sharing an apartment with me
so i had an excuse to be around
i picked you up remember
good night bye-bye
jean
jean
youll have to look me in the eye
when you kill me jean
that wont bother me not this time
no youre a one-talent man frenchman
you took this contract cause you wanted
inside you wanted my job
and you needed a mcleod
to carry your sins for you
i was finished with you cross
i was going home tomorrow with her
she was my way out
im sorry about the girl truly sorry
but i had no part of her plans
she was a czech courier and very good
a lot of hard work went
into collecting this
go ahead scorpio it should be easy
youd be doing both of us a favor
and there an outside chance
they might let you live
two for one
there a room just down the hall
from mcleod office
where grown men play a game
it a bit like monopoly
only more people get hurt
there no good and no bad
jesus
the object is not to win
but not to lose
and the only rule is to stay in the game
