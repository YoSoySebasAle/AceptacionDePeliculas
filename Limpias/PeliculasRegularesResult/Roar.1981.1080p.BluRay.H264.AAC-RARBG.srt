there a fire in the
sky in the morning
when the sun is a
crimson dawning
and the earth is glowing
like a burning ember
who land is this
this is my land
see the shadow of
the eagle in the sunrise
hear the music of the children
in the moon rise
feel the power of the lion
when he roars like thunder
calling who land is this
this is my land
who land is this
this is my land
okay pat hello girl

what that rogue
togar doing here
god togar why today of all days
okay come on let play chase
the closer we get
the more excited i get
it should be great
to see him after three years
yeah i couldnt believe how fast he
split for africa after he got his grant
and the zoo let him take
the little cubs he raised
youd think hed
take the kids he raised
well he was going to send for us
but he said it was too dangerous
he certainly didnt leave
because he didnt love us
you know how
depressed he used to get
with his cats being kept
in cages all the time
i wonder where he is
why dont we find our own way there
youre joking
where could he be
why you guys wait till my family get
here tonight are they gonna love you
sorry hank
and i thought you came to help me
i did i come to speak for
you with that committee
and take you to pick up your family

this is a madhouse
no it just like life you
get the funny with the tragic
just with them you get the
gentle and the ferocious too
be careful of the bad
and enjoy the good
you arent careful enough
for my studies i have to get
as close to them as possible
no actually
the closer you get to them
the more they like you
the safer youd be
but look it going to jump on us
oh no no no
theyre just playing
they like to play the
cat and mouse game
here ill cover you
o big joe
no if you just look at them
or you run at them roar
o god no look

the cats got a little
excited that all
mativo are you okay
youre crazy
oh mativo there robbie
youve never met robbie
he always out guarding
his borders in the daytime
and youre always too afraid to
come and visit me at night
you know he is the
nicest cat in the world
and he also the top cat here
no he the boss
i work for him
hey rob wauw wauw
well come here
i want you to meet mativo
see actually it robbie
im worried about
their whole life is eh
based on dominance
that why we have such a
great harmony here
because robbie is such
a gentle and loving ruler
he also knows he has to
protect the others from outsiders
right now he very
worried about togar
he also worried that if the others
see that he worried or afraid
that then they start challenging him
like theyve been each other all day
no matter how afraid
he is at this moment
he still knows he has
to see this through
the whole meaning of
life is before him mativo
that why you have to help me
help what
why
because i have to help him mativo
and he could get killed
dont worry im
gonna help you
i  i dont think you
should count on me
but only yesterday they
were so happy
now look at them
finally on the verge
of finding paradise
and the only thing
lacking is my family
to share it with me and
togar comes in and wrecking it
here comes trouble
it the grand committee
but prentis is with them
listen my friend
let me talk for you
good morning everybody
i like to open this meeting
by reminding you all
that eh hank
original idea
was a comparative study of
the great cats of the world
and while preserving
the african cats
in their natural habitat
he would raise several cats
of each species
be they african or otherwise
and to become almost
like a member of the pride
hey it has stripes it must be
another tiger or a liger
the mother is a lioness
the father must be a tiger
say hello to henry
the jaguar would ya
not today
what are you trying to prove that you
can have lions socializing with people
no but we cant keep
exterminating them
we cant keep eliminating their land
we cant keep exterminating everything
that we fear or that inconveniences us
let the zoos keep them alive
prentis your actions arent necessary
the government knows
there a better way
theyre moving the people
out of the migration paths
i dont know what kind of person
could look in the eyes at 200 elephants
and put out those lights
theyd run franticly and panic
do you think your
lions would run in panic
well youd better start with me first
no ill start with
the tigers first
thatll teach you for
bringing them to africa
i gotta go help your uncle
they are killing each other
stop it
stop it
togar
togar
you stay out of it you
let robbie take care of him
yeah you guys are smart
you stay out of it
oh great
hey tommy jimmy
oh you all hiding here
oh i dont blame ya
all those those guys are fighting
that my jacket
hank
hank
hank
come on go in the house
and get some bandages
no
oh what the hell wrong with
you all you got a few scratches
youre lucky i told
her i didnt get ya
i think you should take a bus
it goes right by there
oh no i think we should wait
no if you wait until tonight
and he doesnt come
there no other bus for 2 days and
there no place for you to stay here
oh what do we do
will he know where to take us
hey she dry
alice has no milk
listen i have to go change
ill go wait in my boat
okay
oh maybe i come with you
what we do now
just stand up to them
dont let them get
away with anything
you gotta let them see
how strong you are
come on lions we have to clean
the house of madelaine
come on lions

new everything
come on go with your friends
wauw come on

goodbye
come on
why dont worry baby
robbie can handle togar
your father is
tougher than you think
wauw oh come on
youre hurt my hand
see my hand hurt
come on
come on baby
wauw
ive seen that rogue togar
as far away as 200 miles
this is the first time he come in
i have a hunch that robbie
and togar could be brothers
you know bugsy and
robbie were both rogue lions
i found them dying
from battle wounds
now if togar were sick or dying
these guys would probably except him
but the way he is now
arrived
but he cant help that as a loner
he too slow to catch his normal diner
and the hungrier he gets
the more desperate hell get
and the more desperate he gets
the more ferocious he gets
because the only way he
can eat most of the time
is by taking his meals
from whole prides alliance
youve got to be pretty
ferocious to do that
sooner or later he gonna get killed
come on gary
whyd i ever leave madelaine alone
make me believe youll never leave
it couldnt hurt to pretend
whyd i ever leave madelaine alone
billie
whoa dont try touching me
leave that alone

give me that
hey hank come and help me
give my jacket

my head knew it
but my feet didnt
oh hi babe
oh

theyre trying to stay away from togar
come on
whyd they have to be in here
why this open-door policy

all the doors are closed
except for here
and the bathroom
there nothing they can
tear up here or the bathroom

have as many wives as he wants to here
and what does that supposed to mean
i mean how could you be
away from dad for so long
you know that your father
and i were having problems
and we thought it would be
better to be apart for a while
you know absence makes
the heart grow fonder
the heart maybe
but what about the sex glands
sex is all you think
about lately young lady
youd better watch it youre
gonna get your little tail in trouble
someday i hope youll understand the
beauty of restraint and self-denial
well i hope it wasnt restraint and
self-denial that drove dad away
isnt it time that we stop
hey mativo you know what my kids
used to do every time i started to sing
theyd hold their
hands over their ears
and say oh no
