
people always say
there no such thing
as the perfect crime
but i dont agree with that
if you plan things
carefully enough
if you think through
every last detail
if you have nerves of steel
if you can remain calm
no matter what happens
there should be no problem
you cant handle
it really all
a matter of character
of course
if i had any character
i wouldnt have stolen
$2 million from my boss

vic cavanaugh and bill guerrard eat guys like you for lunch

and here the thing
about what weve done
mr arglist

the most talented and handsome
mob lawyer in all of kansas
i really wish you wouldnt do that
come on
come on
that was vic cavanaugh you were hanging out with back there
so what
hey let me ask you a question
is it true that one time
he cut the hand off of somebody who stuck their fingers
up the twazzallah of a dancer over at tease-o-rama
look around at the bar
do you see a lot
of one-armed men in here
because if they chopped off
the hand
of every guy who tried
that with a stripper
half the men in wichita
would be wearing hooks
are you trying to tell me that these are just normal guys you work for
what are you doing here
trying to get my ashes hauled
like everybody else
noël joyeux noëll
it all right
he drunk
sarabeth isnt performing
that function anymore
did she do that
for you oftentimes
throughout your saga
occasionally
not very often mmm-hmm
is she still wearing
flannel to bed
silly me
i thought until i met
and married sarabeth
that it was
only little children
who wore those things with the feet sewn on the bottom
you could have warned me
about that
and im actually
being kind of serious here
i tried to pete
i really did
yeah bullshit i was the end
of your alimony problem
that what i was
like hell you were in love
with my wife
love
someday somebody is going
to tally up the cost
of that particular illusion
hey
yeah
did you ever go and
the strippers
yeah occasionally
yeah
yeah sure
when im really desperate
or completely shit-faced
or generally have my head up my ass
im all those three things
right now baby let go
so how you doing
otherwise buddy
great great really great
drawing a lot of buildings
making a fucking fortune
well listen
i gotta make a phone call
if you just hold down
the fort here and remain calm
remain calm
big mob lawyer
sweet cage
sidney is renata back yet
no she just called
said she on her way
all right listen
when she gets back
you tell her i have that present
that i mentioned for her
earlier and not to leave
okay bye
mr arglist
councilman
i wonder if we might
have a quiet word
actually im kind of
would you be good enough to deliver a message from me to mr
guerrard
wichita is a community
of good people mr arglist
christian people
yeah half of them are in this very bar trying to get laid
that may well be
but my point is some time ago
in a moment of weakness
i did a very foolish thing
and that foolish thing
was photographed
i believe that photo is in the possession of a mr
vic cavanaugh
an associate of yours
who refuses to surrender it
despite several generous
offers for its purchase
the last of which
delivered not 0 minutes ago
people can be stubborn
do you think mr
guerrard would be able to persuade mr cavanaugh
oh
to reconsider if he understood his own interests in the matter
well mr
guerrard is one of the most persuasive men i know
what kind of figures
are we talking about here
are we talking about four
five six
five mr arglist
low five
councilman i think
the photo in question
might be closer than you can possibly imagine
youve given me hope mr
arglist merry christmas
wonderful season isnt it
so full of mutual understanding
yeah
you gotta know the whole culture is in the toilet
if a guy dressed like that can get laid in a place like this
hey youre flipping off the mob here
just so you know
did i mention to you that i really wish you wouldnt do that
yeah
m-o-b mob okay
all right let go
right back at you huh
and there that one too
there see
that my chair in there
you wanna know the truth
i cant fill it
neither could i
if it makes you feel any better
listen charlie
before we go in
there something i have to tell you
it been on my conscience
and you can punch me if you want to
i dont think
im gonna want to
back when you and sarabeth were still married that last year
uh-huh
she and i
were fucking
no kidding
like minks everywhere
kitchen table your bed garage
wow
jesus charlie
we were friends
it doesnt make you angry
actually it makes me curious
makes me wonder
who she fucking now
yo ho ho
merry fucking christmas
guess who i brought with me
ghost of christmas past
ooh
marley
get the fuck in here
hey everybody
merry christmas
merry christmas
hello charlie

and have a piece of pie
hi dottie
no thank you im fine
i just wanted to stop in and wish you all a very merry
screw the pie you old harpy
were here for dinner
turkey cranberry
stuffing the works
thanks yeah
yeah motherfucker
yeah
turkey-alurkey
pathetic
what did you say stan
you two are pathetic
makes me ashamed to be a man
im pathetic
im pathetic
who paid for that
hip replacement
your insurance company
wouldnt cover huh
dad tell me that
and who took care of your mortgage
payments when you were recuperating
and when youre
done with that
maybe you could
explain to me who it was
raised his only daughter
to be a cold gossiping
hypocritical bitch
so spence how you doing
go to hell
dont you talk
to your father that way
he not my father
he didnt even send us presents this year
i hate his guts
is that right charlie
you didnt even send them
any christmas presents
no
christmas is tomorrow
guess what daddy
i was in the christmas play
so what
all you were was tiny tim sister
and you didnt even have any lines
and he didnt even
come to watch
he would have
but mommy didnt send an invitation
im sorry charlie
but maybe you should go now
and perhaps you would give
pete a ride home
sarabeth and the children
will be staying here tonight
okay
yeah
listen sweetie
im gonna go
and im gonna come back and visit you tomorrow
all right
dont believe him melissa
he lying all he ever does is lie
shut up
merry christmas charlie
on the whole
i thought that went well
yeah it good
to see the family
what do you say one more drink
the night is young
all right one more
that it okay one more
melissa really misses you
not spencer he hates me
you just gotta give him time
hell come around
your leaving came
at an awkward age for him
a clean break is best
no a clean break is easiest
on you
oh
are you saying
you have no regrets
dont believe in them
bullshit
everybody has regrets
guys our age
what else is there
i ever tell you
my father was a twin
identical
fraternal
looked a lot alike though
him and my uncle
different temperaments
completely
my father he a cop
by-the-book guy
believed in the law
wanted his only son to be a lawyer
drank in moderation
didnt smoke
kept up his
life insurance premiums
voted in every election
not just for president
let me guess
uncle didnt vote
he said he didnt want
to encourage the bastards
in and out of jail
from the time he was 6
drunk all the time
fucked everything that walked
won a fortune playing poker
lost it all the same way
lost an eye in a fight
half his life
so what youre trying to say is
you take after your uncle
i wasnt finished
my father was 54
when he died of a massive embolism
right here in wichita
my uncle
died the very next day
in a car wreck in california
so the point is
it is futile to regret
you do one thing
you do another
i mean so what
what the difference
same result
how many of these lights
you gonna sit through
see if i tell you
another fucking story
sorry guys were closed
we just want one drink
each
my friend a mobster
you might know that you might not
ill tell you what
ill give you one on the house
if you drink it up and leave
but im not opening
my register back up
thank you gorgeous
do you know where this last drink is going to take me
to that perfect stage
of drunkenness
and then do you know
what im going to do
im going to go straight home
go to bed and dream of you
i dont think id pursue that particular line
you with him
yeah
makes no difference
it okay
it a free country
and any man can dream
anything he wants to dream
and tonight
im gonna dream of you
all right i gotta make a phone call
ill be right back
okay behave yourself
sweet cage

im fucking ecstatic
cant you tell
and in return for this
you want exactly what
nothing
nothing
charlie ive been hearing weird things about you all night
like what
like waiving stage rentals
over at the tease-o-rama
comping dancers drinks
not like you at all
and now this
oh my god
you are leaving town
have you and vic
been dipping into the till
steal from bill
that would be crazy
well then there only one
other possible explanation
youre in love with me
ive always liked you
ive noticed
tell you what
what
give me 45 minutes to close up
then meet me at my apartment
all right
okay
i forgot vic called
said to tell you that you were right and he was wrong
something about a guy you thought might be looking for you
yeah
he is
this was when
about half an hour ago
vic said for you to meet him at the velvet touch as soon as you can
you sure nothing going on
not a thing
dont forget to come back
okay
i wont
vic
harder oh yeah
vic hate to interrupt
yeah baby
come on vic
dont stop
almost there
keep going keep going
vic
fuck oh fuck
mr arglist
oh fuck
ouch that had to hurt
yeah it sure did
what were you doing
i was gonna be sick
but now im okay
different car
yeah it my ex-wife
it a long story
you dont look too good
you want me to call somebody
to come get you
no no im fine
im headed home anyway
okay mr arglist
you go home and get some sleep
and dont forget to put in a good word for me with mr
guerrard
i will officer
officer what
taylor
tyler
but it pretty close though yeah
all right tell you what
when you go home
i dont think id come back out again tonight
if i were you
no i probably wont
good night to you
happy holidays
okay all the best
oh fuck
hello
renata
charlie
listen
you were right
vic and i have been skimming
well duh
i think roy gelles
must have found out
and i think
he might have killed vic
that terrible
so i was thinking it might be best if i left town
i was wondering
if you wanted to come with me
you have the money
what
which
the money were talking about
that you and vic
have been skimming
try to keep up okay
no vic had it
so your idea is that we should run away together and be poor
i thought id give it a shot
here the thing though
roy wouldnt have killed vic unless vic told him where the money was
which means roy has it now
well why dont you sneak up
behind him
and hit him over the head
with something and take it
me you want me
to sneak up on roy gelles
charlie think of this
as your defining moment
this is your chance
to be something more
like a murderer
this is your chance
to start over charlie
our chance
if that what you want
if that what i want
listen i just gotta
ask you one thing
what
i didnt have
a specific question planned
nothing sorry

you and me together

bill guerrard
is around here somewhere
oh
yeah oh
where is he
oh
hide behind the door and shoot him when he comes in
you dont happen to have
any bullets for this do you
shotgun behind the bar
as wichita falls
so falls wichita falls
i like that
and im gonna give your pussy-whipped pal arglist
another 5 minutes
to rescue your sweet ass
after which time im going to assume his brain overruled his pecker
well bill
that just not enough time
he lives way across town
yeah well that your bad luck
i should be home in kansas city
watching my kids
open their christmas presents
now i gotta waste
the whole fucking day
iooking for that nitwit
ill never understand lawyers
i mean
here theyve got a license to steal from the general public
all legal and aboveboard
but is that enough
fuck no
they gotta steal from their friends
anybody
but a fucking lawyer
would consider
the consequences right
that i would
for an absolute certainty
castrate that son of a bitch
with a butter knife
and that would give
a normal person pause
but not a lawyer
it defies the imagination
you know
how a woman like you could throw in with a couple of farthammers
like cavanaugh and arglist
cavanaugh he doesnt
have the brains
to pull off
something like this
and arglist
he doesnt have the guts
maybe that where you
came in huh
what did you do
did you encourage them both
suppose you do luck out
and you get clear of wichita
with all that money
at some point
youre gonna have to get rid of at least one of the peckerwoods
and then what do you got
a dick with no brain
or a brain with no dick
you know what bill
you seem awfully tense
and i have this idea
of what might help you relax
you do huh
mmm-hmm
that you arglist
drop the gun
step away from the desk
and put your hands up
charlie
dont be a fucking idiot
youve been watching
too many stupid old movies
why would i drop my gun
i dont know bill
because i got
a big fucking shotgun
and ill blow your head off
well if you could do that
youd be me
and id be a pissant lawyer
with a case of the shakes
jesus charlie
just shoot him
if he was gonna
pull the trigger
hed have done it when he came
through the door girlie
it something they dont
teach you in law school
which is a shame
because
get his gun charlie
get his gun
he dead renata
the fuck he is
sidney loads that with birdshot
why would he i mean
charlie
from a liability standpoint
that doesnt make any sense at all
charlie
well arglist
now youve truly gone
and shit in your nest
all right girlie
you first
mr guerrard
what going on
come here
bitch
charlie
i dont know why
i even bother with kansas
do i hear an amen
my old man tried
to tell me
that id be better off
starting a church
and letting jesus pay
for the mortgage
in this sorry-ass
backwards state
i wouldnt listen
instead
i put my faith
in naked women and hand jobs
which have a proven track
record everywhere but here
and now ive been disfigured
by a whisky-dick lawyer
who imagines he can kill me with a shotgun loaded for snake
serves me right
that all i can say
all right girlie
this is the one
that gonna kill you
bill
yuck
i will say after this
the holidays are never gonna feel quite the same to me
how the foot
shorter
you dont happen to have
any morphine
or demerol or anything
do you
try this
i have to give you credit
charlie
you took your own sweet time
rising to the occasion
but in the end
you did the deed
deed you did
you really came through
charlie
the odds were definitely
against it but somehow
you managed to be
the last man standing
i know what i wanted
to ask you
what
where are you actually from
originally
why do you keep
asking questions charlie
what it got to do
with anything
i was just curious
wanted to know
where you came from
it a long story
charlie
i think weve got plenty of time to get to know each other better
dont you
yeah
i guess we do
it just you and me now
charlie
to the victor go the spoils
you saved my life
charlie
youre a different man
just like i promised
can you feel it
yes i can
charlie
whatd you do
oh damn stupid fuck
you stupid fucking whore
you dumb dumb fuck
your mother again
shit
hi charlie yeah
who else
loans me her camper and fails to mention that it out of gas
if youve got a gas can
you can siphon some from me
charlie
i dont want you
to take this the wrong way
but youre about
the nicest guy i know
im awfully sorry to hear that sidney
but thank you
