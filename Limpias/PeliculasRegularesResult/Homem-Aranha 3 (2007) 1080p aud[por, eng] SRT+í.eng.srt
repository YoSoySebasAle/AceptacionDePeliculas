no
i wanted to say yes but i said no
i wasnt ready neither was he
so we took our time

with nothing to count on but love
a man has to be understanding
and put his wife before himself

i hope youve considered
a proper proposal
your uncle had it all planned

in his bathing suit
and i didnt look too bad myself
we were very good swimmers
and it was a beautiful day
and he said
let swim to the island
and at the island we found
a perfect spot by an old tree
and we lay down
and looked up at the sky
and then he said
close your eyes may
and i did
and then he said open them
and i did
and he was holding this ring
dazzling
in front of me
i thought it was the sun

like the fact that spider-man
wont let you help your poor daughter
it just
that doesnt seem right to me
look i wanna kill the spider
you wanna kill the spider
together he doesnt stand a chance
interested
yeah
so
where to
all new york is holding its breath
as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold
just 30 minutes ago
police came across
this startling sight
a young woman
held hostage in a taxi
suspended 80 stories
above the ground
in what appears to be
a giant web
every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage
has been thwarted
by the sandman
compounding the danger
is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure
early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited spider-man
but he has now been identified
as something entirely different
the hostage has been identified
as mary jane watson
an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on broadway
were now going to take you
live to the scene
with jennifer dugan jennifer
were only about
00 feet away now hal and
wait there seems to be
some kind of activity in the web
they seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering
spider-man being challenged
to some sort of confrontation
and that raises serious questions
about what kind of chance hed
stand against such overwhelming
harry
i need your help
i cant take them both
not by myself
you dont deserve my help
harry
she needs us
get out
if i may sir
ive seen things in this house
ive never spoken of
what are you trying to tell me
the night your father died
i cleaned his wound
the blade that pierced his body
came from his glider
i know youre trying to defend
your father honor
but there no question
that he died by his own hand
i loved your father
as i have loved you harry
as your friends love you
look
spider-man spider-man
spider-man
he seems to have
come out of nowhere
to answer the prayers of the city
just when all hope
seemed to be lost
peter theyre gonna kill us both
im gonna get you out of this
watch out
hey parker
my god eddie
my spider-sense is tingling

and i spent a lot of nights
wishing i could take it back
im not asking you to forgive me

i didnt choose to be this
the only thing left of me now
is my daughter

whatever battle we have raging
inside us we always have a choice
my friend harry taught me that
he chose to be the best of himself
it the choices
that make us who we are
and we can always choose
to do what right
