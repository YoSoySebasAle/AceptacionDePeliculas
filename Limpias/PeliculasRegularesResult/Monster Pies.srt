traditional movie monsters
who find love with each other while
acting out romeo and juliet
our main characters are frankenstein
born as a monster
but not accepted for being different
and the wolfman trying to overcome
his new changes
as he enters into the world
of the monsters
theyre not out to hurt anybody
though theyre cruelly misjudged
and hunted down by the villagers
who fear them

with frankenstein like in a way
to get closer to him
