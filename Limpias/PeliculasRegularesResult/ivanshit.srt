for one day
one horribly traumatic day
in which my client suffered
irreparable psychological
damage to her self-esteem
oh and she keeps
the mercedes
what
bullshit
well we could drag this
before a judge
if you think that
would be more favorable
that would put your client
business under scrutiny

random repossessions
give her what she wants
i cant believe you

youll go off
youll get lonely
some moron hunk will come along
youll think it true love
youd never been so sure
of anything in your life

he will pull a
conceive and leave
and then it my
life all over again
mom i am not that stupid

heard of us
im surprised because
we so seldom hear from you
well i suppose
i might be a little late
with this year return
maybe even the last 7
mother im stunned
i had no idea you would
evade your responsibilities
as a us citizen
shut up miss conners
weve never seen
a dime from you either
look i know
what must have happened
you see i always
assumed that my returns
were filed by my husband
oh
which one
look just because
ive had some trouble
with my personal
relationships--
ms conners
how you earn your money is
of no interest to the irs
now how can i put this in
language youll understand
we just want our cut
how much
with interest and penalties
the total comes to $247 8
what
oh no no
no no no
ha ha im afraid
that amount is in addition
to what used to be
in your accounts
your latest divorce settlement
arrived this morning
thanks
but that everything
it not all bad
we give you a full
90 days to pay
or

with criminal charges
for felony tax
evasion and fraud
good luck

that $ 300 each
wow have a nice life
with that princess
ill economize
sure
you can do your own hair
your own nails
they actually have some
great shoes at wal-mart
ugh all right
one more con
but only if we do it right
what does that mean
it means no more
small-time crap
it has to be big
one big final score
to pay off the irs
and set me up on my own
