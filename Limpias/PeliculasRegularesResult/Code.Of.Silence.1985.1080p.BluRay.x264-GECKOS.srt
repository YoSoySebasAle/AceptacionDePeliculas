eddie
the prowler
standard weapons complement
includes one recoilless rifle
two mark-9 grenade launchers
and twin 50-caliber machine guns
i have sufficient firepower
to neutralize
a wide variety
of security threats
as you can see this lightweight
handheld control unit enables you
to direct my movements
while simultaneously operating
the various weapons systems
in manual or full-automatic mode
in full-automatic mode my infrared
heat sensors and doppler radar
mean that i am able to acquire
moving targets at night
without assistance
from the operator
that concludes
the program demonstration
now our factory representative
will discuss the features
of the simplified mark-2
handheld control system
after the gyros are locked
any movement of the hand controller
is duplicated by the prowler
the simple control system means even
semiskilled employees can operate--
he talking about you cusack
so pay attention
youve all got to qualify on this
it the future
as they say
even a child can operate it
youre looking at the perfect cop
the damn thing follows orders
another gun without a brain
the machine guns can be linked to
the laser range and guidance system
for target orientation
if the commander would like
to pick someone to elude prowler
ill show you
our target acquisition system
halt police
throw down your weapon
we will not harm you please place
your hands above your head
drop it
you are under arrest
please do not resist
thank you for your cooperation
