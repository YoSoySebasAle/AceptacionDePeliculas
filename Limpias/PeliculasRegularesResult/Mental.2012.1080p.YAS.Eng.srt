
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
with songs they have sung
for a thousand years
the hills fill my heart
with the sound of music
my heart wants to sing
every song it hears
my heart wants to beat
like the wings of the birds that rise
from the lake to the trees
oh no
my heart wants to sigh
but i was winning
like a chime that ﬂies
on a church on a breeze
to laugh like a brook
when it trips and falls
oh no
over stones on its way
to sing through the night
like a lark who is learning to pray
i go to the hills
when my heart is lonely
oh my god
mum in the backyard
we know
coral
do you often feel
that life is not worth living

some children are less trouble
than others i reckon
i was lucky
my children are naturally tidy
quiet too i bet
well
i was strict
but children need that
i posted a daily roster
of their responsibilities
you sure youre shirley sister
were ten years apart
i still think of shirley as
the baby of the family the one
who got away with everything
but she a dear thing
with a sweet trusting nature

it all coming together
the life of shirley moochmore
ripper

youre onto them now michelle
theyre gonna have
to think of something else
none of youse are mental
except you michelle
youre bonkers
but the rest of youse
nah
but if were not mental
were just unpopular
ill show you the meaning
of the word mental
page 354
obsessive compulsive disorder
yeah that her
stubborn stingy possessive
uncreative and unimaginative
devoted to meaningless activities
that require being tidy and meticulous
it is her
yeah
theyre all in there
the whole neighbourhood
see that delusional over there
he mowed the same strip
of grass yesterday
he cant help himself
looklook
look at him look
oh upset the delicate balance of
their fantasy world they go nuts
but they cant all be mental
what are the odds of that
youse have stumbled on the meaning
of life and you dont even know it
america
europe
asia
and all the way down here is australia
alone
isolated
ever wonder why
why were down here
well
we were a penal colony
well that the cover story yeah
but historically where have
they always sent the loonies
as far away as possible
you cant get any further away
than australia
we werent a penal colony
we was a lunatic asylum
our ancestors were loonies
and this is the result
well have a look around
there no such thing as normal
it just different shades of mental
your totally mental are
in the lunatic asylums
the rest of them are
the delusionals
borderlines compulsives
paranoids schizoids
make up australia as we know it
were nothing but a living experiment
in madness under constant observation
by the psychiatric community of the world
but
if were all under observation
and mental
how come were allowed to leave
kylie minogue she left
she practically british
in any experiment
there test mice and control mice
control mice are marked in some way
and sent off into the normal world
as comparisons
kylie minogue a control mouse
cate blanchett control mouse
russell crowe
a control mouse outta control
rupert murdoch nicole kidman
the list of control mice is endless

theyre scared of me
im the next step to human evolution
a next step to perfection

and ken in dolphin heads
and me dad
he was a big man
a rogue like old joe kennedy was

mayor of nothing but a shithole town
with an insane wife
and five mental daughters
so you didnt get what you want
big deal
were girls dad
were gonna be girls
for the rest of our lives
so why dont you just shut up about it
and we want you to start coming home
and talking to us about things
and taking us places
like the beach and that
like we were a real family
because we are one
if you think about it
and we want you to stop
seeing other women
because everybody knows about it
mum did too
it just embarrassing
i would never have dared
not in a million years
dared to talk to my father like this
one wrong look and he thrashed
the living daylights outta me
yeah
he was a bad father too
dad
there werent only kennedy boys

but at least were not crazy
oh i cant--
you take it back
no
take it back
you hear voices
you hear your daughter voice
calling you from inside a dead shark
nobody
can save you from that
the spirit lives on after the body
dont you know that
but it can be trapped
it screams out in pain
but no-one is hearing it
a mother never stops hearing it
her spirit gotta be in the ocean
where she died
ive got to get it outta me head
come on
no
no
well
you promised me
he knows youre coming shaz
get out of here
while you still can
go shaz

dont you know what it like
to care for someone
more than you care for yourself
ripper

sorry love
youre out of a job
im closing the shark show
taking off tonight
cheers love
you all feel bad about shaz i know
but you done the right thing
theyll let her out
they always do
then it starts again
why dont you just give her the shark
she never gets that shark
she never gets to forget what she done
what did she do
she looked the other way
she wants to protect grace now
where was she then
maybe shell die
there a possibility
she cant take another 2 months
searching for me itll kill her
or shell kill herself
shaz would never do that
that a fact
a little girl once told me
she jumped off a verandah
because she didnt like
the look of her own face
imagine if that little girl knew real pain
grief
despair
maybe shed out her throat too
yeah
or her wrists
or try to hang herself in the bathroom
with the elastic from her pajamas
maybe this time well be lucky
and therell be no five-minute checks
and we can all be free
i had a family
we used to sit around a table and
talk about things
the future
