
i grew up slowly
beside the tides and marshes
of a carolina sea island
we lived in a small white house
won by my great-great-grandfather
winston shadrach wingo
in a horseshoe game
last one around the tree is a ninny
joop joop joop come here
boys boys careful now
ill race you tom
wait up luke
there are families
who live out their entire lives
without a single thing of interest
happening to them
dont run so fast tom
ive always envied those families
luke

the child of a beautiful woman
i was also a shrimper son
in love with the shape of boats
luke he pushing me
im not pushing her
quit pushing her
you know that
as a small boy i loved
to navigate my father shrimp boat
between the sandbars
there a rock pile up ahead
i suppose henry wingo
would have made a pretty good father
if he hadnt been such a violent man
from my mother
i inherited a love of language
and an appreciation of nature
she could turn a walk around the island
into a voyage of purest discovery
as a child i thought she was
the most extraordinary woman on earth
i wasnt the first son
to be wrong about his mother
i am sick and tired of you
leave me alone
never showing me
any respect in my own house
wait for me
listen to me lila
i dont know when my parents
began their war against each other
youre running too fast for me
move it tom
but i do know the only prisoners they took
were their children
wait you guys
my shoes are falling off
keep up savannah
when my brother sister and i
needed to escape we developed a ritual
okay jump
we found a silent soothing world
where there was no pain
a world without mothers or fathers
we would make a circle bound by flesh
and blood
and water
and only when we felt our lungs betray us
would we rise toward the light
and the fear of what lay in wait for us
above the surface
i held my breath longer than you
that was fun let do it again
i did better than yall
no you didnt
all this was a long time ago
before i chose not to have a memory

here you go darling
now this is food lila
eat up children
so your mother fed him dog food huh
yeah he even asked for a second helping
maybe that where you got
your sense of humor from your mother
oh very funny very funny
she called today
very concerned about savannah
dont believe a word she says
she a liar
that interesting
she said you tell lies about her
that figures
you know i saw herbert woodruff
come out of your office the other day
he sure can play the fiddle
youre changing the subject again
what wrong with him
just kidding
still it hard to believe that anybody
that makes that kind of money
has troubles
are you really that provincial
oh hell yes so is savannah
when we were kids the only way
wed get off our island was by boat
we grew up on a tidal plain
a tidal plain what does that mean
tides mean everything lowenstein
they measure everything
moods seasons time to plant
to fish
to mate
it primitive biological clocks
ticking all over the place
hmm
sounds like a nice way to live
what else did she say my mother
she said that she was the one
who encouraged savannah to become a poet
is that true
jesus christ
that woman has no shame
you want to know
how she encouraged savannah to write
by burning the journals
she kept as a child
why would she burn them
because savannah was being disloyal
writing about our hideous family
what hideous about your family
are you asking me to be disloyal
if that what it takes
to help savannah yes
arent we about done
what time is it
mm-mm mm-mm
we still have a few more minutes
what did savannah do
after your mother burned her journals
well she took her finger
and she wrote in the sand
and then she wrote in the air
she began writing poetry
so mother wouldnt understand it
so in a sense your mother was right
she did help to create a poet
oh bullshit lowenstein
she created a schizophrenic
my mother shouldve raised cobras
not children
can you tell me anything good
about your parents
no
try
okay they did two really good things
luke and savannah
incredible people
passionate
defiant
not for sale
what about you
oh i was a courteous southern boy
who did what he was told
i was responsible and normal and dull
i dont know what normal is
and youre anything but dull
compared to them i was
meanwhile your sister in the hospital
and your brother dead
you must be doing something right
you can go now
hmm
time up
good night
night
women and men
both little and small
cared for anyone not at all
they sowed their isnt
they reaped their same
sun moon stars rain
children guessed but only a few
and down they forgot as up they grew
so this began a series
of confessional days
when i spun out the history
of savannah past
in order to keep her alive
by the second week
id developed the first symptom
of the new york willies ‒
the guilt that every out-of-towner feels
if he not improving
his mind every goddamn second
i made a list of things i should do ‒
museums plays
run six miles in under 50 minutes
see three foreign films
all at the same time
anything not to feel guilty
tom how old was savannah
when you first realized
something was wrong with her
about seven or eight
anything specific happen
well
my mother had a baby at home
it was stillborn
she told us it died cause we were bad
anyway we were gonna
bury it the next day
so dad wrapped it in some towels
and put it in the freezer
that night
i got up to get a drink of water
and i saw savannah sitting
in the rocking chair
with the dead baby in her arms
she was saying
youre the lucky one
because you dont have to live with us
did you say anything to her
the next day i did
but she didnt remember anything about it
when i told her what happened
all she said was
why would anyone do
a crazy thing like that
hmm
so
you were her memory even then
i guess so
uh-huh
goddamn locks
im coming im coming
yo
oh what what was that again
im learning to speak the language
of the natives here
hiya sally how it going down there
well it just sort of
blowing up a storm
oh i got the girls drawings
did they get my letters
yep they loved them
oh good did you get my letter
uh tom
i dont think it a good idea
for you to come home this weekend
why not
well im not ‒ im just not sure
that i want to see you right now
i um
i have a lot to figure out
uh-huh
what the point tom
i mean let face it
we dont make each other
feelgood anymore
right
look um
i didnt want to tell you this
on the telephone
i wanted to tell you before you left
but the way you left
there wasnt any time
what did you want to tell me sally
what his name
what his name sally
the man must have a name
jack cleveland
oh no
oh no
jesus sally jesus
jack cleveland
you mean that aging pompous hippie
from the hospital
who still rides a motorcycle
oh for christ sake sally why him
why him
because he knows how he feels about me
oh sally
this is too difficult
to talk about over the phone
uh
just think about it carefully
okay
i hardly think about anything else
good night tom
sally
what
are you really in love
im not sure
i might even be doing this to hurt you
i gotta go
dear sally
i wish the words i love you
werent so difficult for me
ive missed you
i miss touching you
i dont know what keeps me
at such a distance
im sorry i disappoint you sally
but youre right to feel that way
how else could you react to half a man
how could you not be disappointed
hell i seem to disappoint anyone
who tries to find the best in me
tom
maam
come on in here
come on lie beside me come on
youre the only wingo
who gonna amount to something
luke cant do it because he isnt smart
savannah cant do it
because she just a girl
but luke smart mama
not like you
or me
nobody knows this yet
but im an amazing woman
do you believe that
yes maam
im not gonna die in a house like this
i promise you that
something else tom
i love you
more than i love any of them
but mama
i do
i cant help it
youre my favorite
now
this is gonna be our little secret
you keep a secret
yes maam
okay
can i go now
not till you tell me you love me
i love you mama
it took me 20 years
to tell luke and savannah about my secret
and when i did
they just fell on the floor howling
you see my mother took
each of them into that room
and told them exactly the same thing
hmm
why did you tell me that story
to prove that lila wingo would ‒
just to show why
savannah could never trust her
you mean why you could never trust her
oh well im sorry
that the wrong story
let just skip it
and ill try to think of a better one
what bothering you
global warming acid rain
the national debt
oh and my wife having a goddamn affair
with a heart surgeon in south carolina
hmm
jesus i feel like such an idiot
god i never even knew it was going on
maybe you werent paying attention
oh bullshit
now let face it lowenstein
women are more devious than men
yeah youre great at hiding things
you keep secrets you smile when you lie
you know you expect a man
to be a tower of strength
and when it turns out he got
a few weaknesses and some insecurities
what do you do you turn around
and goddamn it you betray him
so you feel that your mother betrayed you
i was talking about my wife
oh
oh god i hate this freudian crap
and it not your job to listen
to my problems anyway
and if you dont mind id like to go
youre free to leave anytime you want
good
goddamn shrink
who was i kidding
i was a champion at keeping secrets
better than any woman
until susan lowenstein came along
a man who never talked
now is doing nothing else
her questions making me
as dizzy as her perfume
excuse me
would you like to dance
who me

no no no
you dont have to apologize lowenstein
teenagers by definition
are not fit for society
that true
um
bernard wants to play football that why
i brought you up here to meet him
i thought that maybe you could coach him
a couple of days a week
you see
he never gets a chance to play
while his father around
so uh herbert on tour
i thought that maybe ‒
is this a job offer
yes
yes and i would insist on paying you
what would you consider a reasonable rate
what are your rates
i charge $50 an hour
fine ill take it
you must be a very good coach
forget it lowenstein
im not a charity case yet
tell bernard well start on monday

good night
first rule of thumb bernard
never be late
i didnt want to come anyway okay
well your mother thinks
you wanna play ball
is there any truth to that
maybe maybe not
so where do you coach mr wingo
hillbilly country
oh were a little class-conscious
are we
where do you go to school miss porter
phillips exeter smart-ass
you didnt get to play last year did you
howd you know
because any rich snot-nosed punk
that would dare call his coach a smart-ass
wouldnt get to haul water
let alone play
with your attitude
you belong in the bleachers kid
when you get ready to play football
you get my number from your mother
catch
hey you need help
this is not an attractive look
for a middle-aged man
when are you going to take me shopping
say did you ever hear
of a woman named renata halpern

i dont know but she writes good poems
about growing up jewish in brooklyn

youve known about this the whole time
havent you
tom i find it difficult
conducting a session ‒
now this is not a session damn it
im asking you a question
youre doing a shitty job of evading it
tell me who wrote this book
what so disturbing about it
that not the issue
the issue is why you didnt tell me
it wasnt my place to tell you
your sister specifically ‒
youre a piece of work lowenstein
you know i come in here
and i tell you everything
and you withhold
important information from me
maybe it you who withholding
this is not about me
then why are you so upset
because i dont like being lied to
i dont like secrets
i could report you to the authorities
have your goddamn license suspended
tom stop acting like a petulant child
you havent answered
my question lowenstein
tell me who wrote this book
why dont you tell me
oh ill tell you
my sister wrote it
it all about my goddamn family
if my mother ever read it shed rip out
savannah pancreas with her teeth
why why would she do that
what are you all hiding
i dont answer any more questions
till you answer mine
then why dont you sit down and listen
that is if youre not too exhausted
by your temper tantrum
mm-hmm
oh shit
the first few times
savannah came to see me
she told me her name was renata halpern
oh jesus
she even crazier than i thought
shut up or i wont continue
she told me her father was a furrier
and that both parents
were survivors of the holocaust
now she couldnt fool me
about being jewish
but what fascinated me was why
she chose to be the child of survivors
what was she trying to survive
what is she trying to survive
well how the hell would i know
i think you do
come on lowenstein youre supposed
to be answering my questions
why did she do it
something about writing that book
made her want to become someone else
and that was okay with you
it was not okay with me
i told her unless she resolved
her own problems
no one else shed become
would have a chance
is this what people pay you to do
turn them into someone else
youre not listening to me
you havent heard ‒
bullshit
what do you think im doing here
complaining avoiding pointing fingers
oh fuck you lowenstein
fuck you and sigmund freud
and my sister renata halpern

savannah told me that her children book
came out of a dream

ive made in a long time
come on let go to the movies
the movies
yeah come on
rare footage
from the savannah wingo archives
how wonderful
where did you find this
i was snooping around and i found em
you know savannah mustve kept them
wait wait who that luke
yeah that luke
he was always horsing around
oh here our graduation
what from grade school right
yeah right grade school
did you always jump in
with your clothes on
yes
as a matter of fact we did
and that your mother lila
yeah that miss lila
mm-hmm
she was very pretty
she still is
so who took these pictures
my father
you see bought this camera one year
thought hed give up shrimping
the only thing he was good at
and make a fortune in film
dont ask me how
savannah said that um
your father was always losing money
is that true
oh that an understatement
henry wingo had the opposite
of the midas touch
everything he touched turned to shit
what is that tell me what that is
that is one of my father
all-time cockamamie schemes
what
well you see
he bought this gas station
he thought this tiger
would draw people by the thousands
all it did is scare em the hell away
uh-huh
the only one that wasnt afraid
of that animal was luke
he fed him
took care of him
he had a lot of courage
what about you
i didnt need any i had luke
oh this is our island
the only place dad ever really owned
at the time this was taken
it was worthless
not to luke though
to him it was
the most precious place in the world
when he was older he went to vietnam
he came back a hero
swore hed never leave it again
he didnt
what happened
my mother got the island
in the divorce settlement
she immediately sold it
to the government for a lot of money
they wanted to put up a power plant
luke went crazy he made some threats
the government laughed
he blew up a construction site
they quit laughing
and then
he went on waging his own private war
hurt some people
savannah and i tried to stop him
but the government stopped him first
shot him in the head bingo
would you like a cold drink
maybe a beer huh
how did you deal with his death
i shut down like a broken motor
hmm
and according to the southern way
still no tears
oh i cry sometimes lowenstein
i cry at weddings at the olympics ‒
im real big at the national anthem
but not over luke
what the hell for
it wouldnt bring him back
no but it might bring you back

most restrained thing i could say

and part of me says that no life will work
if i cant make this one right

she stopped being our mother
told us morning would come and everything
would look nicer in the sunlight
and after we buried the bodies
i went in there to check on savannah

while youre playing with a dimwit dog
when my father came home for dinner

of course not
herbert not jewish
hey i dont mind
everybody in my family doing it
there luke up there somewhere
you stupid asshole
when i was a kid
he seemed like a god to me
how do you see him now
like a man
with limitations like the rest of us
except you lowenstein youre perfect
i am far from it
no
oh i look back on my life
and i realize
that ive been paralyzed for the last
god knows how many years
i mean how could i have stayed
in a marriage like that
well you had a son
oh yeah
there were reasons but
none of them good enough
i just
i just never thought that
this was possible
and now i
i wake up in the morning
and i spend my whole day thinking
isnt it nice just to feel good
i mean i hear you
walk down the hall towards me
i cant stop smiling
i smile all the time
i love you lowenstein
can we go back to the cabin
and make love all night
you still have a lot to learn
about the outdoors
im glad you brought me here
hey lowenstein says
she gonna let you go home soon
hmm i think im ready
what about you when are you going home
well i dont know
sally and i are having problems
oh no im sorry tom
i thought i might stay up here
for a while
you in new york
i cant imagine that
you could never leave the south
well you did
yeah
but i dont love it the way you do
come get me
you have to go under the water
hello
oh hi sally
uh-huh
she called you
well
we knew this day would come didnt we
but youre never quite
prepared for it
just hold me please
i feel like im dying
one of the things
i love about you is that
youre the kind of guy
wholl always go back to his family
oh
i gotta find me a nice jewish boy
you guys are killing me
you okay about going home
i think so
good
i started a new book of poems
oh good
im calling it
the prince of tides
and i dedicated it
to somebody very special
oh luke would appreciate that savannah
i dedicated it
to my brother tom wingo
my memory
oh thank you sweetheart
oh thank you
lowenstein why are you making it so hard
you just love her more
admit it
no lowenstein
just longer
we spent our last few hours together
at the rainbow room
dancing a slow dance
just like in my dream
i held her in my arms
as i told her that it was her doing
that i could go back
six weeks before
i was ready to leave my wife my kids
i wanted out of everything
but she changed that
she changed me
for the first time
i felt like i had something to give back
to the women in my life
they deserved that
daddy
daddy home
hi daddy
daddy did you bring me anything
so i returned to my southern home
and my southern life
and it is in the presence
of my wife and children
that i acknowledge my life my destiny
i am a teacher
a coach
and a well-loved man
and it is more than enough
in new york i learned that i needed
to love my mother and father
in all their flawed outrageous humanity
and in families
there are no crimes beyond forgiveness
but it is the mystery of life
that sustains me now
and i look to the north
and i wish again that there were
two lives apportioned to every man
and every woman
at the end of every day
i drive through the city of charleston
and as i cross the bridge
thatll take me home
i feel the words building inside me
i cant stop em
or tell you why i say em
but as i reach the top of the bridge
these words come to me in a whisper
i say them as prayer
as regret
as praise
i say
lowenstein
lowenstein
