and was wondering if you would
give my tape to one of your artists
violet that is so cute
now let me tell you about me
my name is wendy i moved to new york
when i was 2 to be a dancer
but i broke my big toe
i got knocked up by this actor
who dumped me to join the peace corps
so for the last 6 years i been
raising my daughter all by myself
and then two weeks ago she tells me
that she is a bisexual
and that she hates me more
than any person on this planet
sarcastic now tell me
how i can help you please
because i am dying
to make your dreams come true
emf unbelievable
you dont take the tape
unless it comes from an agent
but i cant get an agent
until i get published
if we were to listen to that tape
that would give you grounds
for a copyright or plagiarism lawsuit
it just a little tape
all i want is someone to sing my songs
welcome to the music business

i think it sweet
violet so do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car
what can i say im a romantic
you think this is romantic
well you may not be feeling it now
but i think one day
youll be on stage singing
a song about this very night
mmm when we were downwind
from a trash barge
yeah catchy title hum a few bars
sorry to disappoint you
but im a songwriter not a singer
when i get on stage i freeze
what if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice
ok if the fate of the free world
depended on me singing
maybe
all i ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark
and hear someone great
singing my songs
i wanna be the one
who writes the music
i remember the first time my mother
played me bridge over troubled water
by simon and garfunkel
i remember exactly
what she was wearing
i remember exactly how her hair smelled
i remember exactly how i felt
and every time i hear that song
i remember exactly
what she was wearing
and exactly how her hair smelled
and exactly how i felt
cause the great songs last forever
so what the problem
well
they tell me the only way
to get my songs heard
is to go out there
and sing em myself
so we have to try fix
this little problem straightaway
