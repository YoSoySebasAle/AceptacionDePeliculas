them to stay sober hey pink

youve been mighty scarce
since you moved here to griffin

well
let me take a good
look at you susan girl

you havent changed a bit
you look even better than ever
youre wounded
oh it nothing dont worry about it
let me bandage it for you
well all right
you always were a
good nurse susan
a good wife too
for that matter
our boy our son is with logan
yes
six years
guess he not a baby anymore is he
no he a big boy now
i was hoping to see him
sam he doesnt
know youre his father
well he will soon enough
try to understand sam
everything is different now
nothing is different susan not with me
so logan left you all alone eh
well he he ought to
know better than that
a beautiful woman like you shouldnt
be all by herself like that it not safe
and that how i lost you remember
you cant really believe that
well it true isnt it
a little sweet talk from logan
when my back was turned and
well you just got a
little mixed up honey
sam you went
away to prison for life
you knew they werent
going to keep me there
couple years and id had enough
came out looking for my wife
sam im not your wife
you knew about the divorce
well now we wont worry about that
look i understand honey
this this thing with logan
was just a a handy way out
for you while i was gone
logan had nothing to do with it
sam our marriage was through when you
first started making your way with a gun
logan took you when
i was behind bars
when i couldnt fight for you
well im out now and
im taking you back
it finished between us
is it susan
let see if it is
well logan is
logan is got a stronger
hold on you than i figured
too bad we dont have more time
therell never be time not for us
youll come around
susan when logan is dead
ill be back you can
count on that honey
he was here
yes
we drove all night
ill put him to bed
he came here to kill you
somehow i never really believed hed try
he said hed be back
weve got to move logan weve got to
go some place where hell never find us
no use running
besides i just paid the bank
we cant stay here now
he coming back to kill
you and to take sammy
he found us here
hed find us anywhere
best chance is to see he
caught and sent back to prison
cant they get him without you
who knows him as well as i do
i was praying youd never
have to use that gun again
i know
i hope you dont
have to kill him
is the last thing i want to do
logan
dont take any chances
i dont want you to kill him
but if it has to be you or him
if it comes to that
i want you to come back
oh i want you to come back
you fellas shoot then
ask questions later en
we was certain you was ward
im sorry to disappoint you
say ive had enough of this
anyway let head back for town
what the matter leach
beginning to wish you were back
at the saloon throwing out drunks
youd better lay off
you must be part of sheriff
moore handpicked posse
yeah we are what are
you doing out here all alone
where the rest of
the posse tucker
we lost the trail the sheriff split
us up into bunches to cut sign
this tracking is supposed to
be your long suit isnt it diggs
ive tracked a sight of them
but this fella ward is might tricky
did you know was sam ward we was after
yeah i knew
id like to come up against him
maybe youll get a chance
keliher you never did say
what you was doing way out here
i was trailing sam ward
that aint ward horse
no im riding ward horse he stole mine
funny thing he just
happened to stop by your place
isnt funny to me
good way to get a
bullet in you lottie
something went wrong
well not altogether
what happened to the others
they wont be back
my man ira
what about him
he got killed in the getaway
i want his share of that money
you sure do come right to
the point dont you baby eh
well how about it
about what
about the money
i want ira share
it mine now
well you might be selling
out too cheap lottie girl
on
you got something else in mind
ah maybe
just how much did you get
enough for you and me to blow
the town of el paso wide open
el paso
el paso
yeah i think id
like that just fine
wont take me any time to get ready
no no no hold on hold on
let spend a couple of
days getting acquainted eh
yeah youre not a bad
looking woman lottie
doll you up a little bit there why you
could hold your own with most any company
oh i bet you know how
to spend money sam
well now ill tell you
i never been able to save any
you know something
ira told me i was going to like you
when he talked me into coming up here
was he right-
well you didnt grieve
very long did you
about as long as he
wouldve grieved for me
yeah i like that
you know a man will always know
where he stands with you lottie
couldnt trail a herd of buffaloes
through this kind of going
you think there any
point in looking further
as long weve gone this far
i say were wasting
our time let turn back
how about you and jeff pink
well town would look pretty
good to me right about now
me too ive had a
bellyful of this riding blind
im afraid ill have to agree
we might as well call it quits
diggs
you know this country
real well dont you
better than most
all right let say youre
an outlaw on the run
where the one place
you wouldnt go from here
right up there
why not
because nothing there
but rocks and rattlesnakes
unless maybe you want to
count them murdering apaches
they hole up back
in there after a raid
sounds like just the kind
of a place ward would pick
that be just a wild goose chase
then why dont you go back
because youre too anxious think
ill just string along just in case
i wish they had gone back
if they have left there have
been fewer of us to split the money
worry about the reward
after we catch him
i wasnt thinking
about the reward
i think ill wear
my hair piled high
maybe an ostrich plume
and a red satin dress
oh yeah i look good in
red you like red sam eh
sam
yeah
oh youll be proud of me
red satin hair up and silk
nothing but silk
next to my body
oh i love the feel of silk
yeah so do i
hold it sam
hey you took me
by surprise logan i didnt have that
much luck when i came looking for you
about the unluckiest
thing you ever did
now stay over there
it all right lottie it me he wants
ill make a deal with you logan
youre not exactly in a
position to make a deal
give me my gun
well settle this between
us right here and now
no
you owe me that much
i dont owe you anything sam
give me my gun
look one of us will walk out of
here and thatll be the end of it
that be easy for you you
dont have anything to lose i do
turn around
lean your head against the wall
let see them
what about me
for now you might
stir up a pot of coffee
look i didnt do anything
i was just waiting here for them
to come back now that no crime
well let the law decide that
watch that arm i took a slug in it
i know i put it there
you were in griffin
i wish i had seen you
i saw you plain enough after my
first bullet dropped you now sit down
why didnt you shoot me again
ah you felt guilty
sure you felt guilty about
stealing my wife and kid
no
we were friends once sam
it not easy to shoot an old friend
friends
that a long way back logan and
ive got one big advantage over you
you wont kill me
unless you have to
i wont hesitate one
second about killing you
so you got him all by yourself
good going keliher
man cant have no privacy anywhere
hey pink look what we got here
turn around honey
let have a look at you
i said turn around
say youre a looker eh
you can keep my share of the
reward fellas ill take this instead
take your hands off of me
leave her alone
what is to you
i said leave her alone
you giving the orders
from now on keliher
im giving the orders
how come
after all he took ward
yeah that right he did
all right jeff leave her alone
did you find the money
i didnt even look for it
figured i have plenty of help
you found ward easy enough
ill make him tell where it is
you make me tell
you wont get it out of him like that
ill bet she knows where is hid
no
she knows all right
just give me a minute with her
what the matter with you fellas
anyway talking about torturing people
the money cant
be that hard to find
well aint back there
maybe hid it outside
let start looking for it then
hey old timer come here
you better protect
your interest eh
theyre sure anxious
about that bank money
yeah too anxious
im sure glad
youre along tucker
ill do what i can
you got enough
to feed this bunch
then start fixing
i have to get wood
go ahead
you wasting time sam
oh im in no hurry
my chances are looking
better by the minute
id say your chances are mighty slim
unless you say where the money is
you want them to beat it out of you
im not worried logan
as long i got you here to protect
me from those honest citizens
it in the fireplace
the fireplace
i said i could make her talk
leach
i see you found it
he almost got away
how much you get
i dont know yet
come on well give
you a hand with it
i was hoping that fight out there
wouldve lasted a little longer
so i noticed
that sweet bunch you got there
i didnt pick them
well maybe you shouldve boy
more than 20000
i dont think ive ever seen
that much in one pile before
this would buy a high
old time back in griffin
boys boys
there no reason you
shouldnt keep that money
why sure let let me go
and nobody back in griffin ever need
know that you found me or the money
that kind of an
interesting thought
yeah it worth
considering all right
there only one thing wrong
with it we cant trust you
now if you were dead
wed be home free
we could tell them back in
griffin that we had to kill
ward and that we
couldnt find the money
what about her
shed tell the whole thing
well get rid of her too
hold on killing ward is one thing
but i aint for murdering no woman
you dont have to
do it ill take care of it
i killed many a squaw indian
fighting taint no different
that money is going back to
griffin these two are going with it
i dont think you can
stop us weve got diggs
now jeff here is a little squeamish but when
it comes right down to it hell back me
you might have tucker on your side
of course i stand behind keliher
that cold blooded
murder youre talking about
well i kind of figured
youd see it that way
leach i dont imagine
youre quite so high minded
sure aint
you like the odds
we got callers apaches
most likely scouts
for a raiding party
we can make a mighty
tempting target there
let get them before they get away
no
you shoot and be a war
party down here no time
we cant just
wait till they hit
afraid youre right turn
this place into a graveyard
i think we better start act like
we dont know theyre out there
and after dark
can try slip away
you think he right about
that apache war party
when you go leave me here
id as soon take my chances with
those apaches as with this bunch
not a very good
bet either way sam
tie my hands in front here
will you i can ride a lot better
yeah and you can grab a gun
a lot better too couldnt you
why logan you know
me better than that
ill take my own horse back
oh i thought was a fair trade
i didnt leach
give him a hand
stick with me ill
look out for you
over against that ledge quick
what did you see
nothing
the best thing
you couldve seen
theyre probably hitting
the cabin about now
i wouldnt have given a plugged
nickel for our chances last night
how much you think theyll be worth after
them indians find out theyve been tricked
im plumb wore out when
you figuring on stopping
well not here
that girl needs some rest
those apaches catch up with
us shell get a good long rest
this will have to do
that keliher
that keliher he
sure pushes hard doesnt he
yeah too hard
you want me to help you
find a place to bed down
no thanks ill
all right
all right sam bail off
you better post a lookout i know
them apaches they aint give up
ill take the first watch whoever
is on guard keeps an eye on ward
you and ward seem
uncommon friendly
in case you get any ideas remember
i sleep lighter than a night owl
stay awake all night if you
want to tie these horses off
no no no not now later
ill come to you
you get a strange sense of humor
sam then you always did have
no no i was just remembering
that night on the concho
when we were in the rangers
together remember that night
yeah i remember it
yeah was comanche country
just the two of us
on guard that night
all those shadows out there
yeah we were a little edgy
oh captain
roberts he he said
he said the comanches never
never strike at night remember
yeah yeah well just when we getting
a little comfort from that thought
those comanches hit us boy they came
hollering and veiling in out of the night
scared us half to death
yeah we had quite a
fight on our hands that night
oh logan logan
in those days i thought more of
you than anybody in the whole world
i wouldve put my
life in your hands
matter of fact i did
well it just goes to show you
how wrong you can be about people
first time i get in a little trouble first
time i get on the wrong side of the law
you turn against me
well i havent trust
in anybody since
i didnt turn on you sam
i even quit the rangers so
wouldnt have to go after you
you quit the rangers so you
could go after my wife and kid
that not true
sam you left that girl broke
and homeless with a baby to raise
well that dont give you no
license to go out stealing them
we didnt even think about
getting married the first i
felt the responsibility
because you were my friend
a responsibility i
dont think you ever felt
logan everything
that i ever did
i did for them and their sake
shooting a man and
going to prison for life is not
exactly the right way to raise a family
well i didnt mean to shoot that
man i mean not the first one anyway
and then after i i broke out well i had
no choice but to go on making it with my gun
you didnt have to
come looking for me
oh yes i did logan
that the one
thing i did have to do
there something you
better get straight sam
susan is my wife
now and i love her
and sammy is my son not yours
was only a baby when you left
all these years he had
my love and ive had his
it not enough just
to plant the seed sam
the real father is the man who
gives his whole life to a child
im the father sammy is
my flesh he my blood
and im going to kill you
for taking him away from me
no not here over there
where they cant see us
come on
all right let
get ready to ride
on ward jumping you like that kind of sets
my mind at ease about a couple of things
well now you know
this yours
you tricked me you dirty little
no i didnt let me got
you were supposed to be guarding him
stop crowding me or ill make you wish
turned west here
he heading right back the way he came
not anymore
hi boys
you must be getting to
like that horse of mine sam
nice of you to bring
him back this time
yeah well i figured youd
appreciate that aint it
brought back a mess
of apaches to boot
thought you preferred those indians to us
no i changed my mind
there a place to
stand them off up ahead
rifle sam
what the matter boy dont
like the way i shoot apaches
yeah you shoot apaches fine
we did it
we whipped them
you dont know much about indians do you
think theyll be back
theyll be back all right it
a matter of when and how
keep an eye on him
why dont we try and get out
of here while we got the chance
yeah sure those apaches
would like that just fine
ill take my chances right here
everything all right back here
yeah i guess so are they gone
for now
look i can use a gun if i have to
we may need you
do we have much chance
well give them a fight
guess youre safe enough here
logan
im sorry about the knife
that was last night
no
i didnt know sam was
going to try to kill you
you know sam very well do you
i do now
he just like all
other men using me
sure made it sound good though
promised hed take me to
el paso dress me in silk
stay at the best hotel
oh yeah we had
a lot of fine plans
now if i even get out of this alive
probably wind up going to prison
maybe not no one needs
to know about that knife
thanks logan
you know ive always thought
that all men were the same
but if i get out of this alive
and get another chance i
diggs stay there
watch that ledge
ill try to draw him out
lottie
i i feel i feel sort of
naked without my gun
it wont take long to dress
you when those apaches hit
you know logan i get the
feeling that you dont trust me
should
we ought to get out of here
while we still got the time
well we ought to
we wont stand a chance in
here when they come back
how much of a chance you
think well stand out there
leach getting a little edgy
man ought to learn to face
death without whimpering
maybe is the waiting
that getting to him
well that the
hard part all right
but when they do come
then a man is really alive
diggs you know i get the
feeling you kind of like this
taint that so much but
life sort of pass this by
now fighting indians well that
makes us of some use again
it good to know that
old gun is on my side
well youre not a bad fella keliher
the way they come nowadays anyway
just a mite of education
would straighten you right out
nobody gun is ever on anybody
side out of plain kindness of heart
man nature is too
pure cursed for that
i cant give you an
argument about that just now
way i see it everybody is out after
everybody else hide one way or another
who are you looking to skin out diggs
nobody unless he stands in my way
sort of what i figured
tucker
now about that bank money
hey diggs im glad you brought that up
you know it funny id all
most forgotten about the money
you know you didnt have
quite the right attitude when we
talked about it
back at the cabin
but then your objection
is been taken care of
tucker of course he
was against killing ward
he wont care now
hey leach you havent
changed your mind have you
no
that it then well shoot
ward and split the money
let see there
five of us left
comes to $4000 a piece
arent you hurrying things a little bit
keliher hasnt agreed
to come in with us
oh hell come along
with it wont you keliher
there four of us against you
youre damned if you do
and damned if you dont
all right 4000 dollars looks
pretty big to me right now
but we better hang onto ward for a
while longer came in handy this morning
oh well leave him here with
them hed just be dead weight for us
not if we run into
those apaches again
he right well keep ward
until we get out of indian country
so now the indians are saving my life eh
in front
all right get down
without the rifle
carrying the two of us this horse
will never make it in to griffin
griffin wed be better off if we
headed in the opposite direction
with that old fox diggs on our trail
doesnt matter which direction we hit
if we make it to griffin well be safe
safe
well that dont
exactly fit into my plan
you know logan youre such a good friend
arent you that youre going to save me
for a hanging eh
you made your own bed sam
well what you going to do lynch me
no less you try to get away
im to let you lynch yourself
now move out
go on
hold up sam
you ought to be played
out enough by now
the rope is sawing my head off
turn around
well it looks like were
on the same side again
the first things
first for both of us
well never be able
to stand them off here
work higher
sam
i was going to kill you
you make up your mind to do
something you sure are bullheaded
how bad is it
probably live to get
another chance at me
ill get the horse
leave me here
no
youd be taking a corpse back
you can make it as far as my place
ill fix up the wagon and
take you in from there
talk about being bullheaded
logan
