you better wise up
the time is gonna come
when all men will judge
themselves before god
itll be the worst hell
the worst hell on earth
itll make nazi germany
look like a picnic
and you gotta be ready
for that right now
right here right now
just like that
and thats where
were at all the time
whatever is
necessary you do it
when somebody needs to be
killed theres no wrong
you do it and move you on
theres a revolution
coming very soon
youve lit the fuse yourself
were gonna cut and
chop all you fuckers up
la will burn to the ground
los angeles will
burn to the ground
once again youve judged
a reflection of yourselves
we are what you made us
and when your so betrayed
unintelligible
i dont know who
fired the shot
i dont know who
killed the congressman
as far as im
concerned i killed him
you understand
what im saying
i killed him
he had no business coming
i told him not to come
die with a degree of dignity
lay down your
life with dignity
dont lay down
with tears and agony
theres nothing to death
its like mac said
its just stepping
over to another plain
dont be this way
stop these hysterics
this is not the way for
people who are socialistic
communist to die
no way for us to die
we must die
with some dignity
we must die
with some dignity
we will have no choice
now we have some choice
you think their gonna
allow this to be done
allow us to get by with this
unintelligible
it has never been
done before you think
its been done by
every tribe in history
every tribe facing annihilation
in the amazon their
doing it right now
they refuse to bring any
babies into the world
they save every child
that comes into this world
because they dont want to
live in this kind of world
so be patient be patient
i tell you i dont care
how many screams you hear
i dont care how
many anguished cries
death is a million
times preferable
to ten more
days of this life
if you knew what
was ahead of you
if you knew what
was ahead of you
youd be glad to be
stepping over tonight
death death death is common

outrageous disciple

and the bullets

thats what gets me
bobby and gypsy and i

traveling family of our own

bobby met charlie
if anybody was
influenced it was him
by me
and so i met charlie
making music is
how i met charlie
when i joined a band
called the milky way
charlie was in it
he was a fine musician
very intense
very vivid from being
locked up all that time
and he was a great lyricist
i was like a
lot of kids my age
looking for god
on a quest for god
stumbling around
taking drugs
kind of like a blind
girl in a forest
let me hit that now
linda i want you to come to
the ranch with me this time
just for a few days
charlie acts from his soul
charlie is the man that
weve all been waiting for
i was living in this
apartment with my dog
and my life was
really routine
id just go to work
go home go shopping
go to work go
home go shopping
and it was really a drag
and then charlie blows in
and he just
changed everything
and i dropped it all
and i just took off
he brought out all
these things in me
that i was just
sticking in slots
when charlie got out
he was 33
hed been locked
up since he was 3
and he was lonely
and this was the first time
he had a group of women
that cared about him
that loved him
and charlie loved those girls
he treated them
with plenty of respect
well i was trying to get
close to charlies girls
its astounding that
charlie even knew dennis
and that we were
all living in this
rock stars mansion
in the first place
but then dennis wised up
and kicked us all out
theres a lot of
acid at the ranch
well of course i went
where the girls went
i followed them
out to the ranch
and tried to integrate
myself with charlie
i came to you with all
the love in my heart
and you slaughtered me man
you slaughtered me
and now i gotta hide
i gotta hide my soul
so you wont kill me
and thats why the
kids have to hide
they come out and
their parents say
shut up get back
inside of yourself
you dont need
to be so bright
cause then weve got
to judge ourselves
they hate to
look at themselves
they hate to look at the
truth in themselves man
they persecute themselves
charlie
this is tex
you can have anything i got
charlie wasnt
the leader at all
he followed us around
and took care of us
are you ready to die
yes i am
then live forever
being accepted by
the family and charlie
was like an answer
an answer to an
unspoken prayer
before his
helter skelter trip
everything was beautiful
all we did was smoke grass
and drop acid
and make love
as much as possible
we were forced to
examine our souls
not privately or secretly
but before charlie
and the entire family
i mean really everything
that everything was for
was for fucking
thats what everything
was for man
to unify ourselves with lsd
i mean if we
werent fucking
we were leading up to it
it was heavy
and if we werent leading
up to it we were fucking
i didnt have any
experience with group sex
but i warmed up to it
the girls kept telling me
that it was my
parents hang ups
that i had to
deprogram myself
from their inhibitions
thats what charlie said the
whole universe was about man
it was all one big fuck
everything was in and out
smoking and
eating and drinking
it was all just one big fuck
were not hippies
were slippies
well the ranch
was fairly isolated
you had to take a back road
from the santa susanna pass
to get there
and it was owned by this
eighty year old
blind guy named george
well charlie never
really believed
that george was
completely blind
he would have
one of the girls
strip down in front
of him from time to time
just to see if there
was some sort of reaction
charlie was always
trying to cultivate george
with the girls you know
to help cook and clean
and make love to him
and of course we helped
out around the ranch
whatever shoveling manure
grooming the horses
whatever it took
to keep up a good front
and make us look
good with george
and for the most part
we got along with
the other ranch hands
goddamn it move you
hippie bastards
except for shorty
freaks
excuse me
charlie tried
but shorty was just
that one ranch hand
that he couldnt
work his magic on
charlie wasnt
looking for attention
which is why he
got so much of it
you people sure
have strange concepts
of boyfriend girlfriend
hi tex
hey tex
sadie
i didnt know what to make
of bobby when i met him
he seemed like a spoiled
super hippy you know
arrogant always trying to use
a power that he
didnt really have
to influence the
rest of the group
whats the problem
last night you said
we were going
swimming this morning
i didnt know you were
going to be in the
barn fucking bobby
look i dont belong
to you tex you got that
i dont belong to anybody
i can do anything i want
and so can you
then why in hell did you bring
me here in the first place
i brought you here
to meet everyone
i brought you here
to meet charlie
charlie charlie
charlie charlie
sometimes our
group lovemaking could
be pretty comical
other times it
was devastating
but thats how
we were growing
we were forming
a bond as a family
and charlie was directing
all these energies
but no one could direct them
charlie wasnt our leader
he didnt want
us hanging on him
like our parents wanted
us to hang onto them
we didnt need them
charlie let us be beautiful
im willing to
die for charlie
because hes me
well we believed
that we were cleansing
ourselves spiritually
the goal was to achieve
an inner harmony
as a group
as an example to
the rest of the world
which we saw as
phony and desperate
we talk this way
about charlie
and people say
people like you
say that were brainwashed
but weve seen
charlie do things
that no human being
has done before
we saw him pick up
a bird in the desert
and breath on it
and bring it back to life
and he said
see i told you
you were perfect
you must always think
of yourself as perfection
and i bought it
and him and the
whole brainwash
man ive been trying to
get a buzz off everybody
nobody has nothing
awwhhh
clem
i need to get high
pack me a bowl
please
that was the last one
oh youve got to be kidding
there isnt any more
no
goddamn it
goddamn it
goddamn it
charlie that sucks
hmmmm yeah
i know some knuckleheads
we can burn
for at least a lid
cmon lets go
whoa whoa now
whoa there
whoa there sadie
hey hey hey
charlie charlie
let go of my leg
whoa whoa hey hey
hey whoa sadie
whoa
hold on now
oh my
youve got some
dirty feet here sadie
lets clean them
there was a love there
a very strong a
very true love there
and if i hadnt felt it
i wouldnt have
followed charlie
a joint
youve got youve got pot
oh thank god
charlie has a joint
would you light this
but until i see all of
you knowing who you are
im going to be
very much what i am
god almighty god
who do you think
sent that tape
maybe it was a practical
joke by some kids
you know charlie has been
sort of an underground hero
for a lot of these kids
wait a minute
i want to show you something
i meant to show you
this the other day
i picked it up at the dark
fantasy comic book store
but look at this
row after row of
charlie faces look at that
and then i realized
that its been all been
leading to right now
you know
its like the family
this is the last time
because now ive
got the perfect body
the one ive wanted all along
the strongest one
the one thats gonna make it
through for the last time
charlie told us
that children were the
real leaders of the family
they were the ones
who lead the way
since we waited on
them they set the pace
jesus christ and his
children were just kids
they were living
free without guilt
and without shame
they were able to
take off their clothes
and lie in the sun
and be one together
we took hundreds of
acid trips together
smoked a lot
of pot together
because we wanted
to be like charlie
because to us
he was living perfection
we wanted to mirror him
we had so much sex
we had every kind of
sex you can imagine
we did things youd
never even think of
its a miracle im not
dead from diseases by now
i had no standards
i would sleep with anybody
anybody i wanted to
or anybody
charlie wanted me to
he would always give
me to the meanest biker
or the craziest whoever
because he said i could
out freak anyone with sex
alright go ahead
and print that
you know when the trial
started for the family
it was really
the milestone
in the death of
the hippie movement
everyone really
thinks patty hearst
martin luther king
died with love
kennedy died
talking about something
he couldnt even understand
some kind of generalized love
and he never
even backed it up
he sucked out
bullshit
love is the only weapon
with which ive got to fight
ive got a hell of a
lot of weapons to fight
ive got my clothes
ive got compasses
i got guns
i got dynamite
ive got a hell
of a lot to fight
ill fight ill fight
unintelligible
i call on you
to stop this now
if you have any
respect at all
are we black proud
socialists or what are we
hey now that reminds
me of something
remember the bookstore
where i got the poster
ok they had both of charlies
albums there both of them
on either vinyl or cds
well he finally
made the record bins
i think its ridiculous
yeah but did you buy them
so terry what was it
like to talk to charlie
you could take him
in very small doses
i mean hed throw
ten things at you
youd be on three
hed be on seven and getting
real physical about it
hed hed bend over
hed pick up a
handful of rocks
and hed toss them
into the air and say
see you can throw it all away
and itll come back to you
were flashing with
divine harmony this morning
i just wrote two songs
while the sun was rising
very very groovy
charlie was not
willing to sell out
to the record producers
which is the first and
most important requirement
before the industry is
willing to handle an artist
do you want
professional sound
maybe something you can use
i suggest you get
in the booth and
hey hey hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey hey
whats the problem here huh
many musicians say they
dont care about the money
yet they commit themselves
to be at given places
at certain times
and to produce what sells
whether they
believe it or not
charlie didnt
want that success
charlie wanted success
on his own terms
he didnt want
to be imprisoned
i know whats best
for us man i know
do you know anything about
the acoustics in this studio
do you know anything about eq
do you know
anything about mixing
i know about the energy
rays of a free love society
and i know your cold
heartless technology
hasnt defined that yet
amen charlie
but its there
its here
its here dig
like a thought
its a thought
its in a thought
its in a thought
from me to you
i dont have to
take this shit
jerry jerry jerry
jerry jerry cmon man
charlie what
are you doing
you dont go slapping people
well fuck you and
your bullshit studio
hey is that
what you think man
charlie does things his way
he dont conform to the pig
rules of the establishment
so terry you worked in
the studio with charlie
now youre his producer
what what did you think
of him as a musician
as an artist
charlie was at the edge
just the whole sixties scene
la
things kind of built
to a critical mass
and at one point
i actually thought
well maybe there is something
we could do with this but
but the music was
really crap wasnt it
yes the music was crap
were so formal
over here on the bbc
charlie singing
just come and
say you love me
give up your world
cmon you can be
i mean things looked
good for charlie
and everybody was just goofing
with their
head in the clouds
well we gave
up our own birthdays
and renounced our families
charlie didnt allow
any clocks calendars
or anything like
that on the ranch
dennis and bobby
were donating food
cars women whatever
it was always submit
give something to charlie
submit everything you had
submit your ego
if you do not give me
the deed to the ranch
i will throw you on
the rail road track
ahaaaahhhhaaaaahhhhhh
help
save me save me
wed just drop acid
and share out of this big
pile of clothes and costumes
and role play the day away
changing situations
and characters
well youre
all going to be clearing
out of here pretty soon
because george is
getting real tired
of you giving his
ranch a bad name
i dont understand
all you little creeps
charlies not jesus christ
hes not the devil
hes just a little con man
hes spent half his
life in jail goddamn it
well once the bikers and
ex-cons moved onto the ranch
it became a chop shop
for stolen cars
and dune buggies
and shorty began taking
down license plate numbers
now shorty was married
to this black go-go dancer
and that just
burned charlie up
because it went
totally against his
racial philosophies
hey you nigger lover
i heard your wife
takes it up the ass
is that true
well loose lips sink ships
he never said
in so many words
that he was christ
but he would imply
like when hed look at me
and smile and hed say
dont you know who i am
i made love to
charlie last night
yeah
how was it
well it was
cmon
like what was it like
it was
it was great
it was kind of scary
he said all these
really nice things to me
then when he
started to come
he got real tense
and then he climaxed
and i came but
i got all
tense
it was like
i couldnt move my arms
for about a minute at all
i was paralyzed
it was real scary
thats because
your ego was dying
until you give of
yourself completely
and your egos dead
you cant be at the now
see what im saying
but it happens you know
stop this nonsense
dont carry this on any more
youre exciting the children
no no sorrow that its over
im glad its over
hurry hurry my
children hurry
hold it down weve got time
its an act of suicide
commit an act of
revolutionary suicide
we are now at
the end of reason
we are motion itself
we are eternal revolution
if you get behind the
wheel youll kill us both

terry was supposed to come in
and record us in our
natural environment
charlie thought a record
deal was coming too
when i showed up
the ranch was in full swing
yeah we had
high expectations
charlie had us clean the
place from top to bottom
we had zuzus
hundreds of
joints were rolled
and the girls
well they prepared this
outstanding vegetarian feast
the food that those
stores threw away
was perfectly good
and we only took the very
best of what was there
charlie singing
oh garbage dump
oh garbage dump
why are you called
a garbage dump
the first day
i came to the ranch
charlie sent me
on a garbage run
he said take
some clean clothes
cause youll get all dirty
and so i went
down to the market
and i hopped in the can
and we went through
everything and got all dirty
and we just took the
best of everything
and we took it and cleaned it
and took the skins off
and cut all the spots out
nobody goes hungry here
you could feed the world
with my garbage dump
you could feed the world
with my garbage dump
charlie im sorry man
im sorry i couldnt make it
i was uh
i was tied up in
a meeting okay
hey hey whoa charlie
charlie ease up man
i never promised
you id be there
i said id come
if i could okay
yeah
its like i tried to
explain to you before ok
the record execs
dont think your stuff
is marketable right now
what i suggest that we do
is well sit on
it until spring
and who knows you
by then you could be
the biggest name since
since jim morrison
whoa whoa whoa whoa
what do you mean
make up my mind
this one little
space in time
where charlie was there
but he wasnt there
little freak
ahhh ahhh
nobody cares about my music
nobody cares
charlie felt betrayed
his album was
going to make us rich
and it was going to spread
his message to the world
i mean it didnt
slow us down
we all the makings
for a great party
when simi came
with the family
she was a virgin
and she was scared
she was scared stiff
charlies about the
hippest guy i ever met
hes going to open doors in
this little brain of yours
so will this
whats that
this is lsd
here take two
weve already dropped
the whole familys
tripping tonight
i havent done any
hard drugs before
its not a hard drug
oh we dont do
any hard drugs
its just its just acid
its not like its heroin
or cocaine or anything
its a groove
i dont know how
what do you mean
you dont know how
its just like going
to the doctors office

tongue and say ahhh

well i guess
ive always wondered
what its like
you know to trip
its a groove
say ahhh
ahhh
say ahhh
ahhhh
on her first big
experience with the family
we all tripped on acid
and she plum
tripped out on that
she flipped completely out
we were all
tripping right along
and we balled her brains out
it wasnt rape
she loved it
ahhhh
it its like
she would start fighting
and shes fighting and
scared and fighting
and then shed calm
down and go uhhhh
and then shed realize
what was happening to her
and shed get all
scared and frightened
and and charlie was
sitting in the corner
just directing the operation
yes i knew who
simi sherry was
and i know she was raped
but that was
bobby and charlie
i had nothing to do with that
no she just vanished
never heard from her again
i pray for her now
in my nightly prayers
i just thank god she
got out when she did
or else she might have
ended up in prison too
youve got the nerve
to pray for me
im just as
youre just as
disgusting as i am
its your fault
ive always hated you
you ruined me
you ruined my whole life
all my life
we struggle
i mean we struggle
with ourselves you know
charlie i am not going to
give up all my possessions
and come live with you man
suddenly there
was a lot more talk
about fear and its usefulness
be like an animal
be like a coyote
use fear to help you exist
and to live in the now
well i think i tried to make
myself believe i was a witch
i was yanna the good witch
charlie just shifted gears
we ignored the establishment
and we ignored reality
even more than we before
we just continued on with
the magical mystery tour
charlie got that
from the beatles
he called life
or the flow of life
the magical mystery tour
we were all part if it
one mind one soul
one body
within it and with it
its a total
state of paranoia
its
its man when
youre that aware
you
you can feel everything
you can see
everything that moves
you can hear everything
that makes a sound
you could smell every smell
and when youre that aware
youre at the now
this is when we
started going out
on creepy crawl missions
well not breaking
and entering
creepy crawling
you what
we creepy crawled them
a few of us would drive
into some wealthy
neighborhood
and wed pick a house
and wed steal right from
under these peoples noses
while they slept
you had to be super aware
you had to be aware
of every move you made
well sometimes wed drop acid
to heighten our
awareness level
we creepy crawled probably
fifty houses or more
and we never got caught
not once
you stay positive
you confront your fears
you say yes to your fears
submit to them
and overcome them
no sense makes sense
you cant get caught
if you dont got
thought in your head
sometimes we would steal
from the peoples houses
that we broke into
other times wed just
move the furniture around
to freak them out when
they woke up in the morning
i was a master criminal
i cant believe
youve ever been alive
you dont deserve to live
i hate you
you gotta go too
take me elizabeth
my name is cassandra
you killed me first
charlie developed this game
wed take really strong lsd
and sit in a circle
around an empty chair
charlie called
it the fear chair
wed stare at this chair
while charlie spoke
he told us to imagine
a rich establishment pig
sitting in the chair
now its the pigs
trial hed say
and wed stare at
this imaginary person
and project his fear
right back at him
keeping him immobilized
with his own projected fear
keep judging
yourselves in charlie
but dont look in the mirror
i dont remember exactly when
my mind crossed over from
reality to imagination
but there was no escaping it
things seemed so
doom-laden that summer
everything that charlie
preached seemed like
absolute divine driven truth
and charlie wasnt
preaching about death
of the ego anymore
now he meant violent death
physical death
and when he said death is
beautiful he meant it
death is beautiful
because it its what
people feared the most
death is merely
an illusion anyway
because the infinite
soul can never die
if youre not dead
you will be soon
tex was in bad shape
charlie had told us all
we had to cease to exist
but tex never could
free the mind
and your ass is
bound to follow
its like he wanted it
both ways you know
one minute hed be
bad mouthing charlie
and the next minute
hed be saying shit like
i am charlie
and charlie is me
you dig man
well here we are
give me the money
you bring it out
ill pay the dude
no man no fronts
the man doesnt
front for anybody
hed be running it
fifty yards from the house
and taking the
money right back
thats not a fucking front
hey look hes not gonna
change his rules for me
now do you want this or not
because i dont care
we can go right now
cmon lotsapoppa
give me the money
ill be back in a flash
i dont like this
lotsapoppa called the
ranch madder than hell
and charlie took the call
who is it
its charlie man
and charlie talked to him
soothed him out cooled him
and said dont come down here
ill come over there
and well settle this thing
where you going
hey baby whats your name
get the fuck off of me
you poor child
you must be rosina
hey man
im talking to you
get over here
marnie would you untie
this poor girls hands
where you going
look motherfucker
you keep her tied up
aw come on man
this little woman
couldnt out muscle you
alright motherfucker get up
get up
and put that fucking
gun on the table
easy
easy its going
i said easy
its going easy
oh the race war was something
we believed in totally
it wasnt the
reason for the murders
but the belief that there was
going the be a great race war
was something that
hung in the atmosphere
and drove us crazy
charlie thought lotsapoppa
was a black panther
nothing has changed since
we talked on the phone man
and if tex aint got every
last cent of that money
hes wasted
im gonna kill him
hes gonna be wiped
out you dig it
thats not necessary
take it as a gift from me
gift
please
ok
and here you are
kill me
my life in exchange
for my brother
shoot me
amen charlie
hes whatever a person
wants to make of him
hes a mirror actually
a reflection of yourself
get up
theyll both be right
here when you get back
if we dont fuckem to death
ill get tex for you
marnie ill be back soon
now you making
sense little man
what are you gonna do
shoot me
how could i shoot you
with an empty gun
there are no
bullets in it man
alright you little fuck
gunshot
scream
drop it
in everything thats
ever been written
people always overlook how
important that shooting was
and the impact that
it had on the future
charlie was terrified
that the black panthers
would come down on us
for shooting lotsapoppa
thats a really nice shirt
youre wearing there
i like it i really do
could i have it
i sure would like to have it
i remember hearing
about the cop who shot the
sixteen year old black kid
we had the race
riots in watts
the black panthers
in san francisco
martin luther king had
just been assassinated
so charlies rap didnt
seem too far out at all
it didnt seem
like it was going to
happen a month from now
it was happening right now
right now
i love you
i do
i think thats really the
crux of the entire story here
that that was the springboard
for these killings
that was the first
domino to tip over
and it it lead to the rest
its gone man
here pack him
some more in there

some of this nonsense
charlies the only
complete man ive ever met
he wont let any woman
talk him into anything
he wont take any
back talk or whining
ahhhh
tex
oh weve missed you
charlies missed you
where the hell have you been
are you staying
yeah
yeah
whats that
youve got a lot
of catching up to do
he never really gave orders
he was so evil
he would just scare us to
death with his preachings
every night hed tell us
that there was going
to be a race war
and that whitey and the blacks
were going to go to war
and it was going
to he the worst war
the world had ever seen
and he said that
we had to be ready
to save the children
and rescue the
homeless babies
and carry them off into
the desert to safety
and he said we had to start
collecting dune buggies
and guns and supplies
and all these other
things to help us survive
and then he would just calmly
pull out this buck knife
and he said i dont know
about the rest of you
but im going to
start carrying a knife
theres no good or no
evil there just is
did you have any idea
you were going to be
one of the apostles
hmm
an apostle
what the hell is that
supposed to mean
cmon tex why else would
you and i be here right now
why would any of us be here
oh
charlie
thats right
cmon patty
tex
well you know
who he is dont you
its all true tex
i know about these things
i know its all true
i used to teach sunday school
i was studying to be a
nun before i met charlie
the gospel
according to charlie
is all you girls know
youre absolutely
fucking right tex
because charlie is christ
and christ is love
and charlie is love
that makes charlie
and christ one
the beatles laid it all
out on the white album
the four angels
with the faces of men
and the hair of women
thats the beatles
and the breastplates of fire
thats their
electric guitars see
you know who the fifth
angel is dont you
dont you
im just so sick of this
mind-fucking bullshit
you better be ready
two weeks everybodys
carrying a knife
and charlies teaching us
the best way to slit
a persons throat
just like theres no
past and no future
just now
thats all
thats important
the time is gonna come
when all men will judge
themselves before god
itll be the worst hell
the worst hell on earth
itll make nazi germany
look like a picnic
and you gotta be ready
for that right now
right here right
now just like that
and thats where
were at all the time
charlie set up
helter skelter patrols
we kept 24 hour a day lookouts
posted with shotguns
around the ranch
it was perfect
timing for charlie
because the family was
starting to drift apart
but now we were being pushed
to the last safe corner
of the earth the desert
now the district
attorney made up the lie
that charlie was trying to
start this black white war
to bring on armageddon
charlie didnt start the war
as far as we
were all concerned
it was already coming down
helter skelter is
the name of a song
performed by
the beatles period
helter skelter
was very real to us
for all we knew
it was happening
all the events
were taking place
and we thought we really
had to get to the desert
that the desert was the only
way that we could be saved
wed still make
music and orgy
but now it had this
dark underbelly to it
everything was biblical
and apocalyptic
we will kill anyone who
gets in our way period
what are we gonna do charlie
creepy crawl
some pigs house
of course i loved charlie
i felt like he was
the messiah come again
you know the second
coming of christ
king of the jews
drink from this
for this is my blood
the blood of the new covenant
which is shed for many
and the flames blew up
like the devils breath
shed for many
im the devil
im the devil
the devil
charlie im the devil
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
neither repented
they of their murders
nor of their sorceries
nor of their fornications
nor of their thefts
and they had a king over them
which is the angel of
the bottomless pit
whose name in the
hebrew tongue is abaddon
but in the latin tongue
hath his name is exterminans
and i started to
space it real bad
and i fucking looked over
and charlie looked
like the devil man
i said man i
think were in hell
and he said
yeah aint it groovy
i was getting some
real weird pictures
so i get out while
the getting was good
what do you mean
leaving you cant
will you go with me
why
you cant leave
i overheard tex and sadie
and theyre watching you
i gotta get out of here
why
what is going on
im sacred
whats wrong
charlie asked me
if i would kill somebody
whats in the bag sunshine
hi sadie
you cant kill
kill
bunch of people with their
backs up against the wall
willing almost to
kill someone
oh yeah
in a split second
kill crazy and
throw your life away
any traces of my own
will or personality
had totally
dissolved by this time
i was just as
extension of charlie
and i took my role of
enforcer very seriously
where were you going
whats the big deal
i just wanted to be
by myself for a while
she was wearing these
i like to see in focus
you were running away
i wasnt running away
look whats the big
deal all of a sudden
you guys are
acting like the ranch
has become a military camp
take them off
charlie told you
not to wear them
stop it
i want to wear them
dont you ever leave the
ranch without telling anyone
going out to death
valley you know
it made a lot of sense
somewhere that we could
raise our children
and let them teach us
some of the things
that we need to learn
in a place thats
closer to the land
and the stars
and the spirit of life
do it again and
ill kill you
well hang you in a tree
and well cut
your tongue out
you got no idea how desperate
things were out there
im not talking frustration
im talking lunacy
chanting
charlie thought that gary had
inherited a lot of money
so charlie asked
gary to join the family
and come with
us to the desert
gary said no
so charlie told bobby and
i to try to convince him
ive given you given you
all help in times of need
but im not following
charlie into the desert
i have my life and its here
were not asking
you to change gary
you can bring your your
gohanza
your gohanza out there
you can have everything
there that you have here
we love you gary
we need you man
i need you
no alright
youre still my brother
and my sister
but i must be true to myself
last chance
its gonna take a lot of
money for a move of this kind
ill give you
forty dollars okay
how about twenty grand
how about it
we need that money gary
the whole thing with gary
was that he had burned me
on a thousand
tabs of mescaline
i went there simply
to get my money back
i think you should
leave right now
bullshit
we aint kidding gary
bobby what are you doing
look i dont know
what charlie told you
but i dont have
twenty thousand dollars
and im not paying
youre bullshitting me
stop it bobby
get out of my house
watch him
im gonna find it
hes not gonna find anything
shut up
we trashed this place
we turned it upside down
i dont know what else
i dont know if he has it
alright fine
ok
alright fine
well be here
youre making terrible causes
causes youll answer
for in later life
charlies pissed at you man
you cant change the
causes youve made
but you can counter
them with positive ones
what the hell
you too sadie
just go
tell that to charlie
music playing
i cant think
with that shit on
music playing
trippy chick
yeah yeah go ahead
gary had no stomach
for what was going on
he just kept saying
over and over again
that he didnt
have any money and
and he was tired
and he wanted to go to sleep
me and bobby looked everywhere
in that house for money
knock on door
thats charlie
let him in
finally bobby didnt
know what to do
get up
get up
hey charlie
wheres bruce
charlie i dont
think you know what
youre doing by this
i want to talk
about that money jack
right now where is it
take your people and get out
scream
dont man
dont come back
without the money man
during my trial
the prosecution wanted to
involve charlie in my case
which is difficult because he
was never there at any time
i cut gary when
we were fighting
and it wasnt his ear
it was more like this
little slash on his cheek
take this
its a little safer
clean up woman
i think at that point charlie
knew what was going on
but we didnt
i know bobby was not at all
ready for what was happening
shut up
im gonna go get
someone to fix his ear
youre not going anywhere
look we dont
have bandages
and he will keep bleeding
until you tell us where
that fucking money is gary
hes not gonna tell
us a fucking thing
unless we help him
thats right
im gonna rip
this place apart
and youre gonna watch him
i am going to get some
medical supplies right now
you do what i say sadie
fuck you
youre so fucking stupid
here gary drink this
we gotta do something
we cant stay
here much longer
ive turned this
place upside down
what do you want to do
well call the
ranch ask charlie
ask charlie
ask charlie sure
charlie always has
an answer right
its not always
the right answer
but he always has an answer
what the hell else
have we ever done
thats right what the hell
else have we ever done
you bastards
will fry for this
youre descending into
the lower worlds gary
wheres your faith
chanting
call the ranch bobby
maybe charlie will let us
take him back there
hey charlie

chanting
whats going on
chanting

stab him again bobby
chanting
bobby would you help me
to die is a beautiful thing
its its everything
its every color in
the spectrum of light
every sound
every note in all music
i returned and tried
to cover up my tracks
but i left some prints
why political piggy
to put it off on the blacks
well thats why
bobby made the paw print
you know the black panthers
i had a lot of anxiety
over getting busted
i split the ranch on the
pretence of ditching the car
some cops woke me up
one morning on the
side of the road
called in the car
found the knife in the car
hauled my ass in
effectively negating all of
my creative efforts forever
this is all your
fault charlie
shut up
you shut up
as long as any
of us are in jail
were all in jail you know
im walking around out here
but im in jail with
every single young person
that should be free you know
im in the hall of
justice with charlie
and im on death
row with bobby
wow they got bobby
it was for the
love of brother
this had nothing to do
with the race war no
no blacks against
whites no armageddon
it no white album
no helter skelter
that wasnt what it was about
then he went on about
how we were a family
and we werent going
to let one of our
brothers rot in jail
girls loved bobby
enough to do this
as they took these
peoples lives
they were willing to
give their own lives
and thats what theyre doing
right now on death row
its for the love of brother
we knew that charlie was
willing to give his life
he brought up the
subject of lotsapoppa
and how that
had been my mess
and how he had to
clean that one up
that he had taken a life
and now it was my turn
to repay that debt
well the girls decided
if they found the police
if they found more bodies
with with writing
on the wall in blood
that that theyd assume
the killer was on the loose
and theyd let bobby go
he told me that
the girls had a plan
and that they needed me
to help them carry it out
he said go to
terrys old place
take all the money you find
and kill anyone there
i was getting into
my creepy crawl clothes
and me and tex were
sneaking some speed
and getting ready to go
linda get up
wake up
now youre gonna need
your drivers license
a change of clothes
put on dark clothes
like im wearing
and bring your knife
linda
i want you to go
wherever tex tells you

he knows what to do
listen to him
and leave a sign
you girls know what i mean
something witchy
so i led them there
i had been there
three times before
i would step
out of this casket

and i would dance
in front of him
i wish youd shut up

i had the girls
wait in the car
while i climbed
the telephone pole
and cut the wire
i went down an embankment

over some barbed wire
we were headed
toward the house
when we saw a car
coming up the driveway
down
get down
hey

its starting come on
i turned the engine off
rolled the car
back a few yards
and i told
linda to keep watch
then i went up to the house

and i let sadie in

the methamphetamine crystal
that i had snorted earlier
was blurring
everything together
time was telescoping
as soon as i had a thought
i was already
physically acting on it

were not human
they were less than human
they were artificial
let her go

tex told me to dip
a towel in her blood
and write something that
would shock the world
so i did
charlie was waiting for us
when we got
back to the ranch
sitting naked
in the moonlight
he asked us if we had any
remorse for what wed done
and of course the
right answer was no
i remember patty
telling me about it
and then i went through a
change and and i thought
right on i guess we did it
well the next night
charlie gathered up clem
sadie leslie patty and me
and told us to come with him
well um
charlie made sure that he
he sort of made
me feel really guilty
and said that
i should want to do it
because it was

charlie said
charlie said
they had to kill shorty
he had to have clem
chop his head off
i heard that
shorty wouldnt die
unless they
chopped his head off
charlie said he knew too much
he actually punched her out
shorty
charlie
so we cut him into ribbons
shorty
right
first we dosed him
then we hogtied him
while he was tripping
we stuck needles
under his fingernails
and in his eyes
through his nipples
and cock
its not nice
to snitch shorty
he pissed himself
piss and blood
then we drug him
through the mud
and he was
screaming for his life
and charlie gave the word
and we stabbed him like caesar
everybody the whole family
he just wouldnt die
we just kept stabbing
and stabbing and stabbing
and stabbing and
stabbing and stabbing
so clem cut his head off
we cut him into nine pieces
and buried him in nine places
his legs are buried
right under you
its not nice to snitch
the girls made up that story
about us chopping him
up into nine pieces
even the prosecutor
put that in his book
but when clem led the
police out to the ranch
they found the skeleton
intact of course
no no
pull over
get out
god help me
its ready
the revolution is ready
and as soon as charlie
gets out its on
the revolution is on
and if you try
to hurt charlie
youll all die
he is god
perfect
as perfection is
because its exactly
the same thing
i had a brother once
who was shot
and killed like that
for nothing in the war
i mean its exactly
the same thing
every single day
love is being killed
were all in this together
you gotta stab
as long as charlie
is locked away
in his asylum
prison grave
you can say anything
you want about him
you can make more bogus books
and movies about his life
you can joke about him
you can pretend to be him
you can say and do
anything you want
but the truth is
you dont have the
soul to face him
youre a lot of vultures
you are
you live off the sacrifice
of the young people
youre bloodsuckers
you are
with your little
phallic symbols you know
were waiting for our
father to be set free
hes a genius
you dont realize
its the second
crucifixion of christ
judgment day
is coming people
leslies lawyer
ronald

leslies hippy lawyer
and we all thought
he was pretty cool
but he was just
like the others
he was the first of
the retaliation murders
we are all facing
the gas chamber

five heads were cut off

judged yourselves

turn against you
