
he lying
ill kill him
he wanted me too
id do it again and again and again
men i hate the whole breed
never mind the speeches let me alone
he made me do it
no have nothing to say
dont be so serious judge
it my funeral
keeping me healthy to kill me
im famous bavian
the papers all hate me dont they
no im not sorry
one week more
six days five days
it goes fast doesnt it
did you mail my letter to paul bavian
three more days one for each man
why doesnt he come
why doesnt he come
why doesnt he come
stop it stop it stop it
but doctor if you were trying to tell me
ruth rogen insane youre too late
the courts have held otherwise
i am not
i am telling you she might be the cause
of other people going insane
what do you mean
warden have you ever noticed
that when a criminal is executed
for some unusual crime
there is frequently an epidemic
of similar crimes
sure
a lot of imitators
i wonder
i wonder if they are imitators
perhaps their will has been subdued
now doctor just because you are
supposed to have psychic powers
just a moment please
perhaps theyve been possessed
by another personality
a powerful and malignant personality
without well without a body of its own
like ruth rogen
precisely
like ruth rogen will be tomorrow
well that a very interesting theory
doctor if you can prove it
im not trying to convince you warden
i only want you help
well what do you want of her body
after the execution
ive been experimenting lately
with mitogenic rays
what are they
ultraviolet rays given off by the body
now if my experiments are correct
i might be able to prevent her personality
from escaping after death
and committing other crime
but why rogen
she a proper remarkable subject
so notorious a criminal should
i imagine have quite a number
of what you would call imitators
now here my point warden
if there are no similar crimes committed
well i should at least have negative proof
that my theory is correct
hmm
seems sort of creepy when you think of it
well well see what we can do
have to get her permission of course
naturally
she rather difficult to handle
youd better let me do most of the talking
all right
come on
let me alone let me alone i tell you
cant i have any peace
get out get out of here
im sorry
i thought it might interest you
nothing going to interest me
except a message from the governor
and i wont get that
no
im afraid you wont
you have nothing to
lose by doing what i ask
no and nothing to gain
listen to me my body my own
the law gives me that much
take my body away
and then guarantee i can have it forever
funny isnt it
you do the laughing
im offering you a chance
to do something for humanity
humanity
there only one of them
i want to do anything for
just one
i wrote for him to come here
but he too smart
the doctor may be giving you
a chance for even that
i suppose he can bring me back
after im dead
no no no i didnt say that im
well you cant tell what hell do
dr houston is one of
the world greatest psychologists
he too modest to tell you everything
if i thought i could come back
and walk around and talk
if i could use my hands
if i could use my hands
just for a few minutes
you have nothing to lose ruth
no i have nothing to lose
nothing to lose
ill send you a paper to sign
here
been to see her in jail mr bavian
no
well look
be careful
dont do that
youre a heartless man mr bavian
i wouldnt treat a dog
the way you treated her
not that it any of my business
it certainly isnt
just the same
i know what goes on in my house
and if any man treated me
the way you treated her
id have shotten him
stop it youve been drinking
what if i have
im thinking of that poor girl
she waiting there waiting in jail
to the death chair waiting for them
to come and fetch her
go to bed youll sleep it off
youre no gentleman
oh there are all of my pets out again
oh
why dont you clean the transom
once in a while
then you can see more clearly
well i just looked in because i thought
why you might have been in bed
what do you want
there a letter for you
why it been here the whole afternoon
it from the poor creature
how do you know
the handwriting
this is a lie
her finger marks were found on his throat
she must be crazy
why should i tell the police
she may be crazy but youre not
what do you mean
youre not going to get within reach
of those hands of hers are ya dearie
roma
can i do anything
no thanks grant
better alone for a while grant
well that over
how about a little snack
i starved all through the funeral
grant weve got to do something
to help roma

what about a trip a sea trip
fine we can take the yacht
what about bermuda

schmitt schmitt
yes sir

truffles sir
with butter and cinnamon
very good sir
hello king
sure you wont have anything
no thanks
it seems strange that i should get back
just in time to see him die
long trip from south america
i guess you had a reason for it
did you ask her yet
ask her what
well to marry you of course
after what happened
why not
might be the best thing for her
ladies and gentlemen
you will now hear
the celebrated courtney twins
in their famous number entitled

but undoubtedly one of the most
dangerous women in criminal history

oh now listen doc that too much
ooh hello roma

well doctor what the matter
ive been conducting
a very trying experiment grant
the woman in there
was ruth rogen
you remember the case
yes i do
well it may sound crazy but
there danger of contagion
no dear not from the body
that harmless
but there
there something else
please
please roma
tell me roma why did you
come here tonight
we went to see
that spiritualist and
and i saw john
but it was all staged
ive been trying
to convince roma
it couldnt have been
i saw john and so did you
and you know it
wait a moment dear
how do you know
it was staged grant
he said john was murdered
by hammond
isnt that enough
murdered by hammond
that absurd
roma you dont believe
anything like that for a moment
i dont know what to believe
it was john talking and
hammond was with him
when he died
oh oh i dont know
roma dear girl weve all known
nicky hammond far too long
to believe anything like that
without real proof
of course the whole thing a trick
to get money out of roma
i wonder if it is a trick
roma
invite him to your house
for another séance
then if he should
well
let wait and see
that strange
those windows are shut
mm and cold as ice
roma you must go at once

paul bavian
ohh

7-9-9-7-0
raymond
this is dr houston speaking
will you please send immediately
for the body of ruth rogen
yes i have finished
at once please
yes
at ms courtney house
at eight oclock
tonight
yes i understand
ill be there
yes
good bye
thank you
now the contact is completed
as you know
spirit communication
may take any one of many forms
levitation
moving lights voices
raps materialization
or automatic writing
in automatic writing
the medium himself
while in a trance
writes the message
consequently this method
may be open to question
independent writing
the messages received
independently of the medium
consequently tonight
we will experiment
by this means
but i warn you again
i promise you nothing
the invisible
that you wish to hear from
may not be able to reach me
but if i succeed
my reward lies in the knowledge
that i have been of service
to a gracious lady
also i feel very flattered
that so eminent a scientist
such as dr houston
would be present
at a seance conducted by
someone with a person
as myself
i would like to have a handkerchief
from you if you please
one of yours will do
hm
thank you
it will eliminate any idea of trickery
if youll excuse me a moment
i want to light the incense
it will assist me in concentrating
would one of you be
good enough to turn out
the overhead lights
this is gonna turn into a job
what this
ahh
yes
hey look here
you cant get away
with this you know
you think you can blackmail me
come on get up
get up get up get up
