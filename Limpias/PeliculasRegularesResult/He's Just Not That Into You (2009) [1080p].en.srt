gigi a girl will never forget
the first boy she likes
even if things dont quite work out
why did you do that
because you smell like dog poo
youre so stupid just like dog poo
youre made out of poo
gigi but usually someone is there
to offer words of wisdom
made
of
dog
poo
honey
do you know why that little boy
did those things and said those things
it because he likes you
gigi
and there it is
that the beginning of our problem
that little boy is doing those terrible things
because he got a crush on you
gigi
do you know what this means
were all encouraged
no programmed
to believe that if a guy
acts like a total jerk
that means he likes you
here the problem
he likes you too much
youre too pretty and too awesome
yes
he cant handle it
that phi delt so obviously liked you
im sure he just lost your number
he not asking you out because he
intimidated by your professional success
speaking in japanese
trust me it because he just
getting out of a serious relationship
trust me it because he never had
a serious relationship
speaking in foreign language
gigi
why do we say this stuff to each other
is it possible that it because
were too scared
and it too hard to say
the one obvious truth
that staring everyone in the face
chattering
so janine says
youre a real-estate agent
yeah but im not
one of those cheesy ones
that puts my headshots on bus benches
and grocery carts
so just like frisbees and notepads

it much classier

she getting married
really
beth
yeah
neil
great
you really think that great
yeah
devon seems like
a great guy
well so you think it great
that theyre getting married
but you dont ever feel like
were going against nature or something
by not getting married
no
going against nature
is like the cat who suckled that monkey
you and i are just two people
who happen not to be married
let me tell you something people
who get married are not to be trusted
you are so weird
theyre not you know why
because if you are so legitimately happy
honestly
you wouldnt feel the need
to make a big show out of it
you wouldnt have to broadcast it
they do it because theyre insecure
and they think getting married
what theyre supposed to be doing
so theyre lying to themselves
and to other people
seriously
think about you and your friends
okay
these women you have
great relationships with
youre close to them
some of them youve known for years
but you dont feel the need
to write a $45 check to the state
of maryland for a friendship certificate
yeah no i get that
right
why should it be any different
you know with me and you
were very happy i love you
im committed to you
we have a great life you know
yes youre right
why cant we just be happy
youre right
im gonna get you some more tea
okay
kids shouting
recording on phone
please enter your pass
you have no messages
main menu to send a message
groans
okay so clearly he hasnt called
maybe he away on business
he sells real estate in baltimore
staying in town is his business
right
well look let me tell you
after i went out with ben for the first
time he didnt call me for  days
eleven days and now
he the world best husband
that happens all the time
really
really
janine
you want coffee
i got you 2 percent
thanks
this is all your fault
what why
you set us up
no you asked me if i know any guys
and i gave conor your phone number
that not a setup
when i do a setup
i weigh the pros and cons
i do my due diligence
all i know about conor
is that he sold us this house
seriously stop
he said he always hangs out after work
at the city supper club
maybe i should do a little drive-by
please dont
hell call
amber
okay i have a question
whyd they even invent caller id
it like who is this service helping
i mean for centuries
okay well maybe not centuries
but for like a lot and lot of years
people have been answering their phone
not knowing who it is
and as far as i can tell
no one died from that
and it like if the police wanna know
who placed a call they could trace it
i mean what am i the police
this constant obsession with needing
to know who calling all the time
it like so gross
like you pick up the phone
you find out who it is then you know
it like
look all im saying
if a guy doesnt call me
i would like to reserve the right
to call him at 5-minute intervals
until he picks up
but if he looks down
and sees my numbers
he gonna think
im some kind of psycho or something
which im not
obviously
shower running
human league dont you
want me plays on phone
hello
mom

instructor
inhale upward-facing dog
look up towards the ceiling
gigi he ordered more drinks for us
when the waitress came
he remembered exactly what i wanted
he initiated the hug
he said it was nice meeting me
so wait this was at the end of the date
or the beginning of the date
end why does it matter
yeah nice meeting you at the beginning
of the date that normal
nice meeting you
at the end of the date
it could be a blowoff
maybe it was at the beginning
okay that fine he gonna call
or maybe it was at the end
or maybe it was just nice to meet me
beth
help
hi this is torture
how am i supposed to come up
with something pithy and dynamic
to say about cinnamon blends
it hard to focus on nutmeg
when the guy who might be
the guy of my dreams
refuses to call me
after my first date with neil
i called him
there are no rules anymore
and i mean why should you
have to wait for him to get off his ass
it ringing
that pretty standard
hey youve reached conor
yes voicemail
leave a message ill get back to you
notes
hey conor it gigi
i just thought i hadnt heard from you
and how stupid is it that a gal has
to wait for a guy call anyway right
mouthing
what does that say what that say
because were all equal right
more than equal
more women are accepted
into law school now than men
and i mean i dont know
if you saw that dateline
but women practically
have penises now right so
call me
oh this is gigi call me
dont worry he totally gonna call
sighs
what
how can there not be a dial tone
how can there not be a dial tone

hi janine it me
conor never called
so im on the precipice of staging
a casual run-in at the city supper club
pick up if you wanna stop me
all right im interpreting your silence
as tacit compliance bye
bartender what up girl
hey
how are you
good
knock knock
hey
so
here we are same shift again
i know i make the schedule remember
well i figured it was no coincidence
i had
a good time the other night
yeah
it amazing where 0 shots
of patrón will get you
laughs
so i was thinking
after work we could
you know
look kelli ann what happened
between us the other night was fun
it was definitely fun
but were way understaffed tonight
i even have to man the bar
so that why i scheduled you
to work

hey oh kelli ann
hey babe could you get the door

uptempo music playing
kelli ann

what can i get you
oh no im meeting someone
oh yeah what you got a hot date
i dont know if youd call it hot
this guy conor and i
have only been out one time
wait wait wait conor barry
yeah
conor not coming in tonight
thanks a lot
did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here
oh see when i said meeting someone
i guess it was kind of a broad term
a wide interpretation
of the word meeting
right you know what ill call him
oh no i mean just totally unnecessary
okay
i just was actually in the area
and so i just figured id swing by
and see if he was around
because i had to return his pen
had to return this pen he left this
and i just thought i should really return it
before he you know freaks out
yeah okay ill get it to him
thanks
wilson ward dds
adult child and geriatric dentistry
look im not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone
yeah that not even
his dentist though
oh really who is
my dad
oh
im gigi i went out
with conor last week
and i just
i thought if i just ran into him
i dont know im gonna go
wait
wait just
hang out for a second
let me buy you a drink
one drink okay
give me two seconds ill be right back
alex look you seem like a cool girl
so im just gonna be honest with you
conor never gonna call you
oh really how do you know
because im a guy
and it just how we do it
he said it was nice meeting me
i dont care if he said
you were his favorite female
since his mommy
and joanie cunningham
over a week went by okay gigi
and he didnt call you
but maybe he did call
and i didnt get the message
or maybe he lost my number
or he out of town
or got hit by a cab or his grandma died
or he didnt call because
he has no interest in seeing you again
yeah but my friend terri once went
out with a guy who never called
she totally wrote him off
over a year goes by
right
she ran into him
and it ended up that
your friend terri an idiot
she also the exception
by the way
the rare exception
okay okay
but what if im the exception
no youre not youre not at all
in fact youre the rule
and the rule is this if a guy doesnt
call you he doesnt wanna call you
really
yeah
always
yeah always
look i know what blowing off
a woman looks like okay
i do it early i do it often
so trust me when i say if a guy
is treating you like he doesnt give a shit
he genuinely doesnt give a shit
no exceptions
thank you
given me a lot to think about
gigi morning morning
man excuse me
hi
hi
everything okay
oh i was up all night
please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy
sure it basically done
i have to tell you something important
janine
sweetie what going on with your hair
yeah come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair
okay
so
thank you i think i figured it out
remember that notary public
who cheated on me
then anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning
but then he changed and now
theyre married and crazy in love
i thought that guy was a process server
no notary
anyway my point is
anastasia the exception not the rule
we have to stop listening
to these stories
the rule is that guys who cheat on you
dont care about you much
okay
okay so exhibit a
chad the drummer who lived
in a storage space
he only used me for rides and yet
i continued to stalk him for most of 998
and then oh there was don
who broke up with me every friday
so that he could have his weekends free
i was delusional about that relationship
id refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist
and all of my friends
used to tell me stories
about how things might work out
with these dipshits
because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine
and that girl ended up getting married
but that the exception
were not the exception were the rule
okay let me just see if i understand
so what youre saying is
if i hear a story about a girl
who been with a guy for 3 years
and he finally married her
that the exception
yes
but the rule are guys like neil
who are with girls like me
for seven years and arent married
theyre never getting married
no
no
no no no no no no
no
it not what she meant in that
no it got nothing to do with you
i absolutely was not talking about you
these are specific relationship situations
i was talking about myself specifically
gigi
just me specifically you know
this guy is like impossible
not to like you know
he flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the handy mart
and you know everything just kind
of lines up it really magical
and then he tells me that he married
which of course
i should be pissed about right
but i just cant stop thinking about him
but he married
i know i realize that
i dont know what wrong with me
what wrong with me
okay
i know this guy
he works in my dad printing business
and he was married for 5 years
to a nice lady
and one night he meets this woman
at some church event
and he tells my dad that he never
felt anything like it before
that he had finally met the one
so he divorced his wife
and he been with this other woman
for 22 years
and theyre insanely happy
i mean what if you meet
the love of your life
but you already married someone else
are you supposed to
let them pass you by
youre right okay
im gonna call him
okay
ben hello
hey ben this is anna marks
hey anna what up

why is it the painting
you know i know it looks
kind of like a deflated boob here
right i know
it gonna be depressing
should i take it down
no i want you
to stop doing anything nice
this feels like a trick
no
no
no i just i just need you
to stop being nice to me
unless youre gonna marry me after
chuckles
is that funny
do you think that funny
no i guess it not funny

and i cant keep pretending
that this is something that it not
weve been together
for over seven years
you know me you know who i am
you either wanna marry me
or you dont
or there the possibility
that i mean it when i say
i dont believe in marriage
bullshit
come on it bullshit for every woman
that has been told by some man
that he doesnt believe in marriage
and then six months later he married
to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym
it just it bullshit
where is this coming from
from the place ive been hiding
from you for about five years
okay
five years because i havent wanted
to seem demanding
and i havent wanted
to seem clingy or psycho
or whatever
so i havent asked you
but i
i have to
i mean
are you ever gonna marry me
oh i cant do this anymore
angela i used to think that i had
never been dumped
yeah then we started comparing notes
then we realized weve both been dumped
by every man weve ever been with
every one
yeah
but they do it so skillfully
mm-hm
they just so sneaky
that you think it was your idea
yeah youre sitting back
and youre like
oh yeah this my idea
but wait a second why am i alone
why am i unhappy
why have i gained 20 pounds
they jedi mind-trick you
yes they do
so they do a soft pass
yeah
they got little lines they like to tell you
like i dont wanna stand in your way
or youre perfect
it just i have to work on myself
right im just thinking
of your happiness
oh i dont deserve you
that my favorite one
you know the other one i like
i am so jealous of the guy
who gets to marry you
well that could have been you
yeah
that what i was leaning towards
yeah and the second you hear that
run to the store get yourself some ribs
and some ice cream
because you have been dumped
hey anna it ben
listen i know it been a while
since you called
it just it took me by surprise
but i did offer to help you
with your career

that it would be good for me to know
why you cannot live
without this other woman
well wed been together since college
and she gave me an ultimatum
she said either we get married
or we break up
so we got married
wow you caved

for too long and dont marry her
you marry her and youre an asshole
for marrying before youre ready

eventually find this piece of paper
and call you

your career in some small way

to tell any of you
that my cousin paige is hot
all laughing
in high school if i told the popular guys
that paige was my cousin
itd keep me
from getting my ass kicked
because no one wanted
to blow their chances with her
all laughing
and when she gets up there
and says those marriage vows to devon
there will be hearts breaking
all over the world
man hear hear
woman that sweet
but you know keep in mind
that her sister beth is still on the market
yeah sure she may be an older model
but she got a lot of good miles
left in that tank
but dont stay on the lot too long
or next year models are gonna
slip in there and steal all
okay that enough of the speeches

ken

and that yellow stuff is not hot mustard
it the crab hepatopancreas
bethie
your cousin jay
has always been a jackass
i know
and somehow even he married
ken chuckles
oh honey look
back when everyone
was just going to camp at the y
you borrowed my new york times
found some arts camp
in the berkshires
wrote away for information
and got accepted on your own
you never did things like everyone else
why not
because that you
that why youre my favorite daughter
youre not supposed to say that
i dont give a shit
im retired ill say what i want to
ill say it to the whole room if you want
wait wait wait come here stop
ken
it true though
hey
what are you doing
waiting for you
come on
sorry im late
no it okay
i like a little time before a blind date
prepare myself mentally remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars
gigi he not coming
but you can tell me the story
about the molars id love to hear it
hey
how could he already not like me
i screwed up i told bill it was thursday
not tuesday it my fault
hi are you good
can i get a jameson on the rocks
sure
gigi awesome im stuck with a guy who
cant distinguish tuesday from thursday
meanwhile this girl she probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak
this one right here
mm-hm
oh god no
how do you know
the guy working the tom cruise thing
she interested he clearly not
you cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he not into her
actually i can
i see this stuff going on every night
watch this she going on
about her macrobiotic diet
he thinking
dear christ get me out of here
and look how fortuitous
drinks spill which is perfect for him
because now
he can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo
man you have a gift
now check out droopy dog
on the other side
he gonna buy her drinks all night and
she still gonna insist there no spark
maybe there not you need a spark
oh the spark thing is bullshit
really
bullshit
enlighten me
guys invented the spark
so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing
then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally
was actually just a spark
and you guys all buy it
you eat it up and you love it
you love it because you feed off
that drama you all love that drama
i dont
so you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill
because secretly you love the drama
of not knowing whether or not
youre gonna make it
maybe
and let me guess
when you were stalking conor
the other night
were you obsessing
about him calling
constantly pacing back and forth
staring at your phone for days
even though the date
was just kind of mediocre
gigi laughs
okay yeah
because you all thrive on the drama
thank you
look you gotta be more like me
if a girl likes me great
but if not there are plenty more
out there like her you know
with smaller pores and bigger implants
that beautiful
i know
why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again
i dont know i like you
you do
well yeah okay dont start doodling
my name on your binder okay
i just mean i mean i like you
the way i like basset hounds
something pathetic about them
you just wanna cheer them up
again with the sensitivity
to sensitivity
hammering
it looks good
javier
yeah
janine
yeah
he does good work
yeah he does
janine
very nice
very nice
javier
yeah
javier
if i asked you an honest question
do you think you could
give me an honest answer
i think so
good good
because i think some of your guys
might be smoking
javier
is that the question
yes
seemed like a statement
the question part implied
i really didnt hear it in the inflection
javier
have you guys been smoking
or not
no maam my guys they dont smoke
on the job site theyre good guys
are you sure your guys havent been
sneaking around here
and smoking
and lying to me
and smoking
im pretty sure
i need you to be honest with me javier
because i cant have someone
lying to me
to my face under my roof
on my time
that a lot of prepositions
i mean there no reason
for that kind of dishonesty is there
i mean we made promises to each other
i mean we have a contract
that like making promises isnt it
maybe i should get back to work
oh yeah right yeah
that great yeah
javier
yeah
were good right you and me
oh yeah yeah were good
oh good
okay that great
yeah he did great work
hey
welcome everybody
thanks for coming im conor
sign in when you get a second
make yourselves at home
we got some cookies over here
some cold beverages help yourself
conor you are the liza minnelli
of real estate
i know your friend mary a genius
i know she so great
well i gotta go
so i guess ill see you later
what you got a class or
yeah no no just something
stuff i gotta do
conor okay well
ill see you okay bye
okay
okay bye
see you later
conor all right call me
what
she holding out on you isnt she
not quite sure i get your meaning
it obvious she wont sleep with you
it written all over your puppy-dog face
it killing me literally im dying
here have a cookie
no im cool
i dont know what she doing
i cannot read her signals
we used to sleep together all the time
that not true
i dont know why i said that
it wasnt all the time but it happened
i know im not just making this up
and then out of nowhere it just stops
but she still calls
she wants a massage
she leaves cute messages
but it not going anywhere
what is she doing
honestly we may not
have the best insight
gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals
he right
the signals are totally different
like here
here i wanna sleep with you
one two three
that it three seconds or more it on
and here
i dont wanna sleep with you
one two
nope thanks for playing move along
it that simple
youre right that didnt help me at all
all right well i can tell you this
gay or straight youre not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive
she likes you maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something
hit me up with an oatmeal raisin
will you
thanks
here you go
trent if a girl into you
she sleeping with you
if after a month
or two months at the very outside
she not sleeping with you
she doesnt like you
the trick is to spot this girl early
dont wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it never gonna happen
so ive come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl
a girl will never sleep with you
if she calls you cuddly
or dependable
if she pops a zit in front of you
if her name is amber or christine
if she takes a dump in your bathroom
or she takes home leftovers
on dates one two or three
i know it not scientific
but im just saying
you were warned
wait stop
what
ben
shit
what
i am so into you
seriously ive never felt like this before
i have to actively stop my brain
from thinking about you
like all the time
why stop
because i dont do stuff like this
stuff like what
like sleep with women
that arent my wife
first of all i am not women
im just one
and second of all
oh i didnt have a second of all
i was hoping second of all
would make me feel better
second of all
i cant stop thinking about you either
anna laughs
he totally leaving his wife for me
that crazy
that crazy we hardly know each other
i dont know i mean look at becca
you know my sister friend
one guy waits on her at bennigan
and by the end of the meal
they both knew they had found the one
youre right youre totally right
i mean it could happen right
not for me
what about texter
texter has yet to make verbal contact
i mean this guy couldve had surgery
leaving him without a voice box
breathing through a stoma
and i would never know because
ive never actually heard his voice
well i doubt he has a stoma
mary
that not the point i cant text
you know im not charming via text
anna
maybe you should just stop texting
but it not just texting it e-mail
it voicemail it snail mail
that regular mail
whatever none of it working
i had this guy leave me a voicemail
at work so i called him at home
and then he e-mailed me to my blackberry
and so i texted to his cell
then he e-mailed me to my home account
and the whole thing just got out of control
and i miss the days where you had one
phone number and one answering machine
and that one answering machine
housed one cassette tape
and that one cassette tape either
had a message from the guy or it didnt
and now you have to go around
checking all these different portals
just to get rejected
by seven different technologies
it exhausting
what about that myspace guy
jude i like him
good
yeah i felt like we connected
great
what if she wants you to kiss her
well then i guess
im just gonna have to kiss her
amanda jones is no minor leaguer
wholl be swept off her feet
at the touch of your amateur lips
phone rings
this babe has plenty of battle scars
hello
oh hey youre home
where am i supposed to be
out maybe it saturday night
you wont let me go out with guys
who dont like me it kind of limiting
right listen i was just gonna
leave a message
im having a party next weekend
you should come
oh i dont know wont conor be there
might be kind of awkward
he at a real-estate conference in dc
but therell be a lot of single guys
so there will be plenty of chances
for me to be awkward
dont worry ill be there
ill talk you through it
plates shattering
okay gotta go
someone just dropped like 84000 plates
maybe ill see you there
youre busy i shouldnt have called

was watts
yes
so why arent you watts
im eric stoltz
alex is watts watts helps eric stoltz
go on a date with amanda jones
really she in love with eric stoltz
so amanda jones is conor
i guess at first now men in general
but that not the point
the point is he into me
i knew there had to be some reason why
he was spending that time with you
i know it so obvious now
there are so many signs
signs love signs you gotta
tell me about the signs i love signs
first they were small at first when i
called he said good to hear from you
totally good sign
right
and then the next time i called
he was with a woman
but he took the call
and we talked for a while
you know it was a woman
called her babe
okay a guy doesnt leave a woman
to go talk to another woman unless he
and it gets more obvious
i mean please there was no guy
he was gonna fix me up with
the fix-up was him
no
yes he shows up
without this fictitious bill character
the two of us basically have a date
and then he calls and invites me
to a party at his place
janine
he so likes you

i really gotta go to bed though

what
gigi laughs
oh god that was cheesy
oh im not good at this
what
alex
hey
oh yes i knew it
the best relationships
grow out of friendships
wait wait wait gigi
wait wait wait
what
now you and i are in a relationship
well id say if were not
at relationship station-ship
were at least on the track
and why exactly would you think that
because of the signs
really like what
like it was good to hear from me
and you talked to me
even when you were with a girl
and i felt something
oh man
what are you talking about
gigi what have i been saying
since i met you
if a guy wants to date you he will make
it happen okay he will ask you out
did i ask you out
no
why would you do this
oh shit
why do women do this
build up this stuff in their minds
take each little thing a guy does
and then twist it into something else
it insane
id rather be like that than be like you
excuse me
what is that supposed to mean
i may dissect each little thing
and put myself out there too much
but at least that means i still care
oh you think youve won
because women are expendable to you
you may not get hurt
or make an ass of yourself that way
but you dont fall in love
that way either
you have not won
youre alone alex
i may do a lot of stupid shit
but i know im a lot closer
to finding someone than you are
beth
do you want anything else
yeah less of the cardboard crap
and more regular people food
well that cardboard crap
is what we call whole-wheat toast
well maybe you could just fry me up
a couple of sausage links
people who have just had a heart attack
are generally not advised
to have animal fat that been stuffed
into a synthetic casing
chuckles
van morrison i got a woman
playing on record
steven hey beth grab me a beer
when you get to the kitchen okay
and a little plate of cold cuts

to hang on to this vinyl
my collection could use a lot of these
would you just turn it the fuck down
well were totally out of toilet paper
and all we have left to eat
is some old jelly and some ramen noodles
and our new brother would like to co-opt
dad property before he even dead
laura also your husband would
really like another beer
to go with his fifth consecutive hour
of the golf network
are you okay
crying

gigi do you know who it is
no
doesnt matter
so are you gonna leave him
gigi he my husband

he didnt wait to get caught
which takes courage you know
im sorry i didnt mean that
i didnt mean it
i know that alex wasnt just some guy
oh it okay
it my fault you know
what
oh i just think i need to take responsibility
for my share in the whole
mess you know
i forced him into getting married
you know he wasnt ready
janine this isnt your fault
no it is it is ive changed
i was
fun you know
i was fun when we first met
youre still fun
sighs

janine crying
i mean realistically
what do i expect him to do you know
i dont think that really
god this tile is too small
i have to tell javier
what
this tile is too small
i gotta go i have to take a personal day
if anyone asks
mariel
well my first husband was unimpressive
i found him in bed
with his big-breasted secretary
when i came home early
from the maldives
it was just so unoriginal
made me feel sorry for him
my second husband
was a pinch more creative
cheated on me with my sister
but made me believe that i was insane
for being suspicious
so at least some mind games
some intrigue
but my last husband he was a gem
he was a veritable master
at covering his tracks
i mean i pored over his phone records
i intercepted his credit-card bills
i had him followed
on numerous occasions
and never found
a single shred of evidence
it wasnt until he died
that i found out about the property
he owned with his austrian mistress
but the real master i have to say is me
three husbands countless boyfriends
i havent been caught yet

we used to have the exact same one

i know where my life is going
and i want you to go with me
im not saying i want you
to move in right now
but i dont want to buy this place
unless at some point
you could see yourself moving in
so what do you think
i cant do this
okay
well if it too fast
i guess we can always just
i cant do any of this
i mean
what youre saying
and what youre offering
is what every girl wants
it what i always wanted
it just
you dont want it with me
okay
i have a question
is there any way we could
dial it back to before
when we were just sleeping together
because i dont know
i felt like that gelled
babe
it was nice meeting you
thank you so much for a lovely evening
you too
good night
knocking on door
you forget something
yeah i did
really what did you forget
this
you came all the way here at 00 at night
to bring me back a promotional pen
yeah
i thought i should just come up with
some really great excuse to get over here
that how it done isnt it
sometimes
look i cant stop thinking about you
it a problem
i drive by your place i call and hang up
im turning into
me
yeah
a wise person once told me
that if a guy wants to be with a girl
he will make it happen no matter what
that true
but when i was hurling my body
onto yours
you did not seem
to want to make it happen
yeah all right
here the thing about that
you were right
ive gotten so used to keeping myself
at a safe distance from all these women
and having the power
that i didnt know what it felt like
when i actually fell
for one of them
i didnt know
look i just went out
with your friend bill and
yeah
he might be just exactly what i need
no drama
he calls he does what he says
i can do that stuff too
but you didnt
and that same wise person told me
that i am the rule
that i have to stop thinking
that every guy will change
that i have to stop thinking that
im the exception
you are my exception
phone rings
conor barry
hi it mary at the blade
im looking at your new ad and i love it
really you dont think the muscle t
is too much
i think the shirt youre wearing now
is probably more you
what you here
im sitting right in front of you
mary laughing
wow this is you mary
it me
im me
should l
please please
okay
talk to you in a minute
see you in a second
okay
hey
hi
how are you
it nice to finally meet you
you too
in person
this is a pleasant surprise
you
what
i dont know not what i expected
my voice doesnt match my face
conor your voice does not match
your face in a good way
in a yeah i mean
that sounded terrible
amazing
i dont know how all this stuff
fit in here before
i know it seems like it just expanded
you are not trying
to get these back in here
you are not getting rid of these pants
we had a deal mister
these are not staying
you can store those horizontally
goodwill wouldnt even take these
they could be pressed
flattened you can
if youre gonna throw them out
at least check the pockets all right
so you dont throw away
some personal items
i love you so much
so much
and i wanna make you happy
i need to make you happy
for me to even have a shot
at being happy
will you marry me
yes of course i will yes
yes
neil
thank god
gigi
girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up
if a guy punches you he likes you
never try to trim your own bangs
and someday you will meet a wonderful guy
and get your very own happy ending
and your commitment to each other
gigi every movie we see
every story were told
implores us to wait for it
the third act twist
the unexpected declaration of love
the exception to the rule
but sometimes were so focused
on finding our happy ending
we dont learn how to read the signs
how to tell the ones who want us
from the ones who dont
the ones who will stay
from the ones who will leave
hi
hi
gigi and maybe this happy ending
doesnt include a wonderful guy
maybe it you
on your own
picking up the pieces and starting over
freeing yourself up
for something better in the future
maybe the happy ending is just
moving on
baby what are you doing it our turn
forget the dip come on come on
man
let go alex
come on alex your turn
ready lol
laugh out loud we won
gigi
or maybe the happy ending is this
knowing that through all the unreturned
phone calls and broken hearts
through all the blunders
and misread signals
through all of the pain
and embarrassment
you never ever gave up hope
neil
now that we are married
beth
were gonna move
gonna move
that one thing were gonna do
another thing were gonna do
is move a little further away from
baltimore
your sisters
janine
i mean everyone makes mistakes
ive started trying to figure out what
i wanna do who i wanna be you know
probably seems the wrong time to do that
but why not you know why not
better later than never
im dating now
man
what do you miss most about marriage
have you been married
man
yes im married
you are married

and what your question
mary were heading there is that fair
conor it moving fast just on our way
i like him ill say that l word
that true it does start with an l yeah
i like her a lot so
good im glad
mouthing
i love her i love her
anna you know what ive been focusing
my energy on
is like a self-discovery
as opposed to dating
i dont know
maybe dating a little overrated
good friend of mine and i
are going to india for a few months
were going on a yoga retreat
alex
i really genuinely love this person
he had asked me to co-host this party
and i stayed after
i was trying to help you out because there
was this girl who would not leave
