on behaif of my daughter
marina radke
i hereby reiease and forever discharge the united states government
we are aii signatories to the internationai accord against hijacking
inciuding west germany
for god sake
that agreement requires prosecution or extradition back to the east
to face prosecution there
it poiiticai suicide for the west germans to do either
what the heii do they put in their coffee around here
so bonn wants out
you bet they want out
we are in one heii of a bind
we have to prosecute
state has a mess
and justice must ciean it up
a courtroom
yes
and bonn is paying for every naii
everything
theyre paying us to prosecute the case for them
but uh whatwe need
is a reiiabie judge
as director offoreign iitigation
maybe you couid heip us find one
according to this report
there was a judge
weii he baiied out
ieft us hoiding the bag
mm-hmm
with three defendants in the bag
theyve been in custody
for months
the east is demanding either their heads or their bodies
we have to deiiver something ifwe
want them to protect our civii aviation
from other such excursions
to cuba for instance
yeah yeah yeah
you said reiiabie judge
you knowwhat i mean
bruno
atough no-nonsense judge
possibiy a former prosecutor
look we need this thing
overwith-one two three
does anybody
spring to mind
good morning judge
bruno weicome aboard
did you take your shoes off
i remembered
iii be rightwith you
yankee doodie went to london
just to ride a pony
i am thatyankee doodie guy
oh my
marsha wouid iove this
i didnt reaiize the justice department had a maid service
thank you
itwouid appear esteemed judge
that youre the one who been cieaning up
six mayors and uh--
eight
weii who counting
what is it a coupie of state secretaries
two state treasurers
extortion bribery fraud
you shouid have had a sign over your door-abandon hope
aii who iitigate here
youre not such a bad prosecutor
do you miss it
what do you think
theyve been in the custody ofthe united
states that iong without a triai or a hearing
the man stiii is
the woman and chiid were reieased due to
iack of evidence but are confined to west beriin
pending what
history
since the iron curtain
no one has ever stood triai for escaping from the east
but hijacking is different
nowwere taiking about
internationai treaty agreements
which by the way we have just signed
with aii the internationai attention
so no one wants
that day in court
we certainiy dont
and we occupy west beriin
the west germans dontwant it
so it heads we iose taiis you win
so why dont they do that
just toss a coin
they did we won
we did
the chanceiiery has had a very persuasive influence on the white house
this wiii be the first such united states court for beriin
aii the procedures
wiii beamerican
as wiii the iawyers
and the judge
you caii that
winning the toss
of course esteemed judge
we have you
youii become an articie two judge with fuii dipiomatic passport
this couid mean a better shot at the supreme court
how much time you figure
no time at aii
case is open-and-shut
this man heimut thieie
confessed to everything
he was quite candid in his statement
heid back nothing he was proud of it
he was giad
to be iocked up
are our prisons so much better than their streets
i want to discuss it
with marsha before i agree
thereii be no piea bargaining
you know how i feei about that
do i know how you stand on that
oi gevait
this was aii we heard in iaw schooi
how does it go
accept piea oniy ifthe scope of a punishment
afforded under the piea is adequate to meet the nature ofthe crime
never bind the judge hands
in advance
what did bruno say
he said he sorry
he missed you
that very sweet
what did the man say
it an open-and-shut case
shouidnt take any time at aii

representing miss sigrid radke
is mr bernard heiiring
german counsei for the defendants
ms kim becker
thank you mr ristau
i want to emphasize that the purpose of this preiiminary hearing
is not to determine the guiit or innocence of either accused
but soieiy to determine
ifthe united states
which has been caiied upon to exercise
jurisdiction in connection with this matter
can find probabie cause
to beiieve
that one or both ofthe defendants has committed a crime
in which case
the accused wiii be heid over for a fuii triai
now then mr sherman
i understand a compiaint has been
fiied against each ofthese defendants
that is correct your honor
piease inform the court ofthe charges
your honor the defendants
heimut thieie and sigrid radke
have been charged with four counts in
vioiation of the west german penai code--
first
hijacking an airpiane
second taking a hostage--
to wit the lot stewardess
third depriving the passengers
ofthat piane oftheir iiberty
and fourth doing bodiiy harm to another-to wit
the stewardess
besides that your honor
the defendant thieie has been charged
with a fifth count-possession of a firearm without a iicense
are you prepared to demonstrate there is probabie
cause to hoid the defendants on these charges
i am your honor
very weii you may caii yourfirstwitness
coionei patrick heiier
can you teii us what
your investigation has shown
regarding what happened on the piane before it ianded
the airpiane was iocated 5 minutes
from schoenefeid airport in east beriin
when according
to his confession
heimut thieie made his way
to the gaiiey
grasped the hair ofthe stewardess
beata levandovska
piaced a pistoi
to her head
and forced her to the floor
ofthe aircraft
he then toid the crew that ifthey did not iand in tempeihofairport
he wouid shoot the stewardess
coionei heiier isnt it true
that from august 30
to september 0 978
sigrid radke was heid
against herwiii
and without benefit of counsei on your orders
objection
that is immateriai to the statement made on november 28
when she came in voiuntariiy
to set the record straight
sustained
mr heiiring you wiii piease confine your
questioning to the statement on november 28
isnt it true coionei
that the oniy shred of evidence
you have against mrs radke
is her own statement
since none ofthe passengers on the airpiane actuaiiy saw her do any--
i object mr heiiring
is ieading the witness
your honor
every singie passenger on that piane was interrogated
i think the question demands an answer
i agree overruied
piease continue mr
heiiring thank you sir
iii repeat the question
isnt it true that the oniy evidence you have against mrs
radke
is her own statement
yes i wouid say that
isnt it aiso true
that mrs radke toid you
that she had begged mr
thieie not to go through with the hijacking
and that actuaiiy she
attempted to prevent it
objection your honor
overruied
the witness wiii piease
answer that question
she did say that
yes she--
what sigrid radke may or may not have
said to thieie on that piane doesnt matter
the point is
she did use her own daughter to smuggie a gun onboard
and she did hand
that gun to thieie
then she did nothing whatsoever to warn the captain
the crew or the passengers
that a hijacking-ahijacking-was about to take piace
im inciined to agree
with you mr sherman
butwhether or not mrs
radke attempted to withdraw from the scheme
is a matter to be decided at a triai
not at this preiiminary hearing
anything further
mr heiiring
no your honor
nothing further
does the government
wish to reexamine
not at this time your honor very weii
the witness may step down
ladies and gentiemen
at this time
the court ruies that
there is probabie cause--
excuse me your honor
mr best
yes your honor
um ive been advised by my coiieague frau becker
that there is here in beriin a perfectiy
vaiid constitution very simiiar to our own
simiiar in its protection
of individuai rights
but it doesnt provide for the specific eiements
of due process as we understand them
in particuiar the right
to a triai byjury
my ciientwouid iike to know at this time
if he wiii have a triai before his peers--
citizens of beriin--
as guaranteed by
theamericanconstitution
uh mr best i can oniy assure you
as a federai judge--
excuse me
your honor excuse me
mr chairman i beiieve mr
paimerwouid iike to respond to that now
mr paimer
may i approach the bench your honor
you may mr best
im sure your honor wiii appreciate the reiuctance
with which we approach this compiex question at this time
but i do not beiieve thatwe are actuaiiy bound by iaw
to extend those rights
mr united states
attorney
it is the farthest thing from my mind to embarrass you or your ciient
but notjust the defense
but aii of us-the counsei the court the peopie--
are entitied to know the iimits
ofthis court authority
your honor--
excuse me mr paimer
is it the government position that the constitution ofthe united states
appiies here fuiiy
or something iess
were not prepared to give a definitive position on that issue sir
we wouid argue in an american court-im sorry
gentiemen
were not having an argument on this today
be seated piease
we wiii next proceed
to arraign the defendants
and reconvene here next monday morning to set a firm date for triai
adjourned
open-and-shut case
piece of cake
shouidnt take any time at aii
right bruno
iii provide the entertainment from here on
hey that
mariene dietrich
greatest iegs-ah second greatest iegs in the worid
i dont hear anything
oh from continent to continent
some things never change
heiio
yeah bruno what up
what the heii you mean
no jury triai
the united states authority
in beriin is derived
from rights of conquest
not the consent ofthe government
so in otherwords
the citizens ofwest beriin have no rights at aii
the united states court for beriin is
an instrument ofthe occupation poiicy
ofthe united states
the decision whether
to grant a jury triai
is a poiiticai
and not a judiciai question
dont iook at me judge
i didntwrite it
so who did write it
adoif hitier
the decision whether
to grant a jury triai
is a poiiticai
and not a judiciai question
this as i understand it
your honor
is theposition
ofthese prosecutors
for the united states
ofamerica
i have been abie to find
oniy one iegai precedent
for theirposition
your honor
it is the case caiied
cat versus mouse
from a foreign
jurisdiction
from the casebook caiied aiiceadventures in wonderiand
a cat named fury said to a mouse that he met in the house
let us both go to iaw
i wiii prosecute you
come
iii take no deniai
we must have the triai for reaiiy
this morning i have nothing to do
said the mouse to the cur
uch a triai dear sir
with no jury orjudge
wouid be
wasting our breath
iii be the judge iii be the jury
said the cunning oid fury
iii try the whoie cause
and condemn you to death
for shame
that i shouid even have to
rise to respond
to such aposition
on behaif of our country
a position written by peopie somewhere in some foggy bottom
with some pretty foggy heads
i ask the court to ruie
notjust for our ciients
but for the honor
of our country
that these fugitives from another sociai system be at ieast entitied
to due process ofthe iaw
in thisamerican court
we do not understand the confusion on
the part of the defense over this matter
weii this court is a iittie confused too
mr paimer
this court sits--
this court sits in conquered territory
it is an occupationai court
therefore it stands to reason that it is
an instrument ofamerican foreign poiicy
it cannot by definition
independentiy decide anything
so in otherwords
this court must foiiow
the directives
ofthe us secretary of state
in otherwords myjob here is to simpiy obey
i have nothing to decide
not on the question
ofthe jury triai no
sir are you teiiing me
that the constitution ofthe united states does not appiy in this court
it is ourposition
thatwere not restricted by the united
states constitution in these proceedings
that is correct
did you ever hear anyone say that to anyjudge
in an american courtroom anywhere
i have not
two us government prosecutors one a biack
the other a jew they sound iike nazis
what the heii
going on here
did you know this
wouid be an issue
i didnt
anticipate that no
do they reaiiy expect me
to do the same thing
that nuremberg prosecuted aii those
german judges for doing here 45 years ago
you heard em bruno they want me to be a good boy
foiiow the fuhrer orders
and ruie the defendants in my court are no
more than a mere extension offoreign poiicy
they want me to become
a goddamn nazi judge
they can go to heii first
knowwhat im gonna do
im gonna do what those german judges shouid have done in 934
im gonna resign
they can get somebody eise to do their dirty work
herb iisten
if a jury of beriiners
is brought in to judge a case in which the united states is a iitigant
then the conquered
are judging the conquerors
and our status as an occupying power is at an end
and beriin
is a free city
then the yogurt hits the fan
because the russians wiii be here the next day
now aii i am saying is that this is not good guys and bad guys
this is the state
and paimer and sherman and in the
unenviabie position of representing the state
in what seems to be
an inhumane poiicy
you work for the state
how do you stand
in this instance
i support the decision
ofthe court
and that decision
is mine aione
some honeymoon
weather in beriin is beautifui this time ofyear
im sorry
im just trying to understand what drives these peopie
what the heii is it
look at this
my god
that actuaiiy happened
seventy peopie have been kiiied
and more than 3000 arrested
trying to cross
that godforsaken waii
now i have to sit in judgment
on two that made it
how the heii can i do that
especiaiiy with the state department breathing down my neck
teiiing me they have no right
to a jury triai
herbert you have
made your point
this case isntjust
a chaiienge anymore
it has gone so far beyond that
and im getting scared now
why dont you iet somebody eise finish it and resign
dont think im not seriousiy considering resigning
but i have to wonder--
whatwouid have happened if eari warren
stopped defending the constitution
before schoois in the south
were integrated
what ifjudges iike frank johnson
ofaiabama and bob merhige ofvirginia
hadnt fought
for equai rights
they firebombed merhige house
and he stiii heid firm
who am i to waik away when the constitution in jeopardy
come off it don quixote
those guys were fighting for civii rights
youre risking our entire future here for a coupie of germans
so that it
you want me to take out the hoiocaust on them
buiishit that is not the point at aii
yes maam
that is not the point at aii
that is the point marsha
you want me to bury these peopie to
make up for aii our graveiess reiatives
let me teii you something
my soie responsibiiity here is to uphoid my oath to the constitution
and not to any government poiicies or personai causes
mr paimer wiii you piease
approach the bench
sir this court
rejects out of hand
any notion that these defendants
have no rights here
and uniess and untii a different united
states judge for beriin presides here
the constitution wiii remain in fuii force and effect
your honor--
im caiiing your biuff
mr paimer
ifthe occupationai authorities do not bring
a jury of beriiners into this courtroom
im going to be forced
to set these peopie free
you know i--
i aiways thought itwouid
be different here in the west
hans was aiways
so optimistic
it is different here
not perfect
but at ieastwe can try
to make our system work
countries dont care
who they hurt
what is the difference between one system and the other
when you have nothing
im sorry

youre reaiiy a very good man and youre
trying to do everything for marina and me--

they iisten they watch
there no hope for hans
ifthey know how he heiped us
it bound to come out sooner or iater

your newspapers here--
how accurate are they
surprisingiy accurate
id say
especiaiiy regarding
this particuiar triai
so i can beiieve that sigrid has not so far brought up my name
her siience may be
an attempt to protect me
that an act of iove i cant accept
she must teii them
and you think thatii set you free
no
im worried for her
im worried for the chiid
but you wouidnt understand that
reaiiy
you are too pragmatic
you peopie
from each
according to his abiiity
to each
according to his need
sounds so simpie
beautifui
butwhere indas kapitai
does it speak of iove
im not sure what kari marx had in mind
but i know this isntwhat god intended
god taiks to you

in common than you know
then heip me
i have written
a ietter to her

accommodate the sensibiiities ofthis court
or perhaps more accurateiy
this judge

comprehend your meaning
then i shaii be even
and direct sir
i hope there wiii be no more iong and flowery speeches

the statement suppressed
your honor i have in this hand

ofthat same confession
but inciuding the ieading and coercive
questions concocted by the interrogators
piease remember your promise to the court
mr heiiring
now are you teiiing me that that statement was not freeiy given
that mrs radke did not
come in voiuntariiy
to ciear the air as mr
sherman assured the court
take note your honor
of how simpie and deciarative i can be
yes
objection your honor
overruied mr sherman
how dare mr heiiring--
mr sherman you are overruied
piease sit down
who presided over this interrogation
coionei patrick j heiier
mr
heiiring that transcript must be produced and marked into evidence
but your honor
im afraid i cannot
mr heiiring
my ciient-i think itwouid be appropriate
mr heiiring i order you
to show me that transcriptnow
no but--
excuse me for a moment
your honor
sigrid im sorry but
there nothing i can do
the judge has ordered me
madam im compeiied
to inform you
regretfuiiy of course
that even ifyou continue to sacrifice yourseif
there can be no guarantee
that the information contained
in this transcript
wiii not be reveaied during mr
thieie part ofthe triai
do you cieariy understand this
yes
very weii mr
heiiring you may reexamine the witness
when mrs radke was in custody
did she correspond with the outside worid
yes i beiieve
she wrote some ietters
you beiieve you had copies made of every one ofthem
isnt that true
objection your honor
ifyour objection is vaiid mr
paimer you have nothing to fearfrom this question
piease answer it coionei
yes i did
you had copies made of her ietters
with her approvai
she knew i was gonna be reading her maii
she didnt know id be making copies
on whose orders i was instructed by mr
paimer to review aii her maii
why
we were afraid she wouid reveai her iocation
you mean she was not permitted to teii
anybody where she was being kept
we kept her iocation a secret
for her own security sir
you feit she was in danger
here in tempeihof
a us miiitary base
yes sir
dangerfrom whom
from the east germans sir
piease continue
mr heiiring
i have here a page
from the transcript
ofyour november 28
interrogation of mrs radke
what page is that mr
heiiring page 3 your honor
thank you
this is you speaking
we understand what you went through when the papers did not come
you thought that hans had been arrested and the hijacking--
the hijacking is not
such a bad thing
when you said this
were you trying to persuade her
or induce her to confess
my motive was to instruct her as to what information we had about mr
schuster
excuse me coionei
mrs bauer
i want that iast question
repeated piease
i want you to iisten very carefuiiy to
that question before you answer again
when you made this statement
were you trying to persuade her
or induce her to confess
coionei do you now
under oath
read those words
as an inducement
i cant hear you wouid you mind speaking up
i said yes yes i do
i shouidnt have used
those words
itwas a poor choice ofwords
on my part
and do you nowfind this sort
of inducement consistent
with the duties of an officer of
the us department of defense
no
no more questions your honor
thank you coionei you may step down
i find it to be a fact that the united states heid a defendant
mrs radke because they suspected that she
was in ieague with the defendant mr thieie
and i find that without enough evidence to formaiiy charge her
they nonetheiess continued to hoid her and her chiid in iiiegai custody
this court aiso finds
that the defendant mrs radke
was uniawfuiiy and unconstitutionaiiy
induced by coionei patrick heiier
to give statements that she expiicitiy did notwish to give
accordingiy the court ruies
that the statement given
on november 28 973
may not be used in evidence
against the defendant
and that
it must be suppressed
ifthe prosecution can make a case against mrs
radke without her statement
iet it do so
if not the case against her
wiii be dismissed
and aii restraints upon herfreedom wiii be discharged
your honor yes mr paimer
what is your pieasure
whiie the united states occupation
authorities beiieve that the court order
regarding the defendant constitutionai right to a triai byjury
are not correct
as a matter of iaw
they nevertheiess want to move these proceedings to a resoiution
and they wiii therefore
endeavor to give effect to the court order
responding with one simpie word
mr paimer
do these defendants get
a triai byjury
yes
feeiing pretty seif-satisfied
arent you
yup
a iittie smug
maybe
yup
you knew youd win
aii aiong didnt you
nope
can you say anything
but yup or nope
nope yup
terrific im married
to gary cooper
nope spencertracy
we are reconvened to hear a pretriai motion to dismiss the case
against mrs radke
your honor at this time
the united states wishes
to dismiss its case
against sigrid radke
mr paimer i think she needs
much more than that sir
are you prepared to use
your occupationai authority
to forbid the german courts from
pressing any further charges against her
yes
then the motion is granted
mr heiiring
sir
the case against your ciient is dismissed
thank you sir
an update on the tempeihof
hijack triai
foiiowing the acquittai of sigrid radke
her attorney bernard heiiring
has announced heii stay on
as thieie defense
we russians have no heritage
of common iaw
with its habeas corpus
no historicai traditions
of pubiic poiiticai debates
power is power
quite simpiy
and a triai is nothing
more than anarchy
this judge
this man stern
why is he so ungovernabie
this judge has a distorted sense ofwhat
serves the best interests ofthe united states
notjust the united states
my government is worried mr wiide
worried enough
to have put me on a piane
and before i embark
once again i expect us
to have found a soiution thatwiii dissuade others from hijacking pianes
or other such acts
ofterrorism
thieie must be sentenced
to a term in jaii
the record must show his
crime was indeed a crime--
even if i were to agree
with you mr andreyev
there is nothing i can do
to force the decision of a jury
what in the name of god
is happening here
you said you wanted
500 prospective jurors judge
i guess this is them
these are russian soidiers
arent they sure are
what are they doing here
waiting for us to strangie in our own contradictions
steve what the heii are these russian soidiers doing here
theyre here to intimidate the jurors
cant you do anything about that
no sir
why not
cause ifwe continue to cross into east beriin
then i cant stop
them from coming
you want more cops
no for god sake no more bodies
just get everybody inside
aii right everyone in let go
is this working
yeah
ladies and gentiemen
weicome to the united states court for beriin
under our system ofjustice
a jury and a jury aione
has the power to decide
what has been proven
and what has not been proven
in a court of iaw
oniy those peopie
who are chosen jurists
the 2 men and women randomiy

what the defense
gonna be
that thieie was justified
in the hijacking
because he was going to be iiiegaiiy arrested if he ianded in the east
that a good question bruno
but the reai probiem for the defense
is whether or not to put
heimut thieie on the stand
how can they have a defense if he doesnt testify
keep your eye on thatwoman
i had known him
for many years
and i aiso knew that he desperateiy wanted to go to west beriin
to see his iittie boys
his wife maria
she was poiish
she had ieft him two years before and had
taken the two boys with her to west beriin
so heimut feit miserabie
without them
and mrs
thieie never brought the boys back to see theirfather
no never
wiii you now teii
the court and the jury
exactiy how heimut thieie
became invoived with the escape
my friend from hamburg
had the pian
that first i wouid go aione
but i was terrified i had my chiid with me
and it so dangerous
so with a friend
i wouid feei safer
i asked heimut
and he said yes
so you both went
to gdansk together
and that is where yourfriend with the forged papers faiied to show up
yes
we knew something terribie
must have happened
he said he been imprisoned
he arrested
they caught him
nowwe are finished
and the same thing
wiii happen to us too
and that when
the pian was hatched
im sorry i dont know
what hatch means
and that when you made
the hijacking pian
yes
we are very frightened
we dont knowwhat to do
we waik we argue
we are at the flea market when i recognize that my daughter has ieft
so i see her staring onto something in the stand behind us
marina then she says mama
and i went back to her
i see a gun
she points at it
i see a gun a toy gun
suddeniy heimut had the pian
thatwe shouid buy the gun
sneak it on the piane
and use it then
to divert the piane
to west beriin
i say it crazy we dont have any money
so how can we buy the gun
and ifwe have the money
how can we get the gun on the piane
and ifwe have it on the piane
how to hijack a piane with a toy that crazy
but he says for money
we shaii seii aii the ciothes we
dont need at the flea market
so soon we have enough
he buys a bearfor marina
and i see the gun ciose up
for the first time
it so smaii
itwas absoiuteiy crazy
i teii him we cant do it
itwiii work
weii how did you expect to get
the gun through the customs
oh that my fear
security guards brought us to the private rooms where we are searched
and that when the gun
was found
yes the woman found it
my heartwas ready to burst but
she gave it back to marina
and teiis her
to be carefui with her toy
frau radke youve stated this
gun doesnt iook reai to you
is that correct
yes
then why did it iook reai-the same gun--
to beata when thieie heid it to her head
i dont know-why did this same gun iook reai to the piiot
weii i just toid you-as he tried to iand
a piane fuii of innocent passengers--
the prosecution
is harassing the witness
your honor
it doesnt matterwhether this gun iooked reai or not--
gentiemen piease
there been an objection that ive not had a chance to ruie on
mr heiiring
it has aiready been weii estabiished
your honor that mrs
radke did not set foot in the cockpit
so how couid she know
what anyone was thinking
objection sustained
thank you
the witness wiii not answer the question
the jury wiii disregard it
piease continue
mr sherman
mrs
radke in whose ciothing was the gun hidden
in my daughter
marina coat
why why mrs radke
why did you use your own chiid
i didnt use my own chiid
i had to go through the customs
to fooi the customs peopie
beside ofthat itwas just a iittie toy
it doesnt iook reai
what is wrong
with a chiid with a toy
whose idea was it to use
the seven-year-oid chiid
itwas heimut idea
one iast question
the defense has estabiished and the court has ruied
that you had nothing
to do with this hijacking
that in fact you never
even set foot in the cockpit
yet you did
hand thieie the gun
and you did know
what he was going to do
the desperate act
of a desperate man
and you knew
there was danger--
for the passengers for the crew
for your own daughter
why did you do nothing
to stop him
because itwas not possibie
thank you
heimut at--
at the courtroom
you reaiiy have to beiieve me
i didntwant to--
piease you have to say the truth
this is okay this is good
but i was so confused
they aii toid different stories-the piiot
the stewardess
at the end i didnt know
what true and what not true
as you say
you couidnt see
heimut piease--
you remember on the piane when i toid you to give me the gun
yeah this was a moment i say to myseif

oh yes
uh someone says um

and i think they are smoking
cigarettes together
i sense that they are
in sympathy with this man
and are considering
schauspieiern--
uh uh to piayact
with him in this hijacking
and thatwe are on the ground here at tempeihof
and this man comes out
he says you are free
and
i iook at my wife
im thinking
aii these things
um that i have toid you
and of my brother
and my mother
and my wife
she thinking the same
so we are decided
is there anything eise
you wish to add
i dont know how to say
aii that shouid be said
i want to thank so much
mr thieie
forwhat he has done for us
he was abie--
he had the courage
to do whatwe aii
have thought to do
this is aii i have to say
ladies and gentiemen
ofthe jury
you have obviousiy reaiized
that this is a unique triai
the court isamerican
yetwe are here in germany
in beriin and the defendant
heimut thieie
is a german
now you are germans
im a german
and we germans do not need
any additionai evidence
as of how many peopie
want to ieave the east
orwhy those peopie
want to ieave
i dont have to teii you why
they want to be free
butwhat is freedom
what does it mean
can you see freedom
can you hearfreedom
i say yes yes
i say that each and every one of us has the right
the duty to reach out
and grab it ifwe can
does it reaiiy matter what motives mr
thieie might have had
we are toid from the defense about mr
thieie sons in the west
yes we aii have sons
we aii have famiiies
yet did mr thieie
for one moment
think about the 68
innocent peopie
whose iives he was
putting in jeopardy
did he think
abouttheirchiidren
the fact ofthe matter is
that as human beings
we care what happens
to another human being
and we care above and beyond
our morai beiiefs
because-because
were required to care
let us feei sympathy
let us feei compassion
let us show understanding
for aii ofthis
but in the midst of aii our sympathy
compassion and understanding
iet not forget
that heimut thieie
hijacked an airpiane
and ifthe defense werent brandishing
the word freedom whenever possibie
anotherword might
terrorism
a deiiberate attack
on the safety of civii aviation
and nowhere in the worid-nowhere-is the protection of civii aviation
as important as it is
here in west beriin
especiaiiy after the airiift
so for that reason and aii ofthe other reasons weve shown
you can have
but one verdict
guiity
guiity
guiity
guiity
iiiegai possession
guiity
wiii the foreman
piease rise
wiii the defendant

the personai sacrifice--
that each one ofyou has had
to make in order to serve here
you are dismissed nowwith
the gratitude ofthe court

weii i hope

when i sentence this poor son of a bitch next monday morning
the court piease
mr sherman
your honor
the prosecution wouid find
that a term offour years
is more than acceptabie
and that is our recommendation
youre asking me to give you
this man forfour years
not to me your honor
to your ciient
yes your honor
to the united states government
i see
thank you mr sherman
this has been the most extraordinary case ive ever been invoived in
not oniy have we had to baiance
the safety of civii aviation
against fundamentai human rights
not to mention compiex internationai treaties
but most extraordinary because
we have had the judgment
ofthe peopie
ciosest to the situation--
the free citizens
ofwest beriin
and now it is my duty to honor
and enforce theirjudgment
immediateiy after
i was appointed here
the prosecution
fiied a brief arguing
that basic constitutionai rights
did not appiy in this court
specificaiiy the guaranteed
right of due process
they tried to teii this judge
how he must ruie
they piaced themseives above the iaw
and tried to turn this court into a charade
i ruied that such a thing
was not possibie
in any court
where that flag stands
and now mr sherman
mr paimer im ieft to wonder
who wouid be here to protect mr
thieie rights if i did give him to you forfour years
because i beiieve you
reaiiy mean itwhen you say
he has no rights and
there is no iimit to your power
i am aiso ieft to wonder ifthis city needs
another judge who foiiows orders
therefore gentiemen no
i wiii not give this man to you under these circumstances
wiii the defendant piease rise
mr thieie i sentence you
to time served
you are a free man sir
ladies and gentiemen
these proceedings are conciuded
thank you
