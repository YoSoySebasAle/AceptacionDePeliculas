hi harry
morning rick
breakfast
just some cofee thank you
any luck
eh yes and no
kanda is dead he died a few years ago
he didnt have any relativesso
well at least you know it
youve been jumping as scorpion
ever since you got here
what now
-i would like to try something else
good  do you want a safari
maybe but i couldnt afford much one
afford nothing
my pleasure
might not want this rick
may take 4 or 5 months
4 or 5 months
yes im going north to the kalaoyana country
do you wanna die young
will you come along
you wanna try for king solomon mines
yes
i thought itd be something like that
-why
-youre alan son
youre all tied up inside
you spent 3 sweating weeks
trying to track down kanda
by finding him buried ahead
they didnt bring back any diamonds
there no prove for the story
my father wouldnt lie
neither would my mother
youll have half of the diamonds
if we make it
your life should be worth more than
a half of some possible diamonds
me sure i got nothing to lose
and many to gain
youre worst than your father
he pushed his luck and  africa got him
even him
yes i know
but i think he was lucky
he died doing what he wanted
seen everything done everything
his time had come is such simple
he is still buried somewhere out there
its as good a place as any
the last place im gonna be buried is in africa
i dont think you have a choice
is in the cards or is not
im going to find the mines
why
diamondsmoney is the only thing that
counts in our days
do you think so
there no much left
of the world i knew
so im gonna try for something different
if i fail
but if i find them
im gonna contruct my own  world
-youre nice and cinical  arent you
-well arent you
you know youve never been
on safari before
true but i know every end of the way
of my father
every foot of it
second hand knowledge
wont keep you alive
youve ever seen one of this
no
umbopa king of the watusi
who guards the mines
gave it to my father
if we make get into their country
were home free
yeah if
ive never been in or near of that country
no one has  except your father
you know well have maybe
one chance in ten of getting there
let alone getting back
probably one in fifty
the whole idea is crazy
jim-jim
yes bwana
i told you a million times
to keep that thing out of here
-well take it outside
-yes bwana
stinking country
ive tried house snakes to keep the others away
all right so i dont like snakes
well sure i got nothing to lose
except my life
no family nothing sure ill come
i was really hoping youd ask me
why
possibly the diamonds
here youd like to use this
no thank you
ill just use my own rifle
an army rifle
youre married to that
sort of
captain h quatermain
kosb
king own scottish borderers
oh a kilt and all that
yes ive got very pretty knees
i didnt know officer carried rifles
they dont actually
but i found it much more useful
especially with the bayonet
hi glad you could come over
i want to introduce you to
a friend of mine harry
he been around  this country
for years
might be useful to have another
gun along
he is lousy shot
harry quatermein
wilhelm von kintner
if mr cobb had told me
i could have saved you a journey
we dont need another gun sorry
that a lee enfield i see
is it yours
yes
good luck rick and safe journey
thanks for coming over
you know harry we could have used
another gun
maybe but well handle it ourselves
what the matter with you
youre still fighting the war
no four years was quite enough
it is just personal
my mother and sister were drowned
in 96
an uboat got their ship
a lot of people died unnecessarily
that right but in this case
i had to identify their bodies
my sister was still in her mother arms
she was 8
just a childshe had no legs
no legs just stumps
my mother had her child
half a child in her arms
i know he had nothing to do with it
but i just dont want
anyone of them around me that all
jim-jim

ill take the wagon
harry
whats the matter rick

kalaoyana atacked the white god
white god
-is there any mission settlement around here somewhere
-yes  there is
wed better bury them
you didnt find a body of a woman
by any chance  did you

that leaves only one posibility
ill take jim-jim
oh no you dont   jim-jim
yes bwana
if were not back for sundown

-she wasnt as lucky as the others
-what do you mean
kalaoyana like to torture women

come on
well never be able to hold this bridge
or leave trying to make a run forth
there only a vill up ahead
well have to risk it
we can never hold them here
all right but leave the wagon
we dont have too much time
-let just take what we need
all right

i think so
but theyll come back

youre german

where will you take me
never mind no questions just keep going
well have to fire that bridge
fire is a pretty dangerous thing
to play around with in this country
well ill set the rods
well just have to risk it
all right
you think is safe to camp now
yes i think so
what that
the river must have carried
the fire down stream
were lucky the wind is blowing
away from us
were right in their path
quick behind these rocks
come back here
get down  down come back
come back
get down get down
we did keep off the vultures this time just
yes the gods are with us
long way to get through yet
-long  why where are we heading
north
where are you going to leave me off
you cant expect us to turn back now
well leave you off at the end of our safari
it is not usual to find
europeans in this area
youve been here long
many years
even during the war
we saw few europeans
i was lucky you came by
almost a miracle
go easy with the water
this isnt berlin
we may not find drinkable water for days
im sorry i should have known better
yes you should have
what have i done to him by
he should be like this to me
what have i done
maybe he just dislikes germans
it looks like a good place rick
yes
well camp here jim-jim
yes bwana
do you know how far is it to zampari
about half day march  id say
but were lucky i know there
elephants spot about a mile back
youre looking for ivory
no no
but the elephant meat is a delicacy
to the zampari
if we bring them meat they ferry us
across the river
is the only way we can get across
oh i see
does the haupman permit me to bathe
i was a captain
captain  haupman it is all the same
never was to me
nontheless i wouldnt bathe
in the river if i were you
you are afraid i may poison the crocodiles
oh do you consider dirtiness a merit
with us germans
i didnt say that
you did
look erica why dont you
stop picking on him
then tell him to stop
picking on me
i am a human i exist i am here
it is not my fault
and not asked to be rescued
maybe i do not like him as much
as he dislikes germans
i am not ashame of being german
my father told me to be proud
why dont you forget it
youre the only one
that keep bringing it up
i know im sorry
youve been so kind
i will try
it is going to be dificult
because he is such a
dickkopf
how are your feet
few blisters not too bad
good
-rick are you coming
-yeah im coming
you do like him dont you
sure he my friend
-jim-jim
-yes bwana
get some of the boys
and bury the tasks
well pick them up on our way back
were going to get back
do i ever say different
mamba
second hand knowledge eh
say you are a genius
did you have good hunting
yes
you look good
i mean clean  rested
thank you
id use a bath myself
i organized the food i hope is all right
i baked some bread
bread here
all you need is flour and water
it easy to make an oven
out of clay
i smelled something good
do you know why the kalaoyana
atacked your mission
there been much trouble with the change
from a german east africa to a british  protectorade
many of the native tribes
didnt like the war years
it wasnt only the natives
we happened to be germans
whove blamed
sometime innocent people suffer
yes
are you sure there is nowhere
i can be left
you know there isnt
youre quite safe with us
dont worry
but i do
for the first time i have the chance
to live my own life
and do not intend to throw it
way just because you want to go north
you have no alternative  have you
you know my idea of heaven would be
reunite all the mosquitoes in the world
and burn them to death  slowly
real slow
are the flies that make me ill
getting in your hair in your eyes
in your food
hey you better take this
dr quartermain i presume
someone has got to look after you
im fed up with quinine
how about yourself
i already had mine
my idea of heaven would be
a constant hot water
flowing from silver taps
where is always clean
and green
where the rain falls gently
and where you can go out in the sun
without hat on and not be afraid
you know  i left the old country
seeking for a good climate
i figured africa was the place
with the time i found out it was too hot
whatever i was stuck with it
funnywe always wanna be
somewhere we are not
anything would be better than this
you know ive never had a pretty dress
never in my whole life
no silk stockinsive never been to the ballet
or theater
ive never read today paper of today
-im sure youd get bore with it
-no i wouldnt
what your idea of
heaven
this without flies and mosquitoes
youd get bore with that too
what are you looking for north
were going to king solomon mines
you are gone through all of this to find
the will o the wisp
king solomon mines
komisch sehr komisch
it funnyvery funny
do you know how ironic it is
why
a fitting end to everything
a trip off to nothing
maybe it kind of crazy
not if we got there
she a fine girl isnt she
yes
have you been married rick
no and you
no
i cant stand much more of this
neither can i
youre doing fine erica

well make it all right
if the fever doesnt get us
keep going

in the stampede

half day ahead

-hello rick
-no quinine  nothing
if we dont break his fever
i think he will die
how do you know youre a nurse

sometimes  this natives
remedies are good
-it should break his fever tonight
i hope so
jim-jim
it a  watusi it must be
just like harry described it
i cannot undestand him
it bengkala he says his name is
amtagka has come to guide us
he want to see harry
harry why
he told me politely
to mind my own business
he is asking if he will live
yes
he said  he will wait
how could he possibly know
about harry
i dont know strange things
happen in africa
there not much a white man can do
without words passing from drum to drum
do you really believe
solomon mines exist
sure his father got there
and lived to get back
if he dies what will you do
id like to go on
would you come
i would have no alternative
i like have you around erica
thank you
how do you feel

i thought something was wrong
i didnt even take time to dry myself
what did the watusi say
only that he been sent to guide us
that wed be welcomed
will it take long
no  it wont take long
by the way rick told me
how you broke my fever
i wanna thank you
we have quite a time with you
my mother died of the same swamp fever
we didnt know about mimtoyali then
we had just arrived to áfrica
sorry sorry about
your father
he was living on borrowed time
so many years in the
jungle all alone so far away
he knew it would come one day
but he stayed
it was quick when it came
so i think is all right
i didnt think i was going to be as lucky
for that i thank you
were you born in germany
yes  we lived in freiburg
i can just remember the little church
at the edge of the green forest
all the cattle wore bells
and at sundown
we could hear them over the whole valley
its was beautiful
-was your father sent here
no he asked to come
my mother beg him against it
she wasted so quickly
and since i was eight
i was mother to the mission
my mother also died
in africa when i was born
when my father died
my step mother took me to canada
i always remember my step mother
she is dead also
yes she and my sister were drowned
in 96
their ship was torpedoed
by an uboat
oh i see
im sorry
i wanna thank you for saving my life
i would do the same
for anyone
black white german or english
what did he say rick
it a watusi proberb
two virgin and one man
is only good
but two men and one
will destroy all three
he is very wise
we should have caught up with amtagka
hours ago
i hope nothing has happened to him
no he too clever for that
jim-jim
what the matter with those bearers
tabu land  theyre afraid  bwana
tell them we are well armed
there nothing to fear and keep them quite
better not shoot yet
the sound will carry 20 miles
were lucky theyre half blind
and almost deaf
yes  but we better get out
before he sense us
i waited as long as i could
but he wouldnt go away
as long as youre all right
bwana
the boys bwana theyre gone
what
he said he saw the bearer deserting
why dont you stop them
he says the bearer were afraid of going
to the land of the little people the pygmies
why
pygmies are too small to hunt games
with weapons
so they build  traps
from now on itd be like going thrugh a minefield
i will check our suplies come on  jim-jim
ill give you a hand  rick
harryfor god sake stophelp
no harry
let me go
look
harry
oh im so sorry harry
but i thought that you
that the trouble
youre always got the wrong thought
it was just that i
we got a mad woman in our hands rick
ill have to watch out myself
good night
good night
good night
oh  it smells good
breakfast is nearly ready
im so hungry i could eat
an elephant raw
where did you get the eggs
one thing about the army
they teach you to survive
there you are
rick
yes

what the matter
im afraid this one is a bit too ripe
an egg is an egg
im sorry about yesterday
about weeping and all
oh you can use my shoulder
anytime you like
or maybe harry
how about some breakfast
thanks
amtagka says well get to the
desert in a few days
after that watusi country
and the diamonds
how about split it in three ways rick
it all right with me
this is very kind of you  but
youve earned this share
you do not owe me anything
only my life
look out bwana
it broke his neck
yeah that wouldve been mine
is there anything we can do
yes bury him
this damn thing never keeps it edge
how do you keep that thing sharp
melissa
i work out it
melissa
after my sister
harry do you mind if i say something
just as a friend
no go ahead
you know youll never be wholenever be content
while you force it all to remember
i dont have to force it that my trouble
mistakes were made on both sides
during the war
that right but that doesnt help me
you know youd like my people
theyre
theyre what
oh nothing
if we get those diamondsim going back
to the old country
it must be 20 years since i left home
i dont have a home
everyone has to belong somewhere
or somebody
otherwise there no point
erica is all right  isnt she
yes she is
id like to marry her
why dont you ask her
i have no courage
you like her too  dont you
yes  i do
that makes it kind of rough  doesnt it
no it doesnt  i couldnt marry her
nothing gonna stop us noweh harry
-only the guards
-they are on our side
well i hope so
if they are  youll be the richest woman
in the world
i dont know if i want to be that rich
if theyre not  we end up as dust in the wings
of the wind
i like the simplicity
i dont
how beautiful
how wonderful beautiful
my father said it was a paradise
but  i didnt expect it
i wonder what well find down there
you you harry and me
i wonder what well find
whatever were looking for
he asked if we came for
the little white stones
sealed
the only safe way to the diamonds
is sealed forever
i cannot undertand him
he said that the only passage
to the mines
is through the kingdom of fire
the mines are tabu for
his people but
he promises to help us
if we still wish to go
yes  i want to go
itd be funny if after all weve been through
the diamonds werent there
theyll be there it got to be
i have the feeling that it wont be
that easy
before we go  there something
i wanna get settled
you mean erica
yes
umbopa daughter
gave me the dress
the women wear them
you look wonderful erica

youre a wonderful man
youve been so kind to me
you both have
what a meant was
will you marry me
even if we get the diamonds
we have a long way back
it so dificult to think clearly
with so much dangers around

all my life ive been told what to do
it was so easy then

a decision

i tried to tell you many times
but i never seemed to find the right moment
would this have changed  if i had
after now i dont think so

why didnt you tell me this before
maybe i had to prove a point
i was a friend of your father
that right  i thought hed told me everything about you

everything that he considered important
it didnt make any difference to him
he judged a man as a man
he was right he was so very right

this place makes me feel so at home
i can undestand why
it so gentle and peaceful
it not just that it
i think rick is right im all mixed up by
there only one way
to live for today
today must be the world
eternity and everything
well  youre coming
i think we are both staying
ive heard it all
youre both crazy
erica youre going to stay
if youll ask me
it because today i suddenly believe
that i love you
today i believe ive loved you for many days
only today is important
well  arent you gonna ask her to stay
will you
good luck to both of you
im proud to have you as a friend  rick

take this with you
bury it somewhere in the desert
ill bury it deep
id have been a lousy husband anyway
you know the drums carry a long distance
i hope one day theyll tell me you have a fine son
