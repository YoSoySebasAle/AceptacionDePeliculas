again
and they were going to break
into a building so they all
rented a helicopter
to land on the roof of the
building and they all said they
would split up that
way they could cover the house
easier so the first jack
decided he was going to the basement
he is the one trying the fancy
wines than the wine cellar
and then the next jack said he
was going to take the first
floor so he could get
the tv and the vcr and stuffs
like that and the 3rd jack said
he was going to take the
upstairs bedroom cause that
where all the jewelry is and
the last jack said
am going to stand on the roof
and make sure the cops dont
come and catch us
can you just relax cant waith
to get away from all these
people
ooh my god i cant wait
so sure enough the cops came
along so they all came up to the
roof so
that all of the jacks get away
from the cops and pull off the
perfect crime laughter

for them but
we could be side driven instead
of front driven
