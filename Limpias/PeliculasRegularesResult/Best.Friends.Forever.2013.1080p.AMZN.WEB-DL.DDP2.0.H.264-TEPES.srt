ian so have you ever thought
that maybe you do the same thing
with your life

you just sort of say fuck it
and move on
it all arbitrary
harriet
reba

besides im not the one with
the problem knowing what i want

i know it old-fashioned and
doesnt make sense but im
supposed to be a librarian
im supposed to have a life
surrounded by books
i just know it
but why
i dont know
they have power and once you
have that power or that
knowledge no one can take that
away from you
there no signal here
i told my mom id call her when
we got halfway
and on this historic day
many in the united states are
asking what caused this
extreme act of terrorism
the president emphasized the
need for calm and assured
it still too early to
estimate casualties but it
could easily total in the
millions in the
immediate aftermath and untold
more in the ensuing weeks from
radiation exposure
air terrible here
could be wildfire season
do they have that here
the sky looks a little crazy
im just gonna go look for
a phone
ill be right back
no phone anywhere but i found
something better
hi
i made friends
what this

the female characters in these
things have to dress in such
skimpy outfits to beat up bad
guys

male-centric view you know

to death
youre not gonna burn my
books
it hard to find
a problem
that i cant dissolve
and the devil in the details
well he stepping back
this is ridiculous
it freezing out here
this is by far the darkest dark
ive ever seen and were
probably gonna freeze to death
or get bitten by a snake or
a coyote or whatever the hell
else is out here
hey
things could still turn around
jesus
what are you talking about
that crazy
that not crazy actually

crappy rest stop if you werent
leaving me
what are you talking about
im not leaving you im just
moving on with my life
you didnt even talk to me
about it
yeah i dont have to consult
you
that part of making adult
decisions which you know nothing
about
what
my god
of course we end up here in the
middle of nowhere because im
with you and you dont
you dont think about the
consequences
you just do shit
because thinking has gotten
you so far
youre just jealous
of what
what lame grad school
fucking texas
no that im im moving on
with my life that im actually
doing something with myself
is that what the armchair
shits told you in the crazy
place
yeah as a matter of fact
they did
i dont even know who you are
anymore like with your
stupid post-it notes and your
blind denial and all that weird
psychoanalyzation
you are not moving on
youre just moving
you are not growing up
all youre doing is turning
your back on what you already
have
fuck this

she totally serious
you girls think this is
a time for jokes

for reckoning
that what this is
why
harriet
isaiah
the earth is polluted because
of its inhabitants who have
transgressed laws violated
statues broken the ancient
covenant
therefore a curse devours
the earth
he knew it
forest knew it
and he was righteous
i never doubted him
never
not once
why are
just nod your head
secrets
going after the bases if you
ask me
koreans
north koreans
theyre the only ones who can
do it
hey asshole
im chinese

somewhere

sneaky shit on me

country this time

of shit
we are gonna nuke your yellow
asses back into judgment day
for what youve done

aah
therefore a curse consumes
the earth
its people must bear the guilt
fuck you
you dickless sack of shit
were gonna bury you
at the entrance to every
forest knew it
he saw it coming and you will
pay for your sins
all of you from the west they
praise the lord his majesty
terror and traps
where is everyone
im gonna go out on a limb and
say that this is the worst road
trip ever
yeah
yeah
it terrible actually

waste of time

my god
im so punk rock
go back to the chip pile
my god
i should really clean that up
there youre a doctor but
youre a failure cause youre
drunk like your father
now you go back to the candy
cause that is where you turn
the light on
where you turn the light on
die
youre drunk
and then you join all your
friends in the afterlife because
you were alive on the chip pile
the whole time and time is
irrelevant
and that the plot of loss
do you ever wonder why
everyone on tv looks so good
when everything going to shit
like
milla jovovich
she looked hot
hold on dear
like a barnacle on the ship
of fear
im out here
like an island on a sea
of tears
hah
kick
i should probably wear shorts
what was that
i dont know
ill go this way
you go around the other side
wait harriet
i dont know sean
i dont see nothing

is there someone here
what wrong
okay basically there are no
working phones in the southwest
come on
i dont really like it out here
let just go inside okay
okay
let go
let just say for a second that
there is a god
why would he hate fags
i mean why would he hate
anyone
i thought that was the point
of having a devil
i just dont get it
did i ever tell you about that
friend of mine when i was
little what was her name
lisa something or other
she was super-religious
i didnt realize it at the time
but her parents used to take me
to sunday school and mass every
sunday when we were playing and
years later i get this christmas
card and i swear to god the
only three words they used in
the entire card were jesus
savior and amen
how do you make a sentence
with those three words
how do you send a card to
somebody
come with me to austin
what
i am
no
stay with me
in austin to live
yeah right
harriet
look it safer there and
youve always said you wanted to
get out of la
you know austin could be
a fresh start
i dont know harriet
okay
i bet austin has a great art
scene and it smaller so it
would be easier to break your
way into
and you always say that
youve slept with everyone in
los angeles so itd be a whole
new population
that was a joke
los angeles
is a wasteland
there nothing there anymore
it not fair to say that
there nothing there
no reba what im trying
to tell you is that
shh
what
it them
who
the hipsters
get down
we have to hide
where
were in the middle of the road
wait i have an idea
man this chick has a ton
of books
books are no longer useful
except as fire fuel
that ridiculous
yeah it really is man
god
i think that i have the runs
again
just cause there a nuclear
war doesnt mean we cant read
and we wont
i mean what the point
im sorry
what the point of reading
i dont know man
how about education or
entertainment or just trying
to expand your world view
a little bit
how about that
youre never gonna make it
what if mexico just as
fucked
as long as they didnt
detonate nuclear weapons against
their own people
you dont know that what
happened
it so obvious
what about al-qaeda
what about
al-qaeda
what kind of fucking moron are
you
okay
what terrorist organization
could detonate four bombs within
the us at the exact same time
moron
what government could do that
without us finding out about it
right away with four cities that
happen to have key military
bases right by
just shut up all right
you sound like a crazy person
right man
i dont know
hey
shut him up
stop it
aah
what was that
i dont know
he been a fucking baby
ever since i tased him

and im not feeling great
myself

books teach you how to do this
stuff
i got us this far didnt i
ill get us out

good for you

sorry
i know the bombs are making
things weird and im still
trying to figure out what to do

i feel like you might be the
person who could hear it so
here goes
um
you know if i was being honest
with myself i dont have a lot
going right now
i mean im not a loser but
im sort of just nothing
sort of a walking example
of unfulfilled potential
so anyway i applied to grad
school and didnt get in
but regardless im im
going and it the first time
in my life that
i havent just fallen into
whatever easiest
and for better or for worse
im dragging my friend along
with me and and that may not
mean anything to you but it
means the world to me and
that car right there that my
stuff
and
could i just have it back
please
i always wanted to do
something like that
i think that staying motivated
is more important than ever now
and and i guess things
kind of gotten out of hand
yeah and you know it no
big deal
you know i always like to say
that youre exactly where
gotcha

abused or mistreated or
misused

to go but up for you
if youve been hurt or youve
been betrayed or youve been
fucked or youve been
displaced
you were told it was probably
your fault anyway
but when your hustler
subscription and your xanax
prescriptions
make you feel lonelier
instead
you dont want to hear about
all those starving children
you dont want to be told it
all in your head
cause if it all in your
head
that terrible

puddle of his own blood last

no you can never fall too
far
you can buy a salad glove
you can buy an ipod
and you can sell that shit to
bookman when your wife dies
and you lose your job
you can hope it gets better
you can follow your dreams
but hope is for presidents and
dreams are for people who are
sleeping
