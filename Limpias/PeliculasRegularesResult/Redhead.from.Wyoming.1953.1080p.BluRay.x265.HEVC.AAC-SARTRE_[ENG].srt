
when the territories of
the great west were thrown open
men of all kinds rushed in
most came to settle peaceably
lured by free land
gold cattle
a man could begin a herd
with a maverick
an unbranded stray on the public range
by putting his brand on it
he owned it
cattle barons had started
their great herds with mavericks
now they fought each settler
who tried to do the same
they fought to keep the settlers
off the public lands
drive them from their homes
destroy their towns
vast ranges became the
battlegrounds of cattle wars
when the wyoming big ranchers
found guns were not enough
they used the maverick law
a law through which they appointed
themselves commissioners
with power to rule on the ownership
of every maverick branded
a commissioner ruling could
declare the settler a rustler
outlaw his brand
make his mavericks illegal to sell
of course there was no shortage
of sharp-witted men
who were quick
to take advantage of this law
i know what im entitled to
im willing to fight for my rights
and im willing to fight for your rights
but youve got to stand behind me
youve got to put me
in the governor mansion
youve got to have someone to
represent you not just reece duncan
go ahead mr averell
dont let me stop you
what brings you to town
your ears burning
what is this maverick law
the maverick law was designed to
protect us all against cattle rustling
there is nothing in that law
that says new settlers
cant pick up unbranded cattle
and call them their own
when a cattle commission was appointed
to watch over brands and cattle
that was for our protection too
id like to ask mr duncan one question
id like to ask him
who paid bribe money
to the cattle commissioners
to outlaw your brands
to see to it that every time you roped
a maverick it was confiscated
just hold it still everybody
real quiet and still
put the gun away
i only aimed to drill his hat sheriff
just let out some hot air
keep it there
i think mr duncan would like
a crack at the governorship himself
do you reckon wyoming
will ever have a governor
wholl take a shot at a man
who doesnt wear a gun
no or anyone who carries it
under cover either
this is a big deal sheriff you ought to step out of it
everybody oughta
im warning you men this range is taken
there no room for squatters
you started from scratch yourself duncan
that was a long time past
for you but were just beginnin
and we aim to start with mavericks
and we aim to stay
youll stay just so long
as you stay within the law
which means that if i find any one of you
rounding up and branding cattle on my range
i have the right
to fill you full of lead
easy boys easy
a couple of you boys
have asked me if i had any ideas
well gentlemen
here one of my
biggest ideas right now
hello kate how are you
same as always jim
measurements and memory
keep the measurements forget
the memory im gonna make it up to you
folks the newest and latest
scintillating gem to greet our fair town
is there anyone here so young who doesnt
recognize the name of kate maxwell
hello boys
pleased to meet you
boys i never was any good at keeping
secrets from you but i sure kept this one
that place of mine
ive been fixing up
well it belongs to kate
from here on in
therell be music high-kick dancing
and the straightest card game in wyoming
and youll have money for it too
kate a cattle buyer now
she aims to buy up every maverick
you can lay a rope on so bring em on in
kate got her own brand
and not an outlaw brand
shell market your mavericks for you
and there nothing
that duncan and his
cattlemen association can do about it
what are you up to this time jim
i told you i was gonna make you rich
i dont suppose ive got to ask
my lawyer if this is legal
it legal mr duncan
ive looked into it
miss maxwell youve looked into it too
it liable to get you in some hot water
why i soak in hot water
every day mister
it good for the complexion
im glad youre used to it
just in case any of those mavericks
you take in trade come from my range
im just warning you
no animal on my property
branded or not is a stray
whatever you pick up
on the open range is yours
anything you take from me
has lead coming after it
suppose you and me
have a little talk mr averell
waitll you find out
what this is all about
all right boys take the coach
and the wagon over to kate place
boys make room for the lady
oh kate this is stan blaine
sweetwater strong arm of the law
pleased to meet you sheriff
why dont you show me the town
some night before you show me the jail
you talk like you dress
but you dont feel that way
play along with him
play
he just a drifter doesnt make
any trouble doesnt want any
the job was open so he took it
drifter
now i am a man with a purpose
thank you
mind if i give you a hand miss
why id be pleasured
ill carry you
this one a lady
why thanks
take a look kate it all yours
not bad in fact pretty good
so why are you giving it away
well honey ive got a sense of obligation
i owe you something
oh the world must be coming to an end
not only is jim averell
giving things away
but he paying his debts
listen kate a lot of things
have changed since i last saw you
since i last saw you
running out of abilene like a jackrabbit
leaving me holding the sack
did anybody get rough with you
why will you go back there
and gun them down
sorry jim there no money in it
just a poor underpaid judge
i guess somebody oughta give me
a necktie party for what ive done to you
maybe somebody will
but you came when i called you
you didnt waste any time
birds of a feather
but that doesnt mean ill ever feel
the same way about you
you will honey you will
believe me that last sour deal
is way behind me
im going up up and up right into
the governor mansion
to ask a pardon
to be the governor
im going to make the whole territory
of wyoming my own private range
think i cant do it these settlers
would vote me into the white house
im the only one around here
wholl promise them anything
and what in your way
reece duncan
i got a big front but he is big
sounds crazy but it true if duncan goes
i can be governor of wyoming
you will of course
drop in sometime for a drink
and youll be with me
that what im trying to tell you kate
im going to make up to you
for everything
what this other thing about
why am i a cattle buyer
you dont have to know anything
about cattle dont let that scare you
i know plenty
i was riding a cow pony before i could walk
what the deal
duncan again but you dont have to know the details
you just buy mavericks and sell em
look
here your brand registered and legal
kate maxwell
k-bar-m
honey it wont be long before people
are calling you cattle kate
these three for you tex
good let go
whatll it be tex chips or cash
chips watch me double em
that duncan brand wally
let it go
here a maverick for you wally
it a clean one
for value received one maverick
whatll it be
chips
horses comin matt
it duncan ill head him off
what the matter with you that a rustler
matt jessup
im missing branded steers
the jessup boys are taking mavericks
these werent mavericks
they carried the bar-double-check
i dont say you didnt lose em
thereve been reports of strange faces
sheriff there gonna be
a range war here
i suggest you make up
your mind whose side youre on
i have im on the side
of the first man who gets killed
i could knock him off right now
why wait naw
save us weeks of work and put that
loud-talking duncan where averell wants him
i said no
why not
cause averell said
to let him burn a while
i told him to come after midnight
after midnight he better
he does what you say this afternoon
he couldve finished duncan off easy
but he let him go because
that what you wanted
i dont get it boss
abilene taught me something
to wait
we set one side against the other
prod em a little;
first duncan then the settlers
and wait till they kill each other off
that the way to get
things done for you
in fact that the way
into the governor chair
how will that help you
to become governor
look when times are rough a man can
make himself a reputation overnight
thatll spread through
the whole territory like wildfire
that if he on the popular side
and right now ive got these settlers
eating out of my hand
the way you got it figured
there wont be any settlers left
now thatd be too bad
in that case id have to take
the consolation prize
and all the cattle and
all the land in this valley
i might become one of the richest most
important men in the territory of wyoming
there more than one way
to become governor
does kate know how youre running the cattle set-up
no
and nobodyll know if you and the boys
keep your mouths shut and do as i tell ya
understand
yeah boss
if i dont stand on 9
my mind aint on the cards
friend of yours kate
take over ive got to talk to a customer
go ahead
with jim i can at least
keep my eyes on the cards
good evening sheriff drifting
mmm got a nice clean shave there
i bet it was for me
youre keeping the boys busy
roping by day and gambling at night
this is a free country
they work hard for their money
and they got a right to spend it
the way they want to
none of my business
just wonderin where some of em
find time to do any rustling
duncan on the warpath
somebody taking his branded stock
oh he just talkin
he got to say that to stir up trouble
no there rustling going on
got it from the other ranchers
the cows i buy are clean
unbranded mavericks
you ever see a range war
there isnt going to be a range war here
a few rustled cattle--
a few rustled cattle started
the bloodiest killings in texas
i was there
oh so that where you hail from texas
mm-hmm
what brought you here
passin through
oh drifting
you dont like that
a man knows where he going
take a look at jim averell
there a real man
i heard him say so
kate youve got a couple more mavericks
in your corral than you had
thanks hal
let have a look
is anything wrong with it
no
dont you ever forget that badge youre wearing
no
feelin lucky hal
no id like it in cash im saving
for any particular reason
howd you know
he means it kate
aw honey they all mean it
here one free drink
on the house and then get out
i need the space for the free spenders
since youre on duty tonight sheriff
how bout coming out back
and letting me show you my stuff
it a nice moon out tonight
bright enough to read a brand
well there they are
any of them look stolen
nice lookin stock
and mavericks every one
lots of em too
is that suspicious doing business on a big scale
no
every one of those cows
were taken off the free range
you dont have to spit fire at me
my word good enough for everybody
else it ought to be good enough for you
it is
then dont come with rumours of rustling and range wars
im a businesswoman giving the homesteaders
their first look at cash in two years
i dont want trouble
there trouble in the range youll be in it along with us
not if im playing straight
and minding my own business
my pa minded his own business
we had a small spread
down near houston
when the trouble came
he said hed stay out of it
the range war you were talking about
i was up in the barn
when the shootin started
by the time i got down and ran for my rifle
pa was hanging on the corral fence
ma was dead lying in the front yard
they killed my three brothers
who killed them
folks neighbours
people who just got so mad
they started killin
how old were you then
thirteen
thirteen your whole family
is that when you started drifting
drifting not so bad
a man sees a lot of country
not anything he can call his own
why own something if you dont need it
what about marriage
have you ever thought
about getting married
some you
kate need you inside
well talk some more later huh
someone coming put that away
well take care of him
it the sheriff go get averell
you were told not to show up
before midnight
in this business you show up when
youve got the goods
how much did he see
there no tellin
get rid of him
for good
leave him alone
ever since that abilene business
every time you get called out of a room
i get an urge to follow you
now what this about
nothing honey
this drifter was interfering
in something private
as a drifter or as the sheriff
and what jail did you boys break out of
do we take him or not
you leave him alone
that what youll do
and i hope youre thinking up a good story
jim because im getting awfully mad
dont
youll only come apologizing later
he nobody to be skittish about
dump him where hell have
a long walk back
how do i know they wont kill him
i wouldnt trust them
as far as i could throw a steer
they do exactly as i tell them
get to it men
you like him
no there no money
in that kind of maverick
all right who are those men
it seems they were running
some cattle into your corral
whose cattle
yours
anyway your brand
there werent that many here
a few minutes ago
that what im trying to tell you kate
look at this
here reece duncan brand
bar-double-check
now watch this is clever
k-bar-m
katie somebody apt
to call you a cattle rustler
why you dirty low-down-
it takes money to run for office
youll never be governor
youll be crow bait on the end of a rope
im no rustler but you are
this is your brand
registered in your name
i dont share the business with you
i gave it to you
youre the one who been buying and selling
cattle how do you get out of that
wait till i tell stan about this
and duncan
what if they dont believe you
pretty big risk isnt it
jim what are you up to
this isnt a big enough
operation for you
ive told you were going to
the governor mansion
it going to take time
and a lot of money
and meanwhile
youll keep your pretty mouth shut
when im playing for high stakes
i get awfully upset if anyone talks
hi sheriff
maybe you can teach
knuckles how to ride i give up
come on you stumblebum
where kate
went riding
come on knuckles youre not going
to throw in the towel are you
ill get a decision over you yet
hold on tight knuckles
come on ya bum
hi everybody
you look like you came off second best
third
bet you brought him in though whoever he was
no he still kinda loose
but you will
i aim to
you had a lot of stock in here last night some
how many head when we looked at them
why
how many head this morning
before you got them out in such a hurry
putting together that question
and that tin badge
it looks like im accused
of being a rustler
two minutes after you left last night
some cattle came headin for the corral
driven by my boys of course
too dark to see that
but you did see them put cattle into my corral
no i got busy
so youve taken such a personal dislike to me
that without seeing anything
without any proof
youre willing to believe that im a rustler
i havent taken a dislike to ya
sheriff i go by actions
not by words
and what i feel when you talk to me-
why i just feel as homely as a mud fence
homely youre the most-
women
what did he say
i gave him a line he wont be any trouble
that why he has that job
that why i gave it to him
i took one look at him when he first
came into town and i said to myself
that the kind of sheriff
i need a drifter
ive got to hand it to you
this time youre playing it smart jim
it nice to hear you say so
except i know youd like
to see me break my neck
that would be nice
oh katie youre just ungrateful
makes me very unhappy
i dont like the way you operate
you dont think of anyone but yourself
what about the homesteaders
in this thing
how long will it be before duncan
starts taking it out on them
what makes you think hed do a thing like that
youre hoping he will
why kate
you want trouble you want a range war
you want so much killing that theyd
have to send troops in to keep the peace
what an imagination
duncan killed arrested
or any way out of the running
and the homesteaders just about wiped
out and ready to listen to anybody
and who steps up to lead them
jim averell the poor man hope
it a good phrase
i dont want any part of this
im getting out of here
you cant kate
how far could you get
it wont take duncan long
to trace his cattle to your corral
and the sheriff to wire ahead
they dont just arrest you
for cattle rustling
jim
this act youre putting on about
not being interested in the sheriff
now youre imagining things
i hope so
im jealous honey
cant get angry with me for that
sure i want to be up there where
i know i belong but i want you with me
im doing all of this for you katie
ill prove that to you yet
but these things need time
yes that what we need time
get some of the boys
and fix that north line fence
we gotta keep the herds closer in
jiminy look what coming
good morning mr duncan
what brings you out in broad daylight
i wouldnt mind sitting
in the shade for a while
id like to be polite but
i have a lot of work to do
my business wont take long
not much here to interest a woman
it a man place
oh that would interest a woman
well it hasnt
no wife no womenfolk
id have thought otherwise
i live alone
maybe that why youre so successful
everything goes into one big ambition
so far
miss maxwell you said you had
something to talk to me about
i have you
i think youre making a big mistake
no it your settler friends who are making
the mistake with your encouragement
oh now mr duncan youre a fair man
why dont you admit you started the
whole trouble by blacklisting their brands
if you came here thinking that by
being sweet to me and nice to look at
i would become a more reasonable man-
you are a reasonable man
youve just never been
approached in the right way
miss maxwell
i came to this territory as a boy
a ragged trail hand
without a penny in my pocket
and my boots open at the toes
in 0 years i owned or controlled most of this
valley if you think im going to sit back now-
dont holler at me mr duncan
if i made the mistake of thinking that
you knew how to play for big stakes
i apologize
i was wrong
what do you mean
i said i was wrong
i thought you wanted to control
more than just this valley
why dont you read the cards
mr duncan
before long the settlers
will outnumber the cattlemen
it has to be that way
there nothing that can stop it
cooperate give them a chance
to earn an honest living
and youll be the most popular man
in the whole territory
theyll put you in
the governor mansion
not jim averell
what happened miss maxwell
you have an argument with him
let just say that i want
to be on the winning side
suppose this turns out
to be the winning side
what in it for you
the winning side will be the one i tell
the settlers to throw their weight to
and i think ill let you
fix the reward
you sound like
a natural-born politician
it all in knowing how to deal
mr duncan
mr duncan
we caught the jessup brothers
running off with some of our stock
we got em holed up the other side
of town in pitchfork canyon
you expect me to throw in
with a bunch of outlaws
ill give you an example
of how a man gets rich
see that section there
if i buy that up ill control six others
around it because of the water on it
it all in knowing how
you hear shooting
yeah it over near duncan place
let go
im out of shells matt
looks like were gonna lose this one
blast em outta there
hold your fire
better get down you dont want
one of your own friends to shoot you
drop it
i said drop it
youd better learn to take orders
once in a while mr duncan
now start moving
stop firin men
i keep underratin you miss maxwell
ive got to stop that
hal matt
come out reaching
looks interesting
keep me covered
what the story
they was rustling our cattle
a lie we found mavericks
theyre not mavericks when theyre on my land
we didnt set foot on your land
he was comin from that way
were those mavericks part of
duncan stock or werent they
where your proof
i dont need proof
them jaspers were comin from our herd
and i know rustling when i see it
all you know is gunfighting but if that
what you want you can have it now
but youll have a dead boss
simmer down wade
what do you want miss maxwell
have you still got your horses
all right get on em and hightail it
dont move anyone
what this all about
why it mr averell
glad to see you mr averell
miss maxwell and i were talking
about you just a while ago
that nice what did you say
miss maxwell did most of the talkin;
but i can see she didnt mean a word
saying she might tell the settlers
to throw in with me against you
you birds stick together all the way
ill send this back to him
you wont want to be seeing him again
evenin boys myra
were short-handed
what am i a marriage bureau
every time i get a dancer trained
i lose her
youre sure going to lose this one
you know what youre doing myra
i want to see a preacher in this hal
or im gonna get after you with a44
were gettin married as soon as
i get more maverick money
see that you hide it from him
when he celebrates
been here long
settin
can i set with you
set
what do you think
nice team
is there going to be trouble hereabouts
mm-hmm
killing
cant tell
there something queer going on
got another report of
strange faces in the hills
got another complaint from
duncan about losing cows
whatd you see him about today
i was trying to make peace
how
i wanted him to look at this whole thing sensibly
he thinks he being sensible right now
i thought maybe a woman approach-
a woman approach
a gun in the back
so you know the whole story
i know you didnt do peace any good today
what did you expect me to do let him
shoot down the jessup boys or hang them
listen jim averell brought you
out here and set you up in business
everything you do is tied in with him duncan hates averell
no youve-
when you held that gun in his back
it was being held by jim averell
who lying to the settlers
cattlemen and
for all i know lying to you
that what i want to talk to you about
those men are building for a fight
and it wont take but one wrong move
to touch it off set the range on fire
will you listen to me
im not jim averell woman
i choose my own man whoever he is
or whatever he is kingpin or drifter
it a little early to tell anything yet
he a bit low
any news
we lost him in the dark
spent the whole night combing the hills
it a waste of time
i know where to go for the bushwhacker
duncan or one of his boys shot my brother
now it my turn
and then it duncan turn
and whose turn after that
it the way feuds get started
and there no telling where it will end
i believe in law and order myself sheriff
but there also a thing called justice
and im dealing some out
the law didnt appoint you to do that
matt dont make me put you in jail
stan youre holding with duncan
the boys aint gonna like it
you just sit down and cool off
dont try to jump a gun it never works
matt can always get another gun and
duncan always gives us another reason
there a war ahead sheriff
you figure to stop it all by yourself
not if some folks want it
i say wipe out duncan and his whole outfit
it the only thing that makes sense
you talk too much
it seems to me that all men
want to do is fight
even when they talk about peace
like you
it with a gun in their hands
it high time women took a hand
in running this world
duncan and his men run
the cattle association
the homesteaders are mad
because he keeps them out in the cold
very well
let form an association of our own
sure
our own outfit to do business for us
that for being the brainiest woman
ive ever met
boys kate just had a great idea
it the answer to everything well form
our own stockmen corporation
well register our brands with it
find buyers wholl deal with us
if the courts try to stop us well have
an organization to fight back with
jim please youre not a cattle raiser
this has nothing to do with you
of course this will all take money
and itll need leadership
im going to advance you the money
i want all you people
in this territory to know
that jim averell is with you
all the way
get the boys together
better pick your side sheriff
smartest girl i ever knew
you make good partners
you and averell
what one thinks of
is good for the other
i didnt want him to be part of this
he took it out of my hands
played right into duncan
this is what we needed for a long time
kramer you and tiny peterson
start bringing em in from the north range
oconners stubbs
handle the west range
andrews elliot lamont-
hey matt you wouldnt want the men
to ride out in the sun
without something to line their throats
would you
where averell
i dont know he left ahead of us
kinda slow for a man
so anxious to help
all right men
we got plenty of work ahead
got it
couldnt you wait
sure
but not the boys
they like to be paid as they go along
it seems to me you go to an awful lot
of trouble just to start a shootin war
we could do the same thing by nightfall
by riding out and throwing a little lead
mm-hmm that why it a good idea
for you to do exactly as i say
no more no less
good coffee
makes the best coffee in the whole dang world
learned it from kate
there someone who can cook
tell him some more
i need all the recommendations i can get
here comes averell with the tally book
where have you been
weve been waiting for the tally book
the horse threw his shoe
we had to stop at the blacksmith
what the matter sheriff
dont you believe me
just looking at the white stuff
what about it
you come by way of salt lick canyon
long way around wasnt it
i said what about it
nothing about it relax
here comes the first bunch
duncan showed up yet
hell be here
sandy you just standin around
i need an extra man to look for strays
i work for jim averell
youll work in this camp
or you dont eat
there no grub to spare for gunslingers
ill help you matt
i said a man to look for strays
oh i was cuttin cattle
long before i cut cards
get me a horse something alive
tom
thank you
i wouldnt get on that critter kate
it aint safe
kate
bet shed be real handy on a homestead
round-up could be finished before duncan shows up
not likely
trouble is i hold with the settlers
instead of him
makes it pretty hard being sheriff
itll get harder all the time
duncan not the kind who gives up
maybe i am
i didnt figure on this kind of thing
when i took this job
i didnt figure on being duncan man
running around arresting homesteaders
seems to me the best thing i can do
is turn in my badge and move on
where would you go
yonder
yonder always yonder
that no life for a man
havent you ever thought about
sending down roots
staying in one place for a while
reckon so
when i find what i want
what do you want
when duncan hears how many
mavericks we rounded up
he gonna get a real bellyache
bar-vranch one calf
duncan comin up loma pass
get your girls into that tent
and get in with em stay under cover
but i want to be out here
get into the tent
off your horses boys and into place
you know what to do
get every horse outta camp
if there any trouble
theyll only be in the way
step lively everybody
he on the other side of the hill
wade hold the men up here
i dont know how far you thought
youd go with this fool idea averell
but it comes to an end right now
where that sheriff
here a complaint
signed by judge crawford
to the effect that these men
are defying the maverick law
serve it
seems all regular and in order
well sheriff i just happen to have
a federal injunction
enjoining these men from interfering
with this round-up
in any manner shape or form
will you serve it please
looks like a stand-off
that jim averell
did anybody ever outsmart him
if duncan doesnt win by brains
hell win another way
here it comes keep back
that a pretty clever trick
mr averell
im surprised at myself
not figurinon that
ive had it in my pocket
for a couple of days
just waiting for you to show up
cancelling out my court order doesnt
cancel out my rights as a rancher
you dont know of any way
to stop me from stayin here
and keeping an eye peeled for my own stock
i wouldnt wanna stop ya
get a little nervous though
lookin at all that artillery
that why we brought it here
you wont need it here
pick em up
duncan tell your boys
to drop their guns off over in kate wagon
ive got an idea they wouldnt do that
im tellin ya they will
never had so many deputies before
look over there
ive got more but you cant see em
gentlemen peace is declared
what about them
all right everybody over at kate wagon
and drop off your hardware
you deputies too
all right men
drop your guns in the wagon
hey duncan
cut out a bunch of your cows a while ago
you want the calves branded
ill take that as a favour
where its mother
got separated somehow
how do you know this one doesnt belong to me
we dont
half for you and half for us
can you think of anything better
that fair enough
acts just like you when you wont listen to reason
oh
if youd settle down
and talk things over
you might find there room enough here for all of us
could be
youre the prettiest little maverick
i ever did see
how bout lettin me
put my brand on ya
thanks im wearing one already
you gotta get used to sudden changes
hey
get outta here
stop it stop it
what the idea
stampede stampede
mount up and head em off
whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa
whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
duncan
get your men together and clear out
weve had enough trouble here
nobody talks to me like that
that a federal court order
talking to you like that
you better go
call the men in
tell them ive gone back to the ranch
can you finish this round-up in one more day
there a chance
well then get movin
well there the last one
round-up over
how the round-up
it over your men standing by
yeah when do we move
averell will give us the word
hi maverick
how goes it with law and order
not much change
there never is any change with you
dont you ever sing or dance
or feel like kickin up your heels
come on dance with me
i wish i knew what to think about you
if i ride off itll be too late
still talking about going away
about ready to turn in
my badge and saddle up
what holding you back
nothin i reckon
i hope it turns out
to be as green as you think-
the grass on the other side of the fence
hold still everybody
just stay like that and
there wont be any trouble
im takin you to
the marshal at rawlins
what for
for rustling cattle
and murdering my foreman wade burrows
that ridiculous
what are you trying to start here
keep out of this averell
im in this all the way
and you better have plenty of evidence
there enough evidence
to hang her six times over
come out to the corral
found him out on the range
near my north section
stretched out near a brandinfire
with two holes in his back
they never gave him a chance
wade burrows was a troublemaker
it just caught up with him
what the connection with kate
ill show you right now
every time i complained to you
about losin branded cattle
youd talk about strange faces in the hills
and rustlers nobody ever sees
ill show ya some rustlers
that my brand the bar-double-check
when we picked up wade
there was a brandiniron under him
i reckon the killers forgot that
here the iron
and here what it does
kbar-m
im takin you in on suspicion
of rustlin and murder
the sheriff office is still filled duncan
dont try to do my job
this woman is goin to jail
but ill do the takin
i trust you duncan but you got
a vigilante look in your eye
hed put a rope around her neck
as soon as they got out of sight
dont worry honey
ill get you the best
legal representation in
the territory of wyoming
by the time these charges are heard
mr duncanll have to eat a lot of words
am i right boys
you bet
your deputies must be tired
after the round-up
so i know youll be glad
if i post some of my men at the jail
to see she doesnt get away
therell be more in jail when i found out
which of ya have been takin orders from her
you havent said a word
for the last 5 minutes
you used to find it easy to talk
why not now
talking to you never helped me before
what the truth kate
is averell playin you
or are you both playin me
things were bad enough in this town
before you came theyre twice as bad now
you think im a murderer and a rustler
i dont know what to think
what between you and averell
too much
keep your eyes peeled for trouble
want these gents barbecued
or slow-fried
dont get the idea
youre deputies boys
anything happens to her
youll pay for it
you might as well catch 40 winks
tomorrow could be a big day
ill stay here
you cant help her she locked up
ill stay here
kinda wondered why he wasnt around
i wouldnt put it past reece duncan
to kill one of his own men
and pin it on us
what his second move will be
i can only guess
l-im too busy thinking about kate
sitting over in that jail
seems to me we got nothing to go
on but her own word that she innocent
we brought in 300 unbranded mavericks
how did it work
fine she was so surprised
she couldnt say a word
go back and tell em to get set
youll see the signal as soon
as it light enough to see smoke
there isnt much hay over there
youd better drag over another bale
go on
i say kate had nothin to do with it
she innocent as a newborn babe
all right if nobodyll back me up
to bust her outta that jail
ill do it myself
i dont think youll have time
boys i just got some pretty bad news
sandy tells me duncan calling in
every man he got
he getting set for a fight
and hell find a good reason to start one
im going out there
and try and talk him out of it
i never heard of duncan bein talked out of anything
maybe so
at least itll give you men a chance
to get organized for a battle
see that nothin happens to her
as miserable a collection of faces
as ever i seen off a reward poster
what kind of records did you gents have
before you went to work for duncan
smart aleck dont pay him no heed
all right men come and get it
that real cordial but kinda sudden
see who outside
how do you like that
they got suspicions
ive got a good mind
to spill this stuff on the floor
quiet outside but im kinda dry inside
gimme some of that
just a minute
i kinda changed my mind about you fellas
gimme some of that beer sonny
sonny
im gonna like this
nice work knuckles pick him up
you got me covered
hey aint this somethin ajailbreak
were bustin ya outta here
who organized it
we did the sheriff outta town
jim ridin up to duncan ranch
jim found out duncan gettin ready
for a fight he gonna try and stop him
dont you believe it
in ya go
he doesnt want to stop a war
he wants to start one
boys i think it about time
you knew the truth
ive been covering up
for jim averell in one of
the slickest rustling schemes
wyoming ever saw
and the idea back of the whole thing
is to start you
and the big cattle raisers
to killing each other off
i told you she mightnt be innocent
you didnt finish
were still listenin
jim got a bunch of gunslingers
up in the hills
and one of them or sandy killed wade
burrows to pin the whole thing on me
and start this big range war
that he wants
he sure did pin it on ya how many times
that brandin iron been used
i dont know but the important thing is
he wants to start a range war
boys i know jim averell and you dont
he wants to be governor
he doesnt care how many people he
walks over to get to the governor chair
or how many he kills to stay there
i dont believe anything she says
good or bad
shut up
boys youve got to believe me
he got this whole thing worked out
what he doing at duncan
duncan as big a sucker as any of us
jim made him want to fight
and he gone up there to push him into it
i wish somebody would get over
to that case of rifles
and start protecting me
from what coming
what do you want
ill talk to you inside
if you came here to talk for kate maxwell
youre wastin your time
kate doesnt need anybody
to talk for her
she probably out of jail by now
i dont think so
i left five of my men there
hope theyre alive
duncan the settlers are talking fight
theyre gonna end this
by wiping you out
wantin to wont make it easy
id hate to be around
when she sends them out here
theyll smoke you and your men out
and knock you over like rabbits
maybe unless i crack down on them first
with a few ideas of my own
ned
call the men in
right
i suppose your story pretty straight
mr averell
now id like to know how straight you are
use your head
why are we fighting each other
neither of us really have
anything in common with these settlers
we live in a different world
we live a different life
when the chips are down
whose side do you think ill be on
theirs or ours
youre a real high-minded citizen
to be looking for the governorship
im for jim averell
i see that
so after all your big talk youre double-crossin em
that not a nice word
how do i know youre not
double-crossin me
you dont it a big chance isnt it
which reminds me
while were here talking
were giving them more time to get organized
that time about up
they want a fight
ill bring it to them
youre comin along mr averell
if anything goes wrong
ill have you right under my guns
ned get all the hands in from the range
saddle up were ridin
all set
all right come on
get on the horses boys let go
if you try to stop me now sheriff-
im not gonna stop ya
im gonna join ya like averell done
how have you managed to keep
your outlaw friends under cover so long
what outlaws
wanna tell him
i dont know what youre talking about
the outlaws working for him
the ones that killed your foreman and stole your cattle
that a lie
if it isnt averell-
no use arguing now
well find out
if there going to be a fight with duncan men
we know were going into it with clean hands
but let keep it clean all the way
the first shot must come from him
and if it does well
you boys know how to fight back
here they come
now remember
duncan boys must be
the first to start
duncan youve got about a minute
to make up your mind
throw in with the settlers
and i think we can prove our friend here
has been double-crossing
every one of us
start battlin and the outlaws
will wipe out the town
seems to me a man of your position
with all you have at stake
isnt going to let your thinking be done
for you by a $50-a-month sheriff
a saddle bum who rode
in here from nowhere
what your play sheriff
you didnt spend much time in jail
couldnt afford it too many chores
glad everybody in good humour
what it going to be stan
were gonna have a party
a mite different from
the one mr averell planned on
but he gonna be the host
get off
what for
the man spoke to ya
some odd characters in the hills are waiting
for him to tell them were killing each other
all right tell them
i dont know what you mean
the smoke signal mr averell
youre supposed to light that stack of hay as
soon as we start throwin lead at each other
then they come riding in
to take over the town
light it
the windll sweep the fire into every building in town
hal get over in the hotel
and keep a bead on him
if he tries to move anywhere
let him have it
right
now light it
light it jim
let draw em in close boys
let em think were in a free-for-all and make it good
-
what are we waitin for
all right come on
rise and shine governor
listen to that battle
this is where we split up
let ride
i left five men guardin you
nobody hurt them
their pride maybe but that all
you think im crooked and no-account
youd put more trust in a lead dollar
who killed wade burrows
do you think if i had anything to do with that
id have left that branding iron under him
like a signed confession
now youre saying that
averell tried to frame you
why should he youre working together
if i talk from now till christmas
youd still only believe what you want
all right go ahead
believe what you want
but make up your mind quickly there a fight comin on
you aint playin fair jim
you left us no chance for fun
theyre partners all right
i kept trying not to believe it
well
ive been with ya
since we rode into town
you-you boys better put up your guns
why
well i uh-l-
well look here
captured ourselves a sheriff
you boys had a nice little scheme
dont talk dont shoot it a trap
not the kind of scheme thatd give
anybody a chance but im givin you one
a fair trial if you drop your guns
were covered
that it boys
there a bead on every one of ya
let go
get that guy in the hotel window
he got me pinned down
you stay inside
jim grab on
leaving
pointing a gun at me again kate
i ought to kill you
but id rather see you hang
now kate
you lying sneaking murdering-
theyll be piling in here in a minute kate
you gotta let me go
why for what youve done to me
for what i used to mean to you
that was an idea i had
but you were never like the idea
well uh the good times we had
we had good times
think about them kate
what are you gonna gain if i die
youll never see me again
you got stan blaine and-
did i kill him kate
when i had a chance
when you asked me not to
kate did i kill him
there another reason
you gotta let me go
look kate look at this
how can i believe anything youve said
the last time-
let listen to him boys
thank you
i think we can
give credit for this to
cattle kate ive come to realize
that ive got to consider
your interests as well as mine
if you want to make a friend of me
think of my interests as well as yours
the west is gettinmaller friends and i
reckon weve gotta learn to live together
now im not the kind of man thatll throw
away the things that i worked hard for
who gave you that
he did
where is he
saddling up
where to maverick
could be california
maybe oregon territory
do you still think i was jim averell woman
that how it looked
because i cried
sure i cried but not because i love jim
i cried because when i found you
i realized i was all the things
i never wanted to be and because-
oh what do you know about women
or the way they feel
there a piece of bottom land
a few miles down
good for homesteadin
let have a look at it
tantico
