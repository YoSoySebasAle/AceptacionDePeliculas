ended up like that
officer
i know
there no excuse
i agree with you
may i have your
i was going pretty fast

you were going
pretty reckless too
you know
this is an old road
it tricky and dangerous
it lined with signs
that say 25 miles an hour
5 miles an hour
winding road
now those signs
can be quite interesting
if youre going slow enough
to read them
ive read them
all before
what do you think
we put them up for pedestrians
can you give me one good reason
why any sane person would drive
the way you were driving
no
you surprise me
i was sure you would
well actually officer
im maladjusted
i come from
a broken home
want me to write
that down for the judge
youre not going to
throw the book at me
are you
well here what
im going to do
im going to reach into
the hat and pull out just
one of your violations
forty-five miles
an hour in a 25 zone
sign there please
here your copy
ill save the reckless
driving charge for next time

quite a struggle

any of this stuff eli
dont worry i know
all about these things
no identification
of any kind
no wallet
labels all cut out
of the clothing
all we have for sure is
that he wasnt a suicide
ah
not with his hands tied
behind his back
you should have listened to me
i told you to come up right away
now eli
remember the story
about the boy who cried wolf
dont you go trying
to put the blame on me sheriff
nobody blaming anybody eli
if we followed up all your stories
wed have to put on two extra men
which by the way
you taxpayers wont let us have
you know it no wonder
old eli lives alone
no woman could stand
to listen to him all the time
i wish id listened
to him this once
there not enough time in the day
to stop and measure all the ifs
you made the same choice i would
and went after what you saw
instead of what you didnt see
that what youre paid to do
i know that
it doesnt make me
feel any better
if id gone with eli
that man might still be alive
now look boy
when i hired you
i hired myself a good lawman
i didnt think about
what happened in denver then
you stop thinking about it now
you shout your mouth
and solve this case
morning deputy
morning
rising with the sun
or just going to bed
hoping to catch some worms
im trying to get a line on a fellow
thought maybe you could help me
ill do my best
fellow about 55
60 years old tall
grayish hair
distinguished-looking
when last seen
wearing a suit of thin
dark gray shiny material
doesnt sound like
anybody ive seen
thanks anyway
oh if he turns up do you want me
to tell him youre looking for him
no thanks
he turned up already
oh yeah here it is
re wallace
el trovatore motel
that all
well that all you asked me
well that all youve got
no permanent address or anything
nope
well you must have asked
to see his driver license
why
well most people do
when they rent an automobile
to a perfect stranger
oh he didnt rent the heap
he bought it for a 50 bucks
col cash on the line
well registration
oh he hasnt gotten around
to fill that out yet
hey look youre the law
what do you think should i
send it to him at the motel
no send it to the county morgue
good morning
morning
looks like it going to be
another scorcher dont it
yes maam
are you selling tickets
for the sheriff rodeo
or are you
just raiding the place
i wouldnt think of it
just trying to track down
some information
on a mr re wallace
oh yeah number 8
i dont think
he here now though
i dont see his old yellow car
you mind if i take a look
in his room
why should i mind
can you tell me anything
about this mr wallace
well not an awful lot
im afraid
he been here
four or five days
but he not gabby
like most of us
very quiet
fine-looking gentleman
id say a businessman of some sort
probably from the east
has that funny way of talking
this is 8
what
what in the world
could have happened
this is just awful
why everything ruined
ill certainly have plenty
to say to that mr wallace
i dont think he did it maam
how can i ever
get it cleaned up
dont touch a thing please
as a favor to the state of arizona
no label on this clothing either
not even any laundry marks
all this expensive luggage
but no initials on it
nothing
what does that mean to you
first i thought the killer
was trying to cover up
the identity of the victim
now i think the victim
destroyed his own identification
how do you figure that
any man who buys luggage
as expensive as this
usually has his initials put on it
could be
could be brother bloodhound
dont just stand there
he aint treed yet
get out and see
if you can pick up his track
it sure funny how now
when i got nothing to say to you
you keep wanting me to talk
youve got to keep talking
eli till i can make
some sense out of it
i cant remember crazy talk
when it dont make sense
well try think
what else
over
he did say something
about over the rim
over the rim
that must mean the grand canyon
well that narrows it down
to arizona anyway
come on eli
did he say anything else
that you havent told me
well but im not sure
i heard it right
come on
it sounded like
dancing in the bucket
dancing in the bucket
uh-huh
at least that what it sounded like
got any idea what it could be
over the rim
dancing in the bucket
bucket
hey wait a minute
you just keep your mouth shut
hey jack over here
mr ward
yeah oh hi deputy
say what do you call
that contraption out there
tramcar
you see anything of him
around here we call it
the dancing bucket
who he looking for
charlie piper
old charlie one of the guys
that works here he missing
what he look like
he about 30 maybe 35
you seen anything
of a man about 60
grayish hair 5 well built
no nothing around here
but us chickens
you know what happened
one time a guy did end up
down there
can you imagine he got so busy trying
to get his ladder working he just
walked right over the edge
how do you figure that
how long has old charlie piper
been missing
i dont know for sure
he a watchman around here
on the weekends
when we come on today
he wasnt around
and you didnt think of
reporting this to the sheriff office
hold on
dont take me in yet
we dont think nothing
of it around here
when a guy missing
what do you mean
the work gets them
see the bucket out there
well that thing travels 9000 feet
across that canyon
to that cave on the other side
inside that cave
there about 500000 tons
of prehistoric bat guano
man that a lot of fertilizer
the only way
to get the stuff out
in that bucket
i figure old charlie
probably got tired
of shoveling the stuff
and riding the bucket
so he lit out
next thing you know
hell be sending us postcards
from las vegas or somewhere
hey jack
what about it
bill not a thing
all right bring it on in
it time we got back over
at the other side
and start hauling guano
ill ride back over with you
have you searched
the other side yet
nothing over there
but that cave and the cliff
and a lot of tired worn-out bats
well if you find anything
notify us will you
all right
want to ride over
and take a look for yourself

oh im sorry dad
this is deputy
les martin sir
jim kendon
scotch rye or bourbon
well do you have
any beer around

can all right
yes sir fine
what have you been doing
these days
besides chasing girls
and giving them tickets
they letting you in
on the murder case
you know that was my old office
where they found that man
yes we know
thank you
when was the last time
you were there sir
i havent used it since
the battle of gettysburg
the only time i go over there
is when i get lonesome
for the old days
well pleased to have met you
mr martin
id better be getting back
to my fossils
what kind of fossils
dad likes to wander up
and down the canyon
picking up rocks
he pretty much
retired these days
i think it makes him
a little sad to see the mines now
the way it does me
i go and wander around
the place sometimes
watch it fall apart
im sorry
do you want to sit down
oh no thanks miss kendon
ive got to get back to work
youre a real dedicated
public servant arent you
not dedicated enough
im afraid
why do you always look as though
you have something on your mind
well because i have
one thing ill regret
the rest of my life is
chasing you the other day
to give you that ticket
why officer martin
that the most gallant thing
ive ever heard
yup that me
gallant but stupid
while i was handing out
speeding tickets
that when the man
was being killed
well thanks for the drink
miss kendon
i didnt know
im sorry
ward hi
you got something
remember that fellow i said
had taken off for las vegas
yeah
not so sure about him now
that his watch
one of my boys found it
up the canyon
at the rim
close to it
it was over by a boulder
well you know
even a dollar watch
wears out sometime
maybe he just
threw this away
not charlie piper
like a kid about that watch
sort of a lucky piece you know
you dont think
hed have gone to vegas
without this huh
i dont think
hed go anywhere without it
i cant hear them
that because you never knew kendon
the way it used to be
you know there were
0000 people living here
when the mines
were going full steam
oh it was
a wonderfully noisy place
the clatter of the big mills
and the whine of the conveyor belts
and every now and then
a great big beautiful explosion
and all day long
kids laughing
and playing and howling
at each other
it was a rip-roaring town too
you know scotty saloon
was just one of seven
dance hall girls
say methuselah
how old are you
it was less than 20 years ago
look at it now
yeah
you know for a few moments there
i thought i could hear it too
welcome to the club
let me ask you something
is it possible
there could still be
a lot of gold here
without you people
knowing about it
are you kidding
youre sitting on $20 million
worth of gold
and practically everybody
knows about it
during the war the government had to
close down all the gold mines
because they needed
the manpower
well the war over
what are they waiting for
for the price of gold to go up
i dont see anything wrong
with $35 an ounce
nothing wrong with it
in other countries
where there a free market
it averages about $50 an ounce
oh well that is a difference
$24000 a hundred pounds
darn right it a difference
mm-hmm
my father spent a fortune
sending me to college in new york
to make me ladylike and dainty
you come along and in five minutes
im just a miner brat again
i think you still look
ladylike and dainty
ill slug anyone who says i dont
with all this gold here how come
they have only one man guarding it
oh eli not here to guard it
he just keeps the fences in repair
so that the tourists
wont fall down the mine shafts
and that concludes
the lesson for today
all right teacher
here we go
oh
tell me les what do you do
when you finish a day work
go home
get your notes in order
oh i generally
hang around the pool hall
sometimes i get in with a group
to go stealing hubcaps
you need some recreation
you mean like a hobby
like stamp collecting
why dont you find yourself a nice
intelligent well-rounded girl
take her out
for dinner and dancing
i think youre well-rounded
you might try my house
say 700 tomorrow evening
that sounds like a dare
oh it is
all right youre on
tomorrow at 700
lightweight gloves
keep an eye out for cops
hey what are you
doing down there
what the hell business
is it of yours
get up out of there
what your name
suds reese
what are you doing here
minding my own business
that what
im hitchhiking my way
out of this lousy state
so i stopped for a couple of beers
and im sleeping them off
in a gold mine
i just wanted a cool place to sleep
you county cops got nothing to do
but give me a hard time
wait a minute
where did you get those
theyre a graduation present
from me mother
yeah
you must have skipped
a couple of grades
you shouldnt
get your hands up
keep em up
now turn around
spread your feet come on
i ought to break your neck
what are you trying to pull huh
no wonder you didnt want me
to look at these rew
mr reese if you want
to leave this state ever
you better have a real good story
about where you found those
what kind of a way
is that to talk
i found them
laying back down there
and you had no idea
who to give them back to right
i dont know any rew
reese youre coming down
to kingman with me
just to make sure you dont
all right get going
you heard me
come on now
what going on out here
ive had
enough trouble out of you
book him for assault and battery
and suspicion of murder
murder
suspicion of murder huh
this guy sure gets around
considering he just got out of jail
in prescott late yesterday
late yesterday in prescott
you know this guy
he one of my star boarders
suds reese
he likes it
dont you sudsie
sure you got the best
county jail in the county
then why did he slug me
when i started to look
at these binoculars
old sudsie like that
look at the initials rew
that certainly could be re wallace
where did you get them
like i told this joker
i found them
sorry les probably true
anyway we can book him
for assault and battery
sheriff the county attorney
on the telephone again
ill take it in my office
lock him up
come on les
you might as well
be in on this too
ive met
county attorney houghton
he doesnt think very much
of the sheriff department
the feeling mutual
mr houghton
sheriff edwards
oh that very reassuring
mr edwards
people around town
are beginning to wonder
if we still have a sheriff
i have in my office
the mayor and mr sanford
of the kingman dispatch
they have the feeling that
though you may be on the case
youre not doing anything about it
well we are matter of fact
i got something on it this morning
communication on charlie piper
los angeles police department
the old goat just bluffing
shuffling papers
if we dont win the election
it wont be his fault
here it is
arrested for hijacking a truck
beat the rap
apparently the county attorney
down there wasnt doing his job
july 6 953 was tried and convicted
for the burglary of a warehouse
yeah yeah must have been
a different county attorney
edwards ill tell you one thing
neither one of those county attorneys
would have gotten a conviction
if youd been sheriff
because your mr piper
would never have been arrested
in the first place
look sam why dont you take care
of your department
and let me take care of mine
sam houghton backed my opponent
the last time i ran for sheriff
it would make him very happy
if we dont solve this case
matter of fact it might lose me
the next election
you mean for both our sakes
id better make some progress huh
you got the message
what are you
all dressed up for
im not all dressed up
youve got shoes on
it gets cold
around here at night
if you must know i have
a young man calling for me
obviously you cant think
too much of him
if youre not even going
to keep him waiting
hi
hi
how are you sir
fine thanks
how about a drink
ill intoxicate him
come on les
let live dangerously
and take my car huh
not that dangerously
you can drive
well in that case
good night sir
good night
i keep coming back
to one theory
could somebody be sneaking gold
out of your father mine
your somebody would have
to sneak it out by the truckload
to make it worthwhile
well if you had a big truck
and taking ways
where would you take the gold
ive been accused of having
fetching ways
but this is the first
this is hardly a big girl idea
of a gay night out
cant we talk about us
im just trying to protect you
somewhere in these hills
there a murderer on the loose
you frighten me
if you dont answer my question
im really going to frighten you
yes sir
well if i were stealing gold
we miners call it high-grading
id take it down to mexico
fifty dollars an ounce remember
would you have to know
a lot about mining
to discover a rich vein
yes and that the last
of your questions
where are you taking me mr deputy
to scotty
i want to ask him some questions
this is turning out to be
a fabulous evening
i was hoping to combine
business with pleasure
then let get down to business
ah here we are
thanks
looks like
your brother here
he always here
what else does bob do
he supposed to be
a geologist
supposed to
how that
well he just does it
to keep peace in the family
i wouldnt say he worked at it
or at anything else
for that matter
except flying maybe
mademoiselle kendon
reserved table up front
not too near the music
inspector
champagne of course
hi scotty
hi
ill join you in a minute
all right
come on
drinks are on me
hi sis
stud or draw deuces wild
you name it
why didnt you come home
last night
why should i
well dad and i
were worried about you
im sorry that you were worried
but i dont give a damn about him
look bobby
no one wants to interfere with you
boy when i think of you
driving those turns at night
absolutely pie-eyed
i drive better drunk
that because
youve had more practice at it
how the new fellow
and this is
the specialty of the house
for the carriage trade
ha speaking of
the carriage trade
have you seen
any strangers around
in a ghost town
what would they be doing here
well just in case if you do
anyone anyone at all
get in touch with me
right away will you
if i see any strangers here
im going to grab them
pull them in here then roll them
then ill call you
you have my blessing
youre a little premature
you usually get
what youre after
i cant get you to stop drinking
youve got to lose sometime
youve got to stop sometime
tell you what ill do
ill cut for it
see it impossible
okay but take it easy huh
you too sis
hey scotty
how about another drink
for an arm of the law
youre very light on your feet
and on yours
youre a lot younger
than your jokes
where did you learn to cha-cha
i sent away
for a mail-order course
but the left foot never arrived
are you tired
uncle
im glad you said it first
when youre not
drag racing with policemen
or rinsing out your brother
what do you do to keep busy
im a domestic
when summer comes
dad pretends the housekeeper
needs a long vacation
so i keep house
for him and bobby
uh-huh what do you do
in the winter
now i know
why you became a policeman
you just like to sit around
asking questions
it my turn now
all right
what did you do
before speeding tickets
and the cha-cha
well actually
i started out to be a lawyer
mail-order
university of colorado
i passed my bar exams
i practiced for two years
in boulder city
but i
it just didnt get me
not enough excitement
not enough fresh air
i guess
then what
on one of the cases
i was handling
i met a police sergeant
from denver homicide
and his job seemed much
more interesting than mine
so i became a policeman
homicide
a detective
mm-hmm
that interesting
were you a good detective
they seemed to think so
there was even talk of running me
for district attorney
id have voted for you
another round please
well you cant finish
the chapter there
no personal life
no policewomen
well i did meet a girl
we fell in love got married
had three wonderful years
then she became ill
everyone was
very understanding
i couldnt keep my mind
on what i was doing
and   i messed up
a terribly important case
the department
was kind of glad to see me go
and when she died
i just couldnt stay in the same town
we dont have to talk about it
if youd rather not
oh it finished now i think
i became somewhat of
a drifter for a while
i had nowhere to go
nothing to do
until i ran into sheriff edwards
here in kingman
he knew about me
and practically bullied me
into becoming a deputy
bless his overweight old heart
ill go along with that
and what about the future
you could still run
for district attorney
well the main thing at the moment
is to do a good job right where i am
there nothing to stop you
hello deputy
good evening mr houghton
miss kendon do you know
mr houghton our county attorney
yes weve met
im glad to see
youre relaxing
someone ought to tell him
that all work and no play
makes jack a dull boy
yeah well i think
id better start getting real dull
check please
i dont know about you
but mr houghton just lost a vote
mine
on radio
im sorry mad dog
you wouldnt have it
any other way
well lieutenant
i guess that closes the books
on mad dog cooley
shouldve listened to em mad dog
well you couldnt have picked yourself
a better time to have dropped in
i just made a discovery
that fellow who was murdered
is sitting right here next to mr kendon
look
oh here have yourself an apple
while i phone the sheriff
oh peel it
is this the coroner inquest
yes miss kendon
according to
your previous testimony
before coming here
you were a lieutenant
in the homicide division
of the denver police force
yes sir
youre experienced
in homicide cases therefore
well yes sir
ive had some experience yes sir
perhaps you can explain
why you seem to have
no leads at all
as to the murderer identity
as i explained
in my previous testimony
is this your testimony
about your discovering this body
or the body earlier this week
or the body last week
when you have
as many murder cases as we have
you have to be
a little more specific
im sorry
were talking about
three unsolved murder cases
we have three bodies
it could be we have
only one murder case
while the manner of these three deaths
shows no similarity
we believe there
a strong connection between them
would you mind defining
that connection
when i can define it
that will close the case
we know generally
that john doe and eli jones
had met shortly before
john doe was hanged
both men died
in the same place
a place that visited by probably
not more than a dozen people a year
the office of the inactive
gold mine at kendon
mm-hmm
and the third man
charles piper
we know that charles piper
leaped or fell
or was pushed over
the rim of the grand canyon
at granite gorge
yes but we dont know why
when we know why
well probably know who
well that a well-made phrase
mr deputy
let go back to denver
thank you
the last case
that you handled there
involved the murder
of a 6-year old boy
one harris knight
now according to
my investigation
now wait a minute sam
this has nothing to do with this inquest
and you know it
i know nothing of the kind
but i do know this
im the county attorney
responsible to the good citizens
of mohave county
and theyre very upset
with good reason
over these three
unsolved murders
mr coroner it up to you
to see that he sticks to the inquest
id like to answer him sheriff
might as well
have everything out
you may continue the questioning
mr martin
according to my investigation
you had the police department in denver
holding the wrong man for trial
it wasnt until
you were relieved of your job
and another officer replaced you
that the true murderer
was found and convicted
yes sir
in other words you were guilty
of several mistakes
and some carelessness
in the matter of harris knight
yes sir
and then again
according to your testimony
the deceased eli jones
intercepted you
on the morning of the 6th
of this month
and he begged you
to come with him
to interview a john doe
a man known as
re wallace
who was killed later the same day
in the kendon mine office
now have i made
any misstatements of fact
up to this point
no sir
according to your own report
you disregarded eli jones request
and went chasing after a girl
i wasnt chasing after any girl
i was taking care
of a traffic violation
you gave her a ticket
yes i did
what was the ticket for
forty-five miles an hour
in a 25-mile zone
well that doesnt sound
so serious to me
certainly not as serious
as murder
or even a request
for help from eli jones
when eli jones asked for help
i didnt know of any murder
and i did see somebody
breaking the law
you can call it a mistake
only now after the fact
you made a mistake
in the case of eli jones
and john doe
you made a mistake in denver
in the matter of harris knight
now why should we have
any reason to assume
that there wont be further mistakes
i cant give you any guarantee
nobody can
mr county attorney
our sole purpose here is to establish
the identity of the deceased
and to determine the cause of his death
mr coroner
im just trying to do my job
and i assume that all of us
are trying to do the same
it seems clear to me
that those of us
who havent met with
violent death so far
might be reassured
if there were fewer mistakes
and more progress
perhaps this entire community
would all feel a little more secure
if someone with a different record
was handling this case
you seen the morning paper
you want my resignation
no i dont want your resignation
but if this sort of thing keeps up
im going to have to accept it
hey martin youve got
a stack of unanswered
phone calls out here
janice kendon called
miss kendon called to report
she a missing person
janice kendon would like
would like to send you
a food package where
i see at least you
got the messages
he been working
like a dog miss kendon
he is a dog
not being a girl
you cant imagine
how embarrassing it is
if you keep chasing a man
and he keeps hiding from you
im sorry
all right deputy
put your hat back on
and take the silly look off
youre gonna buy me
a hamburger
all right youre on
ill just put these things away
oh i had a professor
of medieval history
had a jacket almost like this
yeah in new york
of course
that where norman james is
who norman james
your history professor
he is the man who makes these jackets
with the funny little round lapels
oh les you are a country boy
back in the effete east
you could be ostracized
for asking a question like that
what are you talking about
norman james is the most exclusive
gentlemen tailor in new york
and this jazzy lapel
and these crazy pockets
are his trademark
where could i find
this norman james
would he be in
the new york telephone book
you dont think hed have
an unlisted business number
he not all that exclusive
what that for
for being the best girl
a deputy ever had
well hey
how about my hamburger
stay right there
ill get you a truck
full of hamburgers
rush this out will you
to new york police department
contact immediately
norman james
norman james made suit
as described for only one customer
randall e whittemore
claiborne towers new york
whittemore executive vice president
of kendon mining corporation
currently on extended business trip
pretty smart of you
to recognize that jacket
we hicks out here probably
never would have known about it
janice recognized it
do you think mr kendon
is connected with this somehow
well let face it
he and whittemore belonged
to the same company
daughter recognized the jacket
what if you go out
and have a little talk with kendon
yeah
on second thought
itd probably take
half the time if i went out there
well if you want
no no
you know your way around
besides why send
an old man to do a boy job
hi
hi
id like to see
your father
my father
isnt this rather sudden
it line of duty
oh well he and bob
are fighting again
theyre in the den
did you find out
about the jacket
yeah
well that good
youre getting somewhere
i dont know
this case is better in some ways
worse in others
well not discuss
it any further
that fine with me
because im sick of it
dad
mr martin is paying us
an official visit
howdy
hi
well which one of you
two in trouble this time
oh theyre not in
any trouble sir i am
oh
uh mr kendon
when was the last time
you saw mr re whittemore
randall whittemore
yes sir
let see
last may at the stockholder
meeting in new york
you havent seen him since
no why
well the man
who was found dead
at the kendon mine office
was mr re whittemore
what
yes sir
oh no
im afraid ill have to ask you
to come down
and identify him
at the morgue
of course
this is shocking
you didnt even know
he was coming out here
i had no idea
hello yes he here
just a minute
bob it for you
who is it
i dont know a man
mr kendon
isnt it kind of strange
hello oh
his not getting in
touch with you
yes it is strange
why dont you sit down
ill be there right away
i wonder
i wonder
what he was here for
my guess is he found
someone was taking ore
out of the kendon mine
i think youre on the wrong track
first place
you dont just walk into a mine
and fall over
a high-grade pocket
you have to know
something about gold mining
a lot of people around
here know about that
yes
but even after you
discover the ore
you still have to
blast it out
now that hard to do
quietly
do you have to blast
i suppose under
some circumstances
you could get it out
with jackhammer and pick
but you still
have to get it out
and sell it somewhere
taking a few hundred pounds
of gold ore at a time say
six or seven
thousand dollars worth
you could load it onto a truck
or even a small plane
yes i suppose so
excuse me
i think ill make
some coffee
none for me thanks
mr kendon
have you told me
everything you know
about this case
what do you mean
i dont have to steal
from my own mine
im sorry
i have to ask you
these questions
where she going
i have no idea
you have any idea
where bob went
well if he not in a bar
where he probably is
he might be out
at the crop duster strip
where we keep
the old company plane
ill be back
that will be a pleasure
i can forego
you know youre not
supposed to call me
at home
well merciful heavens
look who got out of the wrong side
of the bed this morning
you know who was there
when you called
the deputy sheriff
no
let finish loading the plane
i dug it all myself
and then were off to rio
rio are you crazy
why the sudden change
in our plans
we sell the stuff in mexico
and then we head south
kid i know places in rio
that make las vegas
look like a sunday afternoon
in philadelphia
you know you remind me
of charlie piper
i had him figured
for a lazy loafer
from the start too
im glad i got rid of him
i got news for you
if i could fly this crate
i wouldnt need you either
you mean you killed
charlie piper
oh i should have but i didnt
what a character just like you
never did anything right
i give him a job
busting up some rocks
he lets an old geezer
with a trick suit
catch him at it
so i said to him all right
charlie let him follow you
up to the canyon
then you shove him over the edge
gets into a fight
and he cant even lick
an old man
who going to take care of him
good old scotty
that cold-blooded murder
oh come off it kid
this might have been
a cut caper of yours
to get back at your old man
for being twice the man you are
me i went along for the loot
that worth the lives
of two men
two chuckles
i forgot to tell you about eli
you murdered eli
what do you want from me
he sees a picture of the old snooper
up on the office wall in kendon
if i dont get rid of him
and the picture
everybody in the
whole county would know
who the guy was
they already know
know who
the headman of the whole
mining combine that all
well now dont that
take the cake
before the day over
theyre going to know who we are

snug as a bug in a rug
and ready to roll
now you go to work
