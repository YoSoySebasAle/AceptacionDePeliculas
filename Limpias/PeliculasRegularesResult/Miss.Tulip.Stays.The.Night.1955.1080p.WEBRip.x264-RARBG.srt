cant understand it
i know she seemed a bit mad
but to do a thing like this
she didnt do it
it not suicide kate
she was shot and there
no sign of a gun
im afraid it murder
but if she was shot
wed have heard it
i know silly isnt it
besides how could
anyone have got in
the french windows they
were open this morning
when i came down
were they
we shut them last night
i know i thought
archie might have done it
by the way where is archie
he gone rabbiting i expect
you know what he like
when he gets in the country
do you think he all right
trust archie
well it wasnt
forced anyway
i wonder if
hm
i wonder if she let
someone in herself
why should she
havent the remotest idea
the whole thing so screwy
oh lord i suppose id better
telephone for the police
andrew must we
have the police
of course we must but
itll be all right darling
i know what let have
a nice drink first
id rather have a cup of tea
oh heavens ive
left the kettle on

police do get here
let me do the talking
of course darling
i wont say a word
andrew tea

that not ours
ours is miles away
we lost our nuts you see
did you
i know it not yours
it miss tulip
can i have a word with her
she here isnt she
no she isnt
not really
perhaps you can tell
me where she gone
well i couldnt do that

and besides i promised
not to talk to the
perhaps you better
speak to my husband
ill get him
andrew
andrew
andrew where are you
he not there
perhaps he in the garden
very nice too early morning
lovely fresh smell
nice bit of sun
a garden is a lovesome
thing god wot
rose plot fringed
pool fernd grot
the veriest school of peace
that not mine
some other bloke
what that
what what
i thought so aphids
are they
im afraid i dont
know their names
greenfly to beginners
look at them having
a whale of a time
wont do you know
it wont do at all
terribly sorry
so you ought to be
any man or woman
who has greenfly on his
roses is capable of anything
anything
ill take them off
no no no no spray
them with soapy water
washing soap mind you
none of your scented stuff
any man or woman who
squirts synthetic perfume
over a rose is
capable of murder
would you like
some tea officer
oh well thank
you kindly lady
but im afraid it
against regulations
not on duty
mind you we did have a
lecture last week on courtesy
it would be
ungracious to refuse
thank you very much
i take it you like gardening
like it i love it
that why i
transferred down here
the soil better
you can grow things
better than that mangy
allotment i had in london
why i had eight years
in london in the met
far too much going on
everybody rushing about
dope hold-ups fights murders
thank you
never saw anything like it
very different down here
nothing ever happens
all very quiet
except mr thorne
our cid inspector
not altogether what you
might call a quiet type
now what that
more greenfly
no over there it a woman
yes that miss tulip
i thought you said
she wasnt here
well she isnt in a way
i dont quite follow
oh i see 40 winks
im afraid well
have to wake her up
im afraid that will
be impossible officer
you see miss tulip is dead
oh that different
what did you say
i was just going to
ring for the police
it a good
thing i came along
what was it heart failure
yes in a way she was shot
shot
no sir dont touch
anything if you please
everything is to be
left exactly as it is
hmm
nasty
very nasty
ill have to use your phone

though it very serious
dear dear
and you were just settling
down to a nice cup of tea
well so were you
i didnt know she was there
no but i did
that why i wanted the tea
how long have you been
friends with miss tulip
oh we werent friends
she just spent the night here
spent the night here
but you didnt like her
i didnt say that i just
said that we werent friends
pardon my mistake
we didnt like her
as a matter of fact
she was very rude
stalking in here
and demanding a bed
and milk and a hot water bottle
and she seemed to
think that wed just
give her whatever she wanted
did she want that
want what
murder
now youre being silly
madam as a proud but humble
member of the police force
i must ask you to
withdraw that remark
weill i dont mean
that youre silly
i just meant that it
was silly to think
that shed want to be killed
apology accepted
but you better be
careful of mr thorne
as i said before he not
altogether the quiet type
oi where are you off to
to finish dressing
i want my coat
im afraid i must
ask you to remain here
until the inspector arrives
oh all right
is there any objection to
my having a cup of tea
that if i may say so
sir is entirely a matter
between you and your conscience
yes yes yes
hello mr thorne
detective
inspector thorne here
25 feathers talking
at 000 am this morning
as i was proceeding
along shepstone road
get on with it
in the course of my duty
dont
blether about your duty
in the course of my duty
for heaven
sake come to the point man
in the course of my duty
come to the point
im coming to the point
will you cut the
gaggle and come to the point
how can i come to the point
if you dont listen sir
what it all about
it miss tulip
what about her
she been murdered
that shook him
kate there something very
funny about this business
doesnt make me laugh
let try and work out
how it could have been done
now suppose i was the murderer
and was following her
then her car breaks down
but before i can do
anything about it
she in here with us
well id wait
and then until
shed gone to bed
and then break in somehow
that no good archie
would have barked
that true
then she must have gone
out and let someone in
that it there was
mud on her shoes
i threw stones at
her bedroom window
and she came down and let me
in through the french windows
then i did her in
did you indeed
hello are you
someone i should know
i have a feeling
youre going to know me
extremely well sir
my name thorne
detective inspector thorne
how do you do inspector
this is my wife we were just
reconstructing the crime
reconstructing
or recollecting
why im not altogether sure
that i like the implication
of that question
im not altogether
sure that i intended you
to like it mr curtis
mr dax
what that
not mr curtis mr dax
you told me the cottage
belonged to mrcurtis
so it does but mr dax
rented it from mr curtis
why didnt you say so
you didnt ask me
are you here on holiday
no such luck just working
supposed to be working but
he hasnt done a stroke yet
says it lack of atmosphere
but it just laziness really
in the present murder
what my wife means
just a moment sir
id rather mrs dax
tell me herself
yes mrs dax
well in murder by marriage
that what he supposed
to be writing now
writing
oh yes
dax you have all the facts
im very pleased to
meet you mr dax
are you really inspector
yes you always show us
policemen to be such half wits
itll be a privilege
to get a few tips
from such a brilliant amateur
i shall be delighted
to assist you
in any way i can inspector
you really will
splendid
then perhaps youll
assist us by telling us
why you didnt ring
us up straightaway
well im afraid my
enthusiasm as a writer
overcame my duty as a citizen
he was looking for clues
really hmm
being mr dax i
should have thought
they would have
given themselves up
did you find any
oh naturally
come on here ill show you
look at that button
it obviously fallen
from miss tulip hand
now it quite usual for
the victim to be found
clutching a piece of
the murderer clothing
but that button is torn
from miss tulip own dress
oh darling you are clever
isnt he clever inspector
extremely clever
mrs dax yes
people do clutch at their
clothing when theyre
i wish youd tell
me when youre gonna
fire that thing wilson
sorry sir
always makes me jump
as i was saying
people do clutch
at their clothing
when they are dying
maybe but you
dont have much time
when youre shot
through the head
youve got a point there
any more theories
no not at the moment
oh too bad
well failing the mastermind
well have to rub along
as best as we can
i want to see that car
car
yes the car
miss tulip came in
oh that car
uh feathers
yes sir
just keep mrs dax from
feeling lonely will you
very good sir
but i want to go too
leave it to me ill fix it
mr thorne you
think mrs dax might
you heard
i fixed it
you stay here
oh well
i suppose i might as well as
make some sandwiches and coffee
havent had any
breakfast this morning
what the matter
just a minute where you going
there was somebody
there at the window
im sure it was the murderer
now now now it no
good trying to bluff me
but it was a woman
i saw her distinctly
now now now
well go and look for yourself
if you dont believe me
let you slip out
through the front door
this is pc feathers
now lady let be
friends over this thing
what about that coffee eh
all right but im not
gonna make it by myself
youd better come with me
try and keep me out
seems dead all right
funny eh mrdax
why i dont see there
anything funny about it
cars do stop you know
it just a darn nuisance
that this one packed
up last night
yes it quite a coincidence
do you know anything
about cars mr dax
just enough to switch on
and press the starter
that about all
wasnt one of your books
called the garage murder
yes but that was
strictly non-technical
was it i thought
you thought it
with aid of your
mechanic genius
i say youre
quite a fan of mine
if you care to
put it that way
it a pity you know
so little about cars mr dax
oh why
because you could have
fixed this one in a jiffy
all that wrong is that
the main distributor lead
has slipped out of its socket
well it must be loose
it isnt
it looks as if someone had
deliberately disabled the car
almost as if someone wanted
miss tulip to spend the night
then they
didnt know miss tulip
did you mr dax
eh did i what
know miss tulip
well not before last night
hmm quite a short friendship
come on let get
back to the house
you know inspector
youre developing a
nasty suspicious mind
but youre wasting your
time turning it on me
you think so that
your expert view
that my inspired view
you see im one of the
only two people in the world
who know the vital
fact of this murder
you are
yes
i know i didnt do it
and the murderer knows he did
and if youd concentrate
on finding him
instead of making cheap
cracks about my book
im conducting this
investigation mr dax
and ill turn my
nasty suspicious mind
in any way i think
itll do most good
all right i was only
trying to be helpful
routine investigation mr dax
i dont like to be caught
by unexpected discoveries
well then i dont
expect youll like that
after her akers
well head her off this way
you take your
hands off me tommy
cause i wasnt doing any harm
now what all this
you tell this great lout
to take his hands off me

night and i got worried

phone the police
i dont hold with telephones

the police station

always hated your mistress
i wasnt always trying
to borrow money from her
how dare you
that enough
well go into all this later on
meanwhile i want
your medical report
you can also identify the body
yes of course im sorry
oh inspector
id be obliged if youd
let me go upstairs
and finish my dressing
feathers here seemed to
prefer me in my shirtsleeves
but it really
getting very drafty
he wanted to get
his coat earlier sir
i thought hed better wait
till youd been over the house
you were quite right
thank you sir
for once
go and get it for him
know the room
no sir
first on the left
it a gray tweed
i dropped it when i
heard my wife scream
thank you
thank you
i suppose it
couldnt be suicide
impossible
what about the gun
what do you mean
what type and caliber
well have to
remove the bullet
before we can discover that
where are her rings
rings
yes
her fingers were always
covered with them
valuable too
are these the ones
that them
no doubt about it
where did you get those
on the floor
by mr dax coat
can you explain this
yes i can
im not talking to you
it quite simple
im sure it is
i understand now why you were
so anxious to get your coat
you know mr dax
this puts rather
a different
complexion on things
does it
might i ask one question
is it important
yes very
oh go ahead
may i put my coat on
certainly mr dax
i wouldnt like to take you down
to the station in
your shirtsleeves
this is ridiculous
why miss tulip
gave him the rings
on half an hour
acquaintance
yes i know it sounds absurd
but then the whole
thing was crazy
certainly was
she just barged in here
demanding all sorts of things
and rambled on about
anonymous letters
anonymous letters
yes
she said shed had some
threatening letters
and for a time seemed to
think that id written them
did she why
well how should i know
you know there something
familiar about this story
it rather like one
of your books mr dax
oh thank you
but i can assure you ive
not been imagining things
although miss tulip
whole behavior was unreal
asking kate to lock her
rings up and giving me the
giving you the what
dont tell him andrew
he hasnt even thanked
you for finding her rings
but im sure he was
very grateful darling
im still waiting to hear
what else miss tulip gave you
nothing very much just a gun
a gun
where is it
i cant remember
where i put it
i chucked it
somewhere around here
was it loaded
why i didnt look
well suppose you saw it now
you know im
not sure my union
allows me to do the
work of the police
does your union allow you
to be arrested for murder
i never asked them
you didnt see it
in the bedroom sir
no sir
oh pity
hmm now let me think
oh wait a minute though
thank you mr dax
oh dont mention it
hmm one shot fired
doctor could that be it
im not the ballistics
expert you know
and also id like to say is that
there no reason why this
should not be the weapon
thank you doctor
mr dax you any objection
to having your
fingerprints taken
no not at all if itll help
youll have to have mine too
why did you handle
the gun as well
no but if youre
taking andrew
then you might as
well take mine
after all i am his wife
all right sergeant
well have them all down
you can take a cab over willis
certainly cant
do anything more now
simple case cause of
death cerebral hemorrhage
occasioned by a lesion
of the frontal lobe
i thought you
said she was shot
same thing darling
well then why not say so
im gonna get my coat
mr dax
dont worry im not escaping
archie
archie where are you
archie
archie come on
come on
archie
what is it
t
miss tulip
thank you mr dax
where did you get this
well just there
you didnt drop it
no i didnt
and look someone
been lying here
probably you mr dax
very funny
the ground man use your eyes
that accounts for us
not hearing anything
and the french
windows being open
she was shot here
and left lying
while the murderer went to
see if the coast was clear
but changed her mind
and walked into the house
now that impossible
dont be stupid
of course it impossible
no i didnt mean that at all
i meant if shed
been lying out there
i dont care what you meant
i meant you to keep quiet
very good sir
and stop messing about
with that honeysuckle
wisteria
what that
it isnt honeysuckle
it wisteria
be careful feathers
be very careful
i will sir i
never make a mistake
about the names of plants
now this particular plant
feathers
go and get the others ready
very good sir
fingerprints mr dax
andrew what a funny
little finger youve got
would you like mine now
no maam the inspector
will see to that
if it proves necessary
well i think it is necessary
after all were both in
this thing up to our necks
darling dont
say such things
could you say what time
miss tulip went out or why
no and that how i
know she wasnt herself
ive been her only
friend for years
and if the doctor says
anything to the contrary
he a liar
you dont like
dr willis do you
like him nasty crawly toad
always getting around her
making out she was ill
and giving her medicine
according to mr and mrs dax
shed been receiving
threatening letters
never or id have known
i always open the post
nothing but bills
mostly from the doctor
if anyone was after
her money it was him
mr dax says that miss tulip
gave him a gun to protect her
do you know if she had a gun
she had a gun all right
but it was the doctor
the doctor
yes
i heard him say that
hed be much happier
if she had something to
protect herself with
and then i saw him take
something out of his bag
what else did he say
what
what else did he say
i dont know he saw
me standing outside
and he shut the door in my face
come in
the prints will be
ready in 0 minutes sir
all right thank you
that it
fancy giving a thing like
that to the poor dear
nasty vicious thing
if you want to
know who done that
all right all right
take miss judith out will you
and bring in mr and mrs dax
yes sir
get dr willis on
the line will you
oh hello
ordeal over mr dax
i do hope they didnt hurt you
not at all it a
pleasure to be fingerprinted
makes you feel one of
the family so to speak
then perhaps youll take
one of the family chairs
thank you
now whose idea was it to
come down to wood cottage
oh mine
you see andrew had got
behind in his new book
and philip that
our publisher was
getting very worried
you see they have
to stick to dates
and andrew never will
oh nonsense
it no good saying
nonsense darling
you know you
promised to deliver
before you went to america
when you had that
500 pound advance
oh you had a
500 pound advance
yes
and you still
havent finished the book
no
and youre being
pressed by your publisher
being pressed
look inspector publishers
are mean and grasping people
so if i dont get in
first and plead poverty
and lack of
inspiration i get done
now just a minute
let stick to facts
you owe your
publisher 500 pounds
and he asking you to repay it
repay philip dont be silly
what a crazy idea
hello
yes put him through
hello doctor
yes im glad you rang
i wanted your report
on the time of death
not before 0 and not after 2
youre quite
definite about that
the revolver miss judith
said it belonged to you
well id like it cleared up
yes i know she is
oh miss tulip solicitors
burton and travers
on the high street
was that dr willis
yes why
saying that death
occurred between 0 and 2
but that ridiculous
and your story is
ridiculous too mrs dax
according to you miss
tulip was frightened
yet she appealed to you
perfect strangers
for protection
she spoke of
threatening letters
which judith said she never had
your husband being
pressed for money
yet she gave you jewelry to
put in a nonexistent safe
and she gave you the
gun to shoot her with
i have enough ridiculous
facts to arrest you both
then why dont you inspector
perhaps im waiting
for the big build-up
in the last chapter mr dax
or perhaps it all just a
little too easy and obvious
and you dont wanna make
too big a fool of yourself
take mr and mrs dax
back to wood cottage
yes sir
and stop at burton and
travers solicitors on the way
what for
i want a little legal
advice any objection
you surprise me
i shouldnt have thought you
wanted advice from anyone
which only goes to prove
that sometimes even the
police can be wrong
goodbye inspector
get me constable
feathers at wood cottage
25 feathers speaking
mr thorne
the body been removed
everything in order
and im just about to leave
youll do
nothing of the kind
stay where you are
could you speak a
little louder sir
i cant quite hear you
dont let mr dax
out of your sights
keep a close watch on him
inside or out
that depends on how
tactful you can be
you can leave that to me sir
and feathers
watch your step
we dont want another corpse
on our hands at
wood cottage do we
i cant say im very keen
i dont know that i can
give you the information
look mr burton
we only want to know
if either dr willis or miss gale
are mentioned in the will
no
no
because there is no will
they were mentioned in some
draft she drew up sometime ago
but miss tulip kept
changing her mind
right up till a week or so ago
she was coming to see
me but she never came
so she died intestate
intestate
well then who inherits
no one
but surely she must
have some family
miss tulip was the
last of a very long line
she and her sister angela
were the only children
well what happened to angela
she went to australia
australia the missing heir
she had disgraced her family
run off with some
young profligate
her father was devoted to her
it took him many
years to forgive her
and when he did
it was too late
she was dead
the blow killed the old man
and miss millicent
was left alone
sole heir to the tulip fortune
then there still
maybe some heir
dont you see if
angela had a baby
there would still
be no legal heir
the man angela eloped
with deserted her
without implementing
his promise of marriage
ditched her did he
you men
feathers theyve got him too
oh no
what are you doing here
a matter of duty sir
well am i to take it
that were under arrest
oh no sir
then may i ask just what
youre doing in my house
well you see
the inspector said
yes feathers
well i cant tell
you it confidential
then let me guess
your orders are to
see that i dont
to put it vulgarly do a bunk
exactly
well no not exactly
in a manner of speaking
you see the inspector said
to blazes with the inspector
yes sir no sir
well make up your mind
yes sir
feathers you know
as well as i do
the police have no right
to infest my premises
infest
the word was chosen with care
im sorry sir but
my instructions are
to make sure that
i dont vamoose
feathers the whole of the
outside world is yours
it a bit chilly
outside sir
yes isnt it
i wish you a hearty good day
thank you sir
oh andrew
how can you turn poor mr
feathers out into the cold
think how youd feel
if he got pneumonia
i know how id feel
oh but then i suppose
theyd save him
now youre being very unkind
i think he nice
look how he helped me with
the coffee this morning
im sure if we let him stay
hed do the same again
there so much to do
there the carpet and
stairs to be swept
and the grate to be cleaned
and all the dusting
well i dont think
i could very well
do anything like that
you see im on duty
i should have thought
that it was your duty
to give us a hand
then of course if you
dont like us enough then
well if you put it like
that lady i suppose
kate im worried
feathers mustve had orders
to stay here at all costs
otherwise hed have
never allowed himself
to be turned into a housemaid
of course he would
he very nice
well that not the point
the inspector must
seriously believe
that i killed miss tulip
but we know you didnt
well that not gonna be
much comfort if im hanged
well hanging was never
meant to be very comfortable
andrew dont talk like that
well it happened before
we must do something
yes but what
i have an idea floating around
at the back of my brain
but well it just wont gel
dont turn that on
otherwise we shall be drowned
anyway im doing the washing
oh all right
dont use that cloth
why not
well because mrs jones
left it outside yesterday
and it got soaked
there a clean
one in the drawer
the rain of
course that right
it was raining yesterday
and last night
kate ive got it
got what
the answer to the riddle
it all clicking into place
i may be wrong but feathers
what you want feathers for
feathers
feathers come here a minute
i want you to think
very carefully
when you examined the body
were the clothes damp or dry
that just it they were dry
that why she couldnt possibly
have laid outside
in the shrubbery
not in that storm
well then why
didnt you say so
i tried to but you
know our inspector
nobody knows anything but him
honeysuckle
right now there
only one chance
i must get out of here
no you cant do that sir
of course i can
no no the inspector
rang up definite
very definite he was not
to let you out of my sight
come on feathers
im sorry sir id
liked to help if i could
but orders is orders
if he hadnt rung up special
itd have been different
help fellas quick
do something
all right ready
leave it a bit
i see the trouble this
tap wants tightening
that it plumbing
my strong suit
well it used to be
do you think we should
turn it off at the main
yes if you wouldnt
mind before i get wet
andrew you heard
what mr feathers said
go and turn it off at the main
right darling
i wont be very long
went loose again
im afraid you need
to get a new one
still ill try and fix
it up for you temporary
here we are
no we arent
ever been to trafalgar square
like an english
summer isnt it
oh what a shame
your beautiful uniform
getting spoiled
im sure if you just
beginners luck
now im soaked to the skin
look why dont you
take your uniform off
and well dry it in here
ill get you my
husband dressing gown
thank you
here where is he
hmm
there he gone
he hopped it
i know but hell be back
but what about mr thorne
yeah well what
about andrew neck
what about my pension
phew
get me the police
have you taken
leave of your senses
what do you think this
is a fancy dress party
couldnt say sir
it all my fault inspector
you see the tap went wrong
and mr feathers
came to my rescue
only he got awfully wet
so were drying his
uniform in the kitchen
and mr dax thinking
everything is in good hands
just went for a walk
no andrew hates walking
he took feathers bicycle
so you let him
pinch your bike
surely constable you
should have given it to him
where are your manners
i was being tactful sir
oh for goodness sake man
dont stand about like that
it makes you look even
sillier than you are already
go and put your uniform on
well it all wet
so are you go and put it on
to be taken in by a
smart aleck like that
what exactly do you mean
by a smart aleck like that
just what i say mrs dax
your husband
is not a smart aleck
and if you had one grain of
common sense youd know it
he gone because he has a clue
that what he told you
dont be so silly
anyone who would
think that you really
believed andrew was guilty
and theyd be right
i have a warrant for his arrest
but youre mad
give me one good reason
why he should want
to murder miss tulip
ill give you 0 which
is the number of pieces
of her jewelry still missing
that doesnt prove anything
no but the gun does
it only has one clear set
of fingerprints on it
your husband
but he couldnt
have killed her
we were together all night
all night mrs dax
yes
and did you go to sleep
of course
then how do you know
your husband was with you
because the least
noise wakes me up
why i remember when he came
back with milk and biscuits
when he what mrs dax
when he went for the milk and
biscuits i woke immediately
i think you said
when he came back
oh no no when he went
i know im right because
i was thirsty too
i remember thinking how
lucky it was that andrew
was out in the cold and not me
so he got you some as well
hm
as well or did you drink
out of the same glass
there was only one glass in
your room this morning dear
i dont remember
yes it was the same glass
i had a drink from his
mrs dax when your husband
left you you were asleep
so you havent a clue
how long he was away
where he went or what he did
but we have
we say that while
you were sleeping
he went down and
murdered miss tulip
and at this moment
he on the run
hello
hello
hello exchange
get me the police
yes well you better split
alert all cars
no sign of him yet
he got to go somewhere
and it my bet
hell come back here
but surely if as you say
he did have something to
do with miss tulip death
then the last place
hed come would be here
perhaps his superior
knowledge of police methods
will suggest that this is the
place we wont be watching
andrew is not a murderer
even if he was he wouldnt be
stupid enough to come here
so you might just
as well go back
to your cells and
handcuffs and things
and leave me in peace
you underestimate
one factor mrs dax
you
i dont suppose youve
known many men on the run
but i have
there one thing they all
suffer from loneliness
the knowledge that every
man hand is against them
i lay a fiver he
comes back here
andrew the police are here
the police
i wondered if
you could help me
im so silly but
ive lost my way
wont you come in
oh no no no
i wont come in
it would only make you late
make me late
yes
im not going anywhere
youre so right so right
you wouldnt like it anyway
it the summertime you know
gets the clocks all all upset
dont you think
madam would you kindly
tell me who you are
certainly not weve
not been introduced
miss tulip
well i mustnt
stop your rehearsal
we are not play acting madam
we are the police
oh im so sorry
i only use may glasses
when im reading
weve got police in
australia too you know
australia youre angela
yes im angela
but youre dead
i dont think so
am i
she heard that funny story
what funny story
about my being killed
in the railway crash
all the papers had my
name all over them
the people were so surprised
when i turned up alive
it was so exciting
and your sister knew of this
oh yes yes millicent knew
i sent her all the
cuttings to explain
when did you get back
oh im not going back
it would be so silly to go back
having come all this
way here wouldnt it
besides millicent is
meeting me at the station
miss angela perhaps
youd better sit down
how kind of you thank you
im afraid i have
some bad news for you
dont tell me she
cross with me again
no she wont be
cross with you any more
you see she dead murdered
she should be more careful
but she cant possibly
be dead without seeing me
you see wed quarreled
that why i eloped
to australia
it wasnt till years after
that i wrote home having read
the announcement of my
father death in the paper
then millicent
wrote and told me
he cut me out of his will
is that why you killed her
i dont understand
mrs dax i must ask you
quiet
you hated millicent didnt you
for the way shed opposed you
and made it necessary
for you to run away
and when you heard
how she cheated you
out of your father money
you decided to kill her
my dear you dont
know what youre saying
mrs dax you mustnt make
wild accusations like that
theyre not wild but i am
accusing andrew of murder
anyway she been here
before and i can prove it
how
because when she came
in archie didnt bark
he knew her look at him now
all animals like me
but that no proof
i wouldnt be
too sure of that
andrew
mr dax
in the
name of the law
why dont you keep quiet
while i talk to the inspector
now im sorry i had to
run out on you inspector
but well ive
been doing a little
research on a
story i thought up
yes mr dax
yes inspector
i have been working very
hard as a matter of fact
ive got quite a headache
and now im on
the last chapter
the one where we have
the grand finale
and the brilliant
amateur solves
the mystery that
baffled the police
that right yeah
but it was really kate
who solved the mystery
andrew did i
yes it was when you told me
not to use that damp tea cloth
and reminded me that
it had been raining
feathers was onto it too
feathers
yes
he saw the snag right away
you see although the body
had been laying outside
her clothes were
still quite dry
that was when the penny dropped
and as for you never
again will i say anything
against a woman intuition
your reconstruction of
the crime was masterly
was it
yes
but not quite right
she hated her sister all
right and she killed her
i mean it was a clever plot
to drive towards the coast
stop on the way commit
the murder and then
imposing on two
complete strangers
dump the body in the shrubbery
to establish an alibi
change clothes with the
corpse during the night
and appear the next day as
her newly arrived sister
the only surviving member
of the tulip family
to claim the estate
and that that is
exactly what you did do
miss millicent tulip
millicent tulip
hit the jackpot in one
splendid off with the disguise
you should have found that out
elementary
go on back on the beat
millicent tulip i arrest you
for the murder of
your sister angela
youre wasting
your time inspector
she as mad as a march hare
it a lie
the march hare is
as sane as i am
cost me a packet
not to be certified
come along with me madam
where are we going
to the station
good i love trains
can we get some tea
oh yes
never drink it
well what are we waiting for
let get cracking
i know
the way i know the way
well how crazy can you get
thank heavens that over
oh yes
now youll be able to finish
your book at last darling
youre supposed to be
writing one remember
oh im not gonna finish that
what
no i got a much better idea
oh no
oh yes
and the title miss
tulip stays the night
