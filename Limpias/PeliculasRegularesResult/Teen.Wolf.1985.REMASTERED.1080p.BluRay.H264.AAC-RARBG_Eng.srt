never get less than
2 hours sleep
never play cards with a guy
who got the same
first name as a city
and never go near a lady
who got a tattoo
of a dagger on her body

everything else is cream cheese

he just wouldnt go away
one night
things got
a little physical and--
and you turned into a werewolf
out of anger scott

the werewolf out of anger
right in front of
his beady little eyes
was he scared
scared
he lost control
of his bodily functions
ah i wish i couldve seen that
it wasnt a very
nice thing to do
but it worked
after that he never bothered
your mother and me

the most frightened that night

yeah
i was down to zero
still an unsung hero
waiting for my ship
to come to shore
i stood empty handed
like a seagull stranded
watching all the other
seagulls soar
i was slowly losing hope
twisting frayed ends
of the rope
in a suicidal fantasy
i was going to extremes
losing sight of all my dreams
again
i never thought id win
i was blinded by the pain
running wild
through the rain
in a parody of ecstasy
i was inches from the edge
fingers clinging
to the ledge again
i never thought id win
win in the end
im gonna win in the end
win in the end
im gonna win in the end
how much more of this
can you take freak
as much as you
can dish out mick
got to keep my cool
i am not the fool
everyone expects
to play me for
oh i could change
the pattern
steal a ring from saturn
forge myself
into a man of war
i am equal to the task
i wont hide
behind the mask
what you see
is what youll get from me
i am stronger
than they think
they can force me
to the brink again
but now i know ill win
win in the end
im gonna win in the end
win in the end
im gonna win
in end the end
boo
what so funny dork
that four fouls
one more and youre
out of there
like a true defender
i will not surrender
why should i lie down
for them and die
i am equal to the task
i wont hide
behind the mask
what you see
is what youll get from me
i am stronger
than they think
they can force me
to the brink again
but now i know ill win
win in the end
im gonna win in the end
win in the end

come on
come on make your move
boo
you gotta get back
get back you got two shots
get back off the court
funny how sometimes life
just changes over night
magically everything you do
turns out so right
just like that
you pull rabbits
out of your hat
youve got the charm that
even wizards cant explain
how to make rainbows
from a single drop of rain
who can say
it a trick
you learn how to play
when youre shooting for the
moon and finally make it
guess a lucky star
is shining on you
the candle on the cake
is yours so take it
make another wish
it sure to come
let blow out of here
drop dead
tell me i can do it too
the candle on the cake
is yours so take it
make another wish
it sure to come true
you say there
really nothing to it
maybe i can do it too
