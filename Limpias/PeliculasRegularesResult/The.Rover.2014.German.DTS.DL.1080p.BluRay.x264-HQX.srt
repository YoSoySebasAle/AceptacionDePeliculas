well whatever it was he did
you got left here to die
while he was doing it
it didnt happen like that

i couldnt give a fuck if you die tomorrow
god gave you a brother
who not waiting for you
he gave you a brother who
not even thinking about you right now
just because you and him
came out of the same woman hole
the only thing
that means anything right now
is that im here and he not
your brother left you to die
that what people do
you dont learn to fight
your death gonna come real soon
this is 5- passage is called 2-
we should be clear or clearing shortly
4-3-7 echo
4-3-7 echo this is k-k do you copy
stop shooting
i just wanted to fight
i just wanted to fight him
let go
come on
that lady said it would take about
eight hours to get there in the old days
but it might take longer now cause
a lot of them old roads aint there no more
and all the roads are bad now anyways
so you cant drive fast on em
she said about eight or nine hours
she wasnt sure if it was eight or nine
she seemed a bit confused about it
and why would he still be there
he had to wait two weeks for someone
there a man there he got to meet
it gonna take two weeks
you know this or this is what he told you
your brother cant be trusted
is this something that you know
or is this something that he told you
both those things
you work in the mines
no
what do you do then
i was a farmer and now im here
then how come you learned
how to shoot so good
you was in the army
when i was a little kid i grew up on a farm
we had these neighbors
real old man and lady verna and clarry
they brother and sister
and they lived on this land
that all overgrown
like you couldnt even tell
what they farmed so overgrown
and clarry had these eight tractors
and none of them worked properly
so every morning hed roll each one down
the hill till he got one of them started
and then use that one
to tow all the others back up
he did that every day
and when they died
their family who wed never met before
came around cleared out their house
and they found all this
they found all this weird stuff in there
like
like 50 therm
thermionic radio valves
like them real old valves
they used in old radios
and pyramid of pumpkins
and about 5000 of these little sticks
about this long
and each wrapped up in newspaper
and tied up at the ends with baling twine
why are you telling me this
i just remembered it
it interested me
not everything has to be about something
im tryin to stop thinking about that
little girl who died but i cant
you shouldnt
but i cant
you shouldnt stop thinking about her
you should never stop thinking
about a life youve taken
it the price you pay for taking it
that it sweetheart
let start with the eyelids
i want you to roll over onto your front
put your hands behind your back
and do it slow
and do it now
when are you gonna say something cunt
it over
it over for you
i know that
that good that you know that
do you know it too
i know it champ
i told you it
do you know it over for you too
whatever you think over for me
was over a long time ago
im asking about you
are you threatening me
no
a threat means
there still something left to happen
what are you gonna do with me
youre going to sydney
why dont you just shoot me
why dont you do it
that what everyone else is doing
because me sending you to sydney
tells sydney there a reason
to keep paying us what they pay us
if we just shot every idiot
we wanted to shoot
then pretty soon theyd start to wonder
what the fuck were doing out here
see personally i dont care about you
i dont care if you get to sydney and
they let you off or you bribe your way out
or whatever the fuck they do down there
these days
i dont give a fuck
im doing this for me
youre doing what for you
youre doing what for you
i murdered my wife
i followed her to a man house
i watched him put his fingers inside her
and i killed em both
no one ever came after me
ten years ago
i never had to explain myself
i never had to lie to anyone
i never had to run and hide
i just buried em in a hole and i went home
no one ever came after me
and that hurt me
more than getting my heart broken
knowing it didnt matter
knowing you can do something like that
and no one comes after you
you do a thing like what i did
that should really mean something
but it just doesnt matter anymore
well champ
thing you did in abo town is the one thing
that does matter to us
now you can do
all the lying and confessing youd like
what feeling do you have
when you wake up in the morning
when your feet touch the floor
or before that when youre lying there
thinking about your feet hitting the floor
what does that feel like for you
do you know what im talking about
no mate i dont
you dont
