firing rate
rapid
magazine capacity
large
preferably a 556
the weapon must be
fairly light and compact
how compact
as compact as possible
you want an automatic rifle
to fit inside a woman purse
a small vanity case
would be permissible
a small briefcase
would be possible
noise
silencer
i can only give you
a suppressor
itll dampen
the decibels
and dislocate
the sound source
and reduce
the muzzle flash
i cant make you silent
but i can make you invisible
as long as youre willing
to lose some range

dearer than most
especially those that
have lost their way
fabio meccanico
car doctor
but i think his work
is not always legal
did you ever want to be
anything but a priest
have you ever wanted to be
anything other than a photographer
i do what im good at
you have the hands
of a craftsman
not an artist
you are good
with machines
yet you told me just the
opposite when we first met
hmm
journalism
cannot make you
a rich man
perhaps you are
rich already
a man can be rich
if he has god
in his heart
i dont think god very
interested in me father
fabio

letter from a friend
three dead in dalarna
hello again edward
does this place
get many visitors
this is the only way
to get here
did you check it for
footprints and tire tracks
three days ago i walked
the river both sides
let check again
rounds
i prepared two kinds
0 jacketed 0 expanding
id like 20 of each
and 0 explosive
not a problem
will mercury do
mercury will do
very nicely
i brought my own target
right there
muzzle velocity
about 360 miles an hour
that including 20 miles an hour
off for the sound suppression
ruger
m4
ive not had one before
youll find it easy
ive re-balanced it for the
weight of the suppressor
the fulcrum two centimeters
forward from the grip
but that shouldnt matter
if youre firing
im assuming you are
from a fixed position
there no major
recoil issues
you should be able to hold
any target even the smallest
go to the flower
fire into these reeds
say two steps
away from me
two bursts
five seconds apart
the sound suppression
is superb
i couldnt place
the direction of fire
i shall require the rounds and the
weapon by the first of next month
in the meantime
could you tighten the
adjusting screws on the sight
theyre too loose
what about the case
it a briefcase samsonite
black combination locks
you have a number
you prefer
what do you want
done with these
how thoughtful
asprinio
i dont know it
it like moscato
only frizzante
it wouldnt look right
if the picnic wasnt touched
you chilled the wine
i thought
had to be chilled
italian cops
dont move
so beautiful
it endangered
you like coming here
it serves a purpose
youve never taken a woman
here before
no
perhaps you do not have
a woman in your life
thank you for a lovely day mr butterfly
sergio leone
italiano

strange

act
you might have to
with other clients
but you dont
have to with me
i want you to be
exactly who you are
i came here to get pleasure
not to give it

your edge jack
good morning
buongiorno
youre up early
i needed some air
i walk here to meditate
i thank god for certain
favors he has granted me
and i ask him to look after those
of my friends who are sinners
all men are sinners
some are greater sinners
than others
but those who seek peace
have much sinning
in their history
maybe
forgive me this is the
priest in me speaking but
you have done much
sinning signor clarke
and you still do
something happened
here last night
everything ive done
ive had good cause to do
do you wish to tell me
to confess
yes
for what reason
for your own sake
perhaps i can
pray for you
perhaps
i wonder how many bastards
have been made here
you work in metal
you were given some steel
by fabio the car doctor
where was he
conceived father
fabio the car doctor
why do you ask me that
you have each other photos
you have each other eyes
was he conceived here under the trees
at night like all the other bastards
i do not remember signore
it was many years ago
in the end it is i
who confesses to you
do you want me
to do the same
for your own good
you cannot doubt the
existence of hell you live in it
it is a place without love
perhaps i have no right
to wear these robes
but i do have a heart
full of a father love
something close
to his heart
and for that i am
both grateful and happy
what do you have
