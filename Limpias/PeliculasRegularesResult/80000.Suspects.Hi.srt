steven sounding tired

this isnt just an isolated case
it could be the start of an outbreak
all right so it could be an outbreak
i-im not the only doctor in town
im tired washed out
i need this holiday julie
of course you do
youve been working non-stop for years
you deserve it but i dont
and what does that mean

youre staying
but why in the name of---
because i can help
how
they might call for volunteer nurses
im still qualified
you think youre dedicated to
crisis by birth dont you
it has some sort of
fascination for you
not dedicated just obstinate
ill get my cases
julie
should have married someone outside
your own profession steve
someone who wouldnt know
about these things
so im supposed to
go off alone having a wonderful spree while
you stay here and play the martyr
darling dont turn this into a duel
you need the rest it might even
be good for us to be
apart for a while
no i-i-im not
going to let you make me ashamed
of this holiday julie
you cant
not often we have a bust-up is it
this isnt a bust-up
for you it is
i need you with me
you owe this to me julie
telephone ringing
shall i get it
hello
it clifford steve
you were right
the lab confirmed it weve
had a second case
brought in and the moh
is circulating all general practitioners
so perhaps youd leave a
note for your locum
of course
who the second case
commissionaire
the theatre royal
the hospital under immediate quarantine
you just got away in time
im not away yet
how far is the first case from the theatre
three miles across town
which means it travelled through about
eighty thousand people
steven ive been trying to get
ruth there no reply
you said julie took her home
yes
yes she did
well i wouldnt worry
she probably asleep
yes thanks clifford
well
he er cant get any reply
from ruth
oh the hell with ruth
it is an outbreak isnt it
why dont we get some sleep julie
may not be any for some time
you dont have to stay steve youre right
youre not the only doctor in town
im the only doctor in town whose
wife always wins
wish i could believe that
were all right julie
were all right
church bell chimes
disinfection unit reporting sarge
disinfection who for
oh nothing personal sarge -
so dont take offence
it too early for laughs
some place at fairhaven
chief health inspector said report to him here
better report then
oh
standing by sir
the moh will be wanting you shortly
ready when he is sir
ere what all this then
there a meeting
what eight oclock
moh office
yeah well no one been up this
early since the royal visit
and ive also given instructions that
once an ambulance has been
used to pick up a case
it must not be used for any
other purpose
ill advise my men
yes try and keep the same
vehicle for all new cases
sounds like youre expecting more
i wish i wasnt so sure
sorry weve been waiting for
confirmation of another case
a third
did you get it
it in a modified form but im
afraid it number three
where
the davis house again the woman son
the steward
he quarantined of course
yes indeed
as soon as we knew about
the first case
we also found out the
boy went to the
theatre royal on his first
night leave
which ties up the two cases
so there no doubt he
the missed case
in my opinion none
top priority now is to identify
all primary contacts
and the immediate vaccination of all
police emergency services
postal staff in fact every public
servant in the city
look i dont want to underestimate
the situation
but after all three cases i mean
take precautions yes
but dont you think were
blowing it up a little
out of proportion
mr town clerk
i cannot say this too emphatically
this virus is a killer
yes we do only have three cases
but tomorrow it could be thirty-three
in two weeks a thousand and three
unless we contain it now
fair enough
next question
how much of this do i
give to the press
everything as far as im concerned
we desperately need their help
ask them to try and put this
over to the
public without causing a panic
in that case id better talk
to the editor
unless there something else
no i dont think so
thank you ladies and gentlemen
we cant get things moving too quickly
youd better alert the transport department
im going over to the chronicle
call the doctor in would you
see if doctor preston left yet
yes sir
mr buckridge
i know youll instruct your inspectors
very thoroughly

but youll have a team of six doctors
working in liaison with you
make it seven

all two nights it modified and
youre going to be all right
i dont need any false comfort thank
you i know im a nurse
youre a blinkin nuisance you know
and so are you
it wonderful to lie here and tell that
to a full-blown matron
do you know what sort of
person she is father
do i still call you father if
im not a catholic
oh
you can call me a blinkin
nuisance if you like
should wear your mask
didnt they tell you
well if you dont believe what they
tell you why should i
did they send for you or did you just come
just came
to see if there was anything
i could do for you
anything i can get
i cant really ask a priest for a bedpan
where are they kept
i dont want one i just said it
out of devilment
id like to shout awful things at matron
trouble is i wouldnt really mean them
she runs this place like a battleship and i
admire competent people
are you competent father
me well im sure i wouldnt have
got my eleven plus
youve come to give the last sacrament
i could hardly do that
you belong to a rival firm dont you
julie speaks sleepily
didnt you meet me
sometime
sometime ago
i havent been here very long
i-i mean before
poor clifford
he too good
gets hurt
ruth hurts him
ooh youre so smug julie monks

so difficult
im so cold
ill call matron
im not frightened
i want that understood im not frightened
julie gives a little sobbing noise
i love you steve
that was a stupid thing to do father
for a man of your intelligence
were exposed to gross contamination
in here all of us every minute
there no time for dangerous heroics
they tell me you run this place
like a battleship matron
i try to run it like a hospital
and all i ask is that you dont do
such a foolish thing again
yes matron
matron
now we dont want
you in a state doctor
trying to do everything at once
because it all been done
im sure it has
she in side ward two and
she very comfortable
ill be around if i can be of any help
thanks
what happened
she collapsed the night before last
they found her in the disinfection shower
night before last
why wasnt i told
mainly because your wife asked us not to
she insisted it was merely fatigue
and the heat of the steam
but we took precautions and
put her to bed
i see
she just gone to sleep doctor
she hasnt had much sleep lately
so unless you really need to disturb her
no no i wont disturb her
oh excuse me matron

the front gate

gentle music starts to play
steven thoughts
oh julie
dying isnt a reason for loving
or for being loved
but it you i want julie
i know now
dont let it be too late
steven remembering
julie wish i could believe that
steven were all right julie
steven were all right
steven thoughts
if youre going to die julie
you have to know what possessed me
steven remembering
steven i was able to un-mix myself
ruth were you steven
steven thoughts
what did you ever do to make me
less glad to see you
what have you done now to make me
need so much to see you again
steven remembering
ruth steven
darling
ive been a great help havent i
go back to sleep
ill be here
nightingale rides again
i should have checked your take
you hadnt taken
it my fault
rushing around being so competent

listen julie
you mustnt touch me steve
i touch what i like and what i love
beautiful
but you mustnt
ive wanted to tell you why ive been
so impossible lately
it isnt easy and im---
then dont
is it all right now
it going to be
ive got to work it out when there
time and some peace
poor love
im not much help
came on me while i wasnt watching
know what im trying to say
and then i was in it up to my neck
steve
if i die---
you wont die julie
i might there a fifty-fifty chance
ive been infectious for two weeks steve
i want you to have a test
now you stop worrying
im still organising arent i
doctor monks you really must let her sleep
matron where doctor preston
i ordered him to go down and eat
and i wouldnt be surprised if that
didnt apply to you too
and youre not getting enough sleep matron
you should be a good judge of that doctor monks
a glass of wine wouldnt do you any harm
clifford youre sure it modified
you can see the report for yourself
do we know where she picked it up
the sombrero coffee bar i saw
her name on the list
her vacc hadnt taken of course
why wasnt she checked
you know julie
anyway youre lucky luckier than i am
you just heard your wife isnt
going to die and
im terrified of losing mine in a different way
is she still in london
yes
let get out of here
you dont really mean youre
afraid of losing ruth
did i say that
have you heard from her
look steven
there enough trouble around without
trying to find more but
id like to get something straight
have you and ruth ever stayed
anywhere together
i-i mustnt leave any doubt
as to what i mean
have you ever made love to her
why torture yourself
there wont be a brawl or
anything like that it
just that i must know
yes i have
i knew it
i had to be sure so i could face up to it
would it help you to know it was
all over a long time ago
with ruth it never over
we got a new one right out of nowhere
place called the crossings hotel
on the bristol road a man named bradley
what do you mean right out of nowhere
well it not on any of our lists
must be a missed case
god help us if it is
who there
nobody yet
the hotel just telephoned
people there sound a bit weird but
from what we can gather the man
very ill and we dont have a doctor
well find one
where the moh
well he gone off
to shipton lane
i thought wed sent doctor scott-james
yes yes i know but there a
fog coming up on the outskirts
and he lost in it
all right then call the hospital
they must have someone
if not find whoever off duty and
pull them out of bed
right
if there a carrier still moving
weve got to know about it and fast
you all right sir
it beating us
what are we going to do
what are we going to do
you come and sit in the car for a while
come on
oh im sorry i-i can wait
no come in
it doctor monks isnt it
yes im through now
well how your wife
the fever abated a little
oh good
i was talking to her earlier on she was
good enough to receive me
im sure you did her a lot of good
father maguire gives a little laugh
she hadnt much time for me but
still she did her best to entertain me
that does sound like my wife
mmm youre more sure of your
feelings now are you
i dont know
you dont know
maguire makes a tutting noise
then you must be taking stock
of course that what usually happens
i suppose you said to yourself
if i could have her back everythingd be different
and now she is back
everything is different
isnt it
i wish i felt that
i wish i knew what i felt
these things are happening to me all the time
i dont feel them
i didnt love my wife
then i thought she was going to die
now she not
and the most i can feel is that
other people are different
she different too
youre listening arent you
yes im listening
it not enough
maybe im
changed by these things -
but it not enough
i ought to
feel them i ought to be moved by them
steven shouts angrily
i dont register anything
it not that you dont
but you darent
what do you mean
well youre afraid of showing your feelings
you dont want people to see them
huh
ive been shouting
im sorry
maguire gives a little laugh
ah that all right
sure it did you good
yes you think everything does
you good dont you
getting drunk shouting
making love to another man wife
would you say that did you good
steven shouts
would you
you all right in ere
yes yes were perfectly all right thank you
anything you want
a couple of cigarettes wouldnt go amiss
ah now youll have to wait
till you go through
ill leave them in the porter office
i have some in the clean room
you see im trying to cut down and---
yes yes an excellent idea
yes shouting is a good outlet
shouting and crying are the simplest
forms of communication
we cant stand suffering alone anymore
we want somebody to share it
and when they dont well we get
angry and frightened
but you neednt worry
i can take all you can give
what about those cigarettes
you see i leave them in there purposely
because if you havent got it
you may want it but you cant have it
as the duchess said to the
to the sailor
yes that right it was a sailor
the last time i heard it
dyou---
oh thanks
do you remember what you were
saying to me just now
i think so why
well you mentioned something about adultery
did i
well i im not sure
well if i did ill stick to it
it true
im out of gas
ah thanks
i suppose ive just been given confession
as youre so fond of saying it did me good
im sorry there no penitence
only regret
i dont mean i regret doing it
im just sorry it was done
mmm youd like everybody to
forget about it is that it
im sorry for the man that all
but not your wife no
no because she doesnt know
about it so she isnt hurt by it
it doesnt diminish her
ah
im speaking quite normally arent i
oh yes quite normally
im sorry for the man because it hit
him where it hurts most
yes well you see this man has
asked me for advice
and what have you advised him
i thought id talk to you first
and now that youve talked
well im still not sure
and he feels very strongly that he ought to
talk to your wife when she well enough
and tell her ive been unfaithful
is that what you mean
i broke into his house so naturally he has
the right to break into mine
ah well then
not exactly that
it exactly that
im not objecting it jungle logic
and i accept it
mmm
well after all you broke into his house
to ravish his wife didnt you
oh come what
im liable to be amused at the idea of
my wrenching at the front door with a jemmy and
rushing upstairs to pin a screaming
woman to the bed
ah well now it wasnt i who introduced
the simile of housebreaking
all right i chose a bad phrase
in cold hard fact
we met in london by mutual consent
and shared a very civilised meal
before retiring to an anonymous hotel room
mmm hmm
and you find this extenuating
i find it very hard to defend myself against
your sort of blackmail father
it not a question of blackmail
no he just wants to
tell my wife and remove the barriers
i take it that means the natural reserve
of privacy that exists between
two people who spend their lives together
and is there a need for er
privacy
yes
i think the idea of
complete intimacy between two human beings is
undignified and insufferable
must they
clean their teeth in front of each other and
leave the lavatory door open
yes well he thinks you cant open up
your mind to your wife anymore
without watching your step
without having to remember
well a certain place a certain time
you know in case you make a slip
so what do you suggest i do
ah it not for me to suggest
well what does he want me to do
he threatens to
hurt my wife and embarrass me by
exposing an affair that best forgotten
i know
all right well what are his terms
are you prepared to meet them
i am not prepared to let anyone bust in
and break up our future
if he so insistent about it
ill tell her myself
you understand at last

that those would be his terms

infidelity

well you must have faith in something
in people at least
youve been cooped up here too long clifford
just because ruth is
free and away from you
in london doesnt mean that she---
no it isnt that
i know it true

can you sit down or dont you have time
mmm what about ruth
he was telling me shed been unfaithful

he can keep his problems to himself
while youre trying to get better or
exercise them on somebody else
maguire anybody but not you
tinkling of glass

you dont want to talk about that
i know but you came to talk to me and
cheer me up so im just trying to help
julie gives a little laugh
i used to see the strangers
in the ward on visitor day
curled up with embarrassment with
one eye on the clock and
the relief on their faces when the time was up
come on into bed
i saw one man jam his hat on and run
they found him later in the nurses room
because hed lost his way in his hurry
he was madly in love with his wife
theyd only been married a year
and he was off like a shot
when the time was up
and his poor little wife was in tears about it well
she was a post-caesar and a bit weepy anyway
when they told her that hed been
dragged out of the nurses room
she was hysterical
so if they find you in the nurses room later
darling i wont cut up rough
you should tell me to shut up steve
untll youre less busy
gentle romantic music
julie are you
when this is over are you coming home
i havent been very certain that
you wanted me home
that why im asking
with things on your mind steve you
werent very easy to get through to any more
am i so difficult to understand
youre a very private person steve
people think you have no heart
because you dont flash it around
only thing is it makes it difficult for me
to get through to you when i must
and there are times when i must
because i love you
i want you back julie
thanks
ill er
try and have the place cleaned up a bit
steven gives a little laugh
er mrs chalmers never waters anything
but ive um
looked after your pink cyclamen
and it going strong
im a bit weepy im sorry
well youll feel better if i go
yes i-i can enjoy my cry
mr bradley mumbles incoherently
that should settle him down for the next two hours
am i disturbing you
shall i call you or sister if necessary
ill be on call
somebody telephoned about
ten minutes ago doctor asking about him
she wouldnt give her name
if he regains consciousness tell him please
meanwhile spray the nose mouth and throat
and keep up with the compresses
mr bradley muttering
no
i understand he refused to see father maguire
but if it becomes necessary you
could ask him to come here
mr bradley continues to babble
doctor monks this woman been
exposed to gross contamination
wherever she goes she a
menace to human life
if youre quite sure about this thing
i think doctor preston should be told
look if i thought it would help us to find her
id tell him but it wont
he must have some idea
no he hasnt he thinks she still in london
where in london
i dont know
i tried to ask but
i-i cant press the point
mr buckridge
doctor preston is doing four men work
up at the hospital he as tired and
exhausted as you and i
god knows what thisd do to him right now
you see im not used to this sort of thing
im sorry for doctor preston
well then let try and help him
what i dont understand
she
she a doctor wife
she must realise she a carrier
why run away
because there were people coming from here
people who might recognise her
she must be staying somewhere with someone
i believe she isolated herself
of her own free will
then she mad
no desperate
she left her jewellery everything when she fled
i think she keeping away from people
till she knows whether she infected or not
yet according to you she just
used the telephone
leaving the virus on the mouthpiece
the flex---
a knock on the door
what is it
you asked for more coffee
oh did i
doctor
no no thanks
have you finished with the tray
is the new master list ready
oh the stencils are cut
but mr collins said not to run them
until doctor boswell got back
why
in case he had anything new to add
you tell mr collins
no ill tell him
while this woman is at large
were sitting on a volcano
but ill go along with you
thank you
up to a point
if i tell anyone her real name
itll be because itll help to trace her
that all i can promise
that all i can ask
i know im late
hello steve you look terrible
let me return the compliment
i had to deal with a fire coming back
fire anyone hurt
no just an aa box
an aa box
yes
what happened at the crossings hotel
we filled it with formaline and sealed it up
moved the family to a vacant house
where was this aa box
up at the crossings
yeah what about that family
well youve met them havent you
wanted the dogs vaccinated too
you should have seen
scott-james face---
tim was there a telephone
what
in that box
yes that about all there was
four gutted uprights and a smashed telephone
probably some irate member
i think doctor monks
believes it might have been mrs bradley
are you serious
a woman telephoned the hospital
asking for bradley
she wouldnt leave her name
the operator thought it came from a call box
but why should mrs bradley set
fire to a call box
it a drastic measure of disinfection
knowing it might have been contaminated
well that presuming the woman
has some knowledge---
do we have to presume she hasnt
it a theory tim
if we want to find this woman
we shouldnt sneer at theories
all right steve simmer
well let the police comb over the whole area
maybe the army will help too
a sergeant calling you
from downstairs doctor
anything to add before we run sir
yes smiths
doctor monks
there a lady wishing to see you doctor
well outside sitting in a car
she wouldnt give her name
just said it was personal and very urgent
ill be down
dear god no
pardon me
church bell ringing in the distance
doctor monks
doctor steven monks
that right
can we talk in here
it about ruth
ruth preston
where is she
i was hoping you could tell me
are you a friend of ruth
joanna druten ive known her for ages
so naturally ive heard about you
i see
im sure i can talk in confidence
you can
when did you last see her
new year day
well she arrived at my place in london
she was depressed and hungover and wanted
to stay the night
mmm im ahead of you
when she heard about the outbreak
she told everybody she was still with you and
came down here to stay with bradley
at the crossings hotel
how much of this do you already know
it doesnt matter i know ruth
she told me where she was so that i
could cover for her from my end
when did she meet him
brad
mmm
oh years ago
it was a big thing
then it suddenly broke up and he went abroad
and now theyve met again
mmm two months ago
so when they broadcast for mrs bradley
you knew who they meant
well i was frantic
i rang the hotel
they said that everybody had left
and they were sealing the place up
i couldnt ring clifford
no
so i came down here to see you
the whole thing pretty messy isnt it
yes
but necessity drives us a long way
if i hear anything ill let you know
thank you joanna druten im in the book
i wish i didnt feel so hellishly responsible
we have a lot in common
ominous music
dogs barking
as there have been no new cases
for uh nearly a week would you say youve
beaten the epidemic mr buckridge
there are four more days of infection period
if we stay in the clear that long
then i think we can say weve beaten it
dramatic music
any optimistic hope that were on
top of this epidemic is madness
until we find mrs bradley
do you know for certain she infected
sharing her husband bed id say
it almost a certainty
so by now she must be dangerously ill
telephone rings
yeah
what i dont get is why she
doesnt want treatment
right thank you
it very odd
very odd
is it another one
no
bradley died
see that his name is changed to
the proper column
that makes it seventeen
housewife doorman debutante
typesetter prostitute stockbroker
but the urns are all the same shape
buckridge
bad news
i came to let you know ive decided to tell preston
that the best news ive heard for three weeks
i had no right to try meddling in his affairs
now he can let the police have
something for their dogs
a glove or a shoe
it a hell of a time afterwards but---
mmm i should have told him
before as soon as i knew
as a friend it was generous of
you to try and shield him
generous
yes im always generous to my friends
do you have a cigarette
here
officially it my job to tell him
but he a catholic isnt he
steven exhales loudly
what the difference
well perhaps father maguire could do it
im not trying to get out of it
but father maguire could
give him strength---
ill tell him myself
and the dogs can have their glove
it not only that
by god it not
let me get hold of father maguire
damn father maguire
well i expect youll be going home shortly mrs monks
tonight
oh as soon as that
pulled a bit of rank doctor wife
in capable hands
and does he know the glad news
not yet
think he wants me there
he said so
arent you sure
yes
just saying it aloud i suppose
like looking at a present again
do you mind being out here
ive been shut up for so long
well you deserve your happiness i must say
i dont think so
i was a dreary wife
father maguire gives a little laugh
being a doctor wife
isnt easy
oh i ran things competently if
that what you mean
i didnt wink at the man next door
it not important really
well some people think it is
you mean people like clifford
they didnt have a chance those two
why is he so surprised that ruth
does those things
poor clifford he so good yet so naive
his very perfection alone must have driven her away
well it could have inspired her instead couldnt it
she wanted to be treated as a human
he tried to make a saint out of her
and do you think he should justify
her infidelity by calling it human
not justify try to understand and then help
and would you condone infidelity
in your own marriage partner
on the same grounds
of human weakness
is that sister durrell please
no it nurse monks
oh im sorry were looking for sister durrell
hey are you allowed to be out
coming in right away
well i mustnt keep you
your question wasnt very subtle father
it stuck out like a sore thumb
ruth told me about it one night
she was rather tight
she didnt actually say it happened
but i knew
the whole thing meant nothing to her
it was just an incident
yes but it was more than an incident
to you wasnt it
oh at the time yes it was a shock to my
ego and an affront to my dignity
then all this
the long hours lying in bed
trying to make sense of the news
that i wasnt going to die
and then suddenly everything came into focus
that if hed really wanted ruth instead of me
he would have gone to her
ive had nine years with steven
most of them happy ruth has had an affair
i must go now
yes yes
well i told you this father maguire
because it worried you
you think broadly for a woman
have you known many women father
mmm are you taking the confessional
im sorry
i dont understand
it not bradley wife
it ruth
you mean it was ruth at that hotel
with bradley ruth
yes
staying with him at the hotel
yes
no
not ruth
not ruth
then it all gone
everything
all gone
well find her soon
how long have you known
since i brought bradley in
well why didnt you tell me before
i should have
why didnt you
why
you couldnt have done anything clifford
except go and look for her
ive been to look for her every day
once in the night after the police had gone
why didnt you tell me
you couldnt have done anything clifford
he never talked about his wife
we wondered about that
she meant nothing to him
but did he know who i was did he
no i dont think so
what have i done
why couldnt i help her more
nobody could help her
she said once she came to tap my virtues
wasnt it an odd way of putting it steven
to tap my virtues
well i knew what she meant
i was so sure i could help her
she took our faith and for a time---
does father maguire know
no
he would have told you himself
you look tired steven
you people outside are working
harder than we are
she met him
by chance clifford
yes
it wouldnt have happened if---
yes yes it would
she ruth
im sorry for bradley
why must you always
pity the people who---
you dont understand do you
not pity them
how can you not pity them
do these things make them happy
was she happy with you
no
im afraid the police will want to
publish a photograph of her
and you might let them have something of hers
for the dogs to get a scent from
therell be a lot of morbid interest im afraid
you may decide not to help them
not help them to find ruth
it wont be very easy for you
you dont really think the scandal worries me
then you must get in touch with them
thank you for coming to tell me
im sorry it was so difficult for you but
you see it was shock
post-operative shock
clifford breaks down crying
sorry i had no idea
steven
julie
is that julie in there
what other nurse calls you steven
im obviously at the wrong session
seven to eight woman hour
that what the board said
that board right
i wasnt thinking
are you going right through
i mean to the clean room
are you going home
i should never have left in the first place
it was cowardly of me letting you cope
like that please forgive me
forgive you
forgive you
you see martyrs sometimes follow the wrong cause
julie when they first brought you here and i
thought you were going to die---
that past steve
there was so much i wanted to say but i
panicked and---
well thank you and goodnight
yes you out
may i say in my defence---
you can say it to matron
telephone ringing
if youre not out of---
sorry doctor
no youre absolutely right
and thatll be matron agreeing with you
come on
get your clothes on
and let the men have a go
auxiliary on the phone
yes just a moment please

yes doctor monks here

down the stairs
ruth
police car bells ringing
what happened
it was well alight when i got here
were they able to---
no
the trouble is
it been boarded up
they thought it was empty
solemn music starts playing
at least it the way she chose
im sorry for clifford
there was a time when you couldnt
feel anything for clifford
that was a long while ago
not so long
it was before i heard you were
going to be all right
all new things began from there
were going to be all right arent we steve
yes
were going to be all right
hopeful music end theme
