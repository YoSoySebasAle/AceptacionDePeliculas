murder

wait a minute
was she a junkie
or was she pushing
or what
you school me
we found 50000
uncut pure junk
in her bedroom
how does that read
that a lie
cloris was a little wild
she might have had
a few heavy boyfriends
here and in dc
but she was not dealing
no way i knew her
jake she was my friend
friends in dc
what kind of friends
politicians maybe
i dont know

who would invite her
to a big-time party
we found an invitation
made out to her name
now who were some
of her friends honey
i dont know them
personally
publicly maybe
i dont know anything
about that
then she was killed
because of the junk
no believe me

killed honey
i think the man
has a point

i had some beer
o lord i give to you
the soul
of this young woman
a child of god
who always held out
her hand to others
who always gave
and never asked in return
we ask thee
almighty god
to love cloris
as we have loved her
and take her
into your kingdom
the lord is my shepherd
i shall not want
he makes me lie down
in green pastures
excuse me a minute
he leads me
beside still waters
he restores my soul
he leads me in the path
of righteousness
for his name sake
even though i walk
through the valley
of the shadow of death
i fear no evil
for thou art with me
thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me
thou preparest
a table before me
in the presence
of my enemy
thou anointest
my head with oil
my cup overflows
surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me
all the days
of my life

over her shoulder
a camera gadget bag
exactly
jake colt is friday

to do that friday
stealing a hearse
for christ sake
and destroying
public property
and losing a $600 camera
is that your way
of not getting involved
mr riley it was
the man that--
and do you know
what it cost glance
to keep you out of jail
and what it liable
to cost us
if that funeral director
decides to sue
or press charges
there was nothing
else i could do
yeah and my old man
invented the cotton gin
cant you get it under
your skull friday
that your life
is in danger
and that somebody is
trying to kill you
so youre out
of the slammer
i thought i wouldnt see you
until visiting hours
how was the bread
and water
you got something
for me colt
that depending
on whether or not
you didnt spend up
all your money
on lawyers
and bail bondsmen
i might look into
something for you
in washington dc
tomorrow
like what
like a bunch of flowers
sent to cloris boston
funeral from a no-name friend
friday saw it
tell me do you know a fellow
named david lee hart
the senator
cloris boston had
a senator stashed away
sure cloris had quite
a few friends in dc
she would fly down there
for these weekend dates
some brother named
ford malotte set them up
that a coincidence
he the man--
and i use the term loosely--
that im going to see
all right
when do we go
youre not going
anyplace
aw mr riley--
no way
please i got to find out
who killed cloris
i want to know about
this black widow thing
and i want to prove
that she was not dealing
what you really want
is senator hart
to send you
some flowers
for your funeral
here the print
clear as a bell
the blow-up
came out perfect
it him
this is the man that
been trying to kill me
let get
a print of this
to the police
right away
i want this guy
caught
before he catches up
with friday
but monk now you see
why i have to go to dc
friday there
absolutely no damn way
that you or
glance magazine
is going on a manhunt
to washington
and that
the bottom line
you might as well
forget it no way
no way
colt for god sake
friday
couldnt we have
met him on a park bench
why this place
would
the white house lawn
suit you better
mr hawkins
anywhere is better
than this
and besides since
youve brought me here
im beginning to wonder
about you friday
as dracula
dont be afraid
i wont bite you
this is
a public place
youll be all right
yeah but i think
ill need protection
oh jesus
excuse me miss
could you--
could you tell me
where i can find
ford malotte
please
maybe what
your business sweetie
just tell him that
friday foster is here

earlier
ah cloris
a marvelous girl
i mean nobody
nobody
could wear things
the way she could
with a body
put together in heaven
with tender loving hands
and to think that
that simple policeman
would intimate
that i would terminate
such a talented girl
im afraid
that impossible
that a private party
that reception
oh malotte youve
booked dates for cloris
with government vips
and senators
now why cant you
do it for me
but that
was different
she had
that uh touch
friday look malotte
cloris and i
grew up together
we were like sisters
if she can be invited
to this reception so can i
interesting maybe
with the right gown
and a new coiffure
you might pass
for her
but there no way
you know
there is some reason
why you dont want me
at this reception
are you afraid that
black widow might be there
you know
about black widow
friday darling
when you are
fooling around
with ambitious men
like senator hart
it can be hazardous
to your health
take my advice
stay out of it

little woman

with or without
your help mr malotte
i am going to be
at that reception
well suit yourself

assistance whatsoever

ill remember that
charley
hart after
one divorce
and 2 years
in washington
one gets to know
his people
more brandy
more brandy and i might
lose all my inhibitions
maybe worse
look what happened
to cloris
cloris was only a pal
just a friend
so we made it
a few times
but our relationship
was only physical
im really sorry
about what happened
if i could change it
i really would
will you believe me
trust me
then you can start
trusting me
you can tell me
what the hell is going on
ok
find yourself a certain
mr blake tarr
and it will all
come as clear
as monday wash
im told he the man
behind it all
now why would he plan
his own assassination
it all part
of a big power play
to make you believe
it something
it isnt
and what
your power play
are you something
youre not too
now what will
all the gossips say
oh they will probably
say that i made love
to one of the most
beautiful women
dc has ever seen

of yourself arent you
arent you
when i think about it
it just as well
the girl wasnt killed

think so huh

i thought you said
she came from
glance magazine
i did
it seems she came
to washington
and bluffed her way
into the reception
specifically to meet
with senator hart
it seems she tied
the murder of her friend
to the senator
did the senator
tell her anything
no
well that good
isnt it
did she tell the
senator anything
only that shed heard
about black widow
arent you worried
about that charles
that why i think
she can be of use to me
if the senator
will go along
and i think he will
or else ill have to tell him
how those thousands of
contributors to his campaign
is really just
one big contributor--
enos hartman griffith
who is now willing
to go along with me
well by herself
she nothing
but with glance
magazine behind her
she may be able
to help you
flush out blake tarr
the senator has already
put a bug in her ear
he said that blake tarr
is the one that can tell her
about the murder
of her friend cloris
well he certainly
right about that
isnt he charles
blake tarr
is the answer
to all our problems
mr griffith
well that what the
senator said mr riley
his office would
give us full cooperation

a ride
only if you

there wont be
any dead bodies
laying around
now promise
all right i promise
indistinct conversations
madame rena
it friday foster
why do you have to
stir things up
watch out
colt dont let him
get away
youre wrong
about black widow
but senator hart said--
get a pencil and write
what i say to you
if you want
to know the truth
what am i doing here
son of a bitch
aah
rena call this number
when you can
but whose
theyllexplain
youre wrong about
blackwidow
rena rena

well that makes
two for today
because one
of those killers
wont be
hunting you no more
did she say

hello
im friday foster
and im calling
for madame rena
no she cant
come to the phone

building
hello hello
friday hello
is anybody up here
helicopter flying overhead
miss foster
im blake tarr
i dont care who you are
you have got no right
to come up here
and scare me
half to death
look im sorry
but there are
certain precautions
i have to take
rooftops and helicopters
and henchmen
rena was right
youve got guts
what do you know
about rena
she worked for me
it because of her
and malotte
that i came back
to the states
they told me
what was going on
and what is going on
black widow
so senator hart
was right after all
you are behind
black widow
what else did the charming
senator tell you
that you know who killed
my friend cloris
mm-hmm and that
i go around
killing my own people
that i set myself up
to be assassinated
at the airport
come on does that
make sense to you
that hart a clever
son of a--
you know
he got everybody
believing in that
unity scam of his
when in reality
it just a front
a power grab
i think that black widow
is a code name for it
david lee hart huh
rena said you could be
trusted that why im here
this is all a little
confusing you know
ive got to know
the when the what
the way of
hart timetable
all she was able
to find out
was that it had
something to do
with st valentine day
that the day
after tomorrow
right but the question is
will you help me
why would i
because ive asked you
youre quite sure
of yourself arent you
are all black
millionaires like that
probably
it goes with the job
some job
blake i cant say
i dislike it
coming from the ghetto
all the way to the top
was quite a trip
but im curious
about you
there are things
id like to know
like what
like who is friday foster
where she going
who am i
that a funny question
well first
im a woman
second i am
a photographer
and a big sister
to a little brother
who really
a 40-year-old man
chuckles
and umi like
cats and dogs
and horses and men--
but not necessarily
in that order
i make
my own decisions
and im a gemini
that it
well that enough
well as far as
where im going
do you mean now
or in the future
either way
i see that im
going to be
getting
into something
i did not expect
what did you expect
you know
what i expected
i expected
you to be a rat
but youre
different
baby you forget
im straight off the block
i know that what
canceled my theory
you treat a person
like a person
and a woman
like a woman
i try to treat a lady
like a lady

black widow and he--
are you out of your mind

doing here
hart what would
i be doing here

unity concept is his
but the walls of--
the walls of prejudice
of discrimination
of misunderstanding
and hate--
every important black
leader in the country
is here today
were acting together
as one
for the first time
but if youre not
behind black widow

buy us a little time
time for what
david does this make
any sense to you

to destroy black power
what other way than to
get all of our leaders
