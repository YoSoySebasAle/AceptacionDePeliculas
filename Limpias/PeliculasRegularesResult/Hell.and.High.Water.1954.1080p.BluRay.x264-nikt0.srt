
in the summer of 953
it was announced
that an atomic bomb of foreign origin
had been exploded somewhere
outside of the united states
shortly thereafter it was indicated
that this atomic reaction
according to scientific reports
had originated in a remote area
in north pacific waters
somewhere between the northern tip
of the japanese islands
and the arctic circle
this is the story of that explosion
oh
professor montel
im mccleary of the herald tribune
oh yes how do you do
i understand that youre going
to vienna to address the
central european federation
of advanced scientists
that is correct
i will read a paper on the emission
of neutrons and collision of nuclei
thank you professor
will any of the american atomic
energy commission be present
i doubt it
will you excuse me gentlemen
oui
professor excuse me
there one or two points
id like to get clarified
you will have to excuse me gentlemen
the plane is waiting
who the girl
this is the bbc
with the latest news bulletin
professor montel famous nuclear physicist
and atomic scientist
has vanished while en route
to attend a conference in vienna
professor montel disappearance
is a complete mystery to the police
authoritative sources reveal today
that the former nobel prize winner
is the fifth noted scientist believed
to have vanished behind the iron curtain
professor montel was last seen
at the international airport in vienna
speculation as to the whereabouts
of professor montel continues
ten days have elapsed
since the distinguished scientist vanished
and so far police have been unable
to offer any explanation
authorities are now convinced
that professor montel was not kidnapped
and that his disappearance
was part of a prearranged plan
airport officials in vienna
reveal that the scientist
carried a diplomatic passport
the search for professor montel
continues into the fourth week
it is interesting to note that while the
story has been given front-page space
in newspapers in the united states
and all other parts of the free world
pravda the official mouthpiece
of the soviet union
has as yet failed to take note on it
corporal lee stockwell
right
mr r macdougall
that right
mr franklin meredith
that correct
jones
im afraid youre mistaken
my name macdougall
youre a dead ringer for an officer
i used to know in the submarine service
sorry
mr macdougall
yeah
my name is eddy
your instructions
there is a taxi waiting for you
the driver knows the address
taxi number 63
number 63
okay
this is it
you better wait for me
no i go now
wait a minute what if i need you again
where can i find you
what your name
eddy
mr macdougall
yeah
come in please and follow me
watch your step please
now dont tell me your name is eddy too
eddy is the password
im hokada fujimori commander jones
im very pleased to meet you
thanks for a minute there i thought
this was something out of inner sanctum
youve lost a little weight
im on a diet
ill bet captain taylor
put a little fat on
where is he
im sorry to tell you your friend is dead
dead
his plane crashed returning
from an arctic expedition
no one survived
he never did like to fly
why did he want me to come here
what was the 5000 for
it an advance payment
for a job captain taylor
was certain you would do for us
advance
yes
when do i start
without questions
why talk if taylor lined me up
for the job it must be kosher
some people might not
exactly call it kosher
in here please
gentlemen commander jones
mr mcauliff
how do you do sir
colonel schuman
how are you
mr aylesworth
how do you do
and professor montel
montel the scientist
yes
everybody and his brother
is gunning for you professor
they say you skipped
behind the iron curtain
as you can see only a wooden door
glad youre here
thank you sir
well it quite a layout you got here
what kind of business
are you gentlemen in
the business of investigation
the scientific investigation
of these uninhabited north pacific islands
that lie in neutral waters
between the free world
and the iron curtain
our deductions make us believe
that one of these islands
we dont know which one mr jones
has been prepared as an arsenal
for atomic weapons
your friend captain taylor
volunteered
to undertake a photographic mission
to find out
volunteered
yes
for free
for free
is that when he had the accident
it was no accident
his plane was shot down
this photograph we have just printed
came from the camera
of his salvaged plane
thirty years in the navy
and he gets killed for a picture
for free
each man has his own reason
for living mr jones
and his own price for dying
this was captain taylor price
there nothing there professor
it a washout
i wouldnt be too certain
extend these lines
they could be atomic vault constructions
and over here could also be part
of a concrete runway
look look before we go any further
exactly what country do you men represent
we represent many countries
as private individuals
we are scientists
former statesmen businessmen
all volunteers acting independently
for a common cause
against a common enemy
as private individuals
we can conduct this investigation
on a scientific basis
without violating any neutral waters
and if what we suspect is verified
we can then make our findings public
and what good will that do
dont you think the truth
is worth knowing
dont you believe that factual proof
will establish once and for all
both the identity and the intention
of the aggressor
who knows
but where do i fit into the picture
we want you to command a ship
for an inspection tour of these islands
what kind of a ship
a submarine
we know that four times
during world war i i
you commanded a submarine
reconnaissance patrol
in this very area
as i recall you were extremely
successful in these waters
when you fought my country
this time the enemy is different
mr jones but the waters are the same
you received already $5000
20000 in united states currency
will be deposited to your account
in any bank you elect
to chauffeur professor montel
to this island
and another 25000 bonus
when you bring him back safely
with all the information he seeks
what about the sub
did it volunteer too
one does not pick up a first-class
submarine in the junkyard mr jones
we have salvaged a japanese submarine
what class
i-203
sewer pipe had one on my tail once
for six hours taylor look her over
yes
start getting her refitted
yes
armed
mr jones
the object of this mission
is scientific investigation
not combat
professor
am i in command
that right
then we arm the sub
that is if you want me
to get you back in one piece
did you also salvage a crew
we have picked volunteers
experienced men
there will be two scientists on board
professor montel and his assistant
professor gerard
we arent positive which island it is
but a certain freighter the kiang ching
has been up to this area
several times before
with cargos of concrete and heavy metals
she loading again at tientsin
the last time i tailed a freighter
my price was 650 a month
and i had to buy my own uniforms
all right i want my own key men
men whove served with me before
you name them and well get them
like you got me for cash
if it necessary
as i said before mr jones
each man has his own reason for living
and his own price for dying
i hope for all of us
that it will be a bon voyage
giovane help him with the line
giovane you you carpino
give him a hand with the torpedo
how many hands
you think i got neuman
mr neuman to you
now make sure you give me
the reading on that battery
right skipper
come on come on
bring it on boys
bring it around come on
hey come on now
easy now come on
come on come on all right hold
all right boys
make it fast to the cleats
hey
dont you ever take a bath
shut up
shut up
is that the extent of your vocabulary
whatd you ever give up
the wrestling racket for anyway
i just found out it was phony
that the trouble with these
i say that the trouble
with these phony wrestlers dugboat
they never take a bath
we do too
hey joto hey joto
the after valve wont turn
what
the after valve wont turn
no no the other way
everything backwards no wonder you blokes
lost the war with subs like this
skipper
yeah
that guy welles any good
best engineer out of australia
wish we had wilbur
yeah
with charlie wilbur handling
the engines on the bowfin
there was nothing to worry about
hear he a three-striper now
yeah so i hear
skipper
that number two scopes dont work
what the matter with it
cant get the rust out of it
how bout number one
didnt check it
lift her up holter
the professor topside
wants to see the captain
send him down
he part of the brass behind this setup
now if he looks familiar
dont say anything ill explain later
hello professor welcome aboard sir
captain
well were trying to put
this sewer pipe together
with a little spit and a lot of sweat
i guess well make it all right
captain jones
what the matter
is there something wrong
im sorry to say we cannot permit
one of your crew to make this expedition
what do you mean
they were all handpicked
we cannot trust this one
who
the torpedo man revnik
oh one of the men you picked
i could have told you that all the time
a knothead
did you screen all my men too
very closely including you
okay ill get rid of revnik right away
good
holter i want
she the replacement doc
gentlemen this is professor gerard
my assistant and my right arm
hiya
denise this is captain jones
captain jones
glad to know you professor
well if id known about this
id have cut my price
boys these two professors
are going with us as cargo
what
you heard me
have you blown a gasket
nobody takes a female along in a pigboat
look junior you gonna give me
that 2000-year-old navy bilge
that theyre bad luck
take a look at her
what so bad about that
nothing absolutely nothing
theyre all jonahs it traditional
look skipper i made up my mind
count me out
okay
anybody else
ill give you jokers five minutes
to sleep on it and remember
if i have to
i can replace every one of you
captain i do not like it either
oh scusami
perhaps you are right
in your estimation
i am a a female
but first i am a scientist
and a good one
and i am not the only scientist
who is not of your sex
there are many
like dr lise meitner
who played an important part
in the development of the atom bomb
like madame curie who discovered radium
i have grown up in laboratories
all my life i have worked with men
never have i interfered
and never have they resented me
professor montel and i have
have much to accomplish
much
and i shall appreciate it
if you would not let my my presence
be the cause of of a minor mutiny
i like you
i like you all
and i shall try my best
to make you like me
as a scientist
man that was quite a mouthful
for a female
that no female that a scientist
all right come on
we got a lot of work to do let go
hi mr fujimori professor
where your assistant
are you prepared to sail
ill let you know tomorrow
after we make the running dive tests
there no tomorrow left for us
the freighter kiang ching
sailed from tientsin a half hour ago
you must leave right away
what are you talking about
we only been working for two weeks weve
got a lot of work left to do on this tub
you must leave by dark to overtake her
what about the running tests
as an amateur might i suggest
that we try the running test
while we are running
doc there are about a hundred ways
of losing a submarine
youve just come up with one of the best
we havent even checked
the torpedo tubes yet
you know what that means if we have
to call on fish it means were dead
youve got to leave tonight
okay buster youre buying this trip
you want me to chance it
it not what we want captain jones
it what must be done
all right just as long as the professor
here knows what he letting himself in for
weve arranged airplane contact to give you
position on the kiang ching
howll they contact us blinker or radio
neither is without risk
weve decided cork drop is safest
this contains your code
and this contains
your schedule for contacts
oh just one more thing
i want a clear-cut directive
detailing my specific authority
youll find it all in here captain
at sea you are in complete command
on land professor montel is in command
may i wish you the best of luck
thanks
well now as good a time as any
mr neuman
take her down to periscope depth
yes sir
clear the bridge
dive
stand right over there
youll be all right
thank you
professor gerard give me your hand
watch that top rung it murder
thank you
youre welcome
you sit right here
captain trim satisfactory
at periscope depth
very well joto
yes sir
give welles a hand with those starboard
engine blueprint translations will you
ill take care of it captain
everything tight
in the forward torpedo room
were gonna try her down deep
have all stations checked let me know
ay ay captain
this is that test we were
talking about today professor
now
now
dont get nervous if we crack up
you wont get a chance to feel it
take it easy itll be all right
put her on the bottom mr neuman
two degrees down bubble
flood negative
flood negative
oh thanks chin lee
coffee professor
no thanks
how bout you
no thank you
two hundred feet kapitän
better hold on professor
all right now let see
if we can hit the roof
take her up mr neuman
close all main ballast vents
stand by to surface
stand by to surface
surface
surface
blow all main ballasts
blow all main ballasts
what with the air banks holter
the air bank dry
open the emergency banks
put em on the line
they wont open
theyve got to open
weve checked everything
these signs are all fouled up
ill have to try every valve
no wait a minute
joto come to the control room
unsnarl these japanese signs
i can translate it that one reads
open emergency air bank
what
open emergency air bank
go ahead try it
air bank on the line
good thanks
okay put her on the roof
skipper
yeah everything all right carpino
just a few leaks around the
stuffing glands i marked them
okay make a full sweep ski
all clear skipper
rig for red up scope
you better move out professor
this helps get our eyes
used to the dark when we go up
open the hatch holter
you did a good job
translating that sign doc
professor gerard is mol
mol
master of oriental languages
oh très bon très bon
down scope
glad to have you aboard professor
glad to be aboard captain
captain the professor wants to know
if it all right to come up for fresh air
which one
the one with the beard
oh okay
come to course 355
ahead full on both engines
ay ay captain
you wont need your umbrella professor
she a dry boat
it nothing to worry about
almost everybody gets a touch
of claustrophobia first time down
it not claustrophobia captain
it the realization that at last
our mission has begun
if anyone had told me six months ago
that today i would be on a submarine
headed for arctic waters
in search of a secret atomic base
i just cant believe it
yeah i know what you mean
well
what about your assistant professor
what makes a girl who looks like that
get mixed up in science
she comes from a family of scientists
she was a child prodigy
at 4 she entered college
at 8 she studied at göttingen
she is really very brilliant
a child prodigy
with a body by fisher
and this is the greatest pigboat
in the whole submarine service
the uss bowfin
it one we served on together
me the chief gunner
dugboat and the skipper
beautiful aingt she
oh yes very beautiful
you know something else
that very beautiful
all my life ive been wanting
to find a girl called denise
oh ski
im sure you will find her
oh i found her all right
you see i lost no time at all
in learning your first name
yep denise it always been
my favorite name
i i never met a denise
but i always knew i would
you see from the moment i saw you
i said lafayette im here
that right i always knew
id meet a girl called denise
id-e-n-i
dont let him kid you honey
i just seen him put your name on his arm
look
all right bub you asked for it
no
come here you big drunkard

yeah
just roughed up a little
take care of him holter
oh here let me help you professor
thank you
let see

this is the last thing i
i wanted to happen
it had to break out sooner or later
let have another look here
it lucky you still got your teeth
dont get nervous doc
nobody gonna bite you
dont you think that the pharmacist
should treat me if it necessary
he got his hands full
with those two lugs
besides there nothing
he can do that i cant you know
oh my he got you so greasy
okay
you know what a log is
yes
you do
well im supposed to keep a detailed
report of everything that happens
it for mr fujimori
howd it start
i was working on a new formula
when ski asked if he
could show me his chest
show you his chest
yes
oh
and then what
then he removed his shirt
no kidding
he wanted me to see his tattoo
oh no
it was a beautiful tattoo
ill bet it was
beautiful
but the intoxicated one rubbed it off
naturally
tell me he make a pass at you
a pass
did he try to kiss you
yes he did
he did did you coldcock him
what
did you hit him
wait a minute wait a minute
hold the phone hold the phone
now say that in english
i slapped him
you did
tell me
you hit him after he kissed you
yes
not before
i do not understand
well you see professor i just want
to make sure my report is factual
i couldnt put
captain jones
is this report for mr fujimori
or for you
now really a child prodigy oughta
be able to figure that one out
dont you think
yes
yes
au revoir professor
now listen to me
i dont want any more beefs
you understand
if i hear of anybody
making a play for that girl
ill personally shoot him out
through torpedo tube number one
captain is it still a secret
where were going
were tailing a freighter
to an island in the north pacific
gonna sink her
were gonna sneak into this island
take a look and sneak out
this is a scientific expedition
but skipper what are we looking for
four-leaf clovers
well what if the guys on the island
dont like us
look i know youre all
itching for a little action
but youll only get it if we
have to defend ourselves so relax
capitaine jones
le capitaine jones
bonne nuit
bonne nuit
oh good morning
was the water hot enough professor
just wonderful thank you
voulez-vous fume une cigarette
what
im speaking french
oh
voulez-vous fume une cigarette
oh you mean voulez-vous
fumer une cigarette
that what i said
no fumer
foo-may
no no no
you have to form your lips like this
fumer
fumer
fumer
fumer
i think i better go now
thank you
you know someday im gonna
find out what color her eyes are
good morning captain jones
you wanted to see me
why did you let me sleep
through that plane contact
i thought you needed the rest
you were on duty for almost 20 hours
didnt you stop to think
how important that message might be
of course
so i made sure that it was not
by decoding it myself
as you see
it reports only that the kiang ching
has made no change in speed or course
i knew that was of no importance
professor did it ever occur to you
that i might be steering a course to be
youve lost us approximately two hours
im very sorry captain
and i think i have learned something
i hope so
if you want to listen in on conversations
use the intercom it easier
that conversation i would
prefer not to have heard
but i was waiting to see you
okay you see me im busy
many years have i been
with professor montel
but never before have i heard
anyone speak like you
to the greatest scientist in his field
professor montel field isnt commanding
a screwball submarine mine is
if such rudeness is necessary
i hope this will be a very short cruise
whatd you want to see me about
joto
yes sir
in the future when a message
comes in to this boat i get it
no matter who says it unnecessary
you understand
yes sir
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
no no no no
this time he was right
may we come on the bridge
sure help yourself
contact plane
approaching on schedule
good enough
okay charlie
there it is
well this one for you doc
intelligence reports kiang ching carrying
unconventional-type 6 capsule
signed fujimori what a 6 capsule
the charge to explode an a-bomb
hey skipper radar shows
surface object approaching
bearing 355 degrees
speed
cant tell yet but he closing fast
range
3800 yards
maybe the freighter has seen
our signal and comes after us
rig for red
a sub after us
a sub i thought this was
a scientific expedition
it is and were gonna play it safe
no use getting a bloody nose
unless we have to
she submerged and listening for us
that why she stopped pinging
what does this mean
it means she saving her torpedoes
waiting till we surface
just one more day doc
and wed have finished
overhauling those torpedo tubes
can you see her scope
no
well we can play possum too
how the hydrogen
built up to three percent
well we cant chance surfacing here
weve got to make a run for it
professor i think youd both
better stay in your quarters
down scope
theyre still on our stern skipper
how that hydrogen gas
four percent and still building
take her up
okay charlie
you better keep off the bridge professor
im not going up
the skipperd blow his top if he even
found you here in the control room
sit down professor grab some air
thank you
have you identified the submarine
no we havent even seen her yet
theyre topside trying to spot her now
no sign of her yet skipper
sonar tells us she not far
alert the gun crew
what
i know were not looking for trouble
but wed be fools
not to protect ourselves
alert for battle stations
gun crew stand by to man the deck gun
what about these torpedoes
you know those tubes havent been checked
forget the torpedoes
where is she now joto
range 500
either she moving out
or she gonna surface
there she is skipper
theyre coming out on deck
ask them where we are charlie
why not man the five-incher now
no
the minute they spot a crew near that gun
theyll throw torpedoes at us
what are they saying
they want to know who we are
and what were doing here
tell em were a private scientific
expedition headed for the arctic
they insist on boarding us
well keep stalling
tell em we dont understand
ask them to repeat the message
put one over our bow
keep asking them to repeat charlie
turn our nose into her steer 00
and get ready to man that gun
keep clear of the lifeline
right full rudder
torpedo
clear the deck clear the deck
dive
close the hatch
my hand my hand
my hand
give me a knife
no no no
my hand
no
here
how is he how is he
it his thumb
all right get em all below
hey you guys come on up here
give me a hand quick
we ship too much water cant hold her up
get the angle off
and let her settle to the bottom
all back full
enemy torpedo fired
number two fish
out of their basket
secure all running machinery
remain silent
bilge pump motor flooded skipper
form a bucket line
dump the water in the engine room bilges
that tub laying for us skipper
she coming real close
i lost her
nothing out of her now no sound
what do you think skipper
i think she pulling
the same trick we are
now watch that salt water
we dont want any chlorine gas in the boat
hold it
captain this hot heat is killing us
we got to turn on the fans
if they heard our fans you wouldnt have
to worry about the heat killing you boy
all right ill fill in the picture
for you quick
we got torpedoes but our tubes
arent in condition to fire em
and the red sub parked
on the bottom like we are
waiting to pick us up on sonar
once she does
shell throw more fish at us
so it a question of who can hold out
longer without air the reds or us
if we break first chances are
itll be our last break
and were loaded with hydrogen
were liable to explode
but we got one thing in our favor
we can save oxygen by shutting up
that all
nothing
nothing
we gotta save juice
shift to red
keep your ears open ski
i am sorry captain for being so stupid
that all right save your breath
you had to use the knife
if you didnt close the hatch
we would all be dead
youre beat
you better get back to your bunk
and take it easy come on
i want to tell you how
dont talk
skipper
he in a bad way
i thought that hypo was gonna do the trick but
he suffering from shock and loss of blood
if he dont get some air right away youre
gonna have only one professor for cargo
there 50 grand in that bunk
fifty grand is worth a little air
joto turn on the white lights
boys im gonna try a long shot
if her first couple of torpedoes
miss us we got a chance
id rather pass out without air than have
a torpedo come plowing through us
now when we start the pump
were liable to get a spark
maybe itll burn off the hydrogen
maybe it wont
if it doesnt
well blow up so fast
youll never feel it
good luck to all of us
you got everything straight
yes sir
now here where we find out
if weve lived right
no more chance of explosion
pass the word along
and build up the turns slowly
hold down the noise
yes sir
all ahead one-third

bonne chance
i dont understand
our intelligence report
cannot be this wrong
all we are getting is a normal count
you ought to be happy
dont misunderstand
nothing would please me more than
to know that our suspicions are unfounded
then let move out
there nothing here but this two-bit
garrison and some beat-up storage tanks
it a great pity i cannot talk to them
we are worlds apart
but after all they are human

this is wonderful
you want to see me professor
yes
denise has just translated his orders
his name is sin he a pilot en route
to kevlock island for special duty
so what
kevlock must be the island
captain taylor photographed
well how do you figure that
an air force pilot would hardly be assigned
to duty on an island without an airstrip
and as you know kevlock is the only island
indicated by name in this entire chain
it appears to be due north
of our present position
and what do you suggest we do about it
it seems to me our course is obvious
not in my book doc
what do you mean
i mean you said once that each man
got his own reason for living
and his own price for dying
well my reason for living is 50 grand
im not sticking my neck out again
is one neck that important captain
it is when it mine
what kind of man are you
hold it hold it
let not gang up
with a lot of double-talk
im a businessman
maybe to a couple of flag-wavers like you
im a mercenary all right
but i lived up to my part of the contract
the deal was to tail
the freighter to the island
put you ashore and get you back to tokyo
nobody said anything
about a second island
so as far as im concerned
mission completed were going home
any objections
yes
i hate to use authority
but if i have to i will
i didnt want it to come to this
but as long as you have
mentioned the contract
study it closely captain
you will find a paragraph stating that i
and i alone
shall determine when
the mission is finished
and in my book captain
the mission will be finished
after i am taken to kevlock
given the chance to examine the island
and returned to tokyo
joto
yes sir
head due north
did you say north
you heard me
set a new course for kevlock island
it on your chart
yes sir
okay doc let go
what the matter
my knee
i thought you said it was okay this morning
it was
ill manage in a few moments
not a chance youd just be in the way
it will improve by tomorrow im sure of it
sorry doc
were not hanging around these waters
that long this is a powder keg
wait wait a minute wait a minute what
going on what are you talking about
captain jones
my assistant will accompany you
what
she has sufficient training
to compute figures
determine strength and identify elements
if there are any on this island
you mean youd youd let her go
with the exception of me
professor gerard
is the only member of this expedition
capable of performing this task
oh youre both crazy
you will take her ashore
and follow her instructions
as you would have followed mine
she is not going and that final
you still cannot take an order
can you captain jones
and what behind that crack
exactly what you think is behind it
ski you stay here keep your eyes open
what about her
i could carry her equipment
she can take care of her own equipment
take a look down there
looks like a bunch of doors
im afraid we have found
what we are looking for
a geiger counter reaction like this
can mean only one thing
these figures
what are they saying
they are looking for lumfong
a missing soldier
we gotta stay put
till they move out come on
what did you mean when you said
i still cant take an order
your record captain
in the war you were a very good officer
except for one thing
go on im fascinated
you could give orders
but you couldnt take them
now look i
i know what youre talking about
but if you want to know
what makes a guy tick
youve got to look beyond the record
those philippine guerrillas
were cut off and surrounded
they had to have ammunition and supplies
i couldnt just sit there
on my can and let em die
i knew the waters were mined
but i figured i could get in
get out without a scratch
so i wrote my own orders
i lost my sub and 26 men
and if i had to id do it again
im sorry
very sorry
it was wrong of me even to mention it
forget it it all over
you all right
fine
when this is over if we get back
what gives with you
gives
i mean what are you gonna do
go back to paris i suppose
paris is my home
yeah
and you
when this is over what gives with you
i dont know
have you ever been in paris
no never
you would love it
americans always do
well we cant stay here
if they hold us up till morning
we might never get back
im gonna see if there
another way out of here come on
you stay here ill be right back
here
you wont need this but sometimes
the sight of it a comfort
ill be back in a minute
lumfong
lumfong
denise
give me that come on
let get out of here
come on
hurry up come on
come on
let go
this confirms our worst fears
the atomic reaction is unmistakable
i dont get it
i mean i cant figure out
why that bomber was on the runway
what would a b-29
be doing on a red air base
it just doesnt make sense
say didnt you tell me
that that red officer
we picked up on the other island
was in the air force
yes a major
were you ever able to question him
impossible
i tried but he would not say a word
oh
oh thanks
hey did you talk to that
chinese prisoner chin lee
he has not seen the prisoner
the prisoner has not seen him
holter dig up that portable microphone
and plant it in the torpedo room
then get the prisoner and lock him in there
make sure he doesnt see the microphone
right
give him a hand ski
come on let get into some dry clothes
we got work to do
you have a plan
im gonna find out what this is all about
come on chin lee
we got a job for you let go
you guys got everything set
yep
okay
now youre sure chin lee understands
exactly what he supposed to say
whatd he say
he says he would do anything for you
he wants you to strike him in the face
to make it look more real
holter
he wants you to do it
he says it will not hurt if you do it
you all right boy you okay
what he saying
he says
the prisoner is very intelligent
and must be fooled
he wants you to hit him harder
im sorry pal
all right get him out let go
here come on take em
this is incredible
what it all about skipper
this is the screwball plot of all time
theyre gonna drop an atomic bomb
on korea or manchuria and blame it on us
theyre taking off tomorrow at dawn
in that made-over bomber
he found him out
now listen to me
im shoving off for the island alone
ill park myself right here
around the mouth of this cave
youll submerge half a mile
beyond the runway right around here
so youll be able to spot my signal
now a heavy load of fuel
gonna bring that bomber out low
so when i give you the signal
two short two long two short
thatll mean the plane taking off
thatll give you just time
enough to surface and fire
i want every gun in action
that means everybody
that plane has to be
knocked out of the sky
now the minute you hit it
crash dive to the bottom and stay there
because everything gonna break loose
when that bomber hits
there a cove at the north end
right here that where ill hide
tomorrow night at 000 sharp
ill give you three short blinkers
pick me up
if i dont show up
shove off head for home
any questions
i forbid this insanity
forbid all you want to professor
that plane is not gonna make it
it is dreadful enough to bring back
the terrifying report
that our suspicions are confirmed
but we cannot take it upon ourselves
to commit an act of war
no matter how we feel
we are civilians
i am responsible for this expedition
i order you to take this submarine
back to tokyo
i dont care about you
and your expedition
there an enemy bomber out there
made up to look like an american bomber
it gonna drop the biggest egg in history
and were gonna take the rap for it
i dont like that
so from now on professor
this is my expedition
skipper
the boat gone
what
the boat gone montel took it
well why didnt you stop him
we didnt get the chance
he was on deck with her before we knew
what happened he was in the boat and gone
where the girl
on the bridge
please he doesnt want you to stop him
why didnt you stop him
all you had to do was yell
he knows your plan
hell carry it out that his orders
that the trouble with you geniuses
full of big ideas
now youre fouling up the whole works
you know that island crawling with soldiers
he knows that too
then whyd you let a nice old guy like that
take a shortcut to the cemetery
he no ordinary two-bit professor
you know
he montel top man in his field
but he old and helpless doesnt
know his way outside of a test tube
you oughta know that
you work close enough with him
what kind of a woman are you
stop
havent you got any feelings
stop
he my father
what
my father
oh im sorry denise
im sorry forgive me
he said it was his place to go
not yours
im sorry
she sure got a lot of guts
only thing i cant figure out
is why the big mystery
why didnt she let us know
he her old man
well that what you have to pay
for having a famous father
she been on a spot all her life
wanted to make good
on her own and she did
and he was proud because she did
any sign of him at all
no not yet
there he is
and there his signal
battle surface gun action down scope
youd better get below
please
okay
all right ski let go
come on willie joto get up here
hurry it up hurry it up
fire
you all right
oh
the bomb must have gone off under us
bring her back on course
take her up to periscope depth
periscope depth
all compartments
report damage and casualties
the bomber didnt crash in the ocean
it hit the island
head for home
each man
has his own reason for living mr jones
and his own price for dying
