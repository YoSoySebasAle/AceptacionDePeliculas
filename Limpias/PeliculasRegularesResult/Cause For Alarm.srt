this is where i live
im a housewife
my name is ellen jones
that tuesday in july started out
just like any other day
the past few months
there was no warning it was to be
the most terrifying day of my life
i remember thinking how tired i felt
even the housework seemed drudgery
so meaningless with
george confined to his bed
no-one to see or care even
and then i got scared
because i knew i was beginning
to feel sorry for myself
george was the one who was ill
and he needed all of my
thoughts and attention
and above all my cheerfulness
i tried not to think about us
about george
how he had changed
i told myself it was
just my imagination
that things would be different
when he was well and strong again
then i thought i heard him call
george did you call
george are you alright
yes ellen
do you want anything
not now ive just begun work on
an insurance report for the office
well call me dear if you need me
okay
somehow i had an odd feeling
there was something
about george voice
i found myself thinking
about the first time we met
how different he was in those days
i remember i was sitting
in dr grahame office
we were talking
i played one game of checkers
and two games of rummy
and ive written letters to a wife
a mother and a sweetheart
and i listened for half an hour to a
homesick young ensign from texas
he was awful cute
now what else can i do to help
boost the morale around here
you could go out to dinner with me
wed get half way through the soup
and youd get a call from the hospital
youre right
uhuh
i guess my courting will have
to wait until after the hostilities
there a compound fracture down
the hall who waiting to see me
but ill be tied up for a while
oh
they tell me he feeling blue you see
his wife is expecting a baby any minute
i think he can stand some cheering up
it practically done
see you later rann
im sorry they told me i
could find dr grahame in here
he ought to be along any minute
why dont you come on in
thank you
are you a patient here sir
in a naval hospital no no
im just a friend of the doc
i flew in last night with
the ferry command
the only thing wrong with me
is a double-barrelled hangover
dr graham will be detained so
im taking you for an airing
maybe he doesnt want
to go for an airing
he doesnt
there nothing a woman likes
better than shoving a man around
hello
hey
who are you
im ellen brown
doesnt suit you at all
it much too plain
im sorry id tell my parents about it
but they are still back in kansas city
now what can i do for you young man
i can think of a lot of things
oh
well shall we begin
with a game of cards
uhuh
well i could read the newspaper to you
i could write a letter for you
i know
i know ill sit right here
and you can tell me about that
wonderful baby you are expecting
huh
the baby you are expecting
does ripley know about this
i beg your pardon
skip it
which is your bad leg
well neither one of them
is working very well today
oh my head
is your head bothering you
terribly
both of them
would you like me to rub it for you
i couldnt think of anything nicer
here
now relax
close your eyes
now just think of something pleasant
pretty soon youll be going
home to your wife
wont that be wonderful
hmm
think what she looks like
how pretty she is
lovely
beautiful blue eyes
a short nose
soft brown hair
and lovely kissable lips
whoa there is nothing wrong
with your morale young man
ill recommend to the doctor that you
be sent home to your wife immediately
hey wait a minute
you are all dressed
naturally
george
hello ranney
son of a gun what are you doing here
enjoying myself immensely
his leg isnt even broken
hey doc what kind of nurses do
you have around here anyway
what goes on here ellen
when i came in here he was
lying there all covered up
he let me make an
absolute idiot of myself
rubbing his head both of them
the best cure in the
world for a hangover
ellen this is george jones an old
and untrustworthy friend of mine
now remember i saw her first
george jones
the name suits you perfectly
completely undistinguished
i wouldnt say that honey
some day you might wind up wearing it
well
shall we go
she cute
it pretty depressing have a
medical student for a room-mate
oh
he is always dissecting
something including me
you got to know what going on inside
if you expect to understand the outside
excuse me sir but you are wanted at
the hospital there is an emergency
oh rann im sorry
so am i
well back to the salt mines
see you folks later
not if i can help it
i intend to keep you to myself
for the rest of the afternoon
oh
and for the next two weeks
so
when a lonely prospector strikes gold
he doesnt yell for his friend
until he stakes a claim
how about some lunch
yes id love it
i dont like to make love
on an empty stomach
no neither do i
especially to a perfect stranger
why ellen wherever did you
get the idea that i was perfect
you
would you like to switch boxes
like we did when we were kids
naturally
youll love it
fried chicken potato salad
tomatoes cookies
k-rations canned ham
powdered milk chewing gum
and four cigarettes
coffee
so measly is that the best you can do
the best i can do with no ration card
oh
now if we were to combine forces
and pool our resources
i think we might do very well together
there we go
goodbye george and good luck
thanks for having me
goodbye darling
take care of yourself
ill be back honey
remember that ill be back
of course of course
and ill never let you go
goodbye darling
quite a guy
yeah quite a guy
im going to marry him rann
im going to marry him just
as soon as he gets back
i figured as much
are you sure he is right for you ellen
i dont know
it isnt something you think about
it just something you feel
you know
you cant do anything about it
i know what you mean ellen
a guy with wings has it all over us
fellows who walk around down here
im coming up now dear
do you want me to bring you anything
no
you alright
what is it what the matter
get a doctor
no no not that get a doctor
another doctor not grahame
but i have to dear he is your doctor
dont argue with me
dont call grahame get another doctor
yes alright
he didnt want the medicine
but i made him take it
good girl
still ticking
sounds pretty good
youre evidently feeling
better that when ellen called
what time is it
five after nine dear
it took you a long
time to get here ranney
i know it seems like it but he
came just as soon as i called him
how long did it take
about twenty minutes
fortunately ellen caught me
as i was leaving on another call
is there some alcohol about
yes
twenty minutes
i got that pain over forty-five
minutes ago why did you delay
i didnt dear
i lost a lot of time trying
to get another doctor
but you needed him so badly that
you know best
you always know best
nowadays dont you ellen
no it isnt that
i just knew that he would come
sooner than anyone else
he our friend george
youre much better already
ranney let not kid each other
we both know it my own insurance
company wouldnt put a nickel on me
now look here all of us
are in that same boat
an automobile taking an unexpected turn
a brick falling from a high building
a heart condition like yours
theyre all hazards but that doesnt
necessarily mean theyll never happen
think of all the chances
you took during the war
you didnt worry about them
you came out feeling better
than when you went in
now the only thing you have to do is lie
in bed and let us help you get well
isnt that right ellen
yes that what i keep telling him
you are lucky in many ways george
you have a wonderful wife
she developed into a fine nurse
i dont think ill be tying up her
exclusive services much longer
you must cut out this way of thinking
yeah i know i know
would you mind ellen
id like to talk to george alone
no of course not
ill be across the hall if you need me
those were pretty morbid things
you were saying in front of ellen
has she complained
certainly not
but you got to think of her too
she is looking a little worn
now when you get these ideas
try using a little mental therapy
next youll be telling me
i ought to see a psychiatrist
that might be a very good idea
you doctors are all alike
if you cant cure a patient
you tell him it all in his mind
im trying to help you george
you know that
ill drop in again this afternoon
maybe we can talk this thing out
yeah maybe we can
ellen
yes
ellen did anything particular happen
to upset george this morning
no not that i know of
why do you think he worse
frankly i dont like his mental state
i think maybe it just the hot weather
it depresses him
he been a very active man it
natural for him to be depressed but
yes
when a man is at a low ebb
mentally and physically
he prone all sorts of imaginary fears
yes i know
id feel better if he were
in hospital for a while
no no i dont think so
you want what best
for george dont you
well of course that just it
i think it would upset him terribly
you see he doesnt seem to want
anyone else around him except me
well this morning he didnt
even want me to call you
it isnt that he is disloyal rann
or he lost confidence but
lately he seems to have taken
these sudden dislikes to people
look ellen
you and george arent just
patients you are friends
george is up there
brooding and i dont like it
it could develop into something serious
if you wont send him to the hospital i
want you have someone here to help you
im sure you know what best rann
but honestly i dont know
how george will take it
he doesnt even seem to want
his aunt around anymore
ellen i dont think it is wise for you
to try to handle this alone any longer
youre stressed to the
breaking point already
ill take it up with
george this afternoon
id better get back upstairs
no ellen
let him relax for a while
alright
give the medicine a chance to work
yeah
i want you to relax too
remember now you can call
me any time you need me
even if you just think you need me
oh thanks
i dont know what id do sometimes
if i didnt remember that
goodbye
goodbye
youre doing fine
thanks
stay where you are dont move
oh you frightened me

yes
say what are you all dressed up for
and where did you get
that beautiful new tricycle

i should say hoppy
let me change your pillow
you know the boy i told you about
who just moved in to the neighborhood
the one with the glasses you know
he an awful sweet little kid
what were you talking
to ranney graham about
that what im interested in
we were talking about you dear
he thinks you worry too
much about yourself
if i didnt i dont know who would
george
ever since you got out of bed
yesterday to see if you could walk
ive had it on my mind
i want you to promise me not get out
of bed again while im out of the room
alright ellen
did you
call the druggist about getting
the heat prescription filled
yes dear he said hed send
it up here later in the day
but there is enough there
if we need it before
did you tell them id spilled it
no i didnt do you feel
well enough for the paper
yeah
the editorial page
no just the front page
is alright thank you
here it is
you look tired ellen
im not
it just that it is so hot today
what are you thinking about ellen
well you know i was
i was just thinking that
everything in our lives
every breath every though
has been for ourselves
i dont think people can
do that and be happy
do you
youre getting a little
confused darling
it was me that ranney grahame
told to change my way of thinking
oh no i mean it was my fault too
i
i just wasnt strong enough to help you
but we could change all that now
it could make all the difference
in the world george
come here ellen
yes
what is the first thing you do
when
when i am out of this bed again
away from the house
ill just be so grateful
that you are well
i think i would
try to do something for somebody
i mean you
for your own self
id like children
yeah
and then id like a garden
a real garden
like the woman next door has
and id find out about
flowers and things
id compare notes with every
other woman on the block
so youd have a garden
and children huh
yes
isnt it good to plan again
it kinda gives you something
to hold on to doesnt it
oh my it takes a long time
for things to sink in doesnt it
you always said that you said make a
plan for anything and then stick to it
alright
alright our plan now
is for you to get well
and then afterwards
you must think im very stupid
stupid
dont you think i know
youre in love with him
in love with whom
grahame
why that the silliest
thing i ever heard of
you are not as subtle as
you think you are ellen
it quite obvious
at first i thought it was
just an infatuation
but now i realize it is more serious
serious in the way that my life is more
in danger from your heart than mine
george what are you talking about
i almost feel sorry for you ellen
he overrated you ellen
just as he underrated me
you havent the courage on the
intelligence he thinks you have
please dont talk like that
you suppose i dont know he told you to
rake over these old coals this morning
no he didnt
you convinced me i was a failure
by making me impossible promises
i know something about my own sickness
i know what happens to a man
when you take away his self-respect
i know what happens when
you constantly upset me
george this is wrong i know it is
please dont upset yourself any more
that what he told you to do isnt it
did he also tell you to delay getting
help to me like you did this morning
how could you do that ellen
how can you take a man of
second-rate intelligence like that
ill do anything you say
get another doctor
you didnt know what you
were in for did you ellen
please dont talk anymore
rest darling
oh george you just couldnt believe
those things you said about dr grahame
i dont even want to hear his name
leave it half way up ellen
i was so hurt i could
hardly keep from crying
again i reminded myself that george
was terribly ill and didnt mean it
i knew i had to keep doing
something anything
anything to keep me from
hearing george words
he didnt mean them
he couldnt mean them
it was his illness the heat
but when i took his lunch up to him
id be pleasant and cheerful
as if nothing had happened
hey
oh hi hoppy
shush
what the matter
you dont have to whisper now
he is awake
im just fixing his lunch
you come for your cookies

but ive already had my lunch

i want to thank you very
much for giving it to me
mummy says television is
good for when you are sick
daddy says it makes him sick

he cant go outside
well that is very nice of you but
i dont think he is well
enough to see people dear

i cant get leave bed in my condition
dear the postman said
he saw you at the window

well no he didnt
actually say he saw you
the postman has got
a touch of sunstroke
yeah me too i guess
that hot wind certainly
doesnt help much
you finished
yes very nice thank you
im glad you got that letter off
come over here ellen and sit down
would you like your aunt clara to
come up and visit for a little while
it pretty hot for the old girl
shed love it if you ask for her
you are the apple of her eye you know
i always was
you know
aunt clara gave me a
toy when i was a kid
a toy i was crazy about
my mother used to say she gave me too
much but i can still remember that toy
it was a
it was a bottle with a small absolutely
perfect sailing ship built inside of it
you know i was
i was so crazy about that toy i
wouldnt let anybody touch it
no
not even my mother
one day i was making a  garden
making a garden in the back yard
and a neighbor boy came running out
of my house with my ship in his hand
somehow i
got it away from him
without breaking it
i dont know what i said to him but
he looked awfully scared and white
and then i was frightened too thinking
he may have broken it the ship i mean
i picked up the little rake i had been
playing with and hit him with it
and where his face had been
so white it was all blood
i think i might have killed him
if mother hadnt come out
she took him in the house
to the bathroom and washed his face
they were both so excited but i felt
safe now i had my own little ship again
and when the neighbor boy stopped crying
mother turned to me and she said
give it to him
she sounded so strange
and quiet i knew i had to
he held out his hand i could see
he hadnt learned anything so i
i handed him the ship but just
as he was about to take it
i let it drop on the tiled
floor and i stepped on it
hed never have known what it was
but somehow or other it was mine
mine more than it had ever been before
i remembered every little
perfect thing about that ship
but to them it was just a mess of broken
glass and matchsticks on the floor
ellen
you know who that
neighbor boy looked like
he looked very much like grahame
and your dr grahame will find himself
in the same position as that little boy
but we are not going
to have him here again
but that doesnt change the fact youre
wrong about him he been fine to you
so thoughtful and given
you so much time
maybe that is because he
is a bachelor no home life
he been a good friend to us
our time is limited so
you must listen carefully
ranney grahame may have you alright
hell be disappointed with what he gets
george please
george i cant let you
talk this way anymore
ill fill this up
ill be downstairs if you want me
youd better wait ellen
ive written to the district attorney
asking him to make a full investigation
if anything happens to me today
before he can get help to me
why do you torture yourself like this
why do you imagine
things that dont exist
that letter exists
it proves you are trying to kill me
but im not
im not
if i cant help you george then i am
going to get someone else in who can
it not me that needs help now ellen
you gave that letter to the postman
yourself just a while ago
yes yes i gave him the letter the one
that you wrote about insurance policies
i knew you wouldnt recognise the
district attorney name if you saw it
nobody ever does isnt that strange
everybody knows he the district
attorney but nobody ever knows his name
we are going to get someone else in
another doctor
because this is all in your mind
my mind is fine
to reassure you on the point let say to
you that letter was about insurance
i told the district attorney how much
insurance we had on each other lives
if either of us died the other would
do very nicely for the rest of his life
or her life very comfortably indeed
oh
i also told them how you and
dr grahame how you
working together to aggravate my
condition so it wont look like murder
george
i also told him how you are
gradually giving me overdoses
of the heart medicine
but that isnt true
anyone would know that isnt true
would they
why is that bottle almost empty huh
we only got it the other day
well you
you told me you spilled it on the tray
you told me that yourself george
you didnt tell the druggist that
mr philips will make an excellent
witness against you ellen
hell be the first if anything happens
to me and let me say there are others
the letter takes care of everything
the druggist the medicine
the doctor he in it too
you have implicated your
old friend grahame you know
nothing is going to happen to you
i dont know if you are
doing this to frighten me
but im going to get the letter
back from the postman
you are not going
anyplace anymore ellen
because i am going to kill you
i decided that definitely this morning
you cant
you couldnt mean this george
you couldnt
george you know i
wouldnt hurt anybody
anybody much less you
george think it me

but you did want to be rid of me
it was in your mind that why
you feel so guilty isnt it
no
the letter will take care of grahame
i will take care of you myself
ill make it look like self-defence
please dont
there are just too many
things against you ellen
you used to say that you were
lonesome until you met me
george
george you love me
no ellen
i love you george
since ive been sick
since he been coming to the
house youve hated the sight of me
no i havent

no
it was one of those awful dreams
the kind i used to have
when george was overseas
that man lying there was george
my husband
he was dead
he died trying to kill me
telephone
telephone
hello  hello
hello
yes
mrs jones
yes who is it
mr philips down at the drugstore
what is it that you want mr philips
it about that heart
medicine you want refilled
yes
i cant refill it without
another prescription
i see
well just let it go
let it go
that is until i talk with dr grahame
oh
by the way according to my records you
got prescription filled the other day
but my husband knocked that bottle
over on the tray and spilled it
oh
you didnt tell me that
when you called before
but that what happened i promise you
that what happened mr philips
alright alright mrs jones
you dont have to promise anything
i didnt tell you before as i
didnt think it was necessary
you mean it wasnt
look here mrs jones
george said the mr philips would
be a witness against me
a witness
ill see that you get
another prescription
yes you just get in
touch with dr grahame
why didnt i tell him about george
the letter
i had to get that letter back
i couldnt tell anyone about
george until i got that letter back
i could feel the woman
next door watching
maybe shed be a
witness against me too
she could tell them how
i ran out of the house
and then back in again
how strangely i was acting
it wouldnt matter what she thought
if i could only get that letter back
then i tried to think
which way did he go
what that for tex
who knows
the engine needs everything
we can put in it
yeah but what will it do
who cares
pardon me
can you tell me did the
postman go by here yet
the postman
yeah
that old oddball found his way
through here a little while ago
oh which way did he go do you know
thataway
oh thanks
the way toward merritt street you know
yeah i know
oh im sorry
you know every time i go home
at night i always tell my wife laura
if it wasnt for that pension
plan i do id just never get up
id just drop in my tracks one of
these days and that would settle it
and id just never get up
anymore and that all
you know how it is
hello mr carson
see you later joe
see you later
well moss jones what are
you doing out this way
i was visiting a friend
oh that nice
i wish i had more time for visitors
but by the time i get home at night i
can just hardly make it up the stairs
mr carston remember that
letter i gave you this morning
i suppose so i pick up plenty
of letters why what about it
well i know it seems silly but i
i mailed it by mistake
it wasnt even finished yes
what did you do that for
i dont know i guess
i was just so busy i
finish it up and mail the rest tomorrow
theyll get it in two instalments
you wouldnt want me to do that
may i have the letter please
so i pick them up and carry them around
for miles and then they want them back
well im sorry but you
can understand why
i wouldnt want it to go out unfinished
yeah i guess so
but all these delays count keep me
on my feet longer than i ought to
it wont be much trouble will it
here here it is
thank you
now look you shouldnt have given
me this letter in the first place
why
giving me this letter is just
like putting it in a mailbox
now you wouldnt expect to get this
back from the mailbox would you
no but surely you can make
this exception after all i
isnt this fellow the district attorney
yes
yes my husband read about
some graft in the newspaper
and wrote to the district
attorney about it
oh your husband wrote the letter
yes
i thought you said you wrote it
well what the difference
he is my husband
it makes all the difference
in the world mrs jones
but why
it one of our strictest rules
we cant return a letter to anyone
except the person who wrote it
but mr carston my husband
is sick you know that
and he sent me to get the letter back
yes i know that
dont be so obstinate
you know it alright
he sick give it to me
obstinate now how do you like that
after standing here patiently in all
this heat trying to reason with you
you are the one being obstinate and
dont realise it against the rules
what do you care if
it against the rules
i have to care but you dont
you are not the one whod get fired
im sorry
im very sorry mr carston
i forgot what it means to you
your responsibility
it must be this terrible heat
please
i know how anxious my husband
is to get that letter back
it was my fault you see
i mailed it by mistake
he awfully with me he is
very angry with me mr carston
couldnt you please help me
couldnt i please have the letter back
well i tell you what ill do
yes
im all through with the route
until this afternoon delivery
since it is so important like you say
oh it is
if you give me a lift to town in your
car so i wont lose any more time
i will
ill go to your house with you now and
give the letter to mr jones personally
no you cant
but mrs jones
this way ill be sticking to the rules
and your husband gets his letter back
but my husband didnt sleep last night
and he fell asleep just before i left
and i wouldnt want to wake him
im trying to do the right thing
by everybody concerned
it seems you cannot cooperate im not
risking losing my job for anybody
try to understand
i cant talk about it any longer
i cant waste more time
do you want me to take the letter to
your husband personally or dont you
no
alright then ill take it to the
post office like im supposed to
you can go down there and
get it from the superintendent
superintendent
yeah
he has more authority than i have
maybe hell give it to you
i see
youd better not waste any more time
once i bring the mail in
they send it out right quick
once it leaves the post office
for delivery nobody can stop it
the post office downtown
yep
thanks oh mr carston

about 230 maybe a little over 4
thank you
ellen
ellen
pardon me
yes
have you seen mrs jones this morning
yes she went out about a half hour ago
went out
yes
but what about george mr jones
she hasnt gone off and
left him alone has she
well
her husband is sick you know
so ive heard
if course i never really met them
though i havent lived here long
i cant imagine her going off like that
im mr jones aunt i made him some
jelly consomm i packed it in ice
it melting
i never dreamt i wouldnt get in
i could tell you where the key is
key
perhaps you think it nosy but i did
see her when she locked the door
well isnt that good of you
the front door
yes
right over there above the door
thank you
i dont know how you stand
it in the sun without a hat on
you might dry up like a prune
the top of the green shutter
the far side of the door
ive found it
if there is anything i can
do for you just call me
you are very kind thank you
aunt clara
ellen where on earth have you been
have you been upstairs
i was just going up
why are you so out of breath
why
ive been running
running in all this heat
you should have more sense
how did you get in aunt clara
i found the key on the ledge
there look at that
slipped right down my dress
now it ruined
i was worried half to death
i thought something had happened
ive never known you
to go out like this
how is george
he alright
i even rang the bell just a jab
did he take one of those sedatives
yes
people take too much medicine
nowadays if you ask me
when i was a girl we
had homeopathic doctors
i wonder what happened to them
anyway they gave very little medicine
and it all tasted good even the tonics
and no promises at all
ellen ive never seen you
look so tired and worn out
why not ask that doctor
to give you something
im alright
he looks too young to
me to be a good doctor
but after all if you and
george like him so much
confidence is half the battle
you look awful peaky
ellen you are not letting
yourself go are you
no i know i look terrible
look when george fell asleep i
i had some errands to do
ill get you some
i just thought i would go and
take care of them without
bothering to change
you know how it is
sure you are alright
yes
why not go upstairs and lie down for a
bit take a snooze it will do you good
im not tired really im not
well after all
clara i have so much to do today
do sit down ellen
lean back relax
youll be on your back before you
know it if you dont watch out
after all all i want to do is to help
from now on im going
to have more time too
ellen i forgot to tell you
i resigned
resigned
from the helper guild after fifteen
years im not helping anymore
i will
ill leave the kitchen door open and we
can talk as i clean out there alright
you might as well youre so fidgety
oh ellen while you are on your
feet will you bring me a dishcloth
for fifteen years i was in that guild
and for the past five i was treasurer
and for the last three they were
promising me the presidency
so what happens
last tuesday they elect paula comstock
you know zachary wife
well i was furious
zachary said i was hasty
but after fifteen years
you know ive never known
a small woman yet
who wasnt always boasting about
her little hands and tiny feet
and trying to run everything
that the best i can do
do you think i was right
fifteen years after all
zachary was upset he says i
need lots of outside activity lots
and i agreed with him
i thought if she
didnt stop id scream
i always tell him he plays
too much at his age
that just one of the worries of
being married to an older man
ellen why dont you have
some of that jelly consomm
at least it was jelly when i left home
try it it tasty and full of vitamins
id like someone to enjoy it
after all it ruined my dress
i think ill run up
and pop in on george
if he is asleep you can tell
him later that i peeped in
aunt clara aunt clara
what is it darling
there is something i must tell you
what is it dear what is the matter
i
are you having trouble
yes
i didnt want to tell you
but now i think i must
dont
take my advice and dont you will
only be sorry later that you did
i thought it was funny
you being out like that
and not going up to see
george when you came in
but you dont understand
oh yes i understand
ill just say goodbye to him
no please dont
i didnt want to tell you this but
george said that the last time you came
to see him you upset him terribly
and he said to tell you that if you came
again today to tell you that he just
couldnt see you
upset him
you must remember he is ill
upset him
ive a good mind to tell him something
no please
no i wouldnt think
of humiliating myself
he knew i was here all the time
well he was rude and selfish
even before he was sick
and he is rude and selfish
since he been sick
sorry i had to tell you this
i thought when i first met you youd do
something for him change him somehow
but i must say he hasnt changed at all
he is worse if anything and ellen
you can tell george from me
that a man wrapped up in himself
makes a very small package
i wondered how much time i had
she was right i must look awful
i had to fix myself up before
i could go to the post office
i had to go in there
i was terrified but i knew i had to
george
he was dead
i mustnt let myself think about it
i mustnt think about anything
anything until i get that letter back
that letter that said i killed him
maybe it was a dream
no it wasnt
i must fix my face
i must look presentable
like any other housewife making
a simple request for a letter
a letter that was mailed by mistake
the gun
it was still in george hand
somehow i knew i
shouldnt leave it there
gunshot
bang-bang bang-bang
come down will you
ill take care of them for you
it alright hoppy
it was the radio i just turned it off
need any help
no
no everything is alright
i see it
bang bang bang bang
bang got you
i prayed that no-one
else had heard that shot
doorbell
i thought perhaps if i didnt answer
hed think no-one was home and go away
but he didnt
he just rang the bell again
and then stood there
doorbell
then i knew i had to get rid of him
yes
good afternoon im mr russell
yes
id like to see mr jones
he is expecting me
expecting you
yes
he telephoned me the other day
well there must be some mistake
my husband is not well
he isnt able to leave his bed
he told me he was ill but he did
telephone to be here this afternoon
well nevertheless he isnt
well enough to see anyone
it a business matter mrs jones
im sorry
but the doctor has forbade
him to see anyone
he warned me that i would get
some resistance from you
he did
he explained that you were over
solicitous about his health
but that i wasnt to take you seriously
oh
your husband only wants me to
authenticate some legal papers
i am a notary
it wont take but a few minutes
sorry i told you he isnt very well
he had a relapse
the doctor just left
here a few minutes ago
and he said he wasnt able to
see anyone today not anyone
sorry to have bothered you miss jones
oh that alright
i will leave my card
perhaps youll call me when he better
yes yes ill call you
good afternoon
goodbye
could he be another witness
i couldnt think what id said to him
i would have to be more careful
suddenly i remembered
what happened the last time
i had to be sure no-one
could get into the house
here i come here i come
hi
i beat you to the crossing didnt i
billy
where are you going
are you alright
sure can i go with you
no you cant
im sorry im late
for heaven sake be more careful
dont you ever do a thing like
that again you hear me
okay
my horse ate the bowl of cookies
well ill give you some more later on
m & m
yes m & m
you stay right there in that driveway
until i get out you understand
okay
all i remember about the
drive down town was
i kept thinking
this time i must control myself
i must keep calm
we caught it in plenty
of time mrs jones
it was brought in just a little while
ago and wasnt even processed yet
then i can have it now
of course
thank heavens
i am glad we caught in time for you
my husband will be so
pleased to have it back
ill give you one of our
regular forms here
a form
yes one of these
oh
you mean i cant take
the letter with me now
just take the form home to mr jones
have him fill it out and
when you bring it back ill have the
letter here and i can give it to you
look
but why is that necessary
just regulations
among other things it gives me time
to compare mr jones handwriting
with the writing on the envelope
i can assure you it is my
husband handwriting
im sure it is
yes
but i must have one of
those forms for my records
oh
but
but my husband has been very ill
and everything bothers him
and if i dont have this letter for him
when i go home hell be awfully upset
why should he
well you see
i am afraid that
he said a lot of very
strong things and
he regrets them now
you can explain to him
that it wont be delivered
itll be held here until
the form comes back
yes but it is so hard to reason
with a person who is ill
well you know how it is
they exaggerate the
importance of everything
and what with his heart condition
i wouldnt want to take a chance
really i must have the letter
for him when i go home now
i must
mrs jones i think i can take a chance
ill let you fill out the
form for your husband
that very nice of you
on one condition
i of course must make sure
of the contents of the letter
what do you mean
it will be strictly confidential but
the letter must be opened and read
open the letter
yes to make sure that it is the letter
to the district attorney as you say
no you cant
i wont have anyone prying
into my husband mail
prying
i want that letter back
do you understand
unopened
mrs jones i was about to tell
you if youd let me finish
that i would call your husband for you
explain the issue and ask his permission
for you to open the letter not me
im sorry
im very sorry
i didnt mean to say that
but you dont seem to understand
no i dont understand mrs jones
and i have no alternative but to send
the letter on to the distributing room
good day
mrs jones
mrs jones
i dont want to intrude
but i couldnt help
noticing you all day long
ive had the feeling that you
that something was wrong
and i would so like
to be able to help you
i know we havent been too neighborly
but trouble is something else again
can i help you
is there something i can do for you
of course i know you are anxious
to get up to your husband
so you run up and see if he
is comfortable and settled
then you come over
or call me
ill be waiting for you
she was kind
she might have been my friend
she might have helped me
then i remembered rann
he said he was going to
stop in again to see george
i couldnt let him do that
he mustnt come here again
ever
dr grahame office
hello this is mrs jones
is dr grahame there
he isnt here mrs jones
can you locate him please it urgent
if it an emergency i could
trace him through his house calls
please do
it is very important that dr grahame
doesnt come here today
i hope you understand
of course i will do my best goodbye
goodbye
doorbell
doctor i just called your
office and told the nurse
what is it
well
george told me he wanted
to consult another doctor
and i did too and he just left and
and i really think it would be better
if you didnt see him again today
oh
what doctor did you call
oh
im sorry i have forgotten his name
i called a neighbor for her doctor and
she gave me his phone number and
george liked him very much
yes
is he a heart specialist
yes yes
that is i think so
what was his diagnosis
i dont know
really george feels much
better ill call you tomorrow
now wait a minute
what happened really
well you see
after
no no please dont please
dont go up there it better for
everybody if you just dont go up there
ellen
it
is he dead
yes
yes
he had a gun
he tried to kill me but
before i could shoot he
he
take it easy
and so i took the gun out of
his hand and then i hid it
i had to it looked as though he had
died protecting himself from me
alright ellen but why
didnt you want me here
i dont know how to tell you
that letter said that we
planned his death together
that you told me to
aggravate his condition
to give him overdoses
of his heart medicine
and if they come here
and find you here
theyll think it true
just as george said
ellen his mind was going
i tried to tell you this morning
he wasnt responsible
they wont believe me
how could they
i did everything wrong everything
just like he said i would
the druggist and then the postman
and then the superintendent
i even lied to his aunt
theyll think i was guilty all of them
you are not guilty ellen
remember that
i know
the police will be here any minute
youd better go better go right now
doorbell
ellen where are you going
i dont know
there is no sense in running
away now go to the door
ellen
go to the door
hello mrs jones
i got a letter for you this afternoon
i didnt put it in the slot because
what
i guess i should feel kinda
funny coming here like this
after what happened between
you and me this noon
but it is alright i understand
here is the letter you gave
me to mail this morning
what
a surprise
i didnt realise it at first
a thick letter like that
and only one stamp
those public officials like the district
attorney wont accept postage-due mail
insufficient postage
yeah the other end just wont
pay the postage in these cases
and we have to return them to
the senders how do you like that
not enough postage and we
have to deliver them twice
yes
a crazy business
you know some folks
might think im stingy
i know these extra stamps
cost only just a few cents but
yes i understand
the same for you as everybody else
yes i understand it
thanks again for the letter mr carston
that alright goodbye
thanks again mr carston for bringing it
youre welcome
0h  it is so funny
go ahead it will do you good
you know i
i tried so hard
so hard to get it back
it alright ellen
you got it now
and then i knew what people meant
when they said their heart was broken
all that was left of george
and me and our marriage
was that little pile of ashes
i knew that some way or somehow
i would have to begin to live again
but right then
all i could do was pray
to lose that one day
that one terrifying day
-s-d-
