clutz
well-known philanthropist
we all knew mr whittmore
was a bit of an eccentric
he once said in an interview
that he never really fit in
interesting news
in regards to his will
is surfacing now
a year after his passing
thank you daisy
well have more
as that story develops
why do you think it took so long
to release mr whittmore
final statement
i dont know the logistics
behind it all
but the news that mr whittmore
has hidden a treasure chest
containing a sizable amount
of his estate
has officially been released
do you think it was a final ploy
to increase tourism in this
town he loved and called home
culver doesnt need any more
tourists during the summer
we do fine already
but it is buried here in culver
yes
and mr whittmore hid clues
to help one
lucky individual find it
that right
well i think we can expect
our little town
to get a bit busier
over the next few days
im daisy larson
channel  news
now mr whittmore was known
for being an inventor
but he was actually a very
accomplished businessman
in fact he gave loans
to other businessmen
hoping to better the community
have you ever been
to whittmore root beer stand
no no
well mr whittmore
gave a man named fritz bronson
a sizable loan
to start the root beer stand
with your contributions
id like to open
a root beer stand
where patrons can enjoy a nice
cold beverage during the summer
that sounds like the best
idea ive ever heard
he just loved the idea
of seeing the community flourish
he wanted that to be his legacy
all right
the root beer stand
was very popular
but fritz was always looking
for a way to make more money
so he wanted to sell the root
beer stand to turn a profit
but dr whittmore didnt want
something that the community enjoyed
to go away
so he bought it from fritz
ive never had root beer
youve never had root beer
okay i dont even know
what to say to that
im going to take you
i think im allergic
maybe you will meet some new
friends and they can take you
i dont think people
like me here
why would you say that
this boy kind of threw me
in the lake
that the guy
oh billy bronson
it pretty late sorry
i lost track of time
i dont think you should be
hanging out with kids like billy
okay tiffany if you dont learn
to function without that thing
your brain is going
to turn into mush
tiffany yeah
why would you want
to hang outwith people
who think it cool to throw
kids in the lake jackie
you whiny little tattletale
billy just said
they were having fun
that is your brother
just leave me alone okay
i dont even want to be here
you know just because
mom and dad are too busy for us
doesnt mean they
just dump us here

just need some sleep

seriously but
hey what your name kid
albie peterson
and what that
youve got there
the key
to mr whittmore treasure
how did you find it
i figured out the clues
well was it difficult
no not if youre smart like me
well you heard
it here first folks
albie peterson has found the key
to the mysterious
whittmore treasure
how are you going
to find the treasure
ill figure it out
oh things are about
to get real
why are you writing
that down cheryl
that just weird
dont write everything i say
mr mayor read it and weep
ive got court papers here
that say that
your little treasure hunt
is going to have
to come to a stop
oh you sail
yes i do
oh very nice
oh do you have boat insurance
boat insurance who doesnt
have boat insurance
ringo fink here my card
premiums are at an
all-time high right now
but id be happy to hook you up
we all live in a yellow
submarine after all
i dont understand
you dont understand
well understand this sir
your little treasure hunt
yeah there a land dispute
that goes back about three years
between my client
fritz bronson
and a mr whittmore
why was it never settled
i resent your tone sir
if youre trying to imply
that i have not done my due
diligence as a lawyer
jurisprudence please please
get the point mr fink
ill get to the point
mr mayor
if this little treasure of yours
is found on land
that is owned by my client
or mr whittmore
well then sir
we have a problem
because
were going to have to put
a stop to the whole thing
until we can all come together
do you like movies
do you like comedies
well this one is not funny
it a scary movie
push pause push pause
no treasure pause
huh huh
we can shoot some hoops
some other time
can you stop us from
looking for the clues
no but we could get
into a lot of trouble
for stepping foot
on any of whittmore land
bronson is just upset that billy
didnt find the key first
what about the missing statue
arent they going to
find out who took it
it is a little bit strange
isnt it
why would mr bronson want
to stop the treasure hunt
well after mr bronson
sold mr whittmore
the root beer stand
those two never
really got along
what happened
well after loaning
mr bronson the money
to build the root bee stand
mr whittmore hired him
as a financial advisor
months later he found out
that mr bronson
had started stealing
from the company
i cannot tell you
how disappointed i am
in you fritz
i almost cant look
at you fritz
do you know why are you here
uh no oh i think you do
i think you do
does that look familiar
not really i
these signatures
these initials
no
the accounting ledger that shows
that you stole money from me
it says frank that not fritz
that the worst lie i think
ive ever heard in my life
hey i
get out of my sight
you had so much potential
sorry
everybody makes mistakes
we do we do
im going to help you
make it right
instead of firing
fritz and taking him to court
mr whittmore forgave him
but there was one condition
what was that
that mr bronson donate
his entire christmas bonus
to a charity in town
thank you santa
mr whittmore was
sad when he found out
that fritz had not carried through
with his request
lam so majorly
disappointed in you
and he fired him
well you know what happens now
youre fired
man i i dont want the job
so why did he come back
well to get his greedy little
hands on the whittmore treasure
i hate that man
hey we dont hate
people okay guys
we just get
excruciatingly
disappointed in them
were going to find that treasure
and ill tell you why
mr whittmore didnt want
mr bronson to have it
yeah and then
he wanted to go fishing
can you believe it
nope
nice
yeah
well youre awkwardly
quiet tonight
but i thought you said we were
going to go to a concert tonight

i thought we could have
some alone time
and i dont want to hear
that suck music anymore

it talks about the geographic
coordinates system
every location on earth
can be located
using a set of numbers
i think whittmore
hid the treasure
using the coordinates system
i just have to locate
the numbers
billy bronson stole
the town statue
what
i was there
it in his garage
this is huge
shh aunt jackie is sleeping
come on
maybe the coordinates
are in the statute
well on the statue ring actually
the statue was wearing this ring
that had a set of numbers on it
it was wearing a ring
i know it sounds silly
but billy actually noticed it
and thought the numbers
might be significant
so he
he put the ring on his necklace
billy wears a necklace
what with men and jewelry
and i get teased
for being a dork
albie we have to get
that necklace back
we need to find
the treasure not billy

or a nice chéteaubriand
so my niece and nephew
are in from the big city
and apparently
my doll collection
is not cool
yeah theyve officially
declared me
one of the town elders
you know how you give
directions in a small town
now this is how
we do it right
we dont say get on the 405 s
take the 0 e no no
too many numbers
too complicated
we say youre going to go past
the cornfield on your left
and when you get to the
end of that cornfield
there going to be some cows
agrazing on your right
“and there a fork in the road
dont go to the left dont go
to the left go to the right
you go in the lake
youve gone too far
so you guys
you know it a small town
when on halloween you just
need one bag of candy
and you have the luxury of eating
half of it yourself
thank you thank you
