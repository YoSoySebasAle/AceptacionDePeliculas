ghosts of the american revolution
when you are
a total non-believer
im not a total
non-believer right
i look forward to being proven wrong
but until then
i plan to find
verifiable explanations
for all things ghostly
and ghoulish
right

beautiful downtown ringwood
it smaller than i remember
your mom dragged me here

margaret saved
my aunt life once

poor woman

house you lived in for your whole life
hey arent you friendly

you have to sell
why because youre
going to move in with me
it the right thing you wouldnt
have anything to worry about
right
im supposed to sell my house
hand over the money to you
and go and sit in your house
and not worry about a thing
sounds peachy
why are you so adamant
about me selling
why has this come up all
of a sudden aunt ruth
next thing i know youll be carting
me off to some old folks home
no you you cant
live on your own
yes i can
and if i cant
ill get someone to live with me
ill hire someone
you dont have
the money to do that
yes i do
i have something tucked away
for a rainy day
but it isnt raining yet
what money you shouldnt
have money lying around
it isnt lying around and it
really none of your business boyd
i was just trying to help
aunt ruth that all
i dont need your help
why dont you help
someone who does
like brenda
excuse me
she got mortgage troubles
go back to that office of yours
and use your influence
maybe i can do something
about that
after i take care
of this whole situation
dont you think that youve
caused enough trouble for one day
and i dont appreciate
coming home
and finding a for sale sign
on my house
i wont have it
fine
fine
it all about money
always is with boyd
how can he get so upset
about a house
when there are so many more
important things in life

like that she threw her book
on the table in a big huff
it turned out the school was holding
auditions for a midsummer night dream

gotcha
therell always be a rainbow
at the end of the field
can you two go play
somewhere else
sony i was going
for pearson
bad aim i guess
now im asking you
did my aunt ever give you money
why are you so upset ive
never seen you like this before
did she ever give you money
you mean did she make donations
i mean did she ever
give you money
yes or no
just give me an answer
yes she did
so my rightful inheritance
was given to you and your zoo
no boyd i mean
she used to bring by food
she been doing that for years
and every once in a while shed very
generously donate some money for the cause
but i think
that was her business
it my business when the cash
was supposed to come to me
i was under the impression
it was hers to give
i want my $50000 brenda
$50000
are you of your mind
im talking 40 or 50 dollars
every once in a while $50000
you saw an old lady with a
ridiculous amount of compassion
for your flea-bitten strays
and you milked her wait just a minute
if youre suggesting that i took
advantage of someone that was my friend
you used her
you tricked her
ive never seen
$50000 in my life
well that my money
and i want it back
so im going to get a court order
and have your bank account checked
go ahead
i have nothing to hide
i think youd better leave
ill be back
what a jerk
he such a creep
the other day im all alone
and he walks right in
without even knocking
i was totally freaked
if he does it again call me
ill kick his butt
he practically
called brenda a liar
and i mean you should see all these
things she does with these animals
she nurses them back to health
she finds them new homes
she looked really upset
i heard something
come on
no i did
nat
dad look whether
you like it or not
there is something
in this house
i told you i can feel it
sometimes right after she died
i thought i felt your mom
presence in the apartment
little things like thinking a mug she
always used for her morning coffee
had been moved on the shelf
or a hint of her perfume
all of a sudden
but i was just so used
to those everyday things
i imagined them
but i didnt imagine her
photo flying off the piano
or the piano keys moving and
i just dont think it a coincidence
that mrs ashboro knew her
im just saying that your mind is
very open to this kind of thing right now
the people i interview
one thing in common
they all lost someone
and they want them back
half the stories im tracking for my book turn
out to have perfectly logical explanations
so what about that guy
who was hung for treason
you said ten people
had seen him
that just
an annual halloween prank
it appeals to those people
who like to think
that ichabod crane
is still out there
riding through the night
without his head
well he is isnt he
tell you what
let both you and i
stay up tonight
that way if something happens
well both be there to see it
okay deal
deal
hey natalie hi
hey
this is my dad
dad brenda
wes merritt
hi
so you must be the animal lady
i mean you look after strays
dogs natalie tells me
yeah and natalie tells me
youre a writer
im sure i mustve read
some of your books
you read a lot of history
im a history buff
it hard not to be
living around here
in fact george washington
used to visit ringwood all the time
one of his chief mapmakers lived in
the area a general erskine i think
yeah erskine ive been
meaning to look him up
yeah
yeah
trapper bo
hang on
i better catch up to the dogs
nice to meet you
my pleasure
and natalie you drop by
anytime you like okay
yeah
she a good worker
see ya
hold on guys
come on trapper
come on
what the
what wrong
nothing
you sense her
dont you i told you
she here
whered all this water
come from
well stay up together tonight
what do you want exactly
no ted
it what you want
you want brenda yancey
farm right
i can make that happen
im the assistant
client funds manager
at the ringwood
savings and loan downtown
i
i know things
that most people dont
like
like brenda yancey a client
and she in deep trouble
way behind on
her mortgage payments
i could maneuver a
foreclosure for a fee
you know boyd i think we maybe
able to do some business after all
well nat i guess this is the case
of the watched pot never boiling
isnt that what grandma
always used to say
all these old houses
are full of strange sounds
theyre creaking and moving
all the time
it not the house
it not your mom
why do you think
your mom would come back
because she knows
knows what
so i can say goodbye
you said goodbye nat
i didnt say everything i needed
to there wasnt enough time
i know that so why
didnt you tell me sooner
i know you think it was wrong
maybe it was
but i didnt tell you right away
because your mother
asked me not to
we were just trying
to protect you
we did what we thought was best
if you think that a decision
was wrong im sorry
god knows at the time
it was hard to think at all
you shouldve thought of me
im sorry
let get some sleep now
you wanna come up now
in a minute
margaret
margaret was it you
i was hearing
what do you want
no stay
hey when did you get a cat
you saw a cat
yeah
where
in the front window

it gone now
it looked sort of like margaret
it must have jumped down
but you saw it
yeah quit psyching me out
you mean you didnt get a cat
at least im not
completely crazy
so ever since we moved in
it just been so weird
things going bump in the night
piano playing
pictures flying
it really freaked me out
i didnt really know
what to think
come on
dont look at me like that
im not crazy

good thing for natalie for both of us
natalie that a tough age
to lose your mother
yeah fifteen not the best time

hard time dealing with it
we both were

margaret
my god
i dont believe this

ghosts cant be hungry

a bag of food she wanted
my god
money
this is what she
wanted me to find
margaret you are
the most wonderful cat
natalie what are
you guys doing in here

dear friend be pulled in all directions
ive always intended to leave you and

love to you brenda
mrs ashboro and margaret

i gotta warn you brenda
there a petition going around
in town to close you down
i know who started that
i cant help you
in the last month
ive had a half dozen complaints
animals going loose
scaring people getting into their garbage
youre at the critical stage
what does that mean
it means if there are
any more serious complaints
im gonna have to shut you down
im real sorry
i dont believe this
you win one battle
and you lose another
i just dont want you
to get messed up again
you could go to jail
im not going anywhere i
swear i didnt let the dogs out
you swore you didnt
set that fire too
natalie
im going to the bank if
you leave before i get back

thanks terry
you just deposited
$50000 i know boyd
brenda that my money
i knew it i knew you had it
your aunt left it to me i will
have the bank freeze the funds
and brenda i will sue you to the
ends of the earth i have a letter
i have written proof
so what
she wasnt of sound mind
she was of sounder mind
than you boyd
i did what i said i would do
i cant help it if she paid
it off i want my money
your plan didnt work
you didnt deliver
i want my money now
not until
she off the property
if i get you brenda land
itll make your little
development deal worth millions
if if you get her off
that big if boyd
ill get rid of her
i promise you
i know the right buttons
to push
i can do a lot more damage than
letting her dogs out riker believe me
much more
okay you do it
margaret
wait
margaret
where are you taking me
natalie what are you doing
here youve gotta get out
no natalie
youve got to get out of here
what are you doing
you got to open the barn door
put this over
your mouth and nose
who in there
kurt is that you
what going on
natalie
what are you two doing in here
okay so what were you
really doing in there
like i told brenda
i thought someone might try
and let the animals out again
i decided to check it out
the barn was full of
fumes when i got here
look i dont know what you heard pearson
and i talking about the other day
ill tell you what i heard
that pearson thinks youre
the one letting the animals out
and that you might
have to go to jail
i didnt let the animals out
and i dont have to go to jail
then what about the fire
he said something about
you setting a fire
so i went a little crazy
after my mom died
i set fire to some guy dump
and it got out of control
i got mandatory
community service
that why
im working at brenda
so youre forced to work here
no im not forced that
just the way it started
i used up my hours long ago
i just stayed
so why didnt you just tell me
like im gonna tell you im a juvenile
delinquent the moment i meet you
clearly that would
impress a girl right
so you wanted to impress me
i didnt know
what to do with you
brenda doesnt want me back
she thinks i did it
i didnt i swear
i know
there no way that happened
by accident tonight
somebody did it deliberately
and i have to find out who
and ill help you
it obvious someone
is out to get me i
i cant believe it kurt
but on the other hand
i cant afford to take any
chances it got to be riker
hed do anything to
get rid of me i just
i cant take this anymore
you dont want to give up now
you dont understand the animals
could have been asphyxiated
im supposed to protect them
not put them in harm way
what i can do to help
i dont need any help
im fine on my own i
im just used
to being on my own
what were you doing over here
in the middle of the night
do you realize how dangerous it
was margaret came and got me
margaret got you
yeah and it a good thing she
did if kurt and i hadnt been here
be careful around kurt
you dont know him very well
you dont really know
brenda either
let go home

you now or anytime soon
if you ever set foot on my property again
you are going to regret it
