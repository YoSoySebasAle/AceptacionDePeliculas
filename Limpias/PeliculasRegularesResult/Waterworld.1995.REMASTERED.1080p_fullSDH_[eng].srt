or he can save what left of you
in a goddamn jar
were going to die here arent we
arent we
after the atoll
when i offered myself to you
why didnt you take me
cos you didnt really want me
not really
have i been sleeping
i was dreaming
it funny
i always thought dryland floated
or drifted with the wind
that why it was so hard to find
why did you believe in it so much
cos we werent made for the sea
weve got our hands and our feet
were supposed to walk
i miss her sound
dont you
gregor helen
no no no no helen up above you
helen gregor
gregor laughs
smart thinking to burn your boat
without the smoke
i never would have found you
who that with you
ichthys sapien is that really you
ill throw the rope down
you catch it ill help you climb up
helen
where enola
smokers took her
theyd have me too
if it werent for him
my friend
thank you very human of you
grab your things quickly quickly

woman enola the reason

helen if the mariner willing to go
after her then why not us
woman we dont want you here

we need this child to find dryland
im not going
man nobody is
woman theyre on the horizon

the numbers yes i think i do
it seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location
latitude longitude
it doesnt make sense though
the numbers
they seem to be backwards or something
it upside down
the world
the poles have reversed themselves
ive been mapping the cities below
the world wasnt created in a deluge
it was covered by it
man that blasphemy
no it true
ive seen it with my own eyes
there land
right under our keel none of it dry
some is
enola been there i know that now
i saw what she drew
that why he going after enola
to find dryland
i dont care about dryland

going after the smokers
man i say let him go
woman were better off without them
if she alive
ill bring her back to you
woman forget about the muto helen
if he brings her back theyll kill us
weve got to go help him
