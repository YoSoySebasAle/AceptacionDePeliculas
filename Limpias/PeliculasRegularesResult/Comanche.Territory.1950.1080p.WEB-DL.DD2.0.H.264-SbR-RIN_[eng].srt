
drop your rifle
get your hands up over your head
well so youve come
to thank me stranger
that one way of putting it
but im a curious man mister
before i thank you id like to know
what you got against me
why nothing son
nothing at all
then why did you shoot at me
instead of the comanches
id call that a mighty fair question
you mind if i put my arm down son
i got a bad shoulder
just dont go reaching
for any iron huh
well you might put it onto the head
in the military strategy son
you see comanches sometimes
get queer notions
they figure that land back there
is kind of sacred
as long as you was trespassing
you were safe
i was just trying to coax you
back onto sacred territory
so that why they kept
changing their minds
im afraid i owe you
my sincere apology sir
and my thanks
ah there was no real danger
there only ten of them
and i still got one good arm left
mind if i have a look at this one
yeah
this is right friendly
of you stranger
looks as though
the comanches got to you
before they got to me
there was no comanches
comanches is real friendly people
if you dont rub them the wrong way
let just say it a snake bite
seems as though the snake
left a little bit of lead in there
only one kind of snake
around these parts
ill get it out
as quick and easy as i can
there no hurry son
only dont throw it away
i like to save
the lead folks take out of me
i got me three pounds of it
i reckon that there is supposed to be
one of them bowie knives
that exactly what it is
that is exactly what it aint
that the poorest imitation
of the genuine article as ever i seen
it is
yessiree
that one is the same
as thousands of others
folks are selling back east
a real bowie knife
that something else again
id ought to know
i gave jim bowie the idea
for that weapon myself
that mighty interesting
yessiree it was back in louisiana
me and jim were sitting
on the front porch whipping
jim was a rich man in them days
it was on account that id given him
the idea there plenty
of money in sugar
no time at all jim had cleaned up
three million dollars
two million
you a friend of jim bowie
not particularly
hmm
well anyways jim
i says omeday im gonna fashion me
a hunting knife 6 inches long
and curved in the end
like a heathen
scimitar
that right scimitar
o as my hand wont slip i says
aimed to put cross guard on the hilt
and im going to put a double edge
on the last three inches
four inches
next thing i knowed
jim bowie had beat me to it
and made the knife his self
i dont think i quite
got your name son
james bowie of louisiana
oh while you was talking
i was beginning to think--
james bowie
why ill be hog swallowed
and whom do i have
the pleasure of digging into
dani seeger
dani gideon seeger
ex-hunter ex-indian fighter
ex-congressman and as you have
probably figured out
the biggest hogtied jugheaded
turnip sucking liar in the whole world
steady now dani
i think i got it
i find this mighty interesting jim
them bucks out there
come galloping by
and see how close they can come to us
with their arrows
and they try again 0 paces further on
and so on
it that so on that bothers me
well i wish you were still
a member of congress dani
this seems the most appropriate time
to register a complaint
i call that mighty fair shooting
you take shoshones jim
theyre a bit nearsighted for indians
now if them were shoshones
instead of comanches
id be getting a little nervous
how many rounds do these
games usually run
three is about average
four rounds is extra good
if it should happen to run up to five
well them bucks would be
talking about nothing else
for weeks to come
that nice to know
well in case theyre only
playing a three rounder
it was mighty nice meeting up
with you jim bowie
excuse the left hand dani
it been a nice friendship
if a short one
yeah me unconscious
most of the time
look yonder jim
it quisima the number one chief
id seen him once in washington
he the one i came out here to see
does he understand english
i dont know
so this is the mighty quisima
who sat in the council of the white man
in washington
this is quisima
who gave one hand in friendship
to his white brothers
while the other hand held a knife
this is quisima
whose word is shifting as the wind
whose tongue twists like a river
of many branches
this is quisima breaker of treaties
today the comanche
is held in honor and respect
like the mountain that never yields
or the sun that never changes
tomorrow you will be
driven off like a dog
that wanders close to a campfire
to take his place among men
white men broke treaty
went where forbidden to go
he a stranger in these parts
your men shouldve come
to him friendly-like
and told him he was trespassing
on sacred ground
instead of swooping down on him
like chicken hawks trying to kill him
i come from the land of the naches
in the muscogeean to sit in council
with the mighty quisima
if i did not come in friendship
your three braves would now lie dead
comanche honors his treaties
hope my white brothers do same
when time comes
one white brother hurt
comanche medicine man
make him well again
meantime white man
whose tongue is as sharp as his blade
will teach quisima
more about his knife
james bowie
if i had your gift of speeching
id still be in congress
it all right jim
my arm being as good as new
we are pulling out tomorrow
well quisima ive kept
my part of the bargain
in the two weeks weve
been here ive taught your men
how to make and fight
with my kind of knife
a blade that cuts two ways
has kept his word
quisima will keep his
when treaty with white man is renewed
bowie brother of quisima
may dig silver ore
that lies beneath land of comanches
and the comanches will get
a good price for it
as long as campfires burn
before the tents of comanches
the blade that cuts two ways
and his friends will be welcome
i aint aiming to pry
into your private affairs jim
but that silver deal
you made with quisima
youre not prying danl
since the war of 82
the country been trying
to get back on its feet
we need that silver to help us do it
that why i came out here
i hate to disappoint you jim
but that treaty aint
being renewed next week
youre mistaken
the renewal was drawn up
when i left the east
oh it was drawn up all right
but andy jackson gave it
to a dimwit named dani seeger
to give to the comanches
for ratification
well then what wrong
remember that bullet
you took out of my shoulder
well a short while
before i run into you
i was dragged and thieved
the ornery skunks
took the treaty renewal
but the president can always
send the comanches another copy
yeah but itll be
weeks before they get here
meanwhile folks are pouring
into the territory
by the dozens just waiting
for the treaty to expire
comes the deadline
they all will be staking claim
once they get in here
it aint gonna be as easy
to get out of here
any idea who might have done it
nope but im hoping
i might find out something
when we get to crooked tongue
dont your remember anything
as a matter of fact
there was something jim
just before i passed out
i got a whiff of fancy perfume
perfume
perfume
smelled real good too
for a minute
i thought i was getting mighty
too close to the pearly gates
do you know what kind it was
no but id recollect it
if i ever ran cross it again
i may not have good brains
but i sure got a good smeller
dani and i have been
doing some tall thinking
along the way
whoever took that treaty
knows for certain
therell be no renewal next week
that follows
so naturally youll expect
to have a lot of silver
to sell in the near future
well seems logical
well im gonna spread it
around town
i came out here to buy silver
all i can lay my hands on
now why couldnt i have thunk of that
the best way to get polecats
is to smoke them out
anybody who ready
to make a deal with you
knows more than he had ought to
precisely
and since youre
evidently known by sight
i suggest we ride into town alone hmm
as we used to say in congress
the motion is seconded and passed
and the meeting is adjourned
come on you cow-heels
now put your money down
boozer here will take all bets
your money or your livestock
but just see that you make it big
with our luck
im not gonna make this ride
unless you fellas
make it worth my while
now let me get this straight katie
youre betting you can
take that tray in one hand
and ride full gallop
to the end of town
stop dead ride back at full speed
return the tray
and if one of the glasses is spilled
ive lost my bet
katie youve just made
yourself a wager
do you call that a wager
take that trash out of my sight
i dont aim to be insulted
by small bets like that
well come on some man-sized bets
or im not going to trouble myself
all right
there you are
that more i like it
come on now come on
$4 keep going
come on now come on
all right
come on now let him do it come on
come on put your hands over here
come on katie come on katie
get away folks
go on hanging right on to it
there
now yall set katie
all set
good lord there we go
now easy does it
easy does it
dont spill it i got my money on it
you clumsy ox
im terribly sorry
blundering fool
now now miss i said i was sorry
it not nice for a lady
not to be a lady
sorry
he said he sorry
you blundering tinhorn
you made me lose all my bets
bets
i didnt know ladies made bets
you call me a lady once more
and ill fill you full of lead
easy now miss the mood youre in
youre liable to pull that trigger
thereby causing
a most embarrassing situation
for both of us
you did that on purpose
look mister if the lady wants
to pull a gun on me
that quite all right
where i come from
we usually let the ladies
have their way
but i dont like a man doing it
oh you dont now im gonna shoot
you get out of this
but miss katie
i bet my whole bankroll on you
i can take care of this
this tinhorn without your help
ive got an idea
why dont you two toss a coin
to see who shoots me huh
you talk too much
all right mister
draw
i said draw
sorry maam back in louisiana
when we meet any pretty ladies
we make love to them
we kiss them
spank them on occasion
but we never go around shooting them
are you going to draw or arent you
of all the yellow spineless
cowardly coyotes i
pay off all bets
another thing i forgot to mention
i dislike the sound of someone
cocking a pistol behind my back
hello
howdy
id like to deposit this bank draft
and draw some cash against it
oh sure sure
hmm $5000
you have to take this up with the boss
in there
it all right go right in
well
look miss im liable
to run out of apologies
if youre following me around
to start trouble again
what do you want to see me about
i can assure you miss
seeing you was the least
of my intentions
im waiting to see
the president of the bank
all right
start talking
youre not the bank president
mister i am the bank and im busy
now what do you want
id like to deposit this draft
and draw some cash against it
james bowie louisiana
and now you got the better of me
i usually like to know
the names of people
i do business with
the name kathryn howard
and were not doing any business
do you mean youre not going
to honor this draft
that exactly what i do mean
i dont like the look of it
meaning you dont like me
suit yourself
i dont like you mister
or your bank draft
but there isnt another bank
within 200 miles
im considered a fairly
wealthy man back east
but if you refuse to cash this draft
i might as well be broke
now it does seem to work out
that way doesnt it
thanks for dropping in mr bowie
but this is ridiculous
this is a perfectly legal bank draft
you cant refuse to recognize
the bank of louisiana
i refuse to recognize
the whole state of louisiana
ms howard ive done
a lot of things in my life
but ive never had
a bank president across my knee
for a good spanking
that a pleasure
i shall look forward to
if you refuse to accept this draft
im sure the gambling casino next door
will be very glad to
mr bowie
let me give you
some friendly advice
get out of town youve already
been here too long
very kind of you
to want to be my friend
thank you
we must have dinner together sometime
jack good
how about you
eight
seven
four
who in charge around here
stacey
that him at the end of the bar
how about you
yeah
excuse me they tell me
youre in charge around here
that right
id like to cash a draft
drawn on the bank of louisiana
certainly how large
five thousand
you know that size
you have to take it up
with the big boss
and where do i find the big boss
in the office
oh no
it you again
get to the point mister
this happens to be one of my busy days
now what can i do for you
oh ive seen everything
i have no time for small talk
mr bowie
but if this is a social call i--
no not at all
ms howard i have in my possession
a draft drawn on the bank--
oh what the use
look i need cash
ill make you a sporting proposition
im not a gambler
but evidently you are
one cut of the cards for five thousand
youve made yourself a bet mr bowie
come on
were breaking in for one hand
of high card slim
that all boys pick up your chips
give me 5000
five thousand one hand
you ask too many questions
cash if you dont mind
mind if i have a look at those cards
why you little
that all right slim
mr bowie has a peculiar
sense of humor
why dont you shuffle them too
well it not necessary
after all we do trust
each other dont we
ladies first
oh i forgot you dont like
to be called a lady
or dress like one either
an eight
four
your money mr bowie
i believe i mentioned before
i dont gamble ms howard
you can have the draft
thatll keep it from being gambling
now look mr bowie if that a bet
i dont think you meant that
to be an insult or did you
i never insult anyone with $5000
especially a lady
whatll it be
thatll be all right
any kind of will do
jim ive have smelled
half the people in town
and believe me there are no lilies
ive smelled polecat and sheepherder
and about a dozen assorted smells
i havent classified as yet
any trace of that perfume
not a whiff but ill keep on smelling
until my smeller gives up
im sorry you had trouble
with the boss
if shed known who jim bowie was
im sure she would have been
more courteous
i cant imagine that female tiger
if she is a female
being courteous
under any circumstances
oh katie really
a nice person mr bowie
when you get to know her better
getting to know her better
is one ordeal
im hoping to spare myself
can i buy you a drink
thanks
boozer
so far all the friends
ive made in this town
add up to zero
well your entrance into town
wasnt exactly conducive
to making friends
you know i spent most
of my life in the east
that where i first heard of jim bowie
and his fabulous knife
i hear tell it a deadly man killer
it a hunting knife
sorry
youre in sugar arent you
used to be
we dont grow much sugar
in these parts
no but i understand
youre expecting a fine
crop of silver very soon
thinking of staking your claim
in comanche territory
im leaving the claim taking to others
im buying silver all i can get
that very interesting mr bowie
if i hear of anyone
with silver to sell
ill pass the word along
well if it aint ms katie howard
lucky for you lem
i cant tote any guns in this outfit
what are you rigged up for katie
a wedding or a funeral
wait until you see the dress
i wear the day we bury you
all right boys
when katie goes feminine
somebody better watch out
still wondering if the tiger is female
not anymore
im raising 0 more
no bet
what the idea
i thought i told you card sharks
to keep out of my place
now get
but i--
go on
mighty affectionate for a man your age
it aint affection it that perfume
well if it going
to affect people like that
i better not use it anymore
all right miss where is the treaty
treaty
the treaty with the comanches
the one you took from me
what have you done with it
i dont know what youre talking about
that treaty was a property
of the federal government
and i aim to get it back
im sorry ms katie
why you clumsy mutt
hey someone get me out of here
someone get me out of here
i promised myself this
pleasure ms bank president
ow
that for not cashing
my draft
ill kill you when i get out of here
ow
that for giving me so much trouble
throw these two gentlemen out of here
well i hope you know
what youre doing
you bet i do
you know people dont toss
jim bowie around like that
and get away with it
ill take my chances
whoever he is
for your information
he a very wealthy man
he in town to buy silver
so what
a comanche silver is no good
to us if we dont get someone
to take it off our hands
therell be other buyers
sure maybe in a few months
but we can use jim bowie now
if you dont want all our plans
to fall through
youd better go after him
see if you can repair
the damage youve done
me go crawling to him
id rather die first
im not asking you katie
im telling you
eh it no use jim
ill never learn to keep my mouth shut
if i had id still be in congress
you never struck me as the kind of man
that goes around kissing strange girls
in the shoulder
and in one drink too
i wasnt kissing i was whiffing
and i got me a nose
full of that perfume
ms howard
uh-hmm
instead of saying nothing
playing possum
i had to raise a fuss
and get us thrown out
now we cant get back in there
to snoop around
im not so sure of that danl
i came out to tell you
that i was sorry
i want to apologize
well this is a surprise
it is to me too
i mean we try to run
a respectable place
and if your friend here
hadnt started all the trouble--
he no friend of mine
i never saw him before
well you were trying to help him
just a case of helping the underdog
too many against one
i reckon i could take the blame
for that little fracas miss
you see i met up with
an accident awhile back
and ive been kind of
getting funny spells ever since
you know imagining
all sorts of funny things
im sorry if i caused you
any trouble stranger
um i hope we can consider all this
a misunderstanding mr bowie
im sure that all it was ms howard
oh that very kind of you to say so
if youre not holding any grudges
i--id like to offer you a drink
well the offer is gratefully accepted
providing of course
im still welcome inside
oh of course mr bowie
and again
my deepest apologies
not at all ms howard
my apologies to you
oh
well ill be
hogswalled
how about this table mr bowie
splendid
you can see everything from here
and nobody can get behind me
oh now mr bowie
boozer
see that mr bowie
has anything he wants
but ms katie i think he just a--
youre not paid to think
mr bowie is a guest of mine
give him the best in the house
oh by the way
have you made any arrangements
for your lodgings
no not yet
well then it all settled
youll stay at my ranch
that very gracious of you
ms howard
oh not at all mr bowie
you know i had no idea
stacey was your brother
you didnt
he told me when i got to
know you better
id get to like you
and i believe he was right
oh
so in two days you think
youre beginning to know me
at least im beginning to like you
oh
come
i thought the comanche
had a peace treaty
with his white brothers
come
it seems that his entire vocabulary
i think we better go with him
why are we brought here like this
quisima breaks his word
to keep the peace
with the white man
quisima keeps his word
want to know if white men
will keep theirs
a blade that cuts two ways
will sit in council
of comanches
pakanah
this is pakanah
my son
he lived with white man
he tell you when your tongue message
is given to us
white man like bird
that makes sweet music
but rob nest of others
he promised comanche peace
while hand reaches for a gun
to slay him
every day
we see white man
come across plain
from direction of morning sun
he bring tools with him
not for planting of corn
but for digging of silver
white man
plan to betray comanche
he will take his land
there will be no new treaty
each day comanche wait
white man becomes stronger
comanche must strike
at once tonight
council agrees with pakanah
but i told them
my brother bowie
man of honor
he not lie
if he tell me
white man renew treaty
quisima believe him
what do you think ms howard
i
i dont know
i pledge my word of honor quisima
that the treaty
has already been renewed
and has been sent on its way here
from washington
white man has false tongue
i dont blame you
for being angry pakanah
but i dont like to be called a liar
white man lie
i make him admit
if that the way you want it
not with your weapons
with ours
each to his own
please dont
you wont stand a chance
then why dont you stop it
you know there a new treaty
and you know who took it
i cant
then ive got to fight him
or every comanche in the territory
will be on the warpath before morning
i wish youd change your mind pakanah
i dont wanna kill you
i want kill you
i told the truth
i told the truth
white man tell truth
you think i want that silver
for myself dont you
well youre wrong
i have my reasons good reasons
but they wouldnt mean anything to you
maybe they would
not to an easterner
you would have to be a part of that
to understand
and that would have to be
a part of you
my father and grandfather
came out here to try
and make something
out of that wilderness
and they died trying
they brought
all their friends with them
and everyone whod listen
go on
but things didnt work out
the way they expected them
they raised cattle
but there was no way to get them
to the eastern markets
people began to get discouraged
lately things have been getting worse
a lot of families have left
the territory and gone back
and you think that comanche silver
will keep them from leaving
is that it
yes that it
once they stake claims
theyd have to stay here
and no one the indians
and the federal government included
is going to stop us
that mighty big talk ms howard
well that the way
we feel about it all of us
even my brother stacey
of all the upside down
back into
mule-headed illogical
irrational feminine reasoning
you saw the mood
those comanches are in
do you think for one moment
the shooting stop
with that one rifle ball i took out
of dani seeger shoulder
im sorry about that
there wasnt supposed to be a shooting
but the men with me
were pretty desperate
somebody slipped up
and theyll slip up again
if they try to jump indian land
quisima has already given
the government permission
to dig for their silver
that mighty fine for the government
but it doesnt do us any good
listen ms howard
your desire to improve this territory
is most commendable
but youre going about it
in the wrong way
dont you understand
the country needs this silver
theyll make a road out here
wagon trains will be rolling
in and out of here
people who left will be coming back
and hundreds more
besides this territory
will be bigger than anything
your father or grandfather
ever dreamed of
you really believe that
believe that i know it
so youre calling off the deal katie
all our plans
everything weve worked for
not unless you agree stacey
after all that your problem
as much as mine
oh anything you say
is all right with me
you know that
since we only have three days left
i suggest we get the treaty to quisima
as quickly as possible
i didnt know thered would be
a change in plans
i destroyed it
im sorry
well no harm done
you two confess the word out
that there is a new treaty
and nobody is to try moving in
on the comanches
thatll protect us till andy jackson
can send along a new copy
yeah im afraid that wont work jim
a lot of newcomers pulled up stakes
and came out here just to get in
on the silver rush
theyre not gonna be
in a listening mood
i found out when i was in
business back east
that usually the best way
to handle a stubborn customer
was to get a couple of drinks
and a good meal under his belt
then hed usually listen to reason
were gonna throw the biggest shindig
this territory ever known
wed throw the cafe wide open
and wine them and dine them
until theyre ready to listen
and just in case a few of them
dont see the light
i suggest we take their guns away
before they come in
what the matter tom
comanches making trouble
heck no get down
to crooked tongue today
free fills and plenty of liquor
katie howard throwing a shindig
you better hurry
yeah
i guess i better get home
and change my duds
come on
hey stop everything
katie howard throwing a party
free fills and liquor for everybody

i got that one from the iroquois
the iroquois taught me that one
i better tell them now
ill take a couple of these
this is as good a time as any
to make a little announcement
there a new treaty with the comanches
and itll be here from washington
in a few days
that means that you can all forget
that midnight deadline tomorrow
nobody is moving in
on comanche territory nobody
you can do whatever you like lady
but im moving in
if any of you newcomers feel
like arguing
ive got a couple of good
arguments right here
you old timers
know how my folks felt
about this territory
and how i feel about it
and im not going to let it break up
that silver is going to be mined
but itll be done legally
and therell be plenty of work
for everybody
and a chance to live right
and bring your kids up in the same way
this territory is going to grow faster
and bigger than we ever dreamed
those that feel like i do
will do well to stay
and as for the others well
well stake them to the expenses
of their trip back home
im staying katie
you can count on me too
yeah
what about the rest of you
katie im afraid
ive got some bad news
i was up on the north range
checking the cattle
and i found a couple of fresh carcasses
and some wolf tracks
wolves
yeah traveling in a pack
about a dozen of them
as near as i can make out
ive never heard of wolves
traveling in packs
this far south
theyre heading towards timberline
oh i got my stock grazing up there
i better get my rifle and get going
ill go with you
just a minute boys
youll need help
folks as part of these festivities
im organizing a wolf hunt
ill pay $20 in gold
for every pelt you bring back
well jim you sure you wont
change your mind
and come with us
no i better stay
and keep an eye on the party
hmm it quite a pretty party
to keep an eye on
what about you stacey
oh id have trouble
getting on a horse
let alone riding one
well im thinking on four pelts
one for each of us
let go
well i guess everybody here
except the boss
it only a wild turkey
we got a long day ahead of us
they make mighty good eating
here he comes
you all know what were here for
i had you men picked because i think
you all feel the way i do
we didnt come out here
for the good of the glorious west
but for our own good
now that being so we are moving in
on comanche territory tonight
are there any questions
yeah
suppose the federal government
brings troops in here to throw us out
there wont be any law
in this territory
for 25 years
by that time well all be rich enough
not to have to worry
youve been talking mighty big
about how were all gonna get rich
but you aint never mentioned
how were gonna split up the silver
ill let you know that
after we take over
and start digging it
id like to know right now
are there any other troublemakers
hankering to know how we split up
this aint no argument stacey
but what are the comanches
gonna be doing
while were digging the silver
that all taken care off
comanches without rifles
shouldnt present much of a problem
ive got the original treaty right here
with shall we say
a little added clause
clause 0
this treaty of peace to take effect
only on the condition that said
comanche indians
shall immediately as a token
of their intention
of keeping said peace
surrender all guns rifles
and powder in their possessions
well there it is quisima
all signed and sealed
this trick of white man
comanche must not give up gun
long before white man came
comanche hunted with bow
and knife was happy
white man gun
has brought them only sorrow
and bloodshed
since we will now live in peace
with white brothers
we not need these guns
it shall be as white brother wish
sorry you had to leave so soon
got to get the youngsters home
and straightened out
they act too much
sure was a swell shindig ms howard
that cake was every bit
as good as mom
mmm almost
bye-bye
bye bye
well it looks like your party
is a success in more ways than one
thanks to you
it was really your idea
folks took the change in plans
very nicely
im sure you wont have any trouble
and someday soon
ill be coming through
this way again
and this territory will be booming
youre not leaving
in a couple of days
i want to get down there
and find out what it all about
when do you expect to get back
id be more up to hurry
if i knew i was being missed
in that case jim bowie
youd better hurry
im going to miss you too
oh what the matter danl
didnt you get any wolves
i found plenty of wolves
two-legged wolves
jim bowie you and me have been took in
like a couple of first-class
greenhorns
meaning what
meaning if there a wolf pack
in them hills ill eat my saddle
looks like ms howard and her brother
dealt it to us right off
the bottom of the deck
i hope you know what youre
talking about mr seeger
because i dont
no i suppose you dont know
where your brother is
or what he is up to
of course i do
he took the buckboard back
to the ranch
and you can just stop
your playacting young woman
stacey and most of those men
are up in the hills
in that supposed-to-be wolf hunt
and they are aiming to move in
on the comanches
well that not true
naturally she dont know
nothing about it
just like she dont know
her brother rides
like a
and he mighty handy
in a lot of other ways
jim i dont know anything about this
i swear it
ive got to hand it to you
ms howard that wolf hunt
was a stroke of genius
youve got to believe me jim
you picked a clever way
of getting the guns back
to the men and sneaking them out
without arousing suspicion
jim youve got to listen to me
ive listened enough
let go
boozer i want to see you
in the office
im kind of busy out there ms katie
get over there
where stacey
i dont know
i guess he went home
you know where he is
and what he up to
no maam
i dont know nothing
then youd better start guessing
no
stay right where you are
and dont move
what is this a joke
listen boozer
ive talked big and tough
all of my life
but ive never shot anyone
youd better start talking
but if i talk
stacey will kill me
you can worry about that later
if you dont talk
ill kill you
we got here as fast as we could
we do not want quisima to think
it is the white man government
that betrays the comanche
our brother bowie has spoken well
quisima understand
there great problem
the boys still got a few hours
before sundown
plenty of time to get ready
for that pack of human hyenas
the comanches have given up their guns
they have only arrows and lances
and few knives
my brother bowie made for them
theyll never let you get
close enough to use them
well theyd pick you off
like a herd of buffalo
if comanches must die
they will die like men
but never gave up
sacred soil of their fathers
listen quisima
dying may be all right for your men
but youve got to get your women
and children out of here
let them take what they can carry
and hide out in the hills
then spread your men out
let them fight
from behind rocks and trees
caution your braves again
well wait beyond the village
until stacey men come close
on this mountain then well attack
well stacey
the men are rested and fed
and raring to go
well you can pass out some whiskey
no more than two drinks per man
youre quite a ways from home
arent you sis
i had to see for myself
well now you know
youre not thinking of whipping
your naughty brother
quite an arsenal youve got over there
youre not taking any chances
i cant afford to
the comanches are most cooperative
they gave up their guns
without a struggle
youve been planning this
for a long time
even before i come out here
i suppose id be wasting my breath
if i tried to talk you out of it
just as much as if i tried to talk you
into coming in with me
and giving up that nonsense
about building up the west
very well stacey
now we know where we stand
from now on im on the other
side of the fence
fortunes of war katie
where are you going
out of here if i dont get
a bullet in my back
take some men and go after her
were not waiting any longer
were moving in on
the comanches right now
ha ha
ha ha
i dont know how im gonna make out
with your kind of knife jim
i was practically weaned
on this arkansas toothpick
remember it cuts up as well as down
this not white man fight
you go
we like it here pakanah
besides weve gotta make
things right on account
of what stacey doing
it fellers like him
that gives a white man a bad name
once in anger
i want kill my brother bowie
now if you let me
i want fight beside him
glad to have you
well wouldnt have to wait long
to get his wish
here they come
they wont get their guns back
tell them to save their arrows
well you know what
it feels like to be a turkey
in a turkey shoot
well they cant hold that much longer
maybe if i try to ration them
you think so huh
look
they wont get their guns back eh
quick rifles
dont get them tied along
let go
i ought to turn you over
to the comanches
but youll be a lot safer
with the federal government
as soon as i finish my business
with mr houston
ill be back
hurry jim
ill need a lot more help now
looking like that
youll do all right
well goodbye kate
bye jim
good luck
that aint no way
to say goodbye to a gal
you big galoot
go ahead and kiss her
