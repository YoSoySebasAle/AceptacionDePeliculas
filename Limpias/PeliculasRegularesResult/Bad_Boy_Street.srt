text message tone
i am sorry
please dont hate me
i dont really know
how to explain
im sure you know

crying
hello claude
oui
mind if i sit down
do you speak english
yes a little
great
my name is michael
im aaron
um brad manager
i hate to meet you under these
circumstances but
im gay myself
so i understand what
youre going through
the thing is um
aaron or brad
signed a contract which had
a morals clause
and it a very big film a
very big part of a franchise
so with this morals clause
if anything were to get out in
the press about him being
um not to the
studio liking
and let just say theyre a
very conservative studio
it could really hurt brad
he would be fired
he could be sued even
because of something like this
so i have some form for you
it a confidentiality
agreement there that
there a prepared statement
weve written for you
which basically states that
nothing happened
between the two of you
it would be really great if
you could sign these for me
um i have a pen here
if you could just sign here
and here
here as well
and here
that would be so wed
really appreciate it so much
and aaron really
appreciates this as well
i mean brad
cell phone ringing
