dont worry
ive taught you well
i know
oww ok but
seriously dont you think

yeah baby
ok what is the lacrosse team
doing on our field
the school cut our team

i can do just say the word
as a matter of fact there is
we wanna try out
for the boys team
uh anything besides that

umm the girls here want
to try out for the team
youre not serious
all right all right
youre all excellent players

or as strong or as athletic
this is not me talking
it a scientific fact
girls cant beat boys
it as simple as that

ball around a field all day
well the world has been set
right mom they cut my team
what no soccer
yeah that right no soccer
how sad

as in london england
yeah my band got a slot
in a music festival there
ok what are you

it would last for two weeks
like mad cow
sebastian you
just got kicked out
of cornwall for skipping
this is not exactly the way
you want to start out
hey i want to be a musician

need to know trigonometry
besides if you want
to chase your dreams
sometimes you gotta break
the rules right

as female soccer players
i will see you in two weeks

i really do it really
acting up during the
no you dont
youve got
male pattern baldness
scoot over kiddo
i dont know if youve realized
but recently ive
started to thin out myself
ive tried all the creams
and the butters
and i still cant seem to stop
mother nature vindictive fury
and neither can you ok
there gonna be a time
when youll have to come out
of the closet and just accept
yourself for who you are
a baldy ok
but it gonna be
all right ok
oh and between you and me
chicks dig it
hang ten yeah
hi olivia i
dont want you to be worried
but malvolio missing
oh no
yeah
if you see him dont feed him
he has an irritable bowel
yeah cause that would be
my very first instinct
to feed the tarantula
hmm
here a wild idea
have you ever thought about
going out with duke orsino
i see that
duke
yeah
no
yeah
no
yeah
yeah
no
i mean he good-looking
and everything
but he just not
the guy for me
hmm i dont know
think there may be more
to him than you think there is
so youre telling me he
not just another dumb jock
who wants to hook up with me
so he could tell
his friends but too
insecure to treat you
as an equal
exactly
tell me about it
youre the first guy
at this school
who hasnt tried
anything with me
trust me
youre not my type
well why not
you know it just
i dont think of you
in that way
were friends you know
youre actually one
of the few people here
that i feel comfortable around
i feel the same way
about you
good then just take my advice
go out with duke
ill consider it
so uh what is that exactly
um i think that the spleen
hmm
ok who your daddy
huh
i got her to agree to consider
you youre halfway in
uhh um all right ok
so should i ask her out
no you dont want
to freak her out
you got to have a casual
conversation first hello
why do i get the feeling
you dont do this very often

the girls team
at cornwall got cut
the guys wouldnt let
me go out for their team
so ive been pretending
to be my brother
while he was in london
for the past two weeks ow
so i could make
the team and beat cornwall ow
whoa
but my brother
came home early
and that who you saw kissing olivia and that who played the first half
just because you wear a wig
doesnt prove youre a girl
ok then
merciful jesus

and i didnt
want to hurt you
but i just wanted to
prove that i was good enough
all im asking for
is a chance
duke
it just like what coach says
before every game
be not afraid of greatness
some are born great
some achieve greatness
and some have greatness
thrust upon them
i think the best chance for us to be great here today is to have you play

no playing
you have to forfeit
there no girls in this league

well a few days ago
i kissed this girl
at a kissing booth
and now i just cant seem
to stop thinking about it
neither can she
plus
i miss my roommate
i really liked him
well
he right in here
listen i know i shouldve
told you who i was but
i was afraid
sorry
well
you know maybe if id have
known you were a girl
we wouldnt have talked
like we did
and got to know each other
the same way
and that would
have been a shame
just so you know
everything you told me
when i was a guy just
made me like you
so much more as a girl
ok but just
from here on in
everything would just
be a lot easier
if you stayed a girl
i promise
