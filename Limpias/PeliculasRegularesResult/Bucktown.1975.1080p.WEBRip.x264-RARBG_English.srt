of a lot and frame house
a hand-tooled leather wallet
containing $3943
and a savings account passbook
in the name
of benjamin a johnson
okay all of ben things

that the state law
takes that long
to close an estate
what am i supposed to do

for two months
of course
we could relax the rules a bit
allow you the use
of your brother properties
huh

an empty hand-tooled
leather wallet
you run a nice business
around here dont ya

your brother ben made
a right smart living from it

except that it gonna be
a little hard
to find a buyer for the club
with that closed sign
on the door
that the way it is bro
but it dont have to be
really duke
if the joint was open
people would be having fun
and partying real good
and catching good
someone will come in there then
want to buy the joint
and you know
youre gonna have to get down
with some heavy bread
you could be playing
sweet music
on the cash register
you guys are dreamin man
hey duke why do you think
those tourist dudes
come over here
from across the river
it cause they know they can
swing till broad daylight
shoot
get four or five times
what youre asking
if the club was open
and dont forget
all those army reservers
over at the armory
one night a week
after marching and drilling
theyre hot
and theyre thirsty
and where do they head for
the club alabam
for some relaxation
relaxation huh
you know somethin little man
you remind me of me
when i was your age
trying to be somebody
always jiving and hustling
i aint hustling
im just trying to grow up fast
in a fast town
and me i aint nothin but
an old football player duke
maybe drink too
much every now and then
but if you open that club
it sure would make me feel like
i was somebody
