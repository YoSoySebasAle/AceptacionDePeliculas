there was nothing left
no reason no conscience
no understanding even the most
rudimentary sense of life and death
of good or evil right or wrong
i met this six-year-old child
with this blank pale
emotionless face and
the blackest eyes
the devil eyes
i spent eight years trying to reach him
and then another seven
trying to keep him locked up
because i realized that what was
living behind that boy eyes
was purely and simply
evil

desperate measures

studies have proven that
all teenagers at some point
in their adolescent lives have shoplifted
what studies
hey we could have
avoided this whole thing
if you woulda simply scored
some of your mom booze
look my mom a functioning alcoholic
she accounts for every
john
john what are you doing here
just gettin some off-campus lunch
youre not allowed to have
little off-campus lunches john

mom im really uncomfortable
with you saying that word

in the position john
do you know what day it is
of all the days for
you to pull this shit
what do you think you can do
just wander around town
i dont ask you for very much
just give me one day
mom ive given you 7 years
and i need you
to be responsible
do you know what that means
responsible dont talk to me
about responsible mom
i just need this one thing
mom i am not responsible for you
that it that enough
i cant take it mom
he dead
michael myers is dead
what do you want me to say
that it over
that we should try to get on with
some attempt at a happy existence mom
because all the shit that going on
in your head is leakin out on me
and i cant take it anymore
you told me yourself
you watched him burn
i didnt e-exactly stay to see his ashes john
mom 20 years
twenty years
dont you think he would
have shown up by now
what he waitin for huh
okay mom i cant live
like this im sorry
wha
what does that mean john
if you want to stay handcuffed
to your dead brother that fine
but youre not draggin me along
not anymore
yes
bring us a dream
give him a pair of eyes with a
ronny
mom let me
where the hell is he
ronny
hey ronny
where the hell were you
norma told me to walk the perimeter
and where were you
when these two got out
eyes up ronny
psycho
janice
dont send down any more all right
i gotta go to class
janice
oh uh
shh the best part
oh
do i get points or what
huh
you score yeah yeah
hmm well it just
occurred to me today
that ive never
celebrated halloween before
and why is that
oh weve got a psychotic
serial killer in the family who
loves to butcher people
on halloween and
i just thought it
in bad taste to
celebrate
so why now
mm because there comes a point in your
life where you have to concentrate
on what right about it
really
and you
are a sterling example
of what right
and tonight you get
my full concentration
im honored
very good point aj
so what could victor have done
to save elizabeth
anybody at all
come on people
did anybody read the book
guys
it frahnk-en-steen
you could have watched the movie
molly please
do you have any thoughts
on victor and elizabeth
well uh
um
well i think that victor should have
confronted the monster sooner
i mea he completely responsible
for elizabeth death
he was he was so paralyzed by fear
that he never did anything
it-it took death
for the guy to get a clue
and why do you think he was
finally able to confront his monster
i think that victor had reached
a point in his life where he
had nothing left to lose
i mean the monster saw to that
by killing off everybody that he loved
victor finally had to face it
it was about redemption
it was his fate
okay everybody um
have a good time
john
what
it a permission slip
bus leaves in 45 minutes
go pack quick
ma i dont have to go
go just go have fun
