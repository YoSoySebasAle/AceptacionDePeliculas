miss adams
morning miss pinkerton
adams to you
did you get out
on the wrong side of the bed
i havent been anywhere
near a bed
im a mattress loving maiden
i dont belong here
neither do i i oughta be in a
hospital examining my head
why are you so candid
look at this will you
i dont see anything
unless for that white spot
is that a defect
in the film
defect dont let the
photographer hear you say that
that the answer to this case
if only had sense to know it
that the corner
of a newspaper
there was a newspaper
by the body
what that
got to do
it got everything
to do
wynn took out a $00000
life insurance
before he shot himself
glenn miss mitchell
attorney just told me
00000 then he killed
himself to leave that to the--
that what he did alright
the mitchell family were broke
down to the last cent
he spent all the money
shot his health to pieces
well he was through
i guess
but was he smart
wait watch this
now im gonna kill
myself see
only insurance companies dont
pay off quickly on suicide
it got to look
like a murder or an accident
alright now here
what i do
first i take some oil and rags
like he did
the kinda stuff
used to clean a gun
then i take the paper
like this
kneel down take my gun
shoot a hole through the paper
once i fall
the paper falls into place
when you pick it up
it alright
what about the powder burn
inside instead of on me
smart huh
it been done lots of times
i must have overlooked
in the meantime somebody got
in here and took that newspaper
that what they were hiding
did you see it
the lady got out and i caught
her when she sneaked back
her feet were
black with dirt
she hid something
under her pillow
morning mary went
to the library to hide it
it might have been
the newspaper
probably thrown out by now
where do they keep
the newspapers here
there an incinerator
in the backyard
hugo burns them i guess
you wait until dark
and take a look
keep your eyes open
ill get down to headquarters
maybe some cop picked it up
and took it there
gee i hope so
ah just my luck
this is the first case theyve
assigned to me all by myself
and here i go and bungle
it right off the bat
probably be walking
the beat next time

a detective on the case
well this paper
doesnt mean anything
he broke in here that night and
used the keys to open the door
did the same thing tonight
walked like a ghost i suppose
he did not walk through
that door like a ghost
he knew the combination of that
secret door all the time
let me see that paper again
well it ten days old
well dont the powder burns
prove something
no not necessarily
he couldve arranged that
ten days ago
brought it to make it
look like a suicide
you are pulling rabbits
out of a hat

man will have to give me
mighty good reasons
for having those keys
you know all juries

to prevent a great injustice
being done
i make it of my own
free will
and in full possession
of my faculties

miss mitchell
hello arthur
good morning
a long statement
why she hasnt the strength
miss adams
oh doctor
well exhaustion naturally
some uh amyl nitrate
hypodermic
hmm
juliet moaning
miss adams
miss adams
yes doctor
what was in that hypodermic
she dead
get me that hypodermic
but doctor it was
the regular injection
get me that hypodermic
do you hear me
ive washed it out doctor
youve washed it alright
used alcohol too
you didnt waste time
im not trained to waste time
where are the tablets
in my room
it arsenic
and five grain tablets too
one would have been enough
oh but thisthis
says amyl nitrate
then arsenic was substituted
that a very clever deduction
do i have to tell you
what this means to you
it either a case
of negligence--
doctor you dont think
i did it intentionally
you couldnt
you couldnt
nevertheless this calls
for a investigation
having some trouble doctor
oh you might call it that
patten miss mitchell is dead
what
she died five minutes ago
no no ill correct
that statement
she was killed
five minutes ago
five grains of arsenic
was substituted
for a regular hypodermic
and i uh im due at hospital
on a surgical case
ill notify the coroner
from there
there is one more thing
i want this nurse held
on charges of gross negligence
or a possible complicity
to homicide
goodbye
goodbye
did you fix that hypodermic
yes for heaven sakes--
no no im not
suspecting you am i
use the brains
you were born with
weve gotta work fast
now somebody got here
and switched those tablets
who was it
who was in this room today
besides yourself and the doctor
florence lenz and paula brent
brent how did she get in
i let her in
she begged me to
wanted to find something
in herbert room
and charlie
life depended on it
and you fell for that
what do you mean
i believe the kid that all
detectives are not
supposed to believe
who said i was a detective
you arent that certain
whyd i let you into this
let me into it
you dragged me into it
ive lost a lot of sleep
and scared myself so much
im in shape for an asylum
never mind
where is brent
up in young wynn
room i suppose
look do me a favor
let me go back to the hospital
go up and hold her
until i get there
i must examine miss mitchell
room before anything is touched
now step on it
pinkerton
did you find it
no i didnt
what this
dont take it you mustnt--
ill take a look at that
patten
married
secretly married to herbert wynn
and in love with young elliott
well this is news
i want to thank you miss brent
for establishing the motive
now i understand why elliott
felt that wynn had to be killed
you are wrong
i hardly think so
im holding you under arrest
for investigation
why you cant
my people wouldnt--
take her to headquarters
but why i havent
committed any crime
im holding you
for investigation
in the murder
of miss mitchell
is miss mitchell dead
yes she was murdered
a few minutes ago
you see
that finishes the case
i think i can link
both murders by night time
it a cinch
there is a connection
i think young elliott
is the missing link
now listen young fella
you are badly mistaken
those kids havent
done a thing wrong
when i get a hunch
it usually good
they are innocent i tell ya
oh youve got yourself all
worked up over this thing
your nerves are all shot
what you need is a good rest
what i need
is a good shoulder to cry on
say you married
no are you
uh-huh
clearing throat
inspector they want
to see you downstairs
well now

patten
i suppose you know
why we brought you here
to reenact my hideous
cold blooded crime
for the edification
of you numbskulls i suppose
oh youll have plenty of time
to wisecrack in the cooler
you might as well begin
at the beginning
tell us why you came here
was it a friendly call
i told you there
nothing friendly
i came to see wynn and tell him
not to bother my girl
you mean quit bothering
his own wife
i didnt know about that
just what did you know
wynn had infatuated her
i guess he was a smooth worker
i knew she was in some
kind of mess
i didnt ask for particulars
so i came to wynn
i was gonna have a showdown
and kill him if necessary
no sock him maybe
i never hated anybody
bad enough to kill em
go on
i took the keys from her
she didnt want me to have em
we had a tussle over--
get the keys to talk to wynn
juliet couldve rung the door
ive explained all that
wynn knew i didnt like him
he wouldnt talk
if i hadnt surprised him
oh i see what did you do
when you got inside
i came upstairs
i saw light
in wynn room and then
and then what
i came into the room
i saw him
he was on the floor
he was dead
i didnt kill him
he was dead when i got in
patten
did you call the police
did you try and assist--
you know what i did
i heard somebody
coming up the stairs
i knew itd look bad
so i got out
out the window
howd you get down
as far as youre
concerned i flew down
i got him down
and brought him here
i was afraid
of what hed do
he whistled from the roof
so i dragged the ladder
over here and got him down
that a mighty
nice story elliott
what with your looks
and your manner
youll get
courtroom sympathy
but that isnt
all you going to get
there just one thing
you left out
let take a look
at this dummy
this was how wynn
looked when you saw him
no
well how did he look
arrange the body to look exactly
as it was when you saw it
nice work looks like
a real suicide alright
did you as neat a job
when you fixed the real corpse
the real corpse--
let quit stalling
your story would
be swell if somebody
hadnt seen you
move the body
got the statement then
here it is
statement was dictated by
miss mitchell on her deathbed
ill read it to you
uh youll hear it
in court anyway
ill tell you what
she said and save time
she saw you
move the body elliot
that was her
dying testament
that a lie i dont know
anything about it
she didnt see you shoot him
but she saw you move the body
i never touched the body
he was dead when i got here
why make it look
like a suicide
i didnt if she
said that she lying
she saw you alright
and you got away fast enough
but you wont
get away this time
not through that window or by
someone bringing you a ladder

it has nothing to do with me
only this
next to go was miss mitchell
cause she got the money
and name the killer

going to make the identification

the prisoner as the man

sleeping powders not arsenic

manufacture the powder burn
newspaper stunt for an alibi

found it and hid it
so shed get
the insurance money
she didnt know
it was a murder
youre all crazy
oh but youre not
you tried killing hugo
so that he wouldnt talk
then the statement
we witnessed was a fake
yes we signed a blank
piece of paper folded over
mr glenn wrote
the fake statement later
he thought
it would convict elliot
and stop further
investigation
that all boys
take him downtown
she goes with him
dont you worry
hell help you i know he will
thanks
