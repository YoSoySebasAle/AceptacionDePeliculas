
once upon a time
there was a king named william
who ruled a large and mighty kingdom
and yet he was sad
for he was growing old and had
no child to inherit the throne
then happily a daughter was born
a princess
and she was given the name odette
kings and queens came from all around
to offer their gifts to the child
among them was the widow uberta
and her young son prince derek
it was then that william and
uberta happened upon the same idea
derek and odette would be brought together each
summer in hopes that they would fall in love
and join their kingdoms forever
but unknown to all was another plan
that of the evil enchanter rothbart
odette birth was of
little concern to him
for he was preparing to
take william kingdom
by means of the forbidden arts
on the eve of his
assault william attacked
and rothbart powers were
plunged into darkness
despite calls for his death
the enchanter was only banished
im not finished with you yet william
someday ill get my power back
and when i do everything you
own everything you love
will be mine
many feared king william too kind
but in time the threat was forgotten
and all hopes turned to
that not-too-distant summer
when derek and odette would meet
here they come oh
dear uberta as lovely as ever
oh a nest heh-heh
and who might this strapping young man be
young prince derek no doubt
welcome to our fair kingdom dear william
and to you young princess
go on derek
dear go on
mother
derek
hello princess odette
im very pleased to meet you
pleased to meet you prince derek
ah ah ah
yuck
i cant believe im stuck with her all summer
ill bet she doesnt wrestle hunt or box
he looks conceited
what a total bummer
if i get lucky ill get chickenpox
so happy you could come
so happy to be here
how id like to run
this is not my idea
this isnt my idea
of fun
the children seem to get along quite nicely
well join our lands if this arrangement clicks
my dear king william
that my point precisely
it such good parenting
and politics
so happy we agree
i think weve got a deal
derek quite a catch
this is my idea
of a match
heh-heh and such fun
good heavens child dont dawdle
we cant keep derek waiting
i havent packed or washed my hair
and father i get seasick
they soon will be arriving
is that respect youre showing
if you make me kiss her hand again
i swear im gonna be sick
one day prince derek will be her intended
heh-heh splendid
weve tried all summer
but we just cant lose her
hey fellas wait up
quick put on some speed
when picking teams
or friends
id never choose her
youd think shed take a hint and learn to read
this really isnt fair
we really couldnt care
boys it all or none
this is not my idea
this isnt my idea
of fun
long before they met
derek and odette
were destined to be wedded
however anyone could see
the only point on which they didnt disagree
was that the very thought of summertime
was dreaded
she tries to talk me into playing dress-up
she always flirting with the castle guards
i think you really sort of like her fess up
id like her better if shed lose at cards
four sevens and a 0
i think ive won again
every time she won
this is my idea of fun
this isnt my idea of fun
we need a royal wedding
id love to be invited
at least wed get a holiday
to rest our plows and axes
someday these two will marry
two lands will be united
and with some luck their marriage
may result in lower taxes
what if odette doesnt go for the merger
urge her
for as long as i remember
weve been told wed someday wed
every june until september
all their pushing and annoying hints
ive got bruises with their fingerprints
i can do much better i am sure
he so immature
i see him smiling and my knees start buckling
i see inside him and my doubts are gone
she started out as such an ugly duckling
and somehow suddenly became a swan
so happy to be here
till now i never knew
it is you ive been dreaming of
this is my idea
this is my idea
what a good idea
such a charming and romantic notion
this is my idea such a good idea
such a powerful and magic potion
this is exactly my idea
of love
this is my idea
this is my idea
this is my idea
of love
arrange the marriage
wait
what youre all i ever wanted
youre beautiful
thank you but what else
what else
is beauty all that matters to you
derek
what else
i uh
what else is there
we tried uberta
no one can say we didnt try
say goodbye odette
goodbye
goodbye
prince derek
mother
derek
goodbye princess
all these years of planning
wasted
what else is there she says
is beauty all that matters
and you say what else is there
it was dumb i know
you should write a book how to offend
women in five syllables or less
heh-heh your turn prince derek
i didnt know what else to say
you lost your queen derek
that twice in one day
think you must see something
other than odette beauty
ha of course i do rogers she like
you know and how about
and then
i mean right
i dont know how to say it
ill prove it to her
ill prove my love checkmate
huh
today the day willie
everything you own
everything you love will be mine
i just dont understand
what else did you want him to say
i need to know that he
loves me for just being me
whoa whoa

we were attacked a great animal
odette

spell make you sad odette
it doesnt even last the whole day
as soon as the moon comes up
and that how it works every night
you have to be on the lake of course
and when the moonlight touches your wings
now look odette this sort of thing
doesnt give me any pleasure
well maybe a teensy bit
but what i really want
is your father kingdom
take it then you have enough power
nah tried that already
once you steal something
you spend your whole life fighting to keep it
but if i marry the only
heir to the throne
well rule your father kingdom together legally
king and queen you know
never
where are you going
as soon as moonlight leaves the lake
youll turn back into a swan
no matter where you are
the musicians are not happy
i know but i have to practice
oh no complaints here
i think it going to be loads of fun
the great animal is never gonna
give her up without a fight
youre not still thinking she alive

and it wouldnt hurt if he was green
for camouflage purposes
precisely small good swimmer green--

and came the farthest distance

just by looking in your eyes
from the very moment i met you
i was thinking of the rest of our lives
just say to me

somehow two hearts have made a friend of time
eternity

because i know it everlasting
and ive never had this feeling before
keep telling me

somehow two hearts have made a friend of time
eternity
ill love you for eternity
caught in a tide
and it brought me to you
under a spell
and now i know that dreams come true
im gonna love you till the end of time
somehow two hearts have made a friend of time
eternity
eternity is on our side
im gonna love you till the end of time
somehow two hearts have made a friend of time
eternity

im gonna love till the end of time
somehow two hearts have made a friend of time
eternity
