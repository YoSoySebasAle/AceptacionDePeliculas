yee-haw
whoo-haw
whoo-haw
hyah hyah
whoo-haw
yee-haw
but it been six weeks
since the surrender sir
how long must our boys remain
in your prison camps
we cant just
turn them loose mr cole
we have to arrange
transportation food--
then arrange it sir
by heaven had the victory
been ours--
when may i see
general good
ill tell him
youre here
excuse me
captain martin
right this way
the general
expecting you
captain martin sir
captain im a busy man
so ill get right
to the point
i have a job here
i think may interest you
this chest
is all that left
of a million-dollar
gold shipment
lost at phantom hill
one of our patrols found it
right about here
20 miles
from phantom hill
and the gold
from that chest
and 9 others like it
is hidden out there
somewhere
how do you know
the gold
never reached
the confederacy
general
we have
general lee word
and he is an honorable
man captain
here take
a look at that
joseph henry barlow
he was one of the rebs
at phantom hill
a few weeks after the raid
he was captured
he knows where the gold is
he finally admitted it
but what more important
he agreed
to lead us to it
why
because we have something
he wants
it all in there
before the war
he was serving
a life term in prison
for murdering
a federal marshal
in texas
i see
and in exchange
for a pardon
he volunteered to join
the reb army
that right
but now the war is over
we could send him
right back
to prison again
but we made
a deal with him
the united states
government will recognize
that reb pardon
if he leads us to the gold
there just one thing you
forgot to mention general
phantom hill is right
in the middle
of the staked plains
and the staked plains
are part of the territory
the government
just gave to the comanches
and under the treaty
the army is forbidden
to set foot in that country
that why this meeting
is unofficial captain
that why youre to forget
this conversation
the minute you leave
this office
and that why provided
you accept this assignment
youll be completely
on your own
and if anything
goes wrong
the united states army
and the federal government
will deny
they ever heard of you
what would i do for men
and supplies
this will buy you
all the equipment
you need
as for men
youll find them waiting
for you at hays city
well do you
want this job
captain martin
you know i do sir
yes i know you do
im very sorry
about your brother
he was a fine officer
we lost a lot of good men
at phantom hill
well at least i hope youll have the
satisfaction of completing his mission
thank you sir
good luck

you could say we met
we didnt take time
to introduce ourselves
that day

im joe barlow
i guess you understand
there was nothing personal
in that roughing up
we gave you
how many men

with you long

only four
that right
where are they
krausman and orourke are

sheriff
hi charlie
sit down
forget it barlow
anybody ever tell you
you got a mean
and suspicious nature
yep
and no sense
of justice either
none at all
it aint like
i stole the gold
it was captured
by the confederacy
legitimate spoils of war
that what it was
only there aint
no more confederacy
so i got just as much right
to that gold as anybody
including the united states
government
it might pay you to
think about that captain
who is it
open up
it sheriff drum
what this
you signed the register
matthew martin
is there a law
against a man
giving his real name
is it
it is
where you from martin
depends on
where i was last
this man
a friend of yours
what difference
does it make
it might make a lot
of difference mister
i might have
to take you in too
for helping
an escaped convict
get your hands up barlow
now wait a minute--
hold it
maybe you dont
remember me reb
i was a guard at the federal
prison in austin texas
when you started serving
a life sentence
for the murder
of a us marshal
so that the burr
under your saddle
well thisll set
your mind at ease sheriff
it a full pardon
from the governor
of the state of texas
given to me in exchange
for volunteering
to serve in the army
of the confederate states
of america
hey
the us government doesnt
recognize any reb pardon
what do you mean--
joe
sheriff there must be some
way of working this out
there nothing to work out
i got a pardon
relax joe
just relax
look sheriff do you have to
make an issue out of this
the war over
why not let bygones be bygones
i still dont like rebs and i dont
want them around my town
well then
you got no problem
joe and i are pulling out first thing
in the morning for santa fe
santa fe
yeah that right
were uh were starting
a freight line there
all right
all right im gonna
do you boys a favor
you be out of hays city
by 700 tomorrow morning
and ill forget
i ever saw you
dont forget
700 in the morning
that was easy
too easy
when you men volunteered
for this mission
you were told your
destination was santa fe
well that not true
were going out
on the staked plains
well i can see youre all
familiar with em
why in the devil are we going
to that land of satan
were going after gold
orourke
$ million in gold
that the united
states government
lost to the rebs
at phantom hill
and mr barlow
gonna lead us to it
captain the staked plains
are 00 miles--
00 miles inside the new indian
treaty lands doctor i know
that why were going
as civilians
if the army was caught
violating the treaty
it could lead to a general
indian uprising
so once we leave here
were on our own
from now on i want you
to forget youre soldiers
if we get picked up
by a military patrol
well be considered
deserters
if were caught
by the indians
it our funeral
is that understood
krausman orourke
i get it
one more thing
youll all wear sidearms
i--
that includes you doctor
like me youll each carry just
two shells in the chamber
since we wont be able to keep
mr barlow under lock and key at all times
he might be tempted
to appropriate somebody gun
if he did he might be able
to kill two of us
but thatd leave him with an
empty gun and three men
six bullets
still against him
i want us on the road
by 700 in the morning
put a little lift
into it now lads
ah you wouldnt have
a wee spot
for the bite of the snake
in there would you doc
all right
let roll
mr martin
i hope you have
a nice trip to santa fe
thanks sheriff
you know martin
a man does a favor
he kind of expects
a favor in return
doesnt that
seem fair to you
depends
well you know the westbound
stages arent running
because of that new treaty
it means changing the routes
setting up new relay stations
be a couple of weeks now before
things get back to normal
so
so ive got a passenger

for that barrel
of water
how much
thatll be about
uh $50

oh well you go ahead
and tell him then
$50
look that the only well
in 00 miles of here
git-up git-up git-up
oh
anybodyd pay $50
for a barrel of water
could only be headed
one place that i know of
like maybe
the staked plains
i wonder
what theyre after
i dont know
but whatever it is
must be mighty inviting
sure does arouse
a fella curiosity
wait a minute
you been here three days
eating and drinking
what about your bill
oh
i got more
than this coming
you didnt mark
the graves
no
i just walked the horses back
and forth trampling the ground flat
hard to tell where
your brother buried
he came
a long way to die
tell me about it adam
didnt you read my report
to general good captain
i read it
then you know
the whole story
i dont know
what the convoy
was doing here
almost 00 miles south
of its original route
the comanches were at war captain
so were the rebs lieutenant
your brother wasnt to blame
for what happened here
i hadnt thought he was
we gonna camp here
tonight
no
weve still got an hour or
so of daylight well move on
yes sir
there your staked plains
out there captain
a misplaced piece of hell
if there ever was one
how much further barlow
well that hard
to tell
we sorta lost track
of things after we left here
what with that wagon full of
gold getting heavier and heavier
and the men and horses dropping
and the sandstorms scouring us raw
where krausman
he was here
a minute ago
captain
krausman what--
still warm
comanche
0 2 ponies
headed south
straight for
the plains
im gonna ride up ahead
take a look around
keep moving for another hour
then make camp
id like to ride
with you captain
ill bet you would
if im not back by morning
break camp and keep moving
youre not to waste any time
looking for me or waiting for me
that an order long
shouldnt somebody
go look for the captain
you volunteering doc
leave him
alone barlow
i was just asking
a question memphis honey
after all the doc here
must be quite a guy
considering all the men
he says he killed
tell us about it doc
barlow
i want to hear about it
howd you kill em doc
it was very simple
mr barlow
i worked in a slaughterhouse
the army called a hospital
and when they brought the
wounded in by the thousands
i chopped off their hands
and feet and arms and legs
and i bandaged them up
with dirty rags
and i stood there and watched
them bleed to death
or die of gangrene or shock
when the war started
i was a surgeon
and when it was over
i was nothing but a butcher
you call me a doctor
but im not a doctor
not anymore or ever again
maybe things aint as bad
as you think they are doc
i mean
if you had some money
and could go someplace
like say california
take a nice long rest
forget about the war
then maybe someday youd feel
like starting all over again
when you come
right down to it
we all got something
ailing us
but you take a million dollars
even split five ways
that mighty powerful
medicine
aint nothing in the world
that wouldnt cure
what about the comanches
theyre out there
all right
i dont know how many
but theyre there
so until we know where they are and what
theyre up to were gonna keep moving
pull up orourke
whoa boys
whoa
whoa
heavy cusses
aint they
that cause theyre airtight
to protect the gold
we dumped em
to lighten the load
didnt do much good
couldnt have been more
than 0 or 5 miles
before the horses give out
and we had to hide the stuff
all right
let make camp
you know
i been thinking about what you
said to the sheriff back in hays city
how youd be back someday
and make him
and the whole town
come crawling to you
to apologize
anybody with
half a million dollars
could make hays city sit up
and bark like a dog
youd like that
wouldnt you
id love it
all you gotta do
is get me a rifle
first chance you get
after we pick up the gold
why not
there it is
there it is boys
hyah hyah
hyah hyah
look at the gold
just look at the gold
unbelievable
all right
let get it loaded
well captain i did
my part of the bargain
now you keep yours
when the job done
barlow
it done
your amnesty will be recognized
when we get to fort hays and not before
how do i know you yanks
wont back down on the deal
and send me back
to austin prison
because you were told
when this gold is returned to
the army youll be a free man
now if youre in a hurry
get to work
gold always was
my favorite color
are you coming
what the matter
afraid ill hide one
in each stocking
well hello again
just bring it
right on down here
you know a fella eyes play
tricks on him out in this country
sees things that aint there like
running water green grass trees
i even seen a herd of buffalo
once that werent there but
i never did see no gold
that gold
is as real as real
drop them gun belts
all of you
do as he says
i wouldnt do that mister
one shotll bring every comanche
within five miles riding down on us
maybe there aint no comanche
within five miles
well then all you gotta do
to find out is pull that trigger
no comanche ever heard
a skinning knife at work
orourke
move the wagon up
let get
that gold loaded
gonna leave them
for the buzzards too
that right doctor
captain
it empty
dont look
at me captain
i get just as thirsty
as anybody else
how much
have we got left
well there only
the one barrel left
and it a third gone
let me see
that map
i dont suppose
youll believe this
but there a water hole
about 50 miles north of here
you sure
of that barlow
im alive aint i
of course im sure
that the way
we went
must mean eagle wells
do you know it
it was on
our original route before
before we decided
to turn south
here eagle wells
there another water hole
30 miles north of that
sabine springs here
sabine springs
all right let get that gold
loaded and move out
adam
what is it captain
barlow down at the picket line
he saddling a horse
let go get him
no im gonna follow him
see what he up to
i want you to keep your eyes
on things while im gone
you didnt have
to come after me
i would have
caught up with you
who buried there
we didnt have time
to carve his name
and without shovels
we couldnt dig too deep
but here lies major armiston
dead by reason of snakebite
what about the others
did the same snake
kill them too
i told you i dont know
what happened to em
a couple of them took off on their
own and i got separated from the rest
i kind of liked the major
he and i got along
real good
and i was curious
if the comanches
had found his grave
theyd as soon scalp
a dead man as a live one
and you came
this far out of the way
just to make sure
yeah
start digging
huh
you heard me dig
with my bare hands
you buried him that way
didnt you
now dig him up
you satisfied
im gonna tell you
just one time barlow
from now on
stay with the wagon
captain
im just played out
both of us im afraid
drink some of this
no
drink damn it
that an order
thanks
help him
into the wagon
ooh ooh easy boy
let go doc
forget the saddle
krausman just take the gear
captain
ill take care of him
well travel afoot
for the next hour
that aint too healthy
captain take a look
they see us
leading our horses
they might get the notion
were too far gone
to put up
much of a fight
yeah and the only
sure way i know
of bringing em buzzing down
around our necks is to make a run for it
so well walk
how far to eagle wells
ought to make it
before sundown
i figure the least theyll do
is try to cut us off
that not their style
of fighting
just waiting
for what
well know
when the time comes
now we know why they werent
in any hurry to cut us off
this hole
been blasted
and not just
recently either
i may be
wrong barlow
but somehow i get the impression
youre not entirely surprised by this
nor much
concerned either
are you accusing me
lieutenant
because if you are
let me remind you again
that i can get just
as thirsty as anybody else
i went through that once
three days of no water
it aint something
i wanna do over
put that thing away krausman
put it away
all right break it up
you heard me break it up
is there any chance
of getting the horses
to sabine springs
theyll pull no more
without water captain
we must be facing it
tis the end
of the line
im thinking
not yet orourke
not yet
just coyotes
ha ha
what are you doing
up here
youre supposed to be
on the north ridge
what good would i be
up there without a rifle
you can yell cant you
now get up there
barlow right
those arent coyotes
no theyre not
but remember this weve
got rifles and a clear field of fire
those comanches will have to
think twice before they do more
than just squat there
barking at each other
yeah and what happens
after they think twice
you were in love with that sheriff
in hays city werent you
that farewell speech
you made
the way you looked at him
and he looked at you
what right
do you have--
tell me about it
you go to hell
tell me
all right captain
yes i loved him
then a young lady
came to town
oh she was a very
respectable young lady
with a very
respectable father
who was the president
of a very respectable bank
and that when
carter drum
decided to clean up hays city
starting with me
now is there anything else
youd like to know
about memphis
whatever-her-name-is

ill be on the downhill
side toward home

like leaving
a tidy camp behind you
that fine
now climb on
you better go with him
come on come on
come on
you can count on
better treatment from me
than a dozen
buck comanches

about what been
going on up here
this ought to
really stir em up
all right let go
come on
hyah
adam i want you to build a fire
a big one

canteens will you
memphis honey
i got a lot
of living owed me
two years of prison
four years of the war
and that stinking
prisoner-of-war camp
ahh
you know honey
i almost forgot
what a woman
voice sounded like
but you sure
fixed that
so i see
hyah git-up
we better get off
and rest that leg captain
were not gonna be able to go
much further without water captain
well make it
weve got to
i gotta tell you
something
i gotta tell you about
your brother captain
why he changed our route
what do you mean
jim was out of his head
he didnt know
what he was doing
hed give one order one minute
and contradict it the next
he shouldnt have
been in command
i should have taken over
then why didnt you
because i was scared
and i didnt have
the guts to admit it
that why i left it on my
report to general good
i was protecting myself
were you
were you protecting
yourself
or were you protecting
a friend
dont waste it
waste it
memphis honey you just dont seem
to understand do you
we got nothing
to worry about
here make
yourself useful
water them nags while
i fill up the canteens
where the other canteen
what canteen
we had three of em this morning
now there only two
where the other one
how should i know
youre lying
all right big man ill tell
you where it is
it about five miles
behind us
now you listen to me
dropping that canteen
was stupid
say martin gets away
from them comanche
say he finds a canteen
say he comes
out of this alive
what then
you looked appetizing
enough to him out here
but back where a gentleman
like him comes from
he wouldnt walk across the street
to spit on you if you was on fire
stop fooling yourself
memphis
youre trash
youre trash
just like me
only difference is
im rich trash
and youre poor trash
but it dont have
to go on being that way
you just say the word
you can have the whole world
right here
memphis honey
all you gotta do is remember
what you are
we lost em captain
the wind must have
covered their tracks
warm some more rocks
the principle
of condensation adam
for the same reason
dew forms at night
cold air striking
a warm surface
warm rocks
against the night air
result moisture
and maybe enough water
to keep us alive
water
tight as a canteen
couldnt take much water from the
first grave but here he really loaded up
farsighted man
mr barlow
first he kills
the officer in charge
then he talks the others
into following him
hide the gold till after the
war then well all be rich
gets the men to fight
amongst themselves
then he fills
the chests at eagle wells
and sabine springs
blasts them dry against
any possible yank pursuit
all the time he was burying
his own private water supply
against the day
hed return
let me see
that map adam
here the first grave
then eagle wells
now this one
and there sabine springs
straight on line
dead north
dead north
and with that wagon barlow gonna
have to take the long way around
i think weve eaten
his dust long enough adam
let beat him
to the next one
hyah hyah
come on you can dig
as good as me
right here
come on
dig they gotta be here
go ahead dig
you can dig clear to china
but you wont find any water
where the others
theyre here
yeah
why dont they
show themselves
krausman
lieutenant
so it come down to you and me
huh captain
youre through barlow
from now on ill always
be one jump ahead of you
grave by grave youll
find nothing but sand
you stay here
all right
you know what to do
be careful
all right captain
you throw rocks
and ill throw lead
matt
well he dug
most of his grave anyway
the lady helped
considerably
