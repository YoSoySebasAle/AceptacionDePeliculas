nietzsche
three different men with three
very different views of the
world

moved i was by what you said
the other day in class

depth
>> thanks curran but i think
ill pass
>> oohim serious
you know marie right
weve got this little study
group going and we both very
much value your input
but i have to say that it
not so much ametaphysical
thing as it were
it really more a hands on
you know
so how about it
would you be interested in a
group learning experience
>> oh come on
it was just a question
>> curran have you ever
stopped to wonder why none of
the little games you play ever
work or do you just figure it
a hygiene problem
>> hey im only responding to
all your dirty little signals
honeysuckle
>> laughs
well re-adjust
you radar romeo
>> okay so maybe i got you all
wrong

a closet nymphomaniac
>> ohah

studying a lot
>> are you going out seeing
people
>> mmhm hmm
>> you know sara when all
your friends went away to
university and you decided to
enroll here i thought well
maybe it was for the best
after all youve been through
it will give you some
continuity and your grades
start to slip and i thought
well it natural
but to just sit at home and
watch the world slip by
>> dad
>> you have got so much
>> a man is running late for
work one day
in his rush he forgets to grab
his umbrella and his raincoat
but he still manages not to get
wet
how
because it never rained
>> ah

prepared against failure
burglary

can come over tomorrow night
and see me and lea

>> yeah
it good to look for answers
sometimes if you look too
hard you lose the ones you
already have
>> im okay
>> professor the curse of
human consciousness is that it
longs to know only that which
is unknowable
for all our philosophizing can
the meaning of life ever truly
be understood
with exams only two weeks away
let us hope for your sakes
that at least some of it can
>> sighs
>> look curran it not going
to happen okay
not here not on a plane not
in a train
>> laughs
i have my secrets too
laughing
>> you ever hear stories on tv
sometimes that dont make any
sense
maybe a train derails for no
reason or an unexplained fire
breaks out somewhere you know
a mystery
a few years ago police found
out about this invitation
that been sent around
some people got it in their
mail or on their computer even
painted on the side of their
house
the invitation was a riddle
>> what do you mean
>> all i know is the answer led
you to an abandoned building
somewhere in the city
if you could work out where it
was then you became part of a
game and the rules were simple
you begin receiving
riddles--anonymous ones
once you solve them all you
had to do was return to the
building and write the answer
on the wall
if you get a certain number of
them right then one day youd
be shown the design
it this idea riddle freaks
are into you know that all
those unexplainable events out
there that no one can make any
sense out of theyre all just
part of one big riddle we dont
understand
well according to the game if
you played long enough one day
you get a chance to see the
answer to that riddle
this was the calling card of
the game
want to tell me where you got
it from
you really dont want to get
involved
>> uh just a friend
it was a joke
>> funny kind of joke
>> yeah funny kind of guy

about it
>> yeah
that woman a few years ago
tried drowning that boy in the
lake--it was all over the news
>> emily gray

about it all she would say was
that it was part of the
design

the subway
it was just like you said vern
written by the tracks this
riddle
i didnt know what it was

the answer led me to the
abandoned building
when i got there the rest of
the game was spray painted on
the floor
they were easy
write your answer to the subway
riddle on the wall of the
building
that was it
then one day maybe after one
riddle--or a hundred--youd

the reason behind everything we
dont understand you would
understand somehow
so i did it
i went back to the subway and
they were there and

and you had no idea who they
were from

>> that one very mixed up
lady
>> something happened to her
vern
straight a through college a
good job a family
she was playing this thing and
she went crazy
>> well let say something
did happen to her
some kind of cult thing maybe
weve got worse things to worry
about here
someone wanted us to find that
body for a reason
>> wellaccording
to her public access file
emily gray was released from an
asylum for the criminally
insane last year
they keep her in a halfway
house just outside toronto now
>> whatever is happening it
aint over
>> police radios
>> on television
in breaking news parts of
toronto university are being
sealed off today as police
investigate a murder
known for the attempted
drowning in 992 of a small
boy emily gray this morning
has confessed to killing a
student from the local
university
>> male reporter why did you
do it emily
>> it all part of the design
>> female reporter police are
refusing all comments until a
psychiatric assessment has been
made
>> still hasnt said anything
>> other than her initial
statementno
and of course her request to
see you
>> we found the body in the
bushes by the library
it had been dragged there from
someplace else
>> officer it been
identified
the victim is who she claims
>> jeff jeremy curran
it was all part of the design
>> in other words her wheel
spinning but the hamster
dead
>> what about her lawyer
>> oh he given clearance for
you to talk to her
he thinks maybe she seen you
on tv before
is making some kind of
connection
>> okay
tom let get a copy of her
character profile
now she phoned it in initially
right
>> mmhm
>> let get a recording of
that too
damned if i know why she
wants to talk to me but i
promise you this she wont ask
twice
>> police radios
>> i know what happening
buddhist monks knew it all
along
what is the sound of one hand
clapping
where does the room go once you
leave it
they believed once you opened
yourself up to enigmas you
began to see the world
differently
you know who the figure on this
card is
well neither did i
so i did some research
>> vern nemesis
>> sara it the closest
translation they found for his
name
he was an indian monk from
around 400 bc
he broke away from his
monastery and studied the way
of enigmas
two years later he was
executed for murder
you want to know how they
caught him
he confessed
>> emily gray
>> nemesis claimed--just
like all the other mysteries of
life--the
murder and his confession could
be understood through the
contemplation of riddles
in the years after his death a
game was developed by his
followers
the players solved riddles and
wrote their answers on the
temple of prayer
when if they were diligent it
was said they would go to write
their answers on the wall only
this time they would find a
riddle waiting there
instead--the final enigma
and if they solved it
>> they would see the design
>> those that saw the design
would then leave more riddles
for others to follow
>> so emily gray tries to drown
the boy after she plays the
game
>> if she had drowned the boy
my guess is she would have
confessed
>> but she failed
so they lock her up
when they finally let her out
she tries again
this time she does kill
someone--your friend
and then confesses
>> just like nemesis
>> sirens wailing
>> vern what are you doing
>> what i should have done from
the start
>> what
you mean the police
first you want to leave them
out of it then when someone
confesses you want to get
involved
>> sara if you hadnt noticed
something not quite right
here
according to your stripper
friend someone tricked curran
into going to that building
it wasnt emily gray
it was a man
someone you know
think about it
the riddle you found in the
subway wasnt random
they had to know who you were
what you were into
they even know about me right
they left the riddle in the
store
whatever going on here it
not just about emily gray
>> we cant go to the cops
>> yeah well watch me
>> vernwhat if it real
what if there something
happening that we cant explain
dont you want to know the
answers
>> you just dont get it do
you
your mother died
im sorry
that messed up
but if youre looking for some
kind of magic potion for your
problems just because you had a
rough ride well guess what
youre not the only one
try watching two of your
friends die in a construction
fire that was you fault
try getting over that in a
hurry
weve withheld evidence of a
murder here
if we dont tell the cops what
happened then our credibility
is gone--and
that all weve got right now
weve got nothing but our word
here
find romeo girl and the word
fear will be here
>> what are you talking about
>> nothing
maybe youre right
maybe we shouldnt go to the
cops
go home
get rid of anything to do with
riddles anything to do with
the game
>> you think we can cover this
up
>> just that part of it
get rid of everything that
connects you to this thing
>> what about you
>> ive got to check something
first
>> hi emily
didnt need to be like this
did it
>> sighs

wheel
