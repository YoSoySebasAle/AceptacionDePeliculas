steward oh no thank you
i never have much of an appetite
shall we sit down

what are you offering
a financial opportunity
let me explain
in this envelope there is a key
ill show you
this key opens the glass dome
to the button unit
voil√†
now if you push the button
two things will happen
first someone somewhere in the world
whom you dont know
will die
second
you will receive a payment
of  million dollars
tax-free
the payment will be delivered to you
by me
in cash
just as you see here
oh and mrs lewis please permit me
to present to you this crisp
00-dollar bill as a gift
in exchange for your kindness
in allowing me into your home
norma youre gonna give me
this 00-dollar bill
even if i say no
that is correct
are you for real
oh i assure you mrs lewis
this offer is quite real
well who do you work for
guarantee of payment
comes with three restrictions im afraid
one i am not permitted
to disclose any information
about the identity of my employers
two you are not permitted
to discuss the details of this with anyone
except your husband of course
three you have 24 hours
you have until 500 tomorrow
to make your decision
at which point
i shall return
and retrieve the button unit
it will be reprogrammed
and the offer will be made
to someone else
it been a pleasure meeting you
mrs lewis
it a new prosthesis for her foot
you got it
but im using
the new ge silastic polymer
theyre developing for the pilot chairs
for the shuttle
wendell nice pal
thank you
hey what happened to her foot
when she was 7
her brother dropped a barbell on her foot
she thinks one of her toes is broken
so she goes to the hospital
the doctor sets her in a chair
turns the x-ray machine on
then goes to check on another
patient down the hall
and he forgets all about norma
leaves the x-ray machine running
oh jesus that
that not good
no
the tissue in four of her toes
was completely destroyed by the radiation
they had to amputate four of her toes
yep then they had to go in
and get skin from her inner thigh
to cover the front of her foot
this is back in 958 so they didnt
have the skin-graft techniques they do now
and she had to sit like this
the same position
full body cast for a month
waiting for it to heal
jesus i hope she sued this idiot
oh yeah her family sued and they won
what was the settlement
ten thousand dollars
if this sucker works
she can start jogging again
wendell
i hope so
that a nice thing youre doing
for norma

dana how do they get the images
from mars back to earth
radio transmissions
they figured out a way to interpret
the data and then print it out on film
how long does it take
to transmit the signal
about two hours the signal travels
58 million miles in about five minutes

look in the mirror youll see
dana dana
man on tv the first picture you saw
which included the footpads
took about five minutes
to take on mars
and then it is transmitted
by a relay radio up to the orbiter
july 20 969
we received a transmission
from the moon telling us
the eagle has landed
today landing like that one
represents the realization of a dream
that has long excited
mankind imagination
and this mission offers the possibility
of a momentous discovery
in the history of mankind
the existence of life
elsewhere in the universe
if the experiments ofvikings  and 2
do not reveal living organisms
they will learn other secrets
of the universe
they will tell us a good many things
about our own planet
opening up new possibilities
for exploration
and should produce knowledge
that will improve the quality of life
right here on earth
our achievements in space represent
not only the height of technological skill
they also reflect the best
in our country
our character
the capacity for creativity and sacrifice
and a willingness
to reach into the unknown

indistinguishable from magic
lightning strikes the earth
00 times per second
a single bolt of lightning
can reach temperatures
approaching 28000 degrees celsius
in a split second
this is five times hotter
than the surface of the sun
is that what happened to you
you were struck by lightning
yes
and now i am in communication
with those who control the lightning
and what lies behind the other two
eternal damnation
right
what the emotion you felt
when you first laid eyes on me norma
i felt
you felt what
i felt
pity
love
you felt love for me
yes
why
because of my disfigurement
because of all of the pain
that it ever caused me in my life
i thought what it would be like
to have all of that pain
magnified and projected
onto my face
and if i refuse
eternal damnation
you have chosen gateway number 2
i saw that pain on your face and i just
i understood it
i felt an overwhelming
feeling of love for you
because i knew that i would never
feel sorry for myself ever again
take my hand norma
walter you dont remember
coming home do you
you came in your car
you walked in the door like a zombie
you didnt say anything
you just went straight up to bed
where did all this water come from
why isnt dad telling us what happened
walter
go down to the basement
and get me more buckets
but i just want
walter
fine
can you tell me what happened
i need a drink
walter
are we still going to the wedding
norma
yeah
there is only so much information
that i can disclose
i understand
in the hours following
the first viking transmission from mars
your colleague arlington steward
was struck by lightning
while standing here on this platform
yes and we havent
heard from him since then
he something else now
norm
what do you mean
teague arlington steward died shortly
after being admitted to the burn unit
at riverside hospital
several hours after his body
was taken to the morgue
and locked in a freezer storage unit
a nurse heard a voice
coming from behind a metal door
it was a man laughing
mr steward had come back from the dead
and he was laughing hysterically
he was then transferred
to a high-security military hospital
soon after we realized he was
demonstrating
some extraordinary capabilities
what do you mean by capabilities
his body healed at a rate
0 times faster than normal
cellular degeneration essentially halted
thunder crashes
man over speaker ladies and
gentlemen mr and mrs edward powell
jazzy music playing
over speakers
hi
you cant drink too much now all right
all right
sir if you dont mind
my asking
why a box
your home is a box
your car is a box on wheels
you drive to work in it
you drive home in it
you sit in your home staring into a box
it erodes your soul
while the box that is your body
inevitably withers then dies
whereupon it is placed in the
ultimate box to slowly decompose
it quite depressing
when you think of it that way
dont think of it that way
think of it as a temporary state of being
what happens
once youve completed your tests
i submit the data to my employers
and then your fate rests in their hands
one cannot say they are not without
a bizarre sense of humor
look at me
i wouldnt know sir
of whom it is that you speak
your employers
remain a mystery to us all
i like mystery
dont you
how do we pass the test
steward isnt it obvious
simply dont press the button
if enough of you dont
the test will conclude
but there will be more tests to come
man
walk directly into the light
do not turn back
under any circumstances
when you walk into the light youre gonna
feel your body submerged in a liquid
try to hold your breath
if you feel a drowning sensation
it will pass
where are you sending them
to prepare for the next test
in massachusetts
you spoke earlier
about the altruism coefficient
if human beings are unable or unwilling
to sacrifice individual desires
for the greater good of your species
you will have no chance for survival
and my employers will be compelled
to expedite your extinction
clear
yes sir
scott walker when joanna
loved me playing over speakers
i was gone norma
i was gone for nearly an hour
what did you see
well what was there in the light
words cant describe it
it a place
neither here nor there
but somewhere in between
it a warm embrace
a place where the sidewalk ends
and despair is no longer
the governor of the human heart
dad what going on
im gonna be sick walter
you can still save yourself
it too late for me
but you can still save yourself
jeffrey carnes

frontal lobe hemorrhage
that his weakness
he hasnt figured out how to get
in their heads without them noticing
the nosebleeds
you see lots of them
yeah
and so there limits
to what it can do it fallible
living inside a 70-year-old man
yeah that why it embedded itself
at langley

military cia fbi nasa
so he can be killed

than you can possibly fathom
please have a seat
where our son
he in a safe place
well get to him in a moment
please sit down
i want you to know
that i have the deepest respect
and admiration for you both
you gave me hope
but i am very sorry
that you pushed the button
im afraid i have to tell you
that two of your son
functional senses have been impaired
he can no longer see
and he can no longer hear
where is he
what have you done with him
i have done nothing with him
i am just a vessel
you are now presented with two options
option one
you can live the rest of your lives
and enjoy the money
that has been given to you
and learn to live with your son
permanent impairment
it is irreversible
he will never hear your voices
or see your faces again
option two
there is one bullet
in the chamber of this gun
you can fire it into your wife heart
killing her
at the exact moment
your spirit leaves your body
your son will be returned to normal
as for the million dollars
it will be placed
into an interest-bearing account
given to your son on his 8th birthday
let me kill myself
arthur has nothing to do with this
im sorry the offer is nonnegotiable
arthur you must fire the gun
norma you must die
or walter will live forever
in darkness and silence
kill me if you like mr lewis
and condemn your son to a life of agony
you will be imprisoned for the murder
of arlington steward a mere employee
and they will simply send another
to replace me
who
who will send another
arthur please dont
arthur who
norma dont
good day to you
mr steward
can i be forgiven
i dont know
i understand you admire the writings
of jean-paul sartre

there are two ways
to enter the final chamber
free or not free
