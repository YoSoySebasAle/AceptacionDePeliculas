
prehistoric worlds
earth a planet seemingly born
to create life to nurture it
to be shaped and colored
by it and to shelter it
and yet of all the organisms
that have ever lived
on earth 985% have gone extinct
because our splendid
sanctuary has been visited
by the apocalypse five times in all
everything we see on earth
today is the end survivor
of at least one or maybe
more mass extinction events
we are the descendants
of those who survived extinction
five times
nearly every living thing was wiped
off the face of the planet
five hells of ice and fire
devastation in the seas
on land and in the air above
after each mass extinction
there always winners survivors
that proliferate to become
the rulers of the earth
after each annihilation the handful
of survivors gave rise to
an explosion of life forms
you have to imagine organisms
that are radically
different to those of today
with some extraordinary forms
from the beautiful
to the bizarre and with an arms race
of predator and prey leading
inevitably to giants
these are the stories
for earth lost worlds
and the fantastic lives and fearsome deaths
of its wondrous creatures
at least 3 /2 billion years ago
life got a toehold on
a still hostile earth
perhaps in a boiling volcanic
pool somewhere on the planet
microbes were born for all we
know alone in the universe
marvelous forms of life would evolve
and colonize every corner of the planet
in a precarious balancing act
an equilibrium so fragile
that a few degrees of change
in the world temperature
could mean disaster
and so it happened
some 450 million years ago
that the first great dying took place
{\an8}at the time during a period known
{\an8}as the ordovician the continents clustered
{\an8}in the southern hemisphere
{\an8}thanks to temperatures just two
degrees warmer than today
{\an8}the icecaps were almost
non-existent and the oceans
{\an8}some 600 meters higher
than their current level
{\an8}it was a very different world to ours
the continents were
barren but in the seas
after billions of years of
simple microscopic life
extraordinary creatures appeared
the oceans played host to
the first earthly paradise
life is boomin
it blowin and goin in the
oceans for sure
so in the ordovician sea
you had animals like trilobites
like little pillbugs
trilobites are moving around
they have eyes
they have legs
they have segmented body parts
and theyre cruisin
around on the seafloor
eating organic matter or
other smaller animals
you also have corals
not the same ones we have today
but different kinds of corals
and there a group of
animals called the crinoids
which we call sea lilies
because they look like plants
but they are in fact animals
they have a place where
they attach to the seafloor
they have a long stem
and it looks like a flower but in fact
it is the body of the animal
in this first eden
at once familiar and
strange the shallows teem
with creatures going about their business
like these fish
some of the first creatures with bones
and these conodonts
which looked like tiny eels
but the conodonts paradise was not
without truly terrifying hunters
like the cephalopods
ancestors to the octopus
these are nasty marine predators
if you are out swimming
with one of those things
it not a pleasant concept
to be eaten by a squid
i mean it reverse calamari right
the calamari eats you
for millions of years life proliferated
in the waters around the continents
but for reasons we still dont understand
the ocean temperatures
dropped by four degrees
causing an abrupt and brutal ice age
{\an8}evaporated seawater that reined down
{\an8}on the land no longer
flowed back to the sea
{\an8}it accumulated as ice
{\an8}as the ice grows the sea level goes down
and so if you live in the
shallow marine ecosystems
and you have a freezing
period which starts
to move the water from
the oceans on to land ice
you decrease the area
where animals can live
and you can get extinctions
after this first cold wave
temperatures started to climb again
the ice melted and sea levels rose
these climate convulsions
pounded the already
weakened creatures that
still clung to life
and the one-two punch of cold and hot put
in motion the first mass
extinction in earth history
by the end of the ordovician
85% of species had been wiped out
but a handful of hardy
survivors made it through
including some of the primitive bony fish
which would navigate a singular pathway
through the tree of life
one for which we should
be eternally grateful
it descendants branched out to give rise
to all the vertebrates
that have ever existed
without it no dinosaur would
ever have walked the earth
no bird would have taken wing
and no mammals or reptiles
would ever have emerged
and there would be no humans
telling the story of life
after this first mass
extinction and the ones to come
life branched out into
billions of different forms
each family each group
each species being part
of a vast spreading tree
there always winners in
the lottery of extinction
and whatever those survivors are
that where the next radiation happens
that where the next
evolutionary burst happens
so if you want a simple way to think
about extinctions on planet earth is
the survivors are the winners
and their descendants are the ones
that populate the next time period
the desolation
of a mass extinction sets the stage
for an evolutionary renaissance
within tens of millions of years
of the ordovician catastrophe
the survivors had given rise to a new
era the devonian
it was a completely new world
full of new prey and new predators
some quite astounding
in the sea we call it the age of fishes
because now the fishes have evolved
and theyre diversifying
and you get some whoppers
and one of the greatest fishes
of all time is this animal
called dunkleosteus
dunkleosteus is the super predator
of the age of fish
right at the top of the food chain
it probably swam in a constant search
for large enough meals
even specimens of its own kind
in the natural history museum in paris
a plaster cast of dunkleosteus
impressive jaw testifies
to the killing power of
this giant of the devonian
this is the well-honed
weapon of a fearsome hunter
paleontologist gael
clement studies placoderms
the large family to which
dunkleosteus belongs
{\an8}this animal part
{\an8}of the group called placoderms which means
{\an8}that they have thick
bony plates under their skin
here we see the jaw
with these sharp points
which are not teeth
because teeth didnt exist yet
it actually the jawbone
which presents this pincer form
so it can crush and chop up
the prey in which it fed
and while dunkleosteus terrorized the seas
the continents were being transformed
the beginning of it on land
theyre little tiny things
and by the end there were forests
the devonian is when you
get a land environment
that starts to look like
something you might recognize
you go from nothing to forests
but trees release water vapor into the air
and may have triggered epic
storms over the continents
torrents swept dead and
decomposing plant matter
into the oceans choking them
oxygen levels plummeted
global cooling and volcanic
turbulence may have
worsened the crisis in the seas as well
for marine life sustenance grew scarce
eventually the food chain collapsed
the devonian extinction strangled 3/4
of the worlds marine life to death
but on land the forests kept thriving
any creature looking
to survive the disaster
at sea would have to seek
greener pastures literally
and that would require
some anatomical innovation
so you have a variety of fish
that actually are
maneuvering their way around
in shallow water
and they have these lobe-like fins
that actually if you look at the fossils
and actually you can start to see the rays
of the fins actually have distinct bones
and it this lineage of fish
that eventually evolves into amphibians
with the seas suffocating
and the lush land beckoning
the menu required updating
pioneering fish like tiktaalik
a descendant of the bony fish that slipped
through the first mass extinction
had already been experimenting with life
where the shallows meet the land
it had gills to breathe in water
but also a primitive lung for breathing air
and four robust fins that
would later become legs
fleeing the choking oceans
tiktaalik and its family
the sarcopterygians crept out of the water
and slithered through the
second great extinction
and the world would never be the same
a new chapter in the history of life began
and again in the race of
life the winners give rise
to new branches of the evolutionary tree
in the new age of the permian
the first modern trees developed
photosynthesis enriched
the air with oxygen
{\an8}at the same time
the continents drifted together
{\an8}to form a supercontinent
pangaea a vast new territory
{\an8}for land-going animals
to explore and exploit
animals unlike anything
the world have ever seen
before evolved to handle
life on terra firma
where conditions like temperature
varied much more wildly
and harshly than in the seas
to protect their offspring
big predators like the gorgonopsians began
to lay the first eggs with hard shells
all the early land animals
walked on four legs
hence the name tetrapods
a body plan that as revolutionary
as any in the story of life
and some were quite flamboyant
what you got are animals
that looked like a big iguana
with a great big sail on its back
it likely that these sails were
for either impressing the other sex
or for moderating heat
you could rotate towards the sun
and your blood is warmed up
by this big warming surface
or you could rotate away from the sun
you can cool it down
these pelycosaurs with their iconic sails
lived alongside dicynodonts
herbivores with a new innovation a beak
designed to excavate the
tough roots on which they fed
these huge animals were probably hunted
by the biggest predators in pangaea
like the titanophoneus or titanic killer
a reptile that could grow
to a length of five meters
in the seas
00 million years after the collapse
of the oceans vibrant
new lifescapes flourished
you wouldve just loved
scuba diving in the permian
and you got all these incredible creatures
that are out swimmin around
there corals
there cephalopods
the fishes have gotten big now
and youve got your first sharks
certainly one of the most amazing
is this animal called helicoprion
it basically had this
whirl of teeth mounted
in its lower jaw
and it would slam into its upper jaw
and it was a slicing mechanism
it swam around in the sea
and it just chopped stuff in half
and then came back and ate it
the massive fossilized teeth
from this buzzsaw shark
suggest it couldve grown
to a length of 2 meters
on land and in the water
the biodiversity of the
permian was simply spectacular
but it was doomed
the most devastating natural catastrophe
the earth has ever seen
so far awaited them
a cataclysm that would
transform this paradise
into hell on earth for millions of years
some 250 million years ago
in what is now siberia
the earth tried to turn itself inside out
these vast cliffs called traps formed
when the planet belched
lava over and over again
for tens of thousands of years
iceland one of the most
volcanically active countries
in the world
is entire built by lava flows
it is an open-air laboratory for geologists
like patrick de wever
and embedded in the rock
he finds the barrels of a
lava flow smoking guns
when there an emission of lava
{\an8}there are holes in the mass of rock
{\an8}and these holes are filled with gases
{\an8}which come out at the
same time as the magma
{\an8}there are different types of gas
there water vapor
there are sulfur oxides and carbon dioxide
we know water vapor is a greenhouse gas
which tends to raise the temperature
as does carbon dioxide
but sulfur oxides have a double effect
on the one hand they cause acid rain
and they also partially block out sunlight
leading to a drop in temperature
and lower light levels
which means a reduction in photosynthesis
and so perhaps fewer plants
and since animals feed on plants
fewer plants mean herbivores start to die
and then in turn
the carnivorous animals die too
the permian-jurassic
extinction was the mother
of all extinctions
basically a lot of our
friends that had been with us
for the entire paleozoic
things like trilobites
the last trilobite goes
lots of these earlier marine organisms
theyve survived through much
of the earlier extinctions
sorry cant make it through
on the other side of the world
in china zhejiang province
researchers sylvie crasquin
and marie-beatrice forel are
in search of one creature
that survived the permian
disaster in the seas
hoping to find the secrets
of how to cheat extinction
here at the dividing line
between the abundant permian
and the disaster-ravaged time just after
the researchers locate
what theyre looking for
tiny crustaceans called ostrocods
ostrocods had an ability to adapt to some
of the most stressed environments
in the history of the planet
in her paris laboratory
sylvie puts her prizes
under the microscope
ostrocods from before the
disaster are pretty large
for miniature marine life
the ones from immediately after are not
{\an8}just after the crisis
{\an8}conditions were extremely harsh
{\an8}you can imagine that ostrocods went
{\an8}into energy-saving mode
meaning they reduced the metabolism
as far as possible to consume less energy
which is why you find smaller ones
which also had smaller eggs
and with reproductions
cycles that are much shorter
than those usually
observed in the paleozoic
after the devastation of the permian
life hit the reset button once again
on land the few tetrapods that survived
descendants of the first
land-going vertebrates
would evolve into reptiles
dinosaurs and mammals
millions of years later
by the start of the triassic
the branches of the tree of
life are once again blossoming
the triassic is a time
of tremendous innovation
because the decks have
been cleared so severely
in the permian-jurassic
so you basically wipe the slate not clean
but pretty clean
the triassic is this really crazy place
where these things now radiate again
into all these different
kinds of shapes and forms
lots of really cool
weird animals in the triassic
in the ocean marine reptiles had emerged
like the ichthyosaurs
which roamed the seas
hunting fish and squid
corals bloomed and built reefs once again
ammonites proliferated
along with sea urchins and starfish
in the skies above
the first flying reptiles
called pterosaurs beat their huge wings
on land great herbivores with
tough leathery armor grazed
in conifer forests
their defensive carapace
hints at the presence
of fearsome predators
like the agile coelophysis
which probably hunted in packs
the two-legged
40-pound coelophysis was one
of the first dinosaurs to grace the earth
it would take tens of millions of years
and another global catastrophe
before giant dinosaurs
completely dominated the world
{\an8}some 200 million years ago
europe and africa tore away
{\an8}from the american continent
forming the atlantic ocean
the earth entered a new
period of volcanic upheaval
it set in motion the fourth mass extinction
in the planet history
wiping out 3/4 of land-dwelling species
and 96% of ocean species
and the great permian
experiment lay in ruins
but once again
life would rise like a phoenix
from the ashes
the dinosaurs survived
the mammals survived
the pterosaurs survived
so on land you have these lineages now
that are off and racing
in the highlands of central south africa
the rocks preserve a
record of this renaissance
and a world dominated by some
of the most massive
animals that ever existed
the mega-dinosaurs
paleontologist jonah choiniere
and his students from
witwatersrand university
in johannesburg are excavating fossils
from the triassic and jurassic periods
that may shed light on this
revolutionary transition
itll come out
while his students extract a fossil
from the triassic jonah goes in search
of sediments from the jurassic
these rocks in this
cliff these are jurassic
so theyre about 200 million years old
{\an8}down below us on the triassic
{\an8}all types of animals
are found in the rocks
{\an8}but as we come up into the jurassic
dinosaurs become much more common
in fact almost everything
we find here is a dinosaur
immediately after the extinction event
dinosaurs are small
but just for a short time
suddenly they explode
into enormous body sizes
and in fact within a few million
years you have things
that are twice the size
of today elephants
in the triassic it anyone game
but as soon as we get into the jurassic
it clear that dinosaurs
are the winners of the day
okay slowly gently
one two three
you guys okay
hey guys
hey just in time
<v ->hi
you flipped it fantastic
okay weve taken bigger ones down before
okay you ready on three two three
most of the fossils collected
in south africa
in the past century are housed
at witwatersrand
university in johannesburg
the wealth of this collection
underlines the sheer variety
of species during the jurassic
the fossils on these shells are the bones
of ladumarahi mafube
a giant dinosaur from south africa
which lived in the jurassic period
about 200 million years ago
and this is the foot bone
of ladumarahi mafube
this is the only known
specimen of ladumarahi
and wed been looking in south africa
for well over 50 years for dinosaurs
the name ledumahadi means
a giant thunderclap
and mafube which is the species
name means dawn
so together it a sesotho term
meaning a giant thunderclap at dawn
we can tell from these bones
that this animal weighed
about 2 tons and that amazing
because it shows that dinosaurs soon
after the end triassic extinction were able
to rebound and attain enormous sizes
we can tell from the bones of ledumahadi
that it mustve walked on all four legs
in fact much like a modern elephant
but with a slightly more
crouched limb posture
this type of dinosaur is a sauropodomorph
and we know that they had long necks
and tiny heads and giant bodies
where they wouldve fermented
the food they swallowed whole
dinosaurs like ledumahadi
wouldve made tremendous advantage
of the openings in the environment
and the ecosystems left vacant
by the end triassic extinction
after life was almost
wiped out in the permian
fascinating new creatures emerged on stage
with the arrival of flowering plants
and pollinating insects
evolution went into overdrive
the development of new species
sparked the genesis of others
herbivores grew larger
and more diversified
along with the carnivores that fed on them
these gigantic suarapods
were the biggest land animals
that have ever lived
some of them as much as 00 feet long
20 feet tall up to 88 tons
these massive incredible animals
during the cretaceous
evolution went to extremes
the jaw of the t-rex exerted so much force
it could crush the bones of its
prey and swallow them whole
the largest flying creatures
the earth has ever seen ruled the skies
pterosaurs whose wing
span could reach 2 meters
and in the oceans
creatures also grew immense
like plesiosaurus a ferocious predator
and then there was the mosasaur
a reptile that grew up to 8 meters
the dinosaurs dominated
the face of the earth
for more than 75 million years
covering two geological periods
the jurassic then the cretaceous
today their only descendants are birds
once again a cataclysm shook the planet
and brought the giants low
{\an8}as the cretaceous drew to its close
{\an8}the world began to
resemble the one we know
{\an8}but india which was not yet
joined to the asian continent
{\an8}underwent a massive volcanic
episode like the one
{\an8}in siberia that ended the permian
the deccan traps bear witness to eruptions
that occurred over several millennia
they date from some 65 million years ago
around the time that the
dinosaurs disappeared
until the 980s
many scientists attributed
the dinosaurs extinction
to this volcanic outburst
then came a theory that was
out of this world literally
that the dinosaur killer
was an extraterrestrial
in 980 this crazy idea was proposed
that an asteroid hit the planet
and caused the extinction
that wiped out the dinosaurs
and we all thought that nuts
that like national enquirer science
little green men come take our dinosaurs
asteroid strikes give me a break
so everybody laughed
thought this is a joke
a joke that scientists would be forced
to take seriously
in the badlands of western canada
paleontologist francois therrien
from the royal tyrrell
museum makes his way down
through millions of years
of fossil-rich sediments
this valley
carved out by the red deer river
has yielded thousands
of dinosaur skeletons
and one layer of sediment
bears the reddish signature
of a dinosaur killer
so we can see here this
salmon-colored rock here
this line marks the end of
the age of the dinosaurs
and the beginning of the age of mammals
for geologists and paleontologists
this line here represents a
record of a catastrophic event
a meteorite impact
that occurred 66 million years ago
at the base of the layer
we have the last pollens
of the last plants that grew
at the end of the cretaceous
followed by iridium
which is an element extremely rare
at the surface of the earth
but extremely abundant in meteorites
this line here marks the
extinction of the dinosaurs
and still at the end of the 20th century
not all researchers accepted the theory
of an extraterrestrial impact
it wouldve left a massive
scar somewhere on earth
so where was the crater
scientists began looking for it
analyzing and dating each
major crater they could find
but none coincided with the
extinction of the dinosaurs
in the end it was two
geologists from an oil company
who discovered it by chance
nestled in mexico yucatan peninsula
half hidden by the waters off the coast
lay a crater more than 00 miles across
it was 66 million years old
and the horrors of the
most famous extinction
of all could no longer be denied
so if you were on planet
earth 6602 million years ago
walking around in a beautiful forest
triceratops is grazing next to you
you were worried you might
run into a tyrannosaurus rex
but you dont see one right now
life is good trees are flowering
suddenly in an instant a blinding light
and youre dead
the asteroid impact was an amazing thing
because unlike all the other extinctions
that preceded it
this one was global and instant
it took a second or two for the asteroid
to pass through the
atmosphere on the way in
the asteroid of course is gone
it vaporized
it now molten rock
shattered target rock
all that stuff blows back out
through the hole in the
atmosphere into low-earth orbit
the earth rotates underneath it
and then all that debris
starts to rain back
into the atmosphere
as it rains back in it heats
up and the sky gets hot
the heat from the sky makes it
to the ground and starts fires
so no matter where you are on earth
within hours
you are feeling some serious hurt
if youre anywhere in north
america forget about it
the initial explosion takes care of you
there smoke
there dust
blocks out the sunlight
if youre a plant
there no photosynthesis
if you were a big animal
if you survive the initial
blast somewhere on earth
there probably nothing to eat
you probably dont make it
through the first winter
a magnitude 3 earthquake
a gigantic tsunami
the raining blocks of rock
that are flown for hundreds of miles
and the oceans have taken
a great insult as well
the chemistry of the oceans have changed
the phytoplankton were
turned off for months
the zooplankton have then crashed
the marine food system is down
in total 3/4 of species vanished forever
all the big dinosaurs
were wiped off the map
but while the titans
died the stage was set
for some tiny survivors
to take over the world
the royal tyrrell museum is home to one
of the world largest
dinosaur collections
including a specimen of
the most terrifying of all
tyrannosaurus rex
but here scientists are also resurrecting
the little animals that
would inherit the earth
craig scott
head of conservation and research
studies the mammals of the paleocene
the time just after the fifth extinction
im essentially a paleo-dentist
because the vast majority
of specimens that i examine are teeth
the fossil record of mammals
is largely a dental record
you do get the occasional jaws
and sometimes you get some
postcranial remains as well
but for mammals of this age and older
the record is primarily dental
well from looking at these teeth
i can tell from the shapes of the cusps
that this animal was probably
eating some resistant foods
maybe really hard insects
or it might have even
been crushing mollusks
so the shells of snails and clams
and i can also tell by looking at the teeth
that they have a very good resemblance
to living relatives of
hedgehogs and shrews
those mammals
that survived the fifth mass
extinction were no larger
than a rat but the fossils
that craig scott is analyzing
illustrates the speed
with which they evolved diversified
and became giants
exploiting the ecological niches
once monopolized by the dinosaurs
so this is the skull of an
animal called a pantodont
and pantodonts were large
almost hippopotamus-like herbivores
that lived during the
paleocene and the eocene
they represent the group of mammals
that achieved the largest body
size during the paleocene
and some of these animals made it up
to the size of a very large cow
so within 5 million
years or 20 million years
after the extinction event
mammals went from animals
that had an average body size
of maybe a small rabbit up
to something that similar
to living hippopotamuses
so that quite a leap
and a mere 0 million
or so years after that
mammals got even larger
and they achieved body sizes equivalent
to living elephants and rhinoceroses
the great extinction
events were revolutions
in the story of life because the thread
of life never completely
snapped and five times
cataclysms opened up new
worlds to the survivors
after each new branches on
the tree of life would bloom
and fill the void left by the dead
and across the earth
that little shrew-like animal
multiplied transformed
and became all the fantastic
mammals we know today
some even returned to the seas
they evolved into unique forms and adapted
to every climate every environment
side-by-side with other survivors
they created a world
as colorful and diverse
as any that had gone before
this is the sixth earthly
paradise and it is uniquely ours
because one among this mammalian multitude
a species of primate rose up
on its hind legs to dominate
and remake the earth like
no other species before it
some lineages were important in times past
and disappeared
because they didnt survive extinctions
but what we have today
is this composite world
humans and trees and whales
and fish and birds and primates
you can go back
in their individual lineages
and find out when their lucky moment was
when did their ancestors
survive key extinctions
when was their point
when their ancestors
radiated and diversified
and were all survivors
at this point in time
human beings now study the forces
of nature that propelled them to dominance
a restless earth with a
volatile and vulnerable climate
an equilibrium we know
to be alarmingly fragile
supporting a complex web of life
all on a home where death could come
from the skies in an instant
but the next mass extinction
may already be upon us
and for the first time
it may be more akin to mass suicide
previous crises have
all had a natural cause
they were either caused
by volcanic eruptions
meteorite impacts or a climate change
the difference with this crisis is
it 00% caused by humans
as such it happening
at a much faster rate
and it far less predictable
right around every extinction weve seen
one or a couple of species
surges in dominance
and that what were seeing today
with humanity taking off at the expense
of other animals on the planet
the timescale that were talking about now
for the current crisis is
incredibly incredibly fast
much much faster than anything
that weve experienced before
mankind is destroying its own planet
at a phenomenal rate
even at our human scale
we can see species becoming extinct
whatever happens
life will regenerate on earth
and itll only take a few million years
but what the actors
will be in that new play
that plays out over the
future of life on this planet
it anyone guess
on the unimaginable timescale
of our planet evolution
we now know that history repeats itself
and the lesson of that history is clear
when catastrophe strikes
molten frozen or hell from the heavens
the creatures that dominate
will likely vanish
but the earth itself will not
and life will always find a way
